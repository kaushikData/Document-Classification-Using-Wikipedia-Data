'''''A Woman Like Me''''' is a 2014 [[Documentary film|documentary]] that runs parallel to the real life story of Alex Sichel who has been diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]] in 2011. The fictional story of Anna Seashell played by Lili Taylor, is of a woman who is able to find the glass half full when she is given the same diagnosis. The documentary follows Alex as she uses narrative film to show her journey through terminal illness as it surrounds her and her families life.

== Plot ==
A Woman Like Me is a documentary about co-director Alex Sichel's navigation through having terminal breast cancer and how it has inspired her to try and embrace death as mentioned in [[Buddhist philosophy]]. The film is composed of [[home video]]s, one on one sit downs with Alex's family; husband, parents, sisters, doctors, and healers. Although a documentary, half of the movie shows Alex's current film project about Anna, a woman with the same diagnosis as Alex except she looks at the glass as half full. The film within the film recounts private conversations between Alex and her husband, Alex's dreams, and the alter-self, Anna, who is moving forward to face her fear of death. Sichel believes that making a movie about herself living with breast cancer can help her heal and accept what is happening to her.

The documentary side of the film shows Alex's doctor visits, the types of medications she's on, and the alternative medicine healing practices she does with healers and shamans. Alex's family, although glad Alex is taking medicine from the "real" doctors, believe healers and the Buddhist philosophy of "going joyfully towards death" are not helpful and is just "magical thinking". Alex later learns that the tumor has grown larger so, she takes the opportunity to go to Greece and learn more about her family's history. The last scene of the film shows that Alex has lived another winter and is once again at the Buddhist silent retreat that she attends yearly. She mentions how her daughter's birthday is coming up so she needs to look forward with positive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-woman-like-me-film-806929|title=A Woman Like Me|last=Scheck|first=Frank|date=7 July 2015|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/movies/review-a-woman-like-me-about-grappling-with-terminal-illness.html|title=Review: "A Woman Like Me,'|last=Catsoulis|first=Jeannette|date=8 October 2015|website=The New York Times|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'''Anakim''' ({{Lang-he-n|עֲנָקִים}} ''‘Ǎnāqîm '') were described as a race of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], descended from [[Anak]],&lt;ref name="eastons-bible-dictionary"&gt;[http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/anakim.html eastons-bible-dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Tanakh]]. They were said to have lived in the southern part of the land of [[Canaan]], near [[Hebron]] (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13). According to {{bibleref2|Genesis|14:5-6}} they inhabited the region later known as [[Edom]] and [[Moab]] in the days of [[Abraham]]. Their name may come from a Hebrew root meaning "necklace" or "neck-chain".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Anakim" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their formidable appearance, as described by [[the Twelve Spies]] sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. The Israelites seem to have identified them with the [[Nephilim]], the giants ({{bibleref2|Genesis|6:4}}, {{bibleref2|Numbers|13:33}}) of the [[antediluvian]] age. [[Joshua]] finally expelled them from the land, except for some that found a refuge in the Philistine cities of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Gath (city)|Gath]], and [[Ashdod]] ({{bibleref2|Joshua|11:22}}), thus the Philistine giants ([[Goliath]]) whom [[David]] encountered (2 Samuel 21:15-22 ) were descendants of the Anakim.&lt;ref name="eastons-bible-dictionary"/&gt;

'''''Anonymus Leobiensis''''' (Anonymous of Leoben) or '''''Chronicon Leobiense''''' (Chronicle of Leoben) is the conventional name for a [[Middle Latin|Latin]] chronicle written in or shortly after 1345. It covers the years from the [[incarnation of Christ]] down to 1345 with an emphasis on the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Papacy]]. The author was certainly a cleric and a native of [[Leoben]] in the [[Duchy of Styria]] (today in Austria). He has been tentatively identified with Conrad of Leoben, a lecturer at the [[Dominican Church, Vienna|Dominican church in Vienna]].&lt;ref name=Ubl&gt;Karl Ubl, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2213-2139_emc_SIM_00206 "Anonymus Leobiensis"], in Graeme Dunphy, Cristian Bratu (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'' (Brill, 2016). Consulted online on 21 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sources for the ''Anonymus Leobiensis'' are the ''Liber certarum historiarum'' of [[John of Viktring]] and the ''Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum'' of [[Martin of Opava]]. A copy of the former was kept at the court of the [[Duke of Austria]] in Vienna, while a copy of Martin of Opava's chronicle was expanded in Leoben around 1300, relying on local and Viennese annals and the works of [[Alexander of Roes]].&lt;ref name=Ubl/&gt; It also borrowed from the ''[[Anonymi Chronicon Austriacum]]'' of around 1327, which is the original source for the account of the [[Mongol invasion of the Latin Empire]] in 1242.&lt;ref&gt;István Vásáry, ''Cumans and Tatars: Oriental Military in the Pre-Ottoman Balkans, 1185–1365'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, he returned to [[Toronto]] to compete for [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]].

'''''British Hit Singles &amp; Albums''''' (originally known as '''''The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'''''  and '''''The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums''''') was a music [[reference work|reference book]] originally published in the United Kingdom by the publishing arm of the [[Guinness]] breweries, Guinness Superlatives. Later editions were published by Guinness World Records and [[HiT Entertainment]]. It listed all the singles and albums featured in the Top 75 pop charts in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In 2004 the book became an amalgamation of two earlier Guinness publications, originally known as '''''British Hit Singles''''' and '''''British Hit Albums'''''. The publication of this amalgamation ceased in 2008. A new version of the book published by [[Virgin Books|Virgin]] and entitled ''[[The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles]]'', first published in November 2008.

The first ten editions were compiled by [[Paul Gambaccini]], [[Mike Read]] and brothers [[Tim Rice]] and [[Jonathan Rice|Jonathan "Jo" Rice]]. Read left the team in the mid-1980s and the other editors resigned in 1996. Chart editor for many editions was David Roberts.

==Content==
''British Hit Singles &amp; Albums'' was generally considered to be the authoritative reference (and only) source for both the [[UK Singles Chart]] (since its inception in 1952) and the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It listed all the singles and albums ever to have been in the UK charts since 1952 (albums since 1958), listing them in alphabetical order and by both artist and song title. The entries also included the date of chart entry, highest position, catalogue number and number of weeks in the chart. Short biographical notes accompanied many of the artists' chart details.

The book's sources are the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' (NME) chart from November 1952 to March 1960, and the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' (later ''[[Music Week]]'') chart thereafter. It could be said that this division is misleading, since the ''Record Retailer'' chart was little known until it was adopted by the [[BBC]] in 1969 and that by adopting this chart as its standard, the editors had a non-consensual view. An example often given is the case of [[The Beatles]]' second single "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]" which was recognised as a number one hit by every other publicly available chart of the time, but not by ''Record Retailer'' and therefore not by ''British Hit Singles''. Other records to which this applies include "[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]], "[[Stranger on the Shore]]" by [[Acker Bilk]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry "[[Are You Sure? (The Allisons song)|Are You Sure?]]" by [[Allisons|The Allisons]].

Co-founder Jo Rice has defended the book's choice of source material on the grounds that ''Record Retailer'' was the only chart to consistently publish a Top 50 from 1960 onwards. This can be substantiated by the fact that charts published in the ''NME'' were of a shorter format and other chart listings such as those in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', became less and less informative although they were probably more accurate. Subsequent research has shown that during the "disputed" period of the 1960s, the samples sizes of the ''Record Retailer'' chart were considerably inferior to those of the other charts: around 30 shops in 1963 in comparison to more than 100 used by ''Melody Maker'', and later around 80 in comparison to ''NME''{{'}}s 150 and ''Melody Maker''{{'}}s 200. As a result, the placings in that chart were more open to error and manipulation – a situation further worsened by the larger number of records listed in the chart.

==History==

===1977–1996 original editors===
[[File:Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles 7th Edition 1988 book cover.png|thumb|right|200px|The cover of the 1989 7th edition of the ''Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'']]
The first edition was published as ''The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'' in July 1977. It wasn't the first Guinness music reference publication, as the previous year a book called ''The Guinness Book of Music Facts &amp; Feats'' had been published. It also contained feats from the world of [[classical music]].

The first edition was issued to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the first UK singles sales chart, which was published in November 1952, by the ''[[New Musical Express]]''. Subsequently, a new edition was published every two years, adding a few hundred titles to each edition.

Keeping in line with the book's parent publication ''The Guinness Book of Records'', each edition of ''British Hit Singles'' also contained a 'facts and feats' section, which included various lists of remarkable chart feats such as 'Most hits', 'Most no. 1 hits', 'Most weeks on chart' or 'Least successful chart artist'. Also included in the books were [[photographs]] (often with captions) and introductions written by the four authors. They also wrote a bi-annual lookback on the major developments in the UK charts in the two preceding years.

The series was soon regarded as the number one source for music and chart reference, thanks to the commercial success of the books and its various sister publications (see below).

The series' 10th edition, published in June 1995, was the last to feature its original authors Rice, Rice and Gambaccini. From the 11th edition onwards, the book was compiled by in-house editors at Guinness Publishing and, later, by David Roberts who had already been a chart editor and designer for the original team.

===1997–2006===
From the 12th edition onwards (published in 1999), the book was published every year rather than bi-annually. In 2004, the book merged with ''The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums'' to form ''The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums''. The eighteenth edition of the book (2005) was billed as a "Special Collector's Edition" as it featured detailed information on the 1,000 Number Ones in the [[UK Singles Chart]] from [[Al Martino]]'s "[[Here in My Heart]]" on 14 November 1952 to [[Elvis Presley]]'s "One Night / I Got Stung" (Limited Edition Collector's re-issue), 22 January 2005.
The 19th edition (2006) was the last in the series. A supposed 20th edition was due to be published in 2007, but apparently the original publishers lost interest in chart reference books after their contract with [[The Official Charts Company]] expired, which saw that organisation sell the contract to Virgin.

Following the success of the ''Guinness Book of British Hit Singles'' series, the original authors and Guinness quickly turned to other charts-related books and projects. The following books were written by them:

The last publication was in 2018 and they have closed operations in China since then. The website isn't maintained anymore.

''City Weekend'' was one of the highest-circulation English magazines in China available free&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/25/TR84197.DTL How Shanghai Got Its Groove Back / China's formerly decadent window on the West is now its go-go gateway to the future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Map Magazine, and ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]''.

The magazine distinguished itself by being one of the first private English language publications in China - it had been distributed since 1999 in Beijing, and 2000 in Shanghai; up until 2018.

The magazine itself acted as a source of information for many in the expat community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cctv.com/program/RediscoveringChina/20030818/101874.shtml CCTV-English Channel-Rediscovering China&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Staff relied on its reader-powered website to access local communities and generated everything from national articles to factual news about local events, venues, and classified ads in China's two largest cities — Beijing and Shanghai (and for a brief period Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Suzhou).

''City Weekend'' also published a variety of free guides yearly including a Bar and Restaurant Guide and the Service Directory (a small English business and service phone book). The magazine also produced supplements focusing on expat families (Parents &amp; Kids, as well as Shanghai Family), and the real-estate market (Home &amp; Office).

''City Weekend'' was published by the Swiss multinational publisher [[Ringier]], and its circulation was audited by [[BPA Worldwide]].

In 2010, ''City Weekend'' launched an English-language [[group buying]] platform called [[FlashBuy]], the first one of its kind targeting English speakers in both [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]].

==History==
''City Weekend'' was an entertainment and lifestyle guide in China. Founded in 1999, the magazine created content related to dining, nightlife, arts, culture, health and wellness, fashion and shopping, local community news, and travel in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringier.com/en/portfolio/publishing/magazines/city-weekend City Weekend | ringier.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''City Weekend Beijing'' was sold to another company. Ringier continued to operate City Weekend nationally in China everywhere except Beijing until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whiteconfucius.com/media-criticism/the-end-of-city-weekend-beijing/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, after a failed acquisition ''City Weekend'' left China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/post/22272/future-of-city-weekend-in-doubt-after-takeover-deal-falls-through/ City Weekend failed deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}; {{issn|1482-471X}}; {{oclc|773250104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey attempts to measure the degree of [[economic freedom]] in the world's nations. It has been used in peer-reviewed studies some of which have found a range of beneficial effects of more economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |title=Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKMGqbq3?url=http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |archivedate=2011-03-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest measures of economic freedom was developed by [[Freedom House]], which has done extensive work on the measurement of political and cultural freedom. This measure incorporated a range of indicators including freedom to establish a business and freedom of union organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-fidel2006-08-03-voa38/399709.html |title=Cuba After Fidel – What Next? |date=October 31, 2009 |publisher=Voice of America |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPxIft8t?url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-fidel2006-08-03-voa38/399709.html |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly in response to dissatisfaction with the Freedom House index from advocates of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] or [[market liberal]] viewpoint, [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Michael Walker (economist)|Michael Walker]] of the [[Fraser Institute]] hosted a series of conferences on  economic freedom. Eventually this resulted in a report on worldwide economic freedom, ''Economic Freedom of the World''. Later the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Wall Street Journal]] created another similar index, the ''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moroccan Liberalization Making Progress|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/world-economy/63362/moroccan-liberalization-making-progress|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=Financial Tribune Daily|date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The participants in the conferences reached a consensus that the cornerstones of economic freedom are: personal choice rather than [[collective]] choice, voluntary exchange coordinated by markets rather than allocation via the political process, freedom to enter and compete in markets, protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.&lt;ref name="Dolan 2017" /&gt; The 2005 report states "When the functions of the minimal state—protection of people and their property from the actions of aggressors, enforcement of contracts, and provision of the limited set of public goods like roads, flood control projects, and money of stable value—are performed well, but the government does little else, a country’s rating on the EFW summary index will be high. Correspondingly, as government expenditures increase and regulations expand, a country’s rating will decline."&lt;ref name="Dolan 2017" /&gt; In practice, the index measures: size of government (expenditures, taxes, and enterprises, legal structure), security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labor, and business.&lt;ref name="Dolan 2017" /&gt; The report uses 42 distinct variables, from for example the [[World Bank]], to measure this. Some examples: tax rates, degree of juridical independence, inflation rates, costs of importing, and regulated prices. Each of the 5 areas above is given equal weight in the final score.&lt;ref name="Dolan 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Ed|title=Quality of Government, Not Size, Is the Key to Freedom and Prosperity|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/quality-government-not-size-key-freedom-prosperity/|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=Niskanen Center|date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[Image:Economic Freedom Charts.png|right|thumb|375px|Charts showing economic freedom, as defined in ''Economic Freedom of the World'', and various other indicators. The red bars shows nations with less economic freedom, the green bars those with more.]]

Economic freedom has been shown to correlate strongly with higher average income per person, higher income of the poorest 10%, higher [[life expectancy]], higher [[literacy]], lower [[infant mortality]], higher access to water sources and less corruption. The share of income in percent going to the poorest 10% is the same for both more and less economically free countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2004 Annual Report |date=2004 |url=http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316215702/http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people living in the top one-fifth of the most free countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s. The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $728 in the least free countries compared with over $7,000 in the most free countries. The life expectancy of people living in the most free nations is 20 years longer than for people in the least free countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Economic Freedom Needed To Alleviate Poverty |first1=Robert A. |last1=Lawson |date=July 1, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006223304/http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/318 |url=http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/318 |archivedate=October 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher economic freedom, as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices, correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?] The Cato institute. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and is significant in preventing wars. Economic freedom is around 54 times more effective than [[democracy]] (as measured by ''Democracy Score'') in diminishing violent conﬂict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf Chapter2: Economic Freedom and Peace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}, Economic Freedom of the World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding environmental health, studies have found no or a positive effect. More important may be the [[Kuznets curve]]. Most environmental health indicators, such as [[Water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] show an inverted U-shape. Meaning in the beginning of economic development, little weight is given to environmental concerns, raising pollution along with industrialization. After a threshold, when basic physical needs are met and a middle class is established, interest in a clean environment rises, reversing the trend.&lt;ref name="Berggren "&gt;{{cite book |first1=Niclas |last1=Berggren |publisher=The Ratio Institute |title=The Benefits of Economic Freedom: A Survey  |url=http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604231447/http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |dead-url=yes |ssrn=888503 |archivedate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that more economic freedom is the cause of beneficial effects and that ''Economic Freedom of the World'' was used for most of the research, partly because ''Index of Economic Freedom'' only goes back to 1995 and because it uses more subjective variables.&lt;ref name="Berggren " /&gt;

==Influence==
Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have used the index and it has been used in economic research, political science, and environmental research.&lt;ref&gt;Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles: {{Hanging indent | {{cite web |title=Economic Freedom|url=https://scholar.google.com/advanced_scholar_search?q=economic+freedom|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=5 May 2017}}}}{{Hanging indent | {{cite web |title=Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research |last1=Dexter |first1=S |url=http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000129073826/http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |archivedate=Jan 29, 2000 }}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Economic Freedom of the World'' index has been more widely used than any other measure of economic freedom, because of its coverage of a longer time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawson|first=John W. |title=The Empirical Institution-Growth Literature: Is Something Amiss at the Top?|volume=4|issue=Issue 2|date=May 2007|pages=184–96 |url=http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-number-1-may-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the report was cited in 412 independent research journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citations in 2016 Professional Literature of the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom Research|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-research-professional-citations-2016.pdf|publisher=Fraser Institute|accessdate=2 April 2017|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 and 2017 ''[[Free Malaysia Today]]'' and ''[[National Review]]'' quoted the report.&lt;ref&gt;See:{{Hanging indent | {{cite news

==Criticisms==
The correlation between economic freedom and growth has been criticized by studies. De Haan and Siermann find that the relationship is not robust.&lt;ref&gt;Further Evidence on the Relationship Between Economic Freedom and Economic Growth, Public Choice. 95: 363–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Heckelman and Stroup argue that the weighting procedure used in the construction of the index is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Jac C. Heckelman, Michael D. Stroup (2000), ‘Which Economic Freedoms Contribute to Growth?’, Kyklos, 53(4), 527–44.&lt;/ref&gt; They examine the components of the index individually and find that many—including a low top marginal tax rate—are negatively, rather than positively correlated with economic growth. A frequent criticism is that [[China]], and other developing nations, have high growth rates but relatively low economic freedom. Developing nations can have higher growth rates than developed nations, as they have cheap labor and can import investment, technology and organizational skills from rich countries.

When examining the subcomponents of the index, any positive effect that a low level of taxes might have is more disputed than the importance of [[rule of law]], lack of [[political corruption]], low [[inflation]], and functioning property rights. Many north European nation, such as [[Iceland]] (# 70), [[Denmark]] (# 15), [[Finland]] (# 11) and [[Sweden]] (# 39), have extensive [[welfare state]]s, which are strongly opposed by advocates of laissez-faire. It is argued these countries have less regulation than most others, and research using the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]] suggests that the effect of business regulations is more important than government consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Knowledge Resources |publisher=[[World Bank]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924010354/http://rru.worldbank.org/PapersLinks/resources.aspx?id=6923 |archivedate=September 24, 2013 |url=http://rru.worldbank.org/PapersLinks/resources.aspx?id=6923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global Competitiveness Report]] looks at several other factors that affect economic growth such as [[infrastructure]], [[health]], and [[education]].

Although the [[World Bank]] does not believe that laissez-faire policies, if they allow large inequalities of wealth to develop, are an effective way to achieve this goal, it is a strong supporter of the importance of economic growth for reducing [[poverty]]. It argues that an overview of many studies shows that: growth is fundamental for poverty reduction, and in principle growth as such does not seem to affect inequality, growth accompanied by a more egalitarian distribution of wealth is better than growth alone, high initial [[income inequality]] is a brake on poverty reduction, poverty itself is also likely to be a barrier for poverty reduction, and [[wealth inequality]] seems to predict lower future growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPGI/0,,contentMDK:20263370~menuPK:342777~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:342771,00.html | title=The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Link |publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the ''[[International Monetary Fund|IMF Economic Review]]'' published an article that found countries with higher economic freedom and more liberal credit market regulation suffered more in output growth during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="IMF-Giannone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giannone|first1=Domenico|last2=Lenza|first2=Michele|last3=Reichlin|first3=Lucrezia|title=Market Freedom and the Global Recession|journal=IMF Economic Review|date=2011|volume=59|issue=1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a working paper published by the [[International Labour Organization]] said some of the methodology used in the Rigidity of Employment index sub-components, was not useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aleksynska|first1=Mariya|last2=Cazes|first2=Sandrine|title=Comparing indicators of labour market regulations across databases: A post scriptum to the employing workers debate|date=2014|volume=50|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_245349.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2017|series=Conditions of Work and Employment Series|publisher=[[International Labour Office]]|location=Geneva|format=pdf|issn=2226-8944|quote=This paper offers a critical overview of labour market regulations’ indicators developed by the World Economic Forum, the IMD, and the Fraser Institute.

==Past reports==
===Trend===
The ''Economic Freedom of the World 2005'' report stated that the world economic freedom score has grown considerably over the last few decades. By its measure, the average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntington|first1=Donald M.|title=Advanced Seminar in Business|date=May 18, 2009|publisher=William Jewell College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunvegan Cup, Fairy Flag, Rory Mor's Horn (photo, sometime before 1927).jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Dunvegan Cup]], Fairy Flag, and [[Sir Rory Mor's Horn]] are [[heirloom]]s of the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]] of [[Dunvegan Castle|Dunvegan]]. This photo was taken sometime before 1927.]]

The '''Fairy Flag''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Am Bratach Sìth'') is an [[heirloom]] of the [[Scottish clan chief|chiefs]] of [[Clan MacLeod]]. It is held in [[Dunvegan Castle]] along with other notable heirlooms, such as the [[Dunvegan Cup]] and [[Sir Rory Mor's Horn]]. The Fairy Flag is known for the numerous traditions of fairies, and magical properties associated with it. The flag is made of silk, is yellow or brown in colour, and measures about {{convert|18|in|cm}} squared. It has been examined numerous times in the last two centuries, and its condition has somewhat deteriorated. It is ripped and tattered, and is considered to be extremely fragile. The flag is covered in small red "elf dots". In the early part of the 19th century, the flag was also marked with small crosses, but these have since disappeared. The silk of the flag has been stated to have originated in the Far East, and was therefore extremely precious, which led some to believe that the flag may have been an important [[relic]] of some sort. Others have attempted to associate the flag with the [[Crusades]] or even a [[raven banner]], which was said to have been used by various [[Viking]] leaders in the [[British Isles]].

There are numerous traditions and stories associated with the flag, most of which deal with its magical properties and mysterious origins. The flag is said to have originated as: a gift from the [[fairies]] to an infant chieftain; a gift to a chief from a departing fairy-lover; a reward for defeating an evil spirit. The various powers attributed to the Fairy Flag include: the ability to multiply a clan's military forces; the ability to save the lives of certain clanfolk; the ability to cure a [[cattle plague|plague on cattle]]; the ability to increase the chances of [[fertility]]; and the ability to bring [[herring]] into the loch at [[Dunvegan]]. Some traditions relate that if the flag were to be unfurled and waved more than three times, it would either vanish, or lose its powers forever.

Clan tradition, preserved in the early 19th century, tells how the Fairy Flag was entrusted to a family of hereditary [[standard bearer]]s. Only the eldest male of this family was ever allowed to unfurl the flag; the first such [[hereditary]] standard bearer was given the honour of being buried inside the tomb of the chiefs, on the sacred isle of [[Iona]]. Tradition states that the flag was unfurled at several clan battles in the 15th and 16th centuries; the flag's magical powers are said to have won at least one of them. Another 19th-century tradition linked the flag to a [[prophecy]] which foretold the downfall of Clan MacLeod; but it also prophesied that, in the "far distant future", the clan would regain its power and raise its honour higher than ever before. In the mid-20th century, the Fairy Flag was said to have extinguished a fire at Dunvegan Castle, and to have given luck to servicemen flying [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing missions]] in the [[Second World War]].

==Description==
[[File:Fairy Flag.jpg|thumb|left|The ripped and tattered Fairy Flag, photographed sometime before 1924.]]
In the 19th century, the writer [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Norman Macleod (Caraid nan Gaidheal)|Norman Macleod]] (1783–1862){{refn|[[Norman Macleod (Caraid nan Gaidheal)|Norman Macleod]] was known in Gaelic as ''Caraid nan Gaidheal'', "friend of the Gael".|group=note}} recalled seeing the Fairy Flag during his childhood around 1799 (see [[Fairy Flag#Reported partial fulfillment prophecy in about 1800|relevant section]] below). He described the flag as then having crosses wrought in gold thread, and several "elf spots" stitched upon it. N. Macleod recollected that when the flag was examined, bits were taken off it from time to time; so much so, that later in his life he did not believe the flag still existed.&lt;ref name="M1-192202"/&gt; In August 1814, Sir [[Walter Scott]] visited [[Dunvegan Castle]] on the [[Isle of Skye]], and wrote of the visit in his diary. One of several items he mentioned seeing was the Fairy Flag. Scott described it as "a [[pennon]] of silk, with something like round red [[rowan]]-berries wrought upon it".&lt;ref name="L1-226228"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockhart|first=John Gibson|authorlink=John Gibson Lockhart|title=Memoirs of the life of Sir Walter Scott, bart|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirslifesirw102lockgoog|year=1837|publisher=Robert Cadell|location=[[Edinburgh]]|volume=3|ref=L1|isbn=0-665-75679-8|pages=226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Francis Campbell]] saw the flag in 1871, and described it as being "made of yellow raw silk with figures and spots worked on it in red".&lt;ref name="C2-294"/&gt; In 1927, Roderick Charles MacLeod described the flag as then being square and brown. He measured it as about {{convert|18|in|cm}} squared. He considered the flag to have originally been much larger; and remarked on its extreme fragility and the requirement for careful handling, if it should be handled at all. R.C. MacLeod noted N. Macleod's description of the flag, but observed that it now only contained the "elf spots"—there was then no evidence of any crosses upon what remained of the flag. R.C. MacLeod also observed that several tears in the flag had been carefully mended.&lt;ref name="M1-192202"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=192–202 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was examined in the early 20th century by [[Alan Wace|A.J.B. Wace]] of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]],&lt;ref name="C2-294"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=John Gregorson|authorlink=John Gregorson Campbell|last2=Black|first2=Ronald|title=The Gaelic otherworld: John Gregorson Campbell's Superstitions of the Highlands &amp; Islands of Scotland and Witchcraft &amp; second sight in the Highlands &amp; Islands|edition=Illustrated|year=2008|publisher=[[Birlinn Limited|Birlinn]]|isbn=978-1-84158-733-2|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the silk was woven in either [[Syria]] or [[Rhodes]], and the [[Darning|darns]] were made in the [[Near East]]. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a [[relic]] like the shirt of a [[saint]]. The belief at the time of this examination was the MacLeods were descended from [[Harald Hardrada]], who spent some time in [[Constantinople]] in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the [[eponymous]] ancestor of the clan—[[Leod]].&lt;ref name="C1-5556"/&gt; The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="castlewebsite"/&gt; The flag is currently held in [[Dunvegan Castle]],&lt;ref name="castlewebsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunvegancastle.com/content/default.asp?page=s2_5 |title=The Fairy Flag |accessdate=22 March 2010 |work=www.dunvegancastle.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other notable heirlooms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Darwin Porter|Porter, Darwin]]; Prince, Danforth |title=Frommer's Scotland |edition=11th |year=2010 |publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |pages=383–384 |isbn=978-0-470-47075-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Dunvegan Cup]] and [[Sir Rory Mor's Horn]].

==Tradition and legend==

===Thomas Pennant (1772)===
[[File:Dunvegan cup, Fairy flag, Rory Mor's horn (engraving, sometime before 1890).jpg|300px|thumb|19th century [[engraving]] of the Fairy Flag, [[Sir Rory Mor's Horn]], and the [[Dunvegan Cup]].]]

In 1772, [[Thomas Pennant]] made a tour of the [[Hebrides]] and later published an account of his travels. One of the things Pennant noted while visiting the Isle of Skye, was the Fairy Flag. According to Pennant, the flag was named "''Braolauch shi''", and was given to the MacLeods by [[Titania]] the "''[[Banshee|Ben-shi]]''", wife of [[Oberon]], king of the [[fairies]]. Titania blessed the flag with powers which would manifest when the flag was unfurled three times. On the third time, the flag and [[flag-bearer]] would be carried off by an invisible being, never to be seen again. The family of "''Clan y Faitter''" had the task of bearing the flag, and in return for their services, they possessed free lands in [[Bracadale]]. Pennant related how the flag had already been produced three times. The first occasion was in an unequal battle between the MacLeods and the [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|Macdonalds of Clanranald]]. On the unfurling of the flag, the MacLeod forces were multiplied by ten. The second time the flag was unfurled to preserve the life of the lady of the clan, and thus saved the clan's heir. Pennant then declared that the flag was unfurled a third time to save his own life. He stated that the flag was by then so tattered that Titania did not seem to think it worth taking back. Pennant also noted the belief of the MacLeod's [[Norsemen|Norse]] ancestry and the magical [[raven banner]]s said to have been used by the [[Vikings]] in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="P1-338339"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennant|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Pennant|title=A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides, 1772|url=https://archive.org/details/tourinscotlandvo01penn|year=1774|publisher=Printed by John Monk|location=[[Chester]]|pages=338–339|accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century manuscript accounts of the flag===
Much of the traditional history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In the early part of the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be the most detailed description of the flag.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacLeod |first=Fred T. |date=1912–13 |title=Notes on the Relics preserved in Dunvegan Castle, Skye, and the Heraldry of the Family of MacLeod of MacLeod |journal=[[Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |volume=47 |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_047/47_099_129.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611044919/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_047/47_099_129.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |format=PDF |pages=111–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of the flag's traditional history is the ''[[Bannatyne manuscript (Clan MacLeod)|Bannatyne manuscript]]'', which documents the traditional history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions.&lt;ref name="macleodgenealogy.org--Matheson1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Matheson1.html |title=The Ancestry of the MacLeods |accessdate=18 August 2009 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727052405/http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Matheson1.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} This webpage cited: {{cite journal |last=Matheson |first=William |title=The MacLeods of Lewis |journal=Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness |year=1978–80 |volume=51 |location=[[Inverness]] |pages=68–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macleodgenealogy.org--Morrison"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Morrison.html |title=The Origin of Leod |accessdate=18 August 2009 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803084623/http://macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Morrison.html |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }} This webpage cited: {{cite book |title=The Chiefs of Clan MacLeod |last=Morrison |first=Alick |year=1986 |publisher=Associated Clan MacLeod Societies |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=1–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Description====
[[File:Iona Abbey - altar.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[Iona Abbey]]: the [[effigy]] on the floor in the centre may mark the location of the burials of several MacLeod chiefs and one flag bearer.]]

The ''c.''1800 manuscript stated that both the honour and the very existence of Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag. Only the "highest and purest blood of the race" and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called "''Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie''" ("the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh"),&lt;!-- This English translation is not supported by any reference. --&gt; and was descended from ''[[Sìol Torcaill]]''.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt; The 20th century Hebridean author [[Alasdair Alpin MacGregor]], when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near [[Bracadale]] for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacGregor |first=Alasdair Alpin |authorlink=Alasdair Alpin MacGregor |title=The peat-fire flame: folk-tales and traditions of the Highlands &amp; Islands |url=https://archive.org/details/peatfireflamefol00macg |year=1937 |publisher=The Moray Press |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=20–22 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at [[St Clements, Harris|St Clements Church]], in [[Rodel]], on the [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|island of Harris]]. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A moveable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The ''c.''1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt;

====Unfurling at the Battle of Bloody Bay====
The ''Bannatyne manuscript'' states that the flag was unfurled at the [[Battle of Bloody Bay]] in 1480. The manuscript related that during the battle, the clan's chief, [[William Dubh MacLeod|William Dubh]] (historically lived ''c.''1415–1480), was slain, and in consequence his clan began to lose heart. A priest then ordered the flag's bearer, Murcha Breac, to unfurl the Fairy Flag to rally the clan. Up until this point, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were on the opposing side of their kinsmen, the [[Clan MacLeod of Lewis|MacLeods of Lewis]]. However, once the MacLeods of Lewis noticed that the flag had been unfurled, they switched sides to join forces with their kinsmen. Unfortunately for both MacLeod clans, the outcome of the battle had already been determined and they were on the losing side. Among the vast numbers of MacLeods slain were Murcha Breac and the twelve guardians of the flag.

====Unfurling at the Battle of Glendale====
[[File:St clements church rodel 100609 - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of [[Alasdair Crotach MacLeod|Alasdair Crotach]] (1450–1547), [[Church of St Clement, Rodel|St Clement's Church]], [[Rodel]], [[Isle of Harris|Harris]]. Male descendants of the flag's bearers were said to be entombed within the same church until the lineage died out.]]

According to the ''Bannatyne manuscript'', the Fairy Flag was also unfurled during the [[Battle of Glendale (Skye)|Battle of Glendale]], which the manuscript states to have been fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis were on the verge of giving way to the invading [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]]. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered the Fairy Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, eventually won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The ''Bannatyne manuscript'' relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the ''c.''1800 manuscript. The writer of the ''Bannatyne manuscript'' states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The ''Bannatyne manuscript'' states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the [[chancel]] at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=72–74 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legend of origin====
The ''c.''1800 manuscript presented a legend of the Fairy Flag's origin. This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a [[Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. On his journey homewards, the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Here, he met a [[hermit]] who gave him food and shelter. The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass, which had never failed to destroy a true believer. However, with the aid of a piece of the [[True Cross]] and certain directions from the hermit, the MacLeod is able to defeat the "She Devil"—who is called "''Nein a Phaipen'', or Daughter of Thunder". In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit wanted some friends to know, she revealed to the MacLeod "the future destinies of the Clan". The writer of the ''c.''1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man's family until its extinction. The spirit then gave the Macleod her [[girdle]], telling him to convert it into a banner. The MacLeod then used his [[spear]] as a flag pole. The writer of the ''c.''1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost, and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever. The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag. The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land, and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt;

====Other episodes====
The ''c.''1800 manuscript related that the spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the ''c.''1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for the third and final time was always resisted; and that at the time of his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt;

The ''c.''1800 manuscript also stated that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always in the possession of the hereditary flag bearers. The ''c.''1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod,&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt; son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of [[Talisker, Skye|Talisker]]. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The ''c.''1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again.&lt;ref name="FTMacLeod-111112"/&gt; Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0067/I36.html|title=Norman Macleod (XX Chief)|accessdate=22 March 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org }} This webpage cited: {{cite book |title=The Chiefs of Clan MacLeod |last=Morrison |first=Alick |year=1986 |publisher=Associated Clan MacLeod Societies |location=[[Edinburgh]] }} also: {{cite book |title=MacLeod Chiefs of Harris and Dunvegan |author1=MacKinnon, Donald |author2=Morrison, Alick |year=1969 |publisher=The Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son, [[Norman MacLeod (The Wicked Man)|Tormod]], was born in July 1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0069/I38.html |title=Norman The Red Man Macled (XXII Chief) |accessdate=22 March 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924092700/http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0069/I38.html |archivedate=24 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }} This webpage cited: {{cite book |title=The Chiefs of Clan MacLeod |last=Morrison |first=Alick |year=1986 |publisher=Associated Clan MacLeod Societies |location=[[Edinburgh]] }} also: {{cite book |title=MacLeod Chiefs of Harris and Dunvegan |author1=MacKinnon, Donald |author2=Morrison, Alick |year=1969 |publisher=The Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reported partial fulfilment prophecy around 1800===
Late in his life, the writer [[Norman Macleod (Caraid nan Gaidheal)|Norman Macleod]] (1783–1862) related to one of his daughters of having heard an old [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] prophecy concerning the flag, and of events which took place in his childhood which were reported as examples of the [[prophecy]] being partially fulfilled. A summarised version of this prophecy was published in the late 19th century, within an account of the life of [[Norman MacLeod (1812–1872)|one of his sons]]. Soon after, in 1878, [[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Alexander Mackenzie]] proposed that the prophecy as dictated by N. Macleod, may have been a fragmented remembrance of one of the prophecies of [[Coinneach Odhar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mackeznie |first1=Alexander |last2=Macgregor |first2=Alexander |authorlink1=Alexander Mackenzie (historian) |title=The Prophecies of the Brahan seer (Coinneach Odhar Fiosaiche) |url=https://archive.org/details/propheciesofbrah00mack |year=1878 |publisher=A. &amp; W. Mackenzie |location=[[Inverness]] |pages=47–50 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is popularly known as the [[Brahan Seer]]). N. Macleod's tale of the prophecy is as follows:

{{cquote|Of the Macleod family it was prophesied at least a hundred years prior to the circumstance which I am about to relate. In the prophecy to which I allude it was foretold, that when Norman, the third Norman ('Tormaid nan' tri Tormaid'), the son of the hard-boned English lady ('Mac na mnatha Caoile cruaidh [[Sassenach|Shassanaich]]'), would perish by an accidental death; that when the 'Maidens' of Macleod (certain well-known rocks on the coast of Macleod's country) became the property of a Campbell; when a fox had young ones in one of the [[turret]]s of the Castle, and, particularly, when the Fairy enchanted banner should be for the last time exhibited, then the glory of the Macleod family should depart; a great part of the estate should be sold to others, so that a small '[[curach|curragh]],' or boat, would carry all gentlemen of the name of [[Macleod]] across Loch Dunvegan; but that in times far distant another John Breac should arise, who should redeem those estates, and raise the powers and honour of the house to a higher pitch than ever.&lt;ref name="M6-333335"/&gt;|30px||[[Norman Macleod DD (The Highlanders' Friend)|Norman Macleod]]}}

N. Macleod then related how as a child, he had been close to an English [[Metalsmith|smith]] employed at Dunvegan. One day the smith told him in secrecy that the chest in which the flag was held was to be forced open the next morning, and that it had been arranged by Hector Macdonald Buchanan that the smith would be at the castle with the necessary tools. N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present, and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone—especially the chief—what was about to be done. The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a wooden case. N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square-shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread, and several "elf spots" stitched onto it. After the flag had been examined, it was placed back into its case. N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the [[heir]] to the chiefship, Norman, was killed at sea.&lt;ref name="M2-112114"/&gt; {{HMS|Queen Charlotte|1790|6}}, on which he was a lieutenant,&lt;ref name="M2-112114"/&gt; caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men.&lt;ref name="memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk-charlotte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/others/excellent/charlotte.htm|title=HMS Excellent – The HMS Queen Charlotte Figurehead -|accessdate=14 August 2009|work=www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923202900/http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/others/excellent/charlotte.htm|archivedate=23 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; N. Macleod stated that at about the same time, MacLeod's Maidens were sold to Campbell of [[Ensay, Outer Hebrides|Ensay]]. He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs, which lived in the west turret of the castle.&lt;ref name="M2-112114"&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacLeod |first=Fred T. |date=1912–13 |title=Notes on the Relics preserved in Dunvegan Castle, Skye, and the Heraldry of the Family of MacLeod of MacLeod |journal=[[Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |volume=47 |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_047/47_099_129.pdf |format=PDF |pages=112–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; N. Macleod related how he was grateful that the worst part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled; and that the chiefly family still owned their ancestral lands.&lt;ref name="M6-333335"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macleod|first=Donald|title=Memoir of Norman Macleod, D.D.|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirofnormanman00macl|year=1877|publisher=Scribner, Armstrong &amp; Co|location=New York City|ref=M6|isbn=0-665-09701-8|pages=333–335|accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R.C. MacLeod, who wrote in the early 20th century, considered that this prophecy seemed to have been fulfilled. At that time, the Macleod chief had no gentlemen of his clan as [[wikt:tenant|tenants]] on his estate; also, an heir to the family—named ''Ian Breac''—was killed in the [[First World War]]. R.C. MacLeod noted that the prophecy stated that a "John Breac" (Gaelic: ''Iain Breac'', "Iain the speckled") would restore the fortunes of the family. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that this may still happen, when he lamented the loss of his son,&lt;ref name="burkes1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dewar |first=Peter Beauclerk |title=Burke's landed gentry of Great Britain: together with members of the titled and non-titled contemporary establishment |year=2001|edition=Illustrated |publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]] |volume=1 |isbn=978-0-9711966-0-5 |pages=941–942}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that Iain Breac "showed that his race had not lost the loyalty and courage which were their chief claims to glory in ancient days".&lt;ref name="M4-110114"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=110–114 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Scott, 1814===
When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, he learned of several traditional tales relating to the area and the clan. He was told that the Fairy Flag had three magical properties. The first was that it multiplied the number of men upon a battlefield. The second was that when it was spread upon a [[Marital bed|nuptial bed]], it ensured [[fertility]]. The third was that it brought [[herring]] into the [[loch]].&lt;ref name="L1-226228"/&gt;

===Other traditions===
[[File:Fairy Bridge, Dunvegan, Skye.jpg|thumb|left|The Fairy Bridge, near [[Dunvegan]].]]
In the early 20th century, R.C. MacLeod noted several traditions concerning the flag. One told how the flag came into the possession of the MacLeods through a fairy. A similar tradition relates of a fairy-lullaby.

====Fairy lover====
The first of these traditions related by R.C. MacLeod tells how one of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod married a fairy; however, after twenty years she is forced to leave him and return to [[Elfland|fairyland]]. She bade farewell to the chief at the Fairy Bridge (which stands about {{convert|3|mi|km}} from Dunvegan) and gave him the flag. She promised that if it was waved in times of danger and distress, help would be given on three occasions.&lt;ref name="M1-192202"/&gt; A similar tradition, related by John Arnott MacCulloch, stated that although the fairy's gift had the power to save both her husband and his clan, afterwards an [[invisible]] being would come to take both the flag and its bearer away—never to be seen again.&lt;ref name="MacCulloch"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=John Arnott |title=The Misty Isle of Skye: its scenery, its people, its story |url=https://archive.org/details/mistyisleofskyei00macc |year=1905 |publisher=Oliphant Anderson &amp; Ferrier |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=75 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oh that I could see thy cattle fold, high up on the mountain side; a green, shaggy jacket about thy two white shoulders, with a linen shirt. My little child.

Oh that I could behold thy team of horses; men following them; serving women returning home and the Catanaich sowing the corn.

Oh tender hero whom my womb did bring forth, who did swallow from my breast, who on my knee wast reared.

My child it is, my armful of yew, merry and plump, my bulrush, my flesh and eggs, that will soon be speaking. Last year thou wast beneath my girdle, plant of fertility! and this year fair and playful on my shoulder, thou wilt be going round the homestead.

Oh let me not hear of thy being wounded. Grey do thou become duly. May thy nose grow sharp ere the close of thy day.

R.C. MacLeod and Alasdair Alpin MacGregor mention Frances Tolmie, when mentioning the lullaby.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

====Fairy lullaby====
R.C. MacLeod considered the above 'fairy lover' tradition to be connected to another about a [[lullaby]]. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan [[bard]] in the last half of the 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The [[nursemaid]], who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|spell]] and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir [[Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod]] (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=195–198 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0039/I45.html|title=Sir Reginald Macleod (XXVII Chief)|accessdate=21 August 2009|work=www.macleodgenealogy.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727054025/http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/ACMS/D0039/I45.html|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The www.macleodgenealogy.org link is only a ref for the chief's birth/death/numbering --&gt; An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the ''right''.

====Fairy music====
Another tradition, related by R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events which took place after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious to join in the festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies appeared and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=200 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern origins====
R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, somewhat similar to the one that appeared in ''c.''1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the [[Holy Land]]. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a [[witch]], from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Roderick Charles |title=The MacLeods of Dunvegan |url=https://archive.org/details/macleodsofdunveg00macl |year=1927 |publisher=Privately printed for the Clan MacLeod Society |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=199 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unfurled numerous times====
R.C. MacLeod wrote of another tradition which stated that the flag was waved at a battle in [[Waternish]], in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved during a time when a [[cattle plague]] was raging, and that it stopped the [[murrain]]. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the [[Clan Macdonald of Sleat|Macdonalds of Sleat]].&lt;ref name="M1-192202"/&gt;

===Supposed powers of the flag in the 20th century===
In 1938, a fire broke out in a wing of Dunvegan Castle, and according to Sir [[Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk]], the flames were checked and extinguished when the flag was carried past to safety.&lt;ref name="M4-69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moncreiffe of that Ilk|first=Iain|authorlink=Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk|title=The Highland Clans|year=1967|publisher=Barrie &amp; Rockliff|location=London|isbn=0-517-54659-0|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the chief of the clan, [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Flora MacLeod of MacLeod]], received a letter from a member of the clan who attributed his luck during [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing missions]] over Germany to a photo of the flag which he carried in his pocket.&lt;ref name="C1-5556"&gt;{{cite book |title=Skye |last=Cooper| first=Derek |edition=Illustrated, reprint |year=1983 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7100-9565-7 |pages=55–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman Mythology]],  the '''[[Giant]]s''', also called '''Gigantes''' (''jye-GAHN-tees'' or ''gee-GAHN-tees''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Γίγαντες, ''Gígantes'', {{small|singular:}} Γίγας, ''Gígas'') were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size, known for the '''Gigantomachy''' ('''Gigantomachia'''), their battle with the [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 177&amp;ndash;179; Gantz, pp. 445&amp;ndash;454.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hesiod]], the Giants were the offspring of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth), born from the blood that fell when [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Sky) was castrated by his [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] son [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185 185]. [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface] gives [[Tartarus]] as the father of the Giants. A parallel to the Giants' birth is the birth of [[Aphrodite]] from the similarly fertilized sea.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaic and Classical representations show Gigantes as man-sized [[hoplites]] (heavily armed ancient Greek foot soldiers) fully human in form.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 446, 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Gigantes with snakes for legs.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 453; Hanfmann 1992, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Giants"; Frazer 1898b, note to Pausanias 8.29.3 "That the giants have serpents instead of feet" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog#page/n336/mode/2up pp. 315&amp;ndash;316].&lt;/ref&gt; In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with other opponents of the Olympians, particularly the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an earlier generation of large and powerful children of Gaia and Uranus.

The vanquished Giants were said to be buried under volcanoes and to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

==Origins==

The name "Gigantes" is usually taken to imply "earth-born",&lt;ref&gt;Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA86  p. 86]; Gantz, p. 16; Merry, ''Homer's Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0055%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D59 7.59]; Douglas Harper mentions that a [[Pre-Greek]] origin has also been proposed ([http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=giant "giant"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' makes this explicit by having the Giants be the offspring of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth). According to Hesiod, Gaia, mating with Uranus, bore many children: the first generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the [[Cyclops]] and the [[Hundred-Handers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+132 132&amp;ndash;153]&lt;/ref&gt; But Uranus hated his children and, as soon as they were born, he imprisoned them inside of Gaia, causing her much distress. And so Gaia made a sickle of adamant which she gave to [[Cronus]], the youngest of her Titan sons, and hid him (presumably still inside Gaia's body) to wait in ambush.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+154 154&amp;ndash;175]; Gantz, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; And when Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus castrated his father, and "the bloody drops that gushed forth [Gaia] received, and as the seasons moved round she bore ... the great Giants."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+176 176 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; From these same drops of blood also came the [[Erinyes]] (Furies) and the [[Meliai]] (ash tree nymphs), while the severed genitals of Uranus falling into the sea resulted in a white foam from which [[Aphrodite]] grew. The mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] also has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Uranus, though he makes no connection with Uranus' castration, saying simply that Gaia "vexed on account of the Titans, brought forth the Giants".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1]; Hansen, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three brief references to the ''Gigantes'' in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though it's not entirely clear that Homer and Hesiod understood the term to mean the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446. Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82 n. 74] says that the "''Odyssey''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Giants stand a little outside the remainder of the tradition, in so far as they are ethnologized into a wild, arrogant, and doomed race, formerly presided over by a king Eurymedon." Hanfmann 1937, p. 175, sees in the "conflicting" descriptions of Homer and Hesiod, "two different local traditions".&lt;/ref&gt; Homer has Giants among the ancestors of the [[Phaiakian]]s, a race of men encountered by [[Odysseus]], their ruler [[Alcinous]] being the son of [[Nausithous]], who was the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Periboea]], the daughter of the Giant king Eurymedon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7.59&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 7.56&amp;ndash;63]. [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Acusilaus]] make the Phaiakians, like the Giants, offspring of the castration of Uranus, Gantz, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the ''Odyssey'', Alcinous says that the Phaiakians, like the Cyclopes and the Giants, are "near kin" to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7.199&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 7.199&amp;ndash;207].&lt;/ref&gt; Odysseus describes the [[Laestrygonians]] (another race encountered by Odysseus in his travels) as more like Giants than men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.120&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.119&amp;ndash;120].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the 2nd century AD geographer, read these lines of the ''Odyssey'' to mean that, for Homer, the Giants were a race of mortal men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.29.1 8.29.1&amp;ndash;4]. Smith, William, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dgigantes-bio-1 "Gigantes"] and Hanfmann 1992, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Giants", following Pausanias, both assert that, for Homer, the Giants were a "savage race of men". For the mythographer [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Giants were also a race of men, see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.21.5], Gantz, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th&amp;ndash;5th century BC lyric poet [[Bacchylides]] calls the Giants "sons of the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DDith 15.63]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA233 pp. 233&amp;ndash;234].&lt;/ref&gt; Later the term "gegeneis" ("earthborn") became a common epithet of the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encquran.brill.nl/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/gegeneis-e420500?s.num=10 "Gegeneis"], ''Brills New Pauly''; Crusius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f35J6nfeZe0C&amp;pg=PA93 p.93]; ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/hesiodhomerichym1914hesi#page/542/mode/2up 7 (pp. 542&amp;ndash;543)]; [[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Soph.+Trach.+1058 1058]; [[Euripides]], ''[[The Phoenician Women]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=432E6B38906EB97E3B6E0D6EDADF1CB8?doc=Eur.+Phoen.+1131 1131]; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/504/mode/2up 127 (pp. 504&amp;ndash;505)], [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/610/mode/2up 1408 (pp. 610&amp;ndash;611)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first century Latin writer [[Hyginus]] has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and [[Tartarus]], another primordial Greek deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface]. [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Genealogiarum_liber_-_Praefatio Latin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with Titans and others==
Though distinct in early traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenistic and later writers often confused or conflated the Giants and their Gigantomachy, with an earlier set of offspring of Gaia and Uranus, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and their war with the Olympian gods, the [[Titanomachy]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dgigantes-bio-1 "Gigantes"]; Gantz, p. 447; Hansen p. 178, Grimal, p. 171; Tripp, p. 250; Morford, pp. 82&amp;ndash;83. A probable early confusion, (or at least a possible cause of later confusion) can be seen in [[Euripides]]' ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0112%3Acard%3D203 221&amp;ndash;224] and ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9E598FCE225CCCB46AC844AFDB838A04?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0098%3Acard%3D466 466&amp;ndash;474], see Torrance, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1x3HlgTPlrkC&amp;pg=PA155 p. 155 n. 74]. Later examples include [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn 4 (to Delos)'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/98/mode/2up 173 ff. (pp. 98&amp;ndash;99)] (see Vian and Moore 1988 p. 193; Mineur, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZU3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170]).&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion extended to other opponents of the Olympians, including the huge monster [[Typhon]],&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Typhon, Typhoeus"; Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt; the offspring of [[Gaia]] and [[Tartarus]], whom [[Zeus]] finally defeated with his thunderbolt, and the [[Aloadae]], the large, strong and aggressive brothers Otus and Ephialtes, who piled [[Pelion]] on top of [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]] in order to scale the heavens and attack the Olympians (though in the case of Ephialtes there was probably a Giant with the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 450&amp;ndash;451.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Hyginus]] includes the names of three Titans: [[Coeus]], [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], and [[Astraeus]], along with Typhon and the Aloadae, in his list of Giants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface]. For other examples of Typhon as a Giant, see [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.53], (which has Typhon  battling Athena, alongside the Giants Mimas, Porphyrion, and Enceladus); [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/manilius-astronomica/1977/pb_LCL469.151.xml 2.874&amp;ndash;880 (pp. 150&amp;ndash;151)]; [[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/16/mode/2up 1.176 (I pp. 16&amp;ndash;17)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/18/mode/2up 1.220 (I pp. 18&amp;ndash;19)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/20/mode/2up 1.244 (I pp. 20&amp;ndash;21)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/22/mode/2up 1.263 (I pp. 22&amp;ndash;23)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/24/mode/2up 1.291 (I pp. 24&amp;ndash;25)].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ovid]], seems to conflate the Gigantomachy with the later siege of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] by the Aloadae.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 178; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D89 1.151–162]. See also [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.42 ff.], with Lyne [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51]. [[Plato]] had already associated the Aloadae with the Giants, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D190b 190b&amp;ndash;c].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
Homer describes the Giant king Eurymedon as "great-hearted" (''μεγαλήτορος''), and his people as "insolent" (''ὑπερθύμοισι'') and "froward" (''ἀτάσθαλος'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D37 7.58&amp;ndash;60]. The translations given are A.T. Murray's. [[Richard Lattimore]] translates ''ὑπερθύμοισι'' as "high-hearted" and ''ἀτάσθαλος'' as "recklessly daring". See also Liddell and Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmegalh%2Ftwr ''μεγαλήτωρ''] ("greathearted"), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Du(pe%2Frqumos ''ὑπέρθυμος''] ("overweening"), and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)ta%2Fsqalos ''ἀτάσθαλος''] ("reckless, presumptuous, wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod calls the Giants "strong" (''κρατερῶν'') and "great" (''μεγάλους'') which may or may not be a reference to their size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+50&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0129 50], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0129 185]; Liddell and Scott [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkratero%2Fs ''κρατερός], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Fgas ''μέγας'']; Hansen, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Though a possible later addition, the ''Theogony'' also has the Giants born "with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands".&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early sources characterize the Giants by their excesses. [[Pindar]] describes the excessive violence of the Giant Porphyrion as having provoked "beyond all measure".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12&amp;ndash;18].&lt;/ref&gt; Bacchylides calls the Giants arrogant, saying that they were destroyed by "Hybris" (the Greek word hubris personified).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DDith 15.50 ff.]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA139  p. 139], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA233 pp. 233&amp;ndash;234].&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier seventh century BC poet [[Alcman]] perhaps had already used the Giants as an example of hubris, with the phrases "vengeance of the gods" and "they suffered unforgettable punishments for the evil they did" being possible references to the Gigantomachy.&lt;ref&gt;Alcman fragment 1 ''Poetarum melicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', see Cairns, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9--TlDdWfdsC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]; Wilkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSp0mnpkE_QC&amp;pg=PA142 p. 142]; Ferrari, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA28 28], [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA109 109], [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA151 151 ff.]; Hanfmann 1937, pp. 475&amp;ndash;476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's comparison of the Giants to the [[Laestrygonians]] is suggestive of similarities between the two races. The Laestrygonians, who "hurled ... rocks huge as a man could lift", certainly possessed great strength, and possibly great size, as their king's wife is described as being as big as a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;According to Gantz, p 446: "In all, the account rather suggests that the huge bulk of  Antiphates' wife is not typical of the Laistrygones as a whole. But they  are clearly thought of as good-sized, although whether it is in this respect that they are like the Gigantes and unlike men we cannot say; the ''Odyssey''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s emphasis might be thought to fall more on their uncivilized behjavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, descriptions of the Giants make them less human, more monstrous and more "gigantic". According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] the Giants had great size and strength, a frightening appearance, with long hair and beards and scaly feet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] makes them "serpent-footed" with a "hundred arms",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D163 1.182 ff.]; Newlands, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U99CAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81]. Here Ovid has apparently conflated the Giants with the [[Hundred-Handers]]: Anderson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t12AuG0q144C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170, note to line 184 "''centum'' with ''bracchia''"]. Compare with ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/262/mode/2up 5.35&amp;ndash;42], where Ovid says "Earth brought forth the Giants, a fierce brood, enormous monsters, who durst assault Jove's mansion; she gave them a thousand hands, and snakes for legs".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nonnus]] has them  "serpent-haired".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/n61/mode/2up 1.18 (I, pp. 4&amp;ndash;5)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gigantomachy==

The most important divine struggle in Greek mythology was the Gigantomachy, the battle fought between the Giants and the Olympian gods for supremacy of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily for this battle that the Giants are known, and its importance to Greek culture is attested by the frequent depiction of the Gigantomachy in Greek art.

===Early sources===

[[File:Athena Enkelados Louvre CA3662.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] (left) fighting the Giant [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]] (inscribed retrograde) on an [[Attica|Attic]] [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] dish, c. 550&amp;ndash;500 BC ([[Louvre]] CA3662).&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/3572A177-0DAE-4EED-8140-BEA13D762135 200059], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+342%22 Gigantes 342].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The references to the Gigantomachy in archaic sources are sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 15. For a survey of literary sources see Gantz, pp. 445&amp;ndash;450,  Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 191&amp;ndash;196.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Homer nor Hesiod mention anything about the Giants battling the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;
Homer's remark that Eurymedon "brought destruction on his froward people" might possibly be a reference to the Gigantomachy&lt;ref&gt;A scholion to ''Odyssey'' 7.59 asserts that Homer does not know that the Giants fought against the gods, Gantz, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hesiod's remark that [[Heracles]] performed a "great work among the immortals"&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+954 954]; for the translation used here see Most 2006, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; is probably a reference to Heracles' crucial role in the gods' victory over the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' (or the ''Ehoia'') following mentions of his sacks of [[Troy]] and of [[Kos]], refers to Heracles having slain "presumptious Giants".&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod fragment 43a.65 MW, see Most 2007, p. 143. Gantz, p. 446, says that this line "with no link to what precedes or follows, might easily be an interpolation".&lt;/ref&gt; Another probable reference to the Gigantomachy in the ''Catalogue'' has Zeus produce Heracles to be "a protector against ruin for gods and men".&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod fragment 195.28&amp;ndash;29 MW, Most 2007, p. 5; Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indications that there might have been a lost epic poem, a ''Gigantomachia'', which gave an account of the war: Hesiod's ''Theogony'' says that the [[Muses]] sing of the Giants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+50 50&amp;ndash;52].&lt;/ref&gt; and the sixth century BC poet [[Xenophanes]] mentions the Gigantomachy as a subject to be avoided at table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophanes]], 1.21 (Lesher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LxxJXTviacgC&amp;pg=PA12 pp. 12, 13]); Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] scholia refers to a "''Gigantomachia''" in which the Titan [[Cronus]] (as a horse) sires the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] by mating with [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] (the daughter of two Titans), but the scholiast may be confusing the Titans and Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Since Chiron did apparently figure in a lost poem about the Titanomachy, and there is no obvious role for the centaur in a poem about the Gigantomachy, see Gantz, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible archaic sources include the lyric poets Alcman (mentioned above) and the sixth-century [[Ibycus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSp0mnpkE_QC&amp;pg=PA141 pp. 141&amp;ndash;142]; Gantz p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The late sixth early fifth century BC lyric poet [[Pindar]] provides some of the earliest details of the battle between the Giants and the Olympians. He locates it "on the plain of [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegra]]" and has [[Teiresias]] foretell Heracles killing Giants "beneath [his] rushing arrows".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D1 1.67&amp;ndash;69].&lt;/ref&gt; He calls Heracles "you who subdued the Giants",&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D7 7.90].&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[Porphyrion]], who he calls "the king of the Giants", being overcome by the bow of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12&amp;ndash;18].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euripides]]' ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' has its hero shooting Giants with arrows,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+177&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0102 177&amp;ndash;180]; Gantz, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' has the chorus describe seeing a depiction of the Gigantomachy on the late sixth century [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]], with [[Athena]] fighting the Giant [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]] with her "gorgon shield", [[Zeus]] burning the Giant [[Mimas (Giant)|Mimas]] with his "mighty thunderbolt, blazing at both ends", and [[Dionysus]] killing an unnamed Giant with his "ivy staff".&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+206&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0110 205&amp;ndash;218].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed account of the Gigantomachy&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; is that of the (first century or second century AD) mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1&amp;ndash;2].&lt;/ref&gt; None of the early sources give any reasons for the war. Scholia to the ''[[Iliad]]'' mention the rape of [[Hera]] by the Giant Eurymedon&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 16, 57, 448&amp;ndash;449; Hard [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA88 p.88]. According to Gantz, p. 449, it is possible but unlikely, that this is the incident being referred to in Odyssey 7, noting that the story of the rape of Hera by Eurymedon may be a later invention to explain Homer's remark.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to scholia to [[Pindar]]'s ''Isthmian'' 6, it was the theft of the cattle of [[Helios]] by the Giant [[Alcyoneus]] that started the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 419, 448&amp;ndash;449.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apollodorus, who also mentions the theft of Helios' cattle by Alcyoneus,&lt;ref&gt;According to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus stole Helios' cattle from [[Erytheia]], where the cattle of [[Geryon]] are usually found.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a mother's revenge as the motive for the war, saying that Gaia bore the Giants because of her anger over the Titans (who had been vanquished and imprisoned by the Olympians).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 449; Grimal, p. 171; Tripp, p. 251. The  late 4th century AD Latin poet [[Claudian]] expands on this notion in his ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/280/mode/2up 1&amp;ndash;35 (pp. 280&amp;ndash;283)] with Gaia, "jealous of the heavenly kingdoms and in pity for the ceasless woes of the Titans" (1&amp;ndash;2), gave birth to the Giants,  urging them to war saying "Up, army of avengers, the hour is come at last, free the Titans from their chains; defend your mother." (27&amp;ndash;28)&lt;/ref&gt; Seemingly, as soon as the Giants are born they begin hurling "rocks and burning oaks at the sky".&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185 185&amp;ndash;186] which seems to have the Giants born, like [[Athena]] and the [[Spartoi]], fully grown and armed for battle (Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6 1.3.6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6 1.3.6]). Also compare with [[Plato]], ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=6EA8185321C1F13AC8EBBFB34B9BDAA7?doc=Plat.+Soph.+246a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 246a], where comparing materialist philosophers with the Giants, says they "drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth, actually grasping rocks and trees with their hands".&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a prophecy that the Giants could not be killed by the gods alone, but they could be killed with the help of a mortal.&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [[Pindar]],  ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D1 1.67&amp;ndash;69] (mentioned above) where [[Teiresias]] prophesies that Heracles will aid the gods in their battle with the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing this, Gaia sought for a certain plant (''pharmakon'') that would protect the Giants. Before Gaia or anyone else could find this plant, Zeus forbade [[Eos]] (Dawn), [[Selene]] (Moon) and [[Helios]] (Sun) to shine, harvested all of the plant himself and then he had [[Athena]] summon Heracles.

According to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus and [[Porphyrion]] were the two strongest Giants. Heracles shot Alcyoneus, who fell to the ground but then revived, for Alcyoneus was immortal within his native land. So Heracles, with [[Athena]]'s advice, dragged him beyond the borders of that land, where Alcyoneus then died (compare with [[Antaeus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Antaeus, another offspring of Gaia who was an opponent of Heracles, was immortal as long as he was in contact with the earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by crushing him while holding him off the ground. For [[Pindar]], Hearacles' battle with Alcyoneus (whom he calls a herdsman) and the Gigantomachy were separate events, see: ''Isthmian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DI.%3Apoem%3D6 6.30&amp;ndash;35], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D4 4.24&amp;ndash;30].&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyrion attacked Heracles and [[Hera]], but Zeus caused Porphyrion to become enamoured of Hera, whom Porphyrion then tried to rape, but Zeus struck Porphyrion with his thunderbolt and Heracles killed him with an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;As noted above Pindar has Apollo kill Porphyrion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Giants and their fates are mentioned by Apollodorus. Ephialtes was blinded by an arrow from Apollo in his left eye, and another arrow from Heracles in his right. [[Eurytus]] was killed by [[Dionysus]] with his [[thyrsus]], [[Clytius]] by [[Hecate]] with her torches and [[Mimas (Giant)|Mimas]] by [[Hephaestus]] with "missiles of red-hot metal" from his forge.&lt;ref&gt;As noted above, Euripides has Zeus kill Mimas; other accounts have Mimas killed by [[Ares]]: [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/276/mode/2up 3.1225&amp;ndash;7 (pp. 276&amp;ndash;277)]; [[Claudian]], ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/286/mode/2up 85&amp;ndash;91 (pp. 286&amp;ndash;287)].&lt;/ref&gt; Athena crushed Enceladus under the Island of Sicily and flayed [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]], using his skin as a shield. [[Poseidon]] broke off a piece of the island of [[Kos]] called [[Nisyros]], and threw it on top of [[Polybotes]] ([[Strabo]] also relates the story of Polybotes buried under Nisyros but adds that some say Polybotes lies under Kos instead).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+10.5.16 10.5.16]. The mention of a millstone, in the poem fragment by Alcman (mentioned above) may be an early reference to the island of Nisyros, see Hanfmann 1937, pp. 476; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]], wearing [[Hades]]' helmet, killed Hippolytus, [[Artemis]] killed Gration, and the [[Moirai]] (Fates) killed [[Agrius]] and Thoas with bronze clubs. The rest of the giants were "destroyed" by thunderbolts thrown by Zeus, with each Giant being shot with arrows by Heracles (as the prophecy seemingly required).

===Ovid===
The Latin poet [[Ovid]] gives a brief account of the Gigantomachy in his poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D89 1.151–162].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ovid, apparently including the [[Aloadae]]'s attack upon Olympus as part of the Gigantomachy, has the Giants attempt to seize "the throne of Heaven" by piling "mountain on mountain to the lofty stars" but Jove (i.e. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Roman Zeus) overwhelms the Giants with his thunderbolts, overturning "from [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]] huge, enormous [[Pelion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid also refers to Giants piling up Pelion on top of Ossa elsewhere, see ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Am.+2.1 2.1.11&amp;ndash;18], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/22/mode/2up 1.307&amp;ndash;308], [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/152/mode/2up 3.437&amp;ndash;442]; Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yPUDE65WEMoC&amp;&amp;pg=PA143 p. 143].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid tells that (as "fame reports") from the blood of the Giants came a new race of beings in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Compare with  [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/606/mode/2up 1356&amp;ndash;1358 (pp. 606&amp;ndash;607]), who has the Pelasgian race born from the "blood of the [[Sithonia]]n giants", Sithonia being the middle spur of [[Chalcidice]] just north of the southern spur of [[Pallene, Chalcidice|Pallene]], the traditional home of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ovid, Earth [Gaia] did not want the Giants to perish without a trace, so "reeking with the copious blood of her gigantic sons", she gave life to the "steaming gore" of the blood soaked battleground.  These new offspring, like their fathers the Giants, also hated the gods and possessed a bloodthirsty desire for "savage slaughter".

Later in the ''Metamorphoses'', Ovid refers to the Gigantomachy as "the time when serpent footed giants strove / to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D163 1.182 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ovid apparently conflates the Giants with the [[Hundred-Handers]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t12AuG0q144C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170, note to line 184 "''centum'' with ''bracchia''"]. Ovid's  ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Am.+2.1 2.1.11&amp;ndash;18] (Knox, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MtNSM3gHnvEC&amp;pg=PT239 p. 209]), likewise associates the Gigantomachy with the Hundred-Hander Gyas, while in ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/262/mode/2up 5.35&amp;ndash;42], Ovid has the Giants have a "thousand hands". This same conflation may already occur in [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 169 (Lightfoot) (Lightfoot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ScXvWB0Es0C&amp;pg=PA394 pp. 394&amp;ndash;395]), see Vian and Moore 1988, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; who, though in Hesiod fought alongside Zeus and the Olympians, in some traditions fought against them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+617 617&amp;ndash;736], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+815 815&amp;ndash;819]. For the Hundred-Handers as opponents of Zeus, see for example [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D543 10.565&amp;ndash;568]; O'Hara, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhAFo12lV7IC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Various places have been associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy. As noted above Pindar has the battle occur at Phlegra ("the place of burning"),&lt;ref&gt;Singleton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xbB5PE9O9KEC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt; as do other early sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0006%3Acard%3D276 294]; [[Euripides]], ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+1192 1192&amp;ndash;1194]; ''Ion'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+987 987&amp;ndash;997]; [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0019,006:824&amp;lang=original 824]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/210/mode/2up 3.232&amp;ndash;234 (pp. 210&amp;ndash;211)], [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/276/mode/2up 3.1225&amp;ndash;7 (pp. 276&amp;ndash;277)].

The name Phlegra and the Gigantomachy were also often associated, by later writers, with a volcanic plain in Italy, west of [[Naples]] and east of [[Cumae]], called the [[Phlegraean Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5D*.html 5.4.4], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5D*.html 5.4.6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+6.3.5 6.3.5]; [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.21.5&amp;ndash;7], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5D*.html 5.71.4].&lt;/ref&gt; The third century BC poet [[Lycophron]], apparently locates a battle of gods and Giants in the vicinity of the volcanic island of [[Ischia]], the largest of the [[Phlegraean Islands]] off the coast of Naples, where he says the Giants (along with Typhon) were "crushed" under the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/550/mode/2up 688&amp;ndash;693 (pp. 550&amp;ndash;551)].&lt;/ref&gt; At least one tradition placed Phlegra in [[Ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]],  ''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+3.578 3.578]; Leigh, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the [[Arcadia]]ns claimed that battle took place "not at Pellene in Thrace" but in  the plain of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] where "rises up fire".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.29.1 8.29.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition apparently placed the battle at [[Tartessus]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast A on ''Iliad'' 8.479 (Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSljjU2xlecC&amp;pg=PA125 p. 125]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.15.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.21.5&amp;ndash;7], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5D*.html 5.71.2&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at [[Phanagoria]], a Greek colony on the shores of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+11.2.10 11.2.10].&lt;/ref&gt; Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place. Individual battles between a Giant and a god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of [[Nisyros]] (or [[Kos]]). Other locales associated with Giants include [[Attica]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Lipari|Lipara]], [[Lycia]], [[Lydia]], [[Miletus]], and [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanfmann 1937, p. 475 n. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9TwhfvU08UcC&amp;pg=PA197 p. 197 ff.]; Apollodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.%201.6.1 1.6.1 n. 3]; Frazer 1898b, note to Pausanias 8.29.1 "the legendary battle of the gods and the giants" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog#page/n336/mode/2up pp. 314&amp;ndash;315]; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.32.5 8.32.5]; [[Philostratus]], ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofapollonius01phil#page/498/mode/2up 5.16 (pp. 498&amp;ndash;501)], ''On Heroes'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nMVkv_lZ4C&amp;pg=PA14 8.15&amp;ndash;16 (p. 14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixth century BC onwards, the Gigantomachy was a popular and important theme in Greek art, with over six hundred representations cataloged in the ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'' (''LIMC'').&lt;ref&gt;Vian and Moore 1988; Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA64 p. 64]; Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; See also Vian 1951; 1952; Morford, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gigantomachy was depicted on the new ''[[peplos]]'' (robe) presented to [[Athena]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] as part of the [[Panathenaea|Panathenaic festival]] celebrating her victory over the Giants, a practice dating from perhaps as early as the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Barber 1992, pp. 103&amp;ndash;104, 112, 117; Barber 1991, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;pg=PA361 361&amp;ndash;362], [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;pg=PA380 380&amp;ndash;381]; Simon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AMTNIZ_LQjoC&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23]; Euripides, ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Hec.+466 466&amp;ndash;474], ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0112%3Acard%3D203 222&amp;ndash;224]; [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0019,006:824&amp;lang=original 823&amp;ndash;831], ''[[The Knights]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=EBE89320150BA26C965AD689D8DABDF1?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0034%3Acard%3D565 565]; [[Plato]], ''[[Euthyphro]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DEuthyph.%3Asection%3D6b 6b&amp;ndash;c]; ''[[Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=6E0C79B2440716402D4400CF905F4A85?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D378c 2.378c]; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 210 no. 32.

Moore 1979, p. 83 n. 36 lists as examples: Tarquina 623 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/622178EF-9C19-4FBC-B7C9-9C998B231893 310411], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+114%22 Gigantes 114]), Munich 1485 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/6BA7826F-3FBE-4581-A4F0-551E315A11D1 302287]), British Museum B208 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/8F58F440-D701-45DF-9D42-9F05021E88A4 302261], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+120%22 Gigantes 120]). Arafat, p. 14 n. 12, in addition to British Museum B208, also gives as examples Vatican 422 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/6882EE32-BAEE-447D-AE53-B7B62EC55CAF 302040], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+123%22 Gigantes 123] and Vatican 365 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/2DA7C493-0544-4EFB-9A35-C1717118E76F 301601], however Moore says that Zeus is not present in Vatican 365. For British Museum B208, see also Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56]. [[Euripides]], perhaps referring to archaic vase paintings or to Athena's ''peplos'', locates Heracles and Athena fighting near Zeus in the Gigantomachy, see ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+177 177&amp;ndash;179]; ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+1528 1528&amp;ndash;1529]; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus, Heracles and Athena are attacking Giants to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Rightward was conventionally the "direction of victory", see Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]; Stewart, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus mounts a chariot brandishing his thunderbolt in his right hand, Heracles, in the chariot, bends forward with drawn bow and left foot on the chariot pole, Athena, beside the chariot, strides forward toward one or two Giants, and the four chariot horses trample a fallen Giant. When present, Gaia is shielded behind Herakles, apparently pleading with Zeus to spare her children.

On either side of the central group are the rest of the gods engaged in combat with particular Giants. While the gods can be identified by characteristic features, for example [[Hermes]] with his hat (''[[petasos]]'') and [[Dionysus]] his ivy crown, the Giants are not individually characterized and can only be identified by inscriptions which sometimes name the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA56 pp. 56&amp;ndash;57]; Gantz p. 451; Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments of one vase from this same period (Getty 81.AE.211)&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetails.asp?id=79B9C21C-CF52-40F6-85C1-E00C4BBC5D60 10047], ''LIMC''  [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+171%22 Gigantes 171].&lt;/ref&gt; name five Giants: Pankrates against Heracles,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; Polybotes against Zeus,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 pp. 30&amp;ndash;31].&lt;/ref&gt; Oranion against Dionysus,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; Euboios and Euphorbos fallen&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34&amp;ndash;36].&lt;/ref&gt; and Ephialtes.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34&amp;ndash;35].&lt;/ref&gt; Also named, on two other of these early vases, are Aristaeus battling [[Hephaestus]] (Akropolis 607), Eurymedon and (again) Ephialtes (Akropolis 2134). An [[amphora]] from [[Caere]] from later in the sixth century, gives the names of more Giants: Hyperbios and Agasthenes (along with Ephialtes) fighting Zeus, Harpolykos against [[Hera]], Enceladus against Athena and (again) Polybotes, who in this case battles Poseidon with his trident holding the island of Nisyros on his shoulder (Louvre E732).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 451; Arafat, p. 16; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/55A90360-6C37-47D9-A4DA-8A81196212C5 14590], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+170%22 Gigantes 170].&lt;/ref&gt; This motif of Poseidon holding the island of Nisyros, ready to hurl it at his opponent, is another frequent feature of these early Gigantomachies.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 453; Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/14/mode/2up pp. 14&amp;ndash;18]; Frazer 1898a, note to Pausanias 1.2.4 "Poseidon on horseback hurling a spear at the giant Polybotes" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr04pausgoog#page/n68/mode/2up pp. 48&amp;ndash;49].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GR-delphi-tempelfries.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]], North frieze (c. 525 BC). Detail showing gods facing right and Giants facing left.]]

The Gigantomachy was also a popular theme in late sixth century sculpture. The most comprehensive treatment is found on the north frieze of the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at [[Delphi]] (c. 525 BC), with more than thirty figures, named by inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 451&amp;ndash;452; Stewart, pp. 128&amp;ndash;129, plates 195&amp;ndash;198; Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA59 pp. 59&amp;ndash;62]; Morford, p. 73; [https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/Sculpture/ashmolean/context/SiphnianTreasuryNFrieze.htm Drawing: J.Boardman, ''Greek Sculpture Archaic Period'' fig.212.1]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=5559FC6C86C9AB95D17FE6D7ACF0D4C6?name=Delphi%2C+Siphnian+Treasury+Frieze--North&amp;object=Sculpture Perseus: Delphi, Siphnian Treasury Frieze--North (Sculpture)]; ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+2%22 Gigantes 2].&lt;/ref&gt; From left to right, these include Hephaestus (with bellows), two females fighting two Giants; Dionysus striding toward an advancing Giant; [[Themis]]&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N17 p. 101. According to Schefold, p. 62, Themis "appears here in the guise of [[Kybele]]".&lt;/ref&gt; in a chariot drawn by a team of lions which are attacking a fleeing Giant; the archers Apollo and Artemis; another fleeing Giant (Tharos or possibly Kantharos);&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N5 p. 92, reads only Tharos.&lt;/ref&gt; the Giant Ephialtes lying on the ground;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N7 p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of three Giants, which include Hyperphas&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N6 p. 92, others have read Hypertas.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alektos,&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N8 p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; opposing Apollo and Artemis. Next comes a missing central section presumably containing Zeus, and possibly Heracles, with chariot (only parts of a team of horses remain). To the right of this comes a female stabbing her spear&lt;ref&gt;Possibly Aphrodite, has been identified as Hera, but Brinkmann, p. 94 finds no trace of that name.&lt;/ref&gt; at a fallen Giant (probably Porphyrion);&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N22 p. 103, only the last four letters: ''ριον'' can be read.&lt;/ref&gt; Athena fighting Eriktypos&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N10 p. 96; others have read Berektas.&lt;/ref&gt; and a second Giant; a male stepping over the fallen Astarias&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N12 p. 103; others have read Astartas.&lt;/ref&gt; to attack Biatas&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N11 p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and another Giant; and Hermes against two Giants. Then follows a gap which probably contained Poseidon and finally, on the far right, a male fighting two Giants, one fallen, the other the Giant Mimon (possibly the same as the Giant Mimas mentioned by Apollodorus).&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N14 pp. 98, 124&amp;ndash;125. The fallen Giant Mimon against Ares is also named on a late fifth century BC cup from [[Vulci]] (Berlin F2531): Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/46E5041B-1D5E-482A-8D61-D896ECDDF3DA 220533]: [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetailsLarge.asp?recordCount=1&amp;id={46E5041B-1D5E-482A-8D61-D896ECDDF3DA}&amp;fileName=IMAGES200%2FGER22%2FCVA%2EGER22%2E1048%2E1%2F&amp;returnPage=&amp;start= detail showing Mimon and Ares]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/n102/mode/2up p. 56], [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/n103/mode/2up Plate VI].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gigantomachy also appeared on several other late sixth century buildings, including the west pediment of the Alkmeonid [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the east pediment of the [[Old Temple of Athena]] on the Acropolis of Athens, and the metopes of [[Temple F (Selinus)|Temple F]] at [[Selinunte|Selinous]].&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 452.

====Fifth century BC====
The theme continued to be popular in the fifth century BC. A particularly fine example is found on a [[red-figure]] cup (c. 490&amp;ndash;485 BC) by the [[Brygos Painter]] (Berlin F2293). On one side of the cup is the same central group of gods (minus Gaia) as described above: Zeus wielding his thunderbolt, stepping into a quadriga, Heracles with lion skin (behind the chariot rather than on it) drawing his (unseen) bow and, ahead, Athena thrusting her spear into a fallen Giant. On the other side are Hephaestus flinging flaming missiles of red-hot metal from two pairs of tongs, Poseidon, with Nisyros on his shoulder, stabbing a fallen Giant with his trident and Hermes with his ''petasos'' hanging in back of his head, attacking another fallen Giant. None of the Giants are named.&lt;ref&gt;Arafat, pp 12&amp;ndash;15; Cohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyufPUA_S74C&amp;pg=PA177 pp. 177&amp;ndash;178]; Gantz p. 452; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/FF922369-A326-4645-870F-1DEBDFEB9D0C 203909]; ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+303%22 Gigantes 303].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phidias]] used the theme for the [[Metopes of the Parthenon|metopes]] of the east façade of the [[Parthenon]] (c. 445 BC) and for the interior of the shield of [[Athena Parthenos]].&lt;ref&gt;For the Parthenon Gigantomachy metopes see Schwab, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TADtR0uRhkC&amp;pg=PA168 pp. 168&amp;ndash;173], for the statue of Athena see Lapatin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TADtR0uRhkC&amp;pg=PA262 pp. 262&amp;ndash;263], for both see Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 pp. 136&amp;mdash;137].&lt;/ref&gt; Phidias' work perhaps marks the beginning of a change in the way the Giants are presented. While previously the Giants had been portrayed as typical [[hoplite]] warriors armed with the usual helmets, shields, spears and swords, in the fifth century the Giants begin to be depicted as less handsome in appearance, primitive and wild, clothed in animal skins or naked, often without armor and using boulders as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295]; Gantz, pp. 446, 447, 452&amp;ndash;453; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90].

With the beginning of the fourth century BC probably comes the first portrayal of the Giants in Greek art as anything other than fully human in form, with legs that become coiled serpents having snake heads at the ends in place of feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 pp. 82&amp;ndash;83], Gantz, p. 453; Berlin V.I. 3375 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/526CE240-23D4-484D-98DD-C14B1FD5AFE1 6987], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+389%22 Gigantes 389]). Snake-legged Giants may exist in earlier Etruscan art, for example a winged and snake-footed monster depicted on a late sixth century Etruscan hydria (British Museum B62, ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Typhon+30%22 Typhon 30]), might be a Giant, see de Grummond, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sKT6M2rdN9gC&amp;pg=PA259 p. 259], compare with Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA71, p. 71]. For more on snake-legged Giants see Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 pp. 82&amp;ndash;86], and Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions were perhaps borrowed from Typhon, the monstrous son of Gaia and [[Tartarus]], described by Hesiod as having a hundred snake heads growing from his shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109]; Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83]; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+820 820 ff.]. The similarities between Typhon and the Giants are several, both "monstrous children produced by Earth in a spirit of revenge, with the mission to attack and overthrow the gods in heaven, and whose fate they share, blasted by thunderbolts and, in Enceladus' case buried under Sicily." (Ogden, p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt; This snake-legged motif becomes the standard for the rest of antiquity, culminating in the monumental Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC [[Pergamon Altar]]. Measuring nearly 400 feet long and over seven feet high, here the Gigantomachy receives its most extensive treatment, with over one hundred figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155 pp. 155&amp;ndash;156]; Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33]; Smith, R. R. R. 1991, p. 159; Queyrel, p. 49; Pergamon Altar (''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+24%22 Gigantes 24]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fragmentary, much of the Gigantomachy frieze has been restored. The general sequence of the figures and the identifications of most of the approximately sixty gods and goddesses have been more or less established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-39.html Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2005]. The names of the gods and goddesses were inscribed on the upper molding of the frieze, with the exception of Gaia whose name was inscribed on the background next to her head, see Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]. For the total number of gods and goddesses, see Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 35].&lt;/ref&gt; The names and positions of most Giants remain uncertain. Some of the names of the Giants have been determined by inscription,&lt;ref&gt;The names of the Giants were inscribed on the lower molding or, for the walls flanking the stairs where the moulding was omitted, on the background of the frieze between the figures, see Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 34]. Queyrel, p. 52, lists the names of 27 Giants fully or partly preserved in the inscriptions which have so far been found. For Queyrel's identification of the various figures, see Fig. 33, pp. 50&amp;ndash;51.&lt;/ref&gt; while their positions are often conjectured on the basis of which gods fought which Giants in [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]' account.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt;

The same central group of Zeus, Athena, Heracles and Gaia, found on many early Attic vases, also featured prominently on the Pergamon Altar. On the right side of the East frieze, the first encountered by a visitor, a winged Giant, usually identified as [[Alcyoneus]], fights [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G8GiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]; Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p. 156 FIG. 5-79]; Queyrel, pp. 52&amp;ndash;53; Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA39, p. 39],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA59 pp. 59&amp;ndash;60 n. 59]. Supporting the identification of this Giant as Alcyoneus, is the fragmentary inscription "neus", that may belong to this scene, for doubts concerning this identification, see Ridgway.&lt;/ref&gt; Below and to the right of Athena, Gaia rises from the ground, touching Athena's robe in supplication. Flying above Gaia, a winged [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] crowns the victorious Athena. To the left of this grouping a snake-legged Porphyrion battles Zeus&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 35]; Queyrel, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the left of Zeus is Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-39.html Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2005]. Though virtually nothing of Heracles remains, only part of a linonskin, and a left hand holding a bow, the location of the hero is identified by inscription, see Queyrel, pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the far left side of the East frieze, a triple [[Hecate]] with torch battles a snake-legged Giant usually identified (following Apollodorus) as Clytius.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, pp. 56&amp;ndash;58; Ling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4HwfcdfLvCUC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Apollodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt; To the right lays the fallen Udaeus, shot in his left eye by an arrow from Apollo,&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, pp. 55&amp;ndash;56. This figure, now identified by inscription as Udaeus, was previously supposed to be Ephialtes, who Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2] has Apollo shoot in the left eye. Udaeus (earthy)  was also the name of one of the [[Spartoi]], who were sometimes called Gegeneis or Gigantes, see Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=Udaios&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5m88VPDqCrfGsQTU7oLoCw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Udaios&amp;f=false p. 316]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.4.1 3.4.1];  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.5.3 9.5.3]; [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#178 178]. Pelorus (monstrous), the name of another Spartoi, is a possible restoration of the fragmentary inscription "oreus" listed by Queyrel, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; along with Demeter who wields a pair of torches against Erysichthon.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, p. 55; Moore 1977, p. 324 n. 70; McKay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SsEeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93]; [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn 6 (to Demeter)'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/126/mode/2up 25 ff. (pp. 126 ff.)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giants are depicted in a variety of ways. Some Giants are fully human in form, while others are a combination of human and animal forms. Some are snake-legged, some have wings, one has bird claws, one is lion-headed, and another is bull-headed. Some Giants wear helmets, carry shields and fight with swords. Others are naked or clothed in animal skins and fight with clubs or rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109]; Smith, R. R. R. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The large size of the frieze probably necessitated the addition of many more Giants than had been previously known. Some, like Typhon and Tityus, who were not strictly speaking Giants, were perhaps included. Others were probably invented.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt; The partial inscription "Mim" may mean that the Giant Mimas was also depicted. Other less familiar or otherwise unknown Giant names include Allektos, Chthonophylos, Eurybias, Molodros, Obrimos, Ochthaios and Olyktor.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In post-classical art====

[[File:Giulio Romano - Fresco on the north wall (detail) - WGA09554.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the ''Sala dei Giganti'' in the [[Palazzo del Te]], [[Mantua]], c. 1530,  [[Giulio Romano]]]]

The subject was revived in the Renaissance, most famously in the frescos of the ''Sala dei Giganti'' in the [[Palazzo del Te]], [[Mantua]].  These were painted around 1530 by [[Giulio Romano]] and his workshop, and aimed to give the viewer the unsettling idea that the large hall was in the process of collapsing. The subject was also popular in [[Northern Mannerism]] around 1600, especially among the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], and continued to be painted into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', p. 140, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism, meaning and interpretations==

Historically, the myth of the Gigantomachy (as well as the Titanomachy) may reflect the "triumph" of the new imported gods of the invading Greek speaking peoples from the north (c. 2000 BC) over the old gods of the existing peoples of the Greek peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Morford, pp. 82&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Greeks, the Gigantomachy represented a victory for order over chaos&amp;mdash;the victory of the divine order and rationalism of the Olympian gods over the discord and excessive violence of the earth-born [[chthonic]] Giants. More specifically, for sixth and fifth century BC Greeks, it represented a victory for civilization over barbarism, and as such was used by [[Phidias]] on the metopes of the [[Parthenon]] and the shield of ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' to symbolize the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. Later the [[Attalids]] similarly used the Gigantomachy on the [[Pergamon Altar]] to symbolize their victory over the [[Galatia]]ns of [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Morford, p. 72; Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 p. 118], [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 p. 136], [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p. 156]; Lyne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA139 p. 139]; Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt of the Giants to overthrow the Olympians also represented the ultimate example of hubris, with the gods themselves punishing the Giants for their arrogant challenge to the gods' divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA139 p. 139]; Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295];  Gale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA121 p. 121]; Wilkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSp0mnpkE_QC&amp;pg=PA142 p. 142]; Cairns, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9--TlDdWfdsC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]; Commager, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv1znLxFKDQC&amp;pg=PA119 pp. 119], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv1znLxFKDQC&amp;pg=PA199 199].&lt;/ref&gt; The Gigantomachy can also be seen as a continuation of the struggle between Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky), and thus as part of the primal opposition between female and male.&lt;ref&gt;Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] compares the Gigantomachy to a philosophical dispute about existence, wherein the [[materialism|materialist]] philosophers, who believe that only physical things exist, like the Giants, wish to "drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=6EA8185321C1F13AC8EBBFB34B9BDAA7?doc=Plat.+Soph.+246a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 246a&amp;ndash;c]; Chaudhuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHfqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 pp.60&amp;ndash;61].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin literature]], in which the Giants, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], [[Typhon]] and the [[Aloadae]] are all often conflated, Gigantomachy imagery is a frequent occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Lovatt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6bgGIG1ZSkC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]], while urging the acceptance of aging and death as natural and inevitable, allegorizes the Gigantomachy as "fighting against Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Senectute'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0039%3Asection%3D5 5]; Powell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbnz0bljUhoC&amp;pg=PA110 p. 110 "Gigantum modo bellare"]; Chaudhuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHfqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7 n. 22].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationalist [[Epicurean]] poet [[Lucretius]], for whom such things as lightning, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had natural rather than divine causes, used the Gigantomachy to celebrate the victory of philosophy over mythology and superstition.  In the triumph of science and reason over traditional religious belief, the Gigantomachy symbolized for him [[Epicurus]] storming heaven. In a reversal of their usual meaning, he represents the Giants as heroic rebels against the tyranny of Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHfqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 pp. 58&amp;ndash;63]; Hardie 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwblQVvCav8C&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]; Gale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA120 pp. 120&amp;ndash;121], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140]; [[Lucretius]], ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Lucr.+1.62 1.62&amp;ndash;79], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Lucr.+5.110 5.110&amp;ndash;125].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil]]&amp;mdash;reversing Lucretius' reversal&amp;mdash;restores the conventional meaning, making the Giants once again enemies of order and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA140 pp. 140&amp;ndash;141]; Gee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPsh5CsJprYC&amp;pg=PA56, pp. 56&amp;ndash;57].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] makes use of this same meaning to symbolize the victory of [[Augustus]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] as a victory for the civilized West over the barbaric East.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA52 pp. 52&amp;ndash;54], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA167 pp. 167&amp;ndash;168]; Commager, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv1znLxFKDQC&amp;pg=PA199 p. 199]; [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.42 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claudian]], the fourth-century AD court poet of emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], composed a ''Gigantomachia'' that viewed the battle as a metaphor for vast geomorphic change: "The puissant company of the giants confounds all differences between things; islands abandon the deep; mountains lie hidden in the sea. Many a river is left dry or has altered its ancient course....robbed of her mountains Earth sank into level plains, parted among her own sons."&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, p. 195;  [[Claudian]], ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/284/mode/2up 62&amp;ndash;73 (pp. 284&amp;ndash;287)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with volcanoes and earthquakes==

Various locations associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy were areas of volcanic and seismic activity (e.g. the [[Phlegraean Fields]] west of [[Naples]]), and the vanquished Gigantes (along with other "giants") were said to be buried under volcanos. Their subterranean movements were said to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;It has been common for cultures (including the ancient Greeks) to attribute earthquakes and volcanoes to the movements of buried "giants", see Andrews, "Earthquakes" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA62 pp. 62&amp;ndash;63], "Giants" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81], "Volcanoes" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA218 pp. 218&amp;ndash;219]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/2/mode/2up n. 5 pp. 2&amp;ndash;3]; Frazer 1914, [https://archive.org/stream/goldenboughstudy05frazuoft#page/196/mode/2up p. 197]: "The people of Timor, in the East Indies, think that the earth rests on the shoulders of a mighty giant, and that when he is weary of bearing it on one shoulder he shifts it to the other and so causes the ground to quake"; [https://archive.org/stream/goldenboughstudy05frazuoft#page/200/mode/2up pp. 200&amp;ndash;201]: "The Tongans think that the earth is supported on the prostrate form of the god Móooi.

==Named Giants==

Names for the Giants can be found in ancient literary sources and inscriptions. Vian and Moore provide a list with over seventy entries, some of which are based upon inscriptions which are only partially preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 268&amp;ndash;269.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Giants identified by name are:

*'''Agrius''': According to Apollodorus, he was killed by the [[Moirai]] (Fates) with bronze clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Alcyoneus]]''': According to Apollodorus, he was (along with Porphyrion), the greatest of the Giants. Immortal while fighting in his native land, he was dragged from his homeland and killed by Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pindar, he was a herdsman and, in a separate battle from the Gigantomachy, he was killed by Heracles and [[Telamon]], while they were traveling through [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DI.%3Apoem%3D6 6.30&amp;ndash;35], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D4 4.24&amp;ndash;30].&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of Heracles fighting Alcyoneus are found on many sixth century BC and later works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter exhumed the body of the giant Damysos who was buried at Pallene -- Damysos was the fastest of all the giants -- removed the 'astragale' and incorporated it into Achilles' foot using 'ingredients'.

The '''''Grimms' Fairy Tales''''', originally known as the '''''Children's and Household Tales''''' ({{lang-de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen|lead=yes}}, {{IPA-de|ˌkɪndɐ ʔʊnt ˈhaʊsmɛːɐ̯çən|pron}}), is a collection of [[fairy tale]]s by the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm brothers]] or "Brothers Grimm", [[Jakob Grimm|Jakob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]], first published on 20 December 1812. The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 211 unique fairy tales.

== Origin ==
Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of nine children from their mother Dorothea (Née Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed their father’s footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in [[Kassel]]. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.&lt;ref name=zipes&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49698876|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=Zipes|first=Jack,|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the [[University of Marburg]]. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance.  University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away.&lt;ref name=zipes/&gt;

=== Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny ===
Jacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he decided to quit studying law and instead spent his full efforts on German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm received his degree in law at Marburg.&lt;ref name=zipes/&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission.&lt;ref name=jackz/&gt;

In 1808, their mother died and it was hard on Jacob because he took the position in the family as a father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family.

[[Ludwig Achim von Arnim|Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]] were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history.&lt;ref name=zipes/&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:The_Complete_Grimm's_Fairy_Tales_(Book_Cover)_Published_September_1976.jpg|thumb|A copy of the 1976 English edition, containing 210 tales]]

The first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 211 tales. All editions were extensively illustrated, first by [[Philipp Grot Johann]] and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called "Children's Tales", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Tatar]], ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p15-17, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many changes through the editions&amp;nbsp;– such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in ''[[Snow White]]'' and ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' (shown in original Grimm stories as Hänsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. [[Jack Zipes]] believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they “held motherhood sacred”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/12/grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation Flood, Alison. "Grimm brothers’ fairytales have blood and horror restored in new translation", ''The Guardian'', November 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

They removed sexual references—such as [[Rapunzel]]'s innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits—but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, "Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales" p. xxvii-iv, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
The brothers' initial intention of their first book, Children’s and Household Tales, was to establish a name for themselves in the world. After the first book was published in 1812, they began their second volume, ''[[Deutsche Sagen|German Legends]],'' which was published in 1818. The book that started their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacob’s publication of ''German Grammar'' in 1819. This was one year after their publication of the ''German Legends''. In 1825, the Brothers published their ''Kleine Ausgabe'' or "small edition", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.

In 1830, Jacob became a professor at [[University of Göttingen]] and shortly after, in 1835, Wilhelm also became a professor. During these years Jacob wrote a third volume of ''[[German grammar|German Grammar]]'' and Wilhelm prepared the third revision of the ''Children’s and Household Tales''.&lt;ref name=zipes/&gt;

In 1837, King Ernst August II revoked the constitution of 1833 and was attempting to restore [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] for the Kingdom of Hannover. Since Göttingen was a part of Hannover, the brothers were expected to take an oath of allegiance. However, the brothers and five other professors led a protest against this and were heavily supported by the student body since all of these professors were well renowned. Jacob left Göttingen immediately and Wilhelm followed him a few months later back to Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49698876|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=1937-|first=Zipes, Jack,|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kassel, the Grimms devoted themselves to researching and studying. A close friend of theirs, Bettina von Arnim, was also a talented writer. Savigny and others convinced the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, to allow the brothers to teach and conduct research at the University of Berlin. In March 1841, the brothers did just this and also continued to work on the ''[[German Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49698876|title=The Brothers Grimm : from enchanted forests to the modern world|last=1937-|first=Zipes, Jack,|date=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0312293801|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=49698876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'' (Children and Household Tales) is listed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Registry.&lt;ref name=jackz&gt;[https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/marchapril/feature/how-the-grimm-brothers-saved-the-fairy-tale Zipes, Jack. "How the Grimm Brothers Saved the Fairy Tale", ''Humanities'', March/April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history.&lt;ref name=jackz/&gt; The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/23/once-upon-a-time-3 Acocella, Joan. "Once Upon a Time", ''The New Yorker'', July 23, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], the English [[Joseph Jacobs]], and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected Irish tales.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Zipes]], ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection. Joseph Jacobs was in part inspired by his complaint that English children did not read English fairy tales;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 345-5, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his own words, "What [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]] began, the Grimms completed".

[[W. H. Auden]] praised the collection during World War II as one of the founding works of Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, "Reading the Grimms' Children's Stories and Household Tales" p. xxx, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tales themselves have been put to many uses. Hitler praised them as folkish tales showing children with sound racial instincts seeking racially pure marriage partners, and so strongly that the Allied forces warned against them;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, "-xxxix, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, ''[[Cinderella]]'' with the heroine as racially pure, the stepmother as an alien, and the prince with an unspoiled instinct being able to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 77-8 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers who have written about the Holocaust have combined the tales with their memoirs, as [[Jane Yolen]] in her ''[[Briar Rose (novel)|Briar Rose]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, "Reading the Grimms' Fairy Stories and Household Tales" p. xlvi, Maria Tatar, ed. ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three individual works of Wilhelm Grimm include ''Altdänische Heldenlieder, Balladen und Märchen'' ('Old Danish Heroic Songs, Ballads, and Folktales') in 1811, ''Über deutsche Runen'' ('On German Runes') in 1821, and ''Die deutsche Heldensage'' ('The German Heroic Saga') in 1829.

The Grimm anthology has been a source of inspiration for artists and composers. [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Walter Crane]] and [[Rie Cramer]] are among the artists who have created illustrations based on the stories.

{{nihongo|'''Hitoshi Igarashi'''|五十嵐 一|Igarashi Hitoshi|extra=10 June 1947 – 12 July 1991}} was a Japanese scholar of Arabic and Persian literature and history and the Japanese translator of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses (novel)|The Satanic Verses]]''. He was murdered in the wake of [[fatwa|fatwas]] issued by [[Iran|Iranian]] [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] calling for the death of the book's author and "those involved in its publication."

==Early life and education==
Igarashi was born in 1947.&lt;ref name=fukimimi/&gt; He completed his doctoral programme in [[Islamic art]] at the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1976, and was research fellow at the Royal Academy of Iran until the [[Islamic Revolution]] in 1979.

==Career==
Igarashi was an associate professor of comparative Islamic culture at the [[University of Tsukuba]].&lt;ref name=lhelm&gt;{{cite news|last=Helm|first=Leslie|title=Translator of 'Satanic Verses' Slain|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-13/news/mn-1822_1_satanic-verses|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; He translated [[Avicenna]]'s ''The Canon of Medicine'' and [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''Satanic Verses''&lt;ref name=omid&gt;{{cite web|title=One person's story|url=http://www.iranrights.org/english/memorial-case-24015.php|publisher=OMID|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and wrote books on Islam, including ''The Islamic Renaissance'' and ''Medicine and Wisdom of the East''.&lt;ref name=stevenr/&gt;

==Death==
{{See also|The Satanic Verses#Violence, assassinations and attempts to harm}}
In 1989 [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] issued a [[fatwa]], calling for the death of "the author of the Satanic Verses book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Qur'an" and in March 1991 (3 months before Igarashi's death) issued a further fatwa and multimillion-dollar bounty for the death of "any of those involved in its publication who are aware of its content".&lt;ref&gt;''Jomhuri Eslami'', 1991, March 16&lt;/ref&gt; After the issuing of these fatwas, Igarashi was stabbed repeatedly in the face and arms by an unknown assailant and died. His body was found on 12 July 1991 in his office at the University of Tsukuba, [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Ibaraki, Japan]].&lt;ref name=fukimimi&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitoshi Igarashi (1947-1991)|url=http://fukumimi.wordpress.com/2006/07/24/hitoshi-igarashi-1947-1991/|publisher=Fukimimi|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stevenr&gt;{{cite news|last=Weismann|first=Steven R.|title=Japanese Translator of Rushdie Book Found Slain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the case was closed without having determined any individual suspects.{{cn|date=September 2017}} [[Kenneth M. Pollack]] alleged in ''The Persian Puzzle'' that the attack was a covert operation by the Iranian [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]].{{cn|date=September 2017}} In 2010, ''[[Bungeishunjū]]'' reported a rumor{{cn|date=September 2017}} circulating among the Japanese immigration authority that a young and wealthy Bangladeshi committed the murder then flew back to his home country the next day, before it was discovered. According to the unverified rumor, the Japanese government has refrained from applying for the [[extradition]] of the suspect from Bangladesh due to fears of inflaming anger over the ''Satanic Verses'' controversy.

The '''Khitrovo Gospels''' is a Russian [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Gospel Book]] from the late 14th or early 15th century. The book has numerous similarities to the [[Koshka Gospels]], [[Kiev Psalter of 1397]], and other East Slavic manuscripts of the 1390s.

It contains eight full page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]]; four [[Evangelist portrait]]s and four pictures of their symbols (the eagle, angel, lion, and bull), the latter the earliest known Russian full-page examples. The angel is attributed to [[Andrei Rublev]], and is the only illumination usually attributed to him, although some art historians incline to attribute at least all the full-pages miniatures to him.&lt;ref&gt;Popova (op cit) for one&lt;/ref&gt;  All the initials are painted in colour and gold, and many pages are richly ornamented.  The style is elegant with light colours and expressive faces.&lt;ref&gt;Popova, Olga, ''Russian Illuminated Manuscripts'', Thames &amp; Hudson, London (or Braziller NY), 1984, nos 36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospel takes its name from [[Bogdan Khitrovo]], a powerful boyar who obtained the manuscript from Tsar [[Fyodor III]]. Khitrovo bequeathed the gospel to the [[Troitse-Sergieva Lavra|Trinity Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], where Andrey Rublev used to be a monk. After the nationalisation of the monastic library the Khitrovo Gospel was incorporated in the holdings of the [[Russian State Library]] in Moscow.

'''''Kildare'''''   is an un-powered butty boat constructed of riveted iron. It was built around 1913 by Braithwaite &amp; Kirk of West Bromwich to be towed behind a powered craft like President. It is complete with a fully fitted boatman’s living cabin and traditional covering cloths over the main hold area.
It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]], where it is based and can be seen dockside in the Lord Ward’s Canal Arm at the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in Dudley when she is not out on the canal system with [[President (narrowboat)|'' President '']].
Boat is maintained and operated by Friends of President on behalf of the Black Country Living Museum.

The '''Leather Archives &amp; Museum''' (LA&amp;M), based in the [[Rogers Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, "the first formally organized archival collection of artifacts, ephemera, and other materials relating specifically to the history and subculture of the [[Leather subculture|leather community]] was founded by longtime activist [[Chuck Renslow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Gregg.|date=2011|title=Leatherman's man: an interview with Chuck Renslow's biographer Owen Keehmen|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=qth&amp;AN=62807228&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Outlook: Columbus|publisher=LGBT Life with Full Text, EBSCOhost|volume=16|issue=1|page=48|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chicago in 1991."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The LA&amp;M has much information and details on the beginning of the [[leather subculture]] and [[BDSM]] community. The {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, two-story building houses:

* Eight exhibition galleries;
* A {{convert|1425|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} climate controlled archival storage space;
* A 164-seat auditorium;
* A {{convert|600|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} reading library to house the research collections;
* Various other spaces which serve as working space for staff, volunteers and researchers.

In addition to activities in Chicago, the LA&amp;M serves the [[Leather subculture|leather]] world by preserving material from all leather communities, sending "traveling" exhibits around the country, and providing email and telephone research assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foer|first=Joshua|date=2016|title=Atlas Obscura |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/books|publisher=Workman Publishing Company|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Executive Director, Rick Storer participated in a panel discussion entitled "Censorship &amp; Sexually Explicit Materials" at the 2006 GLBT ALMS ([[Archives, Libraries, Museums, and Special Collections ALMS Conference|Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections]]) Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=GLBT ALMS 2006 Conference Program|url=|journal=GLBT ALMS 2006 Conference Program|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the LA&amp;M announced that [[International Mister Leather]] (IML) would be placed in a trust to benefit the museum. All proceeds from IML would go towards preserving leather history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2009, The Leather Archives and Museum at Northern Illinois University acquired the 25-box collection of papers of Robert Davolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galloway|first=A.|date=2009|title=Grants and Acquisitions|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lxh&amp;AN=44337322&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries News|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The Leather Archives and Museum is a library, museum and archives pertaining to [[Leather subculture|leather]], [[fetishism]], [[sadomasochism]], and alternative sexual practices.  The geographic collection scope is worldwide and includes all sexual orientations and genders.  The library collection contains published books, magazines, scholarly publications, films and electronic resources related to the subject matter.  The museum collection contains original [[erotic art]] and artifacts from alternative sex organizations and individuals.  The archival collection contains unpublished papers and records from notable activists, artists, businesses and organizations related to the subject matter.

Notable library resources include the writings of the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], [[Laura Antoniou]], [[John Preston (author)|John Preston]] and [[Larry Townsend]].  Complete sets of [[Drummer (magazine)|Drummer magazine]], [[Bound &amp; Gagged (magazine)|Bound &amp; Gagged]], SandMutopia Guardian and other periodicals are also available in the library.

Notable museum artifacts include original works by [[Tom of Finland]], the largest collection of original [[Dom Orejudos|Etienne]] works in the world, historic sadomasochism and sexual devices, and colors (patches worn on the back of leather vests) from hundreds of existing and former Gay and Lesbian [[motorcycle club]]s, leather clubs and [[sex club]]s.  A complete inventory of photographs taken by Kris Studios, a legendary publisher of physique photographs in the 1950s also resides at the LA&amp;M.

Notable archival collections include the papers of Tony DeBlase, Joseph Bean, Jim Kane, Leonard Dworkin and the records of The National Leather Association, [[International Mr. Leather]], and The Mineshaft.

==Access==
The museum exhibitions and library are open to the public (18 years and older) during regular museum hours.  Archival collections are made available by appointment to bona fide researchers.

==History==
In August 1991, the LA&amp;M was incorporated in the state of Illinois.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ridinger|first=Robert|date=2005|title=Founding of the Leather Archives &amp; Museum|journal=LGBT History, 1988-1992 [serial online]|publisher=LGBT Life with Full Text, EBSCOhost,|pages=33–36|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that date until May 1993, the Leather Archives was, in effect, an idea struggling to take form. In 1993, 1994 and 1995, the LA&amp;M existed as a growing collection and appeared in public only as exhibits at International Mr. Leather in Chicago (plus a couple of abortive attempts to appear on the road). In fact, most members of the Leather Communities of the world - even in North America - were still unaware of the LA&amp;M. In 1996, a storefront home for the LA&amp;M was opened in Chicago. Much larger exhibits were mounted in this space, but the collection outgrew the space very rapidly.

In July 1997, Joseph W. Bean arrived to take on the job of Executive Director of the LA&amp;M. Within three months, he had started a series of changing exhibits and proposed to the Board of Directors a capital campaign to raise funds to buy a building. The capital campaign was announced in December 1997, and met with immediate success.

The LA&amp;M moved into its permanent home in late 1999. The {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building provided for exhibits and the effective storage of the ever-growing collection of leather history.  In January 2002, Joseph Bean retired from the LA&amp;M, and then-volunteer Rick Storer was hired to continue the work started by Bean and the entire leather community.  In August 2004, the leather community made a $225,000 balloon payment to pay off the mortgage of the LA&amp;M. Also during 2004, the exhibit space was expanded from one {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} gallery to a full building tour of eight galleries.

==European travel exhibit==
In 2005, a travel exhibit was for the first time in [[Europe]] for an extended time, traveling the continent organized by Matthias "Leatherbound", European coordinator for the Leather Archives and Museum.  The roadshow has been to many places and been seen by hundreds, showing Leather BDSM Fetish history.  The exhibit arrived in Europe on 30 July 2005. During 26&amp;ndash;30 October 2005, at [[Leatherpride]] in [[Amsterdam]], the travelling exhibit is back at [http://www.rob.nl/ Rob Amsterdam] during this special season of leather, SM and fetish.

'''''Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism''''' is a 2008 book by [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], translated by Benjamin Moser.

== Premise ==

In this book, Lévy argues that in the wake of the failure of [[communism]], the [[Left-wing politics|Western left]] has lost its ideals.  It now fails to uphold universal ideas of justice, fails to sympathize with the oppressed, and has lost its commitment to truth.  The left, according to Levy, has replaced those ideals with a pathological hatred of America, of Jews and Israel, and of freedom and liberty itself.&lt;ref name="kirsch"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kirsch|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Kirsch|title=The God That Failed: 'Left in Dark Times'|newspaper=[[The New York Sun]]|date= September 10, 2008|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-god-that-failed-left-in-dark-times-by-bernard/85499/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy also attempts to debunk what he identifies as the six chief claims of the contemporary European and American left. Liberalism is not merely the free market, it is also about democracy and human rights.  Europe is about more than capitalism.  America is not a fascist nation. Humanitarian intervention is humanitarian, not an imperialist ploy. Israel is not the cause of anti-Semitism. [[Islamism]] is homegrown, not caused by the West, and it threatens the West just as seriously as fascism once did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Lévy|first=Bernard-Henri|authorlink=Bernard-Henri Lévy|title=Big brains and a hairy chest|magazine=[[The Economist]]|date=September 11, 2008|url=http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12202509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary left, according to Levy, believes that any opponent of America or capitalism is good by definition.  It is this reasoning that has led the left to support the dictatorship of [[Saddam Hussein]]; to turn the [[World Conference against Racism 2001]] into a forum for [[anti-Semitic]] hatred, and the Sudanese government's attacks first on southern Sudan and now on the people of [[Darfur]] because that government is anti-American and no anti-American government is to be criticized.&lt;ref name="kirsch"/&gt;

== Genesis ==

Levy, who continues to consider himself a member of the "left", says that the book grew out of a phone call he received from French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] on January 23, 2007 asking for his support in the Presidential campaign.  Levy responded that, "no matter how much I like and respect you, the Left is my family", to which Sarkozy replied, "These people who've spent 30 years telling you to go (expletive) yourself? Do you really believe what you're saying, that these people are your family?"&lt;ref name="romano"&gt;{{Citation|last=Romano|first=Carlin|title=What's Left beyond the totalitarians,|date=September 10, 2008|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24321085-5001986,00.html}} dead link as of January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The phone call set Levy thinking, and he concluded that his abiding commitment to the left is rooted in his "adherence to the freedom and dignity of the individual, anti-fascism, anti-colonialism and 'the anti-totalitarianism that is the legacy of [[May 1968 in France|May '68]]'."&lt;ref name="romano"/&gt;

==Critique==
The "New Barbarism" thesis has been criticised by Dag Tuastad, who argues that the New Barbarian writers tend to equate "terrorism" with "Islam" and "the Arab Mind", explaining the former as irrational, and therefore a threat from backward cultures.  This neo [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach justifies continuation of [[colonialism|colonialist]] violence in the Middle East and elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Tuastad, Dag (2003), "Neo-Orientalism and the New Barbarism Thesis: Aspects of Symbolic Violence in the Middle East Conflict(s)", ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (August 2003), pp. 591-599.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been argued by Paul Richards that the widely-perceived "barbarism" of rebel groups in resource-rich regions (like Sierra Leone), is not so "irrational" once you understand the distorted images of dominated people.  The New Barbarism tends to blame the victims for their own condition, so justifying their hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, P. (1996), ''Fighting for the Rain Forest. War, Youth &amp; Resources in Sierra Leone'', Oxford: James Currey.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6642">[[File:Gus Weyhing pitching.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gus Weyhing, the all-time leader in career hit batsmen]]
In [[baseball]], [[hit by pitch]] (HBP) is a situation in which a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the [[pitcher]]; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB). A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or "crowding", home plate.

This is a list of the top 100 [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]s who have the most [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]] of all time.

Gus Weyhing (277) holds the dubious record of most hit batsmen in a career. Chick Fraser (219), Pink Hawley (210), and Walter Johnson (205) are the only other pitchers to hit 200 or more batters in their careers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">In [[Romanian folklore]], '''Muma Pădurii''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmuma pəˈdurij}}) is an ugly and mean old woman living in the forest. She is the opposite of fairies such as [[Zână]].

==Etymology==
Muma Pădurii literally means "the Mother of the Forest", though "mumă" is an archaic version of "mamă" ([[mother]]), which has a fairy-tale overtone for the Romanian reader (somewhat analogous to using the archaic pronouns like "thou" and "thy" in English). A few other such words, typically protagonists of folk-tales, have this effect.

==Characteristics==
Muma Pădurii is a spirit of the forest in a very ugly and old woman's body. Sometimes she has the ability to [[Shapeshifting|change her shape]]. She lives in a dark, dreadful, hidden little house.

She is thought to attack children, and because of this, a large variety of [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] (''descântece'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) are used against her.

This (step-) mother of the forest kidnaps little children and enslaves them. In one of the popular stories, at some point, she tries to boil a little girl alive, in a soup. However the little girl's brother outsmarts Muma Pădurii and pushes the woman-monster in the oven instead, similar to the story of [[Hansel and Gretel]]. The story ends on a happy note when all kids are free to go back to their parents.

==In modern culture==
Instead of saying "She's ugly", Romanians sometimes say, "She looks like Muma Pădurii".
Muma Pădurii was adapted into a monster for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition: http://www.lomion.de/cmm/mumapadu.php

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13152">{{1r|date=December 2017}}The '''Nintendo Player’s Guides''' are a series of [[video game]] [[strategy guide]]s from [[Nintendo]] based on ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.

==Original format==
The first ''Player's Guide'' was simply called ''The Official Nintendo Player's Guide'', featuring dozens of different NES games. Games covered in some detail with enemy guides, item guides and maps are as follows:

{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''
* ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch Out!!]]''
* ''[[Commando]]''
* ''[[Super Mario Bros]]''
* ''[[Top Gun]]''
* ''[[Ghosts and Goblins]]''
* ''[[Double Dribble (video game)|Double Dribble]]''
* ''[[Zelda II: The Adventures of Link]]''
* ''[[Metroid]]''
* ''[[Rad Racer]]''
* ''[[Ring King]]''
* ''[[Kid Icarus]]''
* ''[[Pro Wrestling]]''
* ''[[Castlevania]]''
* ''[[Excitebike]]''
* ''[[Arkanoid]]''
* ''[[Rush'n Attack]]''
* ''[[Rygar]]''
* ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'',
* ''[[Spy Hunter]]''
* ''[[The Goonies 2]]''
* ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu]]''
{{div col end}}

It was followed in the early 1990s by a number of guides which were produced under the slightly different moniker of ''Nintendo Power Strategy Guides''. These were sent between the then [[bi-monthly]] magazine issues to subscribers or mailed alongside them. [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] games covered by their ''Strategy Guides'' included:

* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''
* ''[[Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos]]''
* ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''
* ''4-Player Extra'', which covered multiple four-player games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]

[[Nintendo]] ceased production of these bimonthly ''Strategy Guides'' due to a lack of important game releases in the pre-holiday seasons of the year.

==Player's Guide==
After converting ''Nintendo Power'' to a monthly format came the more well-known mainstay of ''Player's Guides''. Early guides covered groups of games in one book. These books covered strategy for:

Outside of offering an optional ''Player's Guide'' as a free gift for a ''Nintendo Power'' subscription or subscription renewal, ''Nintendo Power'' did not include ''Player's Guide''s with the magazine. They were, however, made available separately, both through mail-order and at book and video-game shops. Nintendo did also once offer a subscription motive that included four of the aforementioned ''Player's Guide''s instead of only one.

Following these four ''Player's Guide''s, a fifth was released to Nintendo Power subscribers entitled Top Secret Passwords, containing passwords for a wide variety of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games. While initially billed as a subscriber exclusive, this guide was eventually sold at retailers.

==Later era==
In its later years, each ''Player's Guide'' published features one specific game, much like the earlier ''Nintendo Power Strategy Guides''. These ''Nintendo Power'' branded ''Player's Guide''s are available only for Nintendo-published games, but the concept is now emulated by other publishing companies such as [[Dorling Kindersley|Brady Games]] or [[Prima Games|Prima]] for major releases on all [[video game console]]s. Almost all major video games released today will have one or more official Guides associated with them.

While the rise of the [[World Wide Web]] and the increasing availability of free on-line FAQs and walkthroughs has taken away some of the need for commercial strategy guides, there is still a market for them. Guides often feature extensive picture-by-picture walkthroughs, maps, game art, and other visual features that cannot be provided by a bare text online walkthrough.

Among the games that have been given ''Nintendo Player's Guide''s:

==End of an era==
Around mid-2007, Nintendo discontinued the series after the publication of the guide for ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Guides for popular games, including recent releases, are going out of stock at the [http://store.nintendo.com Nintendo Online Store]. No guide was published for ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', or ''[[Endless Ocean]]'', and none have been announced for soon-to-be-released major Nintendo projects.

This end of guide production was apparently due to the &lt;!-- then --&gt;impending switch from in-house publication of ''NP'' to publication by [[Future US]], which occurred in November 2007.

In a recent issue of ''Nintendo Power'', an ''NP'' subscriber wrote to Nintendo, asking about the status of the ''Player's Guide'' series. Nintendo replied that the series is indeed discontinued indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} They also pointed out that Prima Games was their official partner for making strategy guides, which they have been making for the aforementioned recent releases. Additionally, Prima made special strategy guides for ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''. These guides were released exclusively as bonuses for Nintendo Power subscriptions or renewals. These guides even carry the label "Special Digest Version: Supplement to Nintendo Power Magazine".{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">A '''plague doctor contract''' was an agreement between a town's administrators and a "doctor" to treat [[bubonic plague]] patients.&lt;ref name="Gottfried125"&gt; Gottfried, p. 125 &lt;/ref&gt; These contracts are present in European city archives.&lt;ref name="Miskimin65"&gt; Miskimin, p. 65 &lt;/ref&gt; A [[plague doctor]] was specifically hired by a European city or town to treat plague patients, rich or poor, in times of [[epidemic]]s. They were especially designed for the poor that could not afford to pay. Their contractual responsibility was twofold: to treat plague patients and to refrain from treating other types of patients, the latter provision representing an attempt to prevent the spread of disease from plague victims to other patients via a shared physician.&lt;ref name="Miskimin65"/&gt; In many cases these "doctors" were either volunteers, second-rate doctors, or new young doctors starting a career.&lt;ref name="Gottfried125"/&gt; A plague doctor had to serve a long [[quarantine]] after seeing a plague patient in his [[plague doctor costume]].&lt;ref name="Gottfried125"/&gt; He was regarded as a "contact" who by agreement had to live in isolation to be quarantined.&lt;ref name="Miskimin65"/&gt;

== Negotiations ==
The bargaining which always preceded the final contract often consisted of serious negotiations. For example, the town administrators of [[Torino|Turin]] in 1630 were considering the terms of an agreement requested by one Dr. Maletto to become their plague doctor. After much negotiating, they instructed their broker representatives to make a fair and prompt deal as soon as possible with this Dr. Maletto. They were told to get the best possible deal for their city, but to be careful not to lose the opportunity of hiring this plague doctor as it would be difficult to find someone else to perform these dangerous duties at such a low rate.&lt;ref name="Miskimin66"&gt; Miskimin, p. 66 &lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the tough negotiating that went on between plague doctors and infected European towns, there is in [[Pavia]] an original agreement between one [[Giovanni de Ventura]] and the city in their archives that shows a sixteen clause contract that was further amended even after originally written. Clause one originally showed 30 florins per month for pay, but later modified to be net of living expenses. Clause two was originally that the pay was to be given two months in advance, but later modified to monthly. Clause five provided originally a [[severance pay]] of two months, however modified later that to one month's pay. Clause six said ''the said master Giovanni shall not be bound nor held under obligation except only in attending the plague patients'' which was later amplified with ''...the doctor must treat all patients and visit infected places as it shall be found to be necessary.'' Clause seven had to do with full citizenship and the original text was modified with ''according to how he shall behave himself.''&lt;ref name="Miskimin66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Miskimin, p. 67 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; King, p. 371 &lt;/ref&gt;

Bernardino di Francesco Rinaldi obtained a clause in his contract when he was hired as plague doctor by the city of [[Volterra]] in 1527 that said essentially that the city had the obligation to provide Bernardino with all and everything necessary for his life support (i.e. food, water), and for these living expenses to be paid through the city expenditures.&lt;ref&gt; Miskimin, p. 69 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Reprimands ==
In 1527, in the city of [[Prato]], a plague doctor by the name of Stefano Mezzettino was noticed attending other patients without a custodian. The rule was in the plague doctor contract that a custodian must always be with the plague doctor when he visits other patients. This created much danger for the public. He was fined for his illegal act and breaking the rule of the plague doctor contract.&lt;ref&gt; Miskimin, p. 71 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447–8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268–285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum – part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333–359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15–17 Sept 1997 |pages=18–36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383–418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond – a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115–39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985–1986 |volume=21 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K. J. |last2=Mnjama |first2=N. M. |last3=Sebina |first3=P. M. I. M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110–130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136–149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197–222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253–300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mediated Recordkeeping: culture-as-evidence (Leisa Gibbons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbons |first=L. M. |date=2015 |title=Culture in the continuum: YouTube, small stories and memory-making |publisher=Monash University Faculty of Information Technology Caulfield School of Information Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===18th century===
[[File:Isaac Gogel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Gogel|Isaac Gogel]] (1765–1821)]]

In 1795, the [[Batavian Republic]] was proclaimed. The [[Minister of Finance]] [[Alexander Gogel|Isaac Gogel]] argued that a national museum, following the French example of  [[The Louvre]], would serve the national interest. On 19 November 1798, the government decided to found the museum.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;{{nl icon}} Roelof van Gelder, [http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Rijksmuseum/schatkamer.html Schatkamer met veel gezichten], 2000. Retrieved 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nationale Kunst-Galerij''), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened in [[Huis ten Bosch]] in [[The Hague]]. The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch [[stadtholder]]s.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"/&gt;

===19th century===
In 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within [[The Hague]] to the [[Prince William V Gallery]], on the [[Buitenhof (The Hague)|Buitenhof]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1806, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was established by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. On the orders of king [[Louis Bonaparte]], brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to [[Amsterdam]] in 1808. The paintings owned by that city, such as ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'' by [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], became part of the collection. In 1809, the museum opened in the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Royal Palace]] in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1817, the museum moved to the [[Trippenhuis]]. The Trippenhuis turned out to be unsuitable as a museum. In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the [[Mauritshuis]] in The Hague and in 1838, the 19th-century paintings "''of living masters''" were moved to king Louis Bonaparte's former summer palace [[Paviljoen Welgelegen]] in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

{{Quote box

In 1863, there was a [[Architectural design competition|design contest]] for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. [[Pierre Cuypers]] also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place.&lt;ref name="bma1"&gt;{{cite web

In 1876, a new contest was held and this time Pierre Cuypers won. The design was a combination of [[gothic architecture|gothic]] and [[renaissance]] elements. The construction began on 1 October 1876. On both the inside and the outside, the building was richly decorated with references to Dutch art history. Another contest was held for these decorations. The winners were B. van Hove and J.F. Vermeylen for the [[sculpture]]s, G. Sturm for the [[tile tableau]]s and [[painting]] and W.F. Dixon for the [[stained glass]]. The museum was opened at its new location on 13 July 1885.&lt;ref name="bma1"/&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2016}}

In 1890, a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum. As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, the building offers an overview of the history of Dutch [[architecture]] and has come to be known informally as the 'fragment building'. It is also known as the 'south wing' and is currently (in 2013) branded the ''[[Philips]] Wing''.

===20th century===
[[File:Afscheid van Neerlands kunstschatbewaarder Weeknummer 59-49 - Open Beelden - 31178.ogv|thumb|Dutch newsreel from 1959]]

In 1906, the hall for the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' was rebuilt.&lt;ref name="bma1"/&gt; In the interior more changes were made between the 1920s and 1950s - most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995–1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name="bma2"&gt;{{cite web

A renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the 'fragment building' or 'Philips Wing', was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.&lt;ref&gt;''A new art: photography in the 19th century.

In December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation. During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the 'fragment building', including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''The Night Watch'' and other 17th-century masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Building restoration|restoration]] and [[renovation]] of the Rijksmuseum are based on a design by Spanish architects [[Cruz y Ortiz|Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz]]. Many of the old interior decorations were restored and the floors in the courtyards were removed. The renovation would have initially taken five years, but was delayed and eventually took almost ten years to complete. The renovation cost [[euro|€]] 375 million.&lt;ref name="renovationcost"/&gt;

The reconstruction of the building was completed on 16 July 2012. In March 2013, the museum's main pieces of art were moved back from the 'fragment building' (Philips Wing) to the main building. ''[[The Night Watch]]'' returned to the Night Watch Room, at the end of the Hall of Fame. On 13 April 2013, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix.&lt;ref name="bbcopening"/&gt; On 1 November 2014, the Philips Wing reopened with the exhibition [[Modern Times: Photography in the 20th Century]].

== Building ==
The building of the Rijksmuseum was designed by [[Pierre Cuypers]] and opened in 1885. It consists of two squares with an atrium in each centre. In the central axis is a tunnel with the entrances at ground level and the Gallery of Honour at the first floor. The building also contains a library. The fragment building, branded Philips wing, contains building fragments that show the history of architecture in the Netherlands. The Rijksmuseum is a ''[[rijksmonument]]'' (national heritage site) since 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=show&amp;cOBJnr=5680 Monumentnummer: 5680], [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed]]. Retrieved on 6 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed in the [[Top 100 Dutch heritage sites]] in 1990. The Asian pavilion was designed by [[Cruz y Ortiz]] and opened in 2013.

According to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, "Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for a synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture.” With the Rijks, “there’s no cut between old and new; we’ve tried to merge it. We did this by looking for materials that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture."&lt;ref name="archdaily.com"&gt;http://www.archdaily.com/496461/rijksmuseum-revisited-the-dutch-national-museum-one-year-on/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scream''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] created by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and [[Wes Craven]]. Starring [[Neve Campbell]], [[Courteney Cox]], and [[David Arquette]], the film series grossed over $604 million in worldwide box-office receipts and consists of four motion pictures directed by Craven. The first series entry, ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', was released on December 20, 1996 and is currently the highest-grossing slasher film in the United States.&lt;ref name="highestslasher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=slasher.htm|title=Horror – Slasher|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second entry ''[[Scream 2]]'' was released on December 12, 1997 followed by a third installment, ''[[Scream 3]]'', released February 4, 2000. Eleven years after the previous film, ''[[Scream 4]]'' was released on April 15, 2011. The films follow [[Sidney Prescott]], and her war against a succession of murderers who adopt the guise of [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] to stalk and torment their victims. Sidney receives support in the films from town deputy [[Dewey Riley]], reporter [[Gale Weathers]], and film-geek [[Randy Meeks]]. A television spin-off of the film series was launched by [[MTV]] on June 30, 2015. The TV series follows different characters and new storylines which are not connected to the film series.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2129592/scream-movie-awards-trailer/|title=Everybody ‘Scream'|publisher=MTV|access-date=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson's original script was bought by [[Miramax]] and developed under the [[Dimension Films]] label by [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], who recruited Craven to direct. Craven in turn recruited composer [[Marco Beltrami]] to score the film. This team went on to be involved in each film in the series though Williamson was forced to take a smaller role for ''Scream 3'', writing only a brief plot outline due to his commitments to other projects, with [[Ehren Kruger]] replacing him as screenwriter. The series' violence resulted in conflicts with the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|Motion Picture Association of America]] and news media concerning censorship resulting in a reduction of violence and gore in ''Scream 3'' when the [[Columbine High School massacre]] brought increased focus on the media's influence on society. ''Scream'' became notable for its use of established and recognizable actors which was uncommon for [[horror film]]s at the time, yet has since become common in part due to ''Scream''{{'}}s success.

The series, particularly the first two films, has received significant critical acclaim. ''Scream'' has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 1990s by combining a traditional slasher film with humor, awareness of horror film [[cliché]]s and a clever plot. ''Scream'' was one of the highest-grossing films of 1996 and became the highest-grossing slasher film in the world, an honor it still holds. Its success was matched by ''Scream 2'', which not only broke box-office records of the time but was also considered superior to the original by some critics. ''Scream 3'' fared worse than its predecessors, both critically and financially, with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in ''Scream''. ''Scream 4'' also received mixed reviews from critics, although some claimed that it was an improvement over its predecessor.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The film series has been the recipient of several awards, including a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]] and [[MTV Movie Award for Best Performance|MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance]] for Campbell and a Saturn Award for [[Saturn Award|Best Horror Film]] for ''Scream''.&lt;ref name="saturnaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#filmactress|title=Past Saturn Awards|publisher=Saturnawards.org|access-date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvmovieaward1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/1998/|title=1998 MTV Movie Awards|publisher=Mtv.com|access-date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scream'' (1996)===
{{Main|Scream (1996 film)}}
The film series began with ''Scream'', premiering on December 18, 1996 at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Avco theater in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood, California]]&lt;ref name="screampremieres"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wayne|first=Gary|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/meet/moviepremierelocations.shtml|title=Locations of Hollywood Movie Premieres|year=2011|access-date=April 4, 2011&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xhF5cVTe?url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/meet/moviepremierelocations.shtml|archive-date=April 4, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was generally released on December 20, 1996. Based on a screenplay by screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and directed by [[Wes Craven]], creator of the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], ''Scream'' offered a self-referential approach to horror by featuring a cast of characters aware of the conventions/clichés of the [[horror film]] genre and able to use them to survive. The film focuses on teenager [[Sidney Prescott]] as she comes under attack from a mysterious character dubbed [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] while dealing with the anniversary of her mother's murder. The film went on to be a financial success and received considerable critical acclaim for its deconstruction of the horror genre. It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the mid 90s and inspiring an array of imitators.&lt;ref name="ImpactHorrorFilmHistory"&gt;{{cite web |first=Wilson|last=Karina| url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1990s | title=Horror movies of the 1990s: Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, Jacob's Ladder, Scream, The Sixth Sense, New Nightmare, Serial Killers | publisher=Horror Film History |access-date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly notable for its casting of established and popular actors and actresses which was previously uncommon in a horror movie.&lt;ref name="Docu1"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = J.

===''Scream 2'' (1997)===
{{Main|Scream 2}}
The series continued with ''Scream 2'', premiering at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]],&lt;ref name="screampremieres"/&gt; followed by general release in December 1997, again written by Williamson and directed by Craven, released less than a year after the original film. Like ''Scream'', the film features characters aware of the horror genre and the conventions of the horror sequel, mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them. Set in 1998, The film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott, now a college student, as a series of [[copycat crime]]s begin, the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface. The film was financially successful,&lt;ref name="scream2gross"/&gt; and receiving similar critical praise for its deconstruction of the horror film sequel and commentary on the influence of the media in society. The script for ''Scream 2'' was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites, changing the identity of the killers though their motivation remained intact.&lt;ref name="imsdb2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Scream-2.html |title=Scream 2 screenplay by Kevin Williamson |year=1998 |access-date= March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scriptleak2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Scream_2_rewritten_after_script_leak/6845335|title=Scream 2 rewritten after script leak |date=April 30, 2010 |access-date= March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scream 3'' (2000)===
{{Main|Scream 3}}
The series continued with ''Scream 3'', which received its premiere on February 3, 2000 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California&lt;ref name="scream3premiere"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wayne|first=Gary|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/calendar/calendarpast2000.shtml|title=Hollywood Movie Premieres – 2000 |year=2000 |access-date= April 4, 2011&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xhClOPzC?url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/calendar/calendarpast2000.shtml|archive-date=April 4, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was generally released on February 4, 2000. Like previous entries, the film was directed by Craven, but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to his commitment to the short-lived television series ''[[Wasteland (TV series)|Wasteland]]'' and his original film ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]'' (1999), being replaced by [[Ehren Kruger]] who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson. Set in 2001, The film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth about her mother that led to the start of the Ghostface killings. The film, like its predecessors, featured characters who were self-aware of horror conventions, in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy. ''Scream 3'' was considerably less successful than the previous two installments, suffering both financially and critically, commentators noting that the film had become akin to the horror films it originally parodied in ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''. Others were critical of the change in tone, focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence. However, critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy.&lt;ref name="rt3" /&gt;

===''Scream 4'' (2011)===

In July 2008, [[The Weinstein Company]] announced the development of a new sequel, ''Scream 4'', written by Williamson with Craven being secured for the project in March 2010. In May 2010, [[Cathy Konrad]], producer of the original three ''Scream'' films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company alleging they violated an agreement with her company, Cat Entertainment, that gave them first rights to produce all ''Scream'' films.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Belloni | first = Matthew | title = Producer says Weinsteins cut her out of Scream 4 | work = The Hollywood Reporter | agency = Reuters | location = Los Angeles | access-date =December 26, 2010| date =May 20, 2010 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64J0O820100520&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5w3vnDphZ?url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64J0O820100520|archive-date=January 27, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Weinstein Company argued that the agreement requires Konrad's services to be exclusive to the franchise, an argument that Konrad called "false pretext" as the previous films did not require this stipulation.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; Konrad accused the Weinsteins of attempting to force her to walk away without compensation in order to hire a cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka) and cut costs.&lt;ref name="the wrap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/konrad-sues-weinsteins-over-scream-4-17502|title=Konrad Sues Weinsteins Over 'Scream 4'|last=Dickey|first=Josh|work=[[The Wrap]]|date=May 18, 2010|access-date=May 20, 2010&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5psleWf0R?url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/cathy-conrad-sues-weinsteins-over-scream-rights-17502|archive-date=May 20, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by The Weinstein Company.&lt;ref name="ConradScream4"/&gt;

The film underwent reshoots of some scenes in January 2011 with Craven stating that they were to enhance some scenes but that the ending remains untouched, countering criticism that, following a January 6, 2011 [[test screening]],&lt;ref name="test screenings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/early-buzz-scream-4/#more-95326|title=Early Buzz: 'Scream 4'|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=January 7, 2011|access-date=January 27, 2011&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5w3vqKP7u?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/early-buzz-scream-4/|archive-date=January 27, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film may undergo significant changes due to poor audience responses.&lt;ref name="scream4reshoots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/wes-craven-talks-scream-4-reshoots|title=Wes Craven Talks Scream 4 Reshoots |date=February 2, 2011 |access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth installment premiered on April 11, 2011 at Grauman's Chinese Theater with a public release following April 15, 2011.

===Future===
Craven confirmed that he was contracted to work on a fifth and sixth installment of the ''Scream'' franchise, to be made if the fourth film achieved a successful release and reception.&lt;ref name="cravenFuture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/04/28/scream-4-poster-wes-craven/|title=Exclusive: New 'Scream 4' poster, plus an interview with Craven |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |access-date=March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following difficulties with script rewrites on ''Scream 2'', ''Scream 3'' and ''Scream 4'', often with pages only being ready on the day of filming, and the related stress of the situation, Craven stated that he would need to see a finalized version of a script for ''Scream 5'' before committing to the production.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; Williamson also confirmed his contractual obligation for ''Scream 4'' and ''Scream 5'', having submitted concepts for three films leading up to ''Scream 6'', though his contract for the sixth film had not yet been finalized. Williamson indicated that if a ''Scream 5'' were to be made, it would be a continuation of the story of the characters who lived through ''Scream 4'' but that ''Scream 4'' would not include any cliffhangers that led into the potential sequel.&lt;ref name="WilliamsonFuture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18914_Exclusive__Kevin_Williamson_Talks__Scream_4____5__and__6_.html|title=Exclusive: Kevin Williamson Talks 'Scream 4', '5' and '6'|publisher=Fearnet.com|access-date=March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor David Arquette also added his support to the potential future of the franchise, stating "It [the ending] definitely leaves it open," before adding that he would welcome the opportunity to play the character of Dewey in future installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=17014 |title=Exclusive: Will Scream 4 Relaunch the Franchise?|publisher=Shocktillyoudrop.com |work=shock till you drop|date=October 27, 2010|access-date=April 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, executive producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] confirmed that a sequel was possible, saying that despite ''Scream 4'' performing below [[The Weinstein Company]]'s financial expectations, he was still happy with the gross it had accrued.&lt;ref name="WeinsteinFuture"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/05/17/scream-series-harvey-weinstein/| title=The 'Scream' Series Is Far From Over, Says Producer Harvey Weinstein| website=Moviesblog.mtv.com | publisher = MTV | date=May 17, 2011|access-date = May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, when asked about a potential ''Scream 5'', Williamson stated at the time that he did not know, saying "I'm not doing it."&lt;ref name="FutureMarch2012"/&gt;

On September 30, 2013, Harvey Weinstein expressed his dire interest in a fifth installment, stating: "I'm begging him to do the movie and just end it. We've milked that cow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nigel M.

In a June 2015 interview with the Washington Street Journal, Bob Weinstein firmly denied the possibility of a fifth installment or any further continuation of the film franchise, citing the MTV series as the right place for the franchise to find new life. "It's like putting an art-house movie in an art-house theater," Weinstein said. "Where the teens reside is MTV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jurgensen |first=John |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-scream-help-mtv-win-back-missing-teens-can-scream-help-mtv-1435257855 |title=Can ‘Scream’ Help MTV Win Back Missing Teens? |publisher=WSJ |date=June 25, 2015 |access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast and characters==

Craven initially intended to hire talented, but relatively unknown actors who had not yet had a "big break" in the film industry, as he had done with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''&amp;apos;s [[Johnny Depp]] and ''[[Shocker (film)|Shocker]]''&amp;apos;s [[Peter Berg]].&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt; However, the decision was made to cast actors who already had a notable body of work, marking a change from many previous horror films where casting current, popular actors was unheard of. Craven believed their budget was inadequate to secure the actors they were pursuing but felt that Barrymore's presence made people eager to take part and accepting of a lower salary.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Wes Craven| title = Behind the 'Scream' documentary from Ultimate Scream Collection| medium = DVD| publisher = Dimension Home Video| location = United States| date = September 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campbellcoxarquette.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: Courteney Cox, Neve Campbell and David Arquette, the three principal cast members in the ''Scream'' films, in a promotional image for ''Scream 4'']]&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;
[[Drew Barrymore]] initially approached the production herself after reading the script and was signed to play Sidney Prescott.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Diana Rico| title = E! A True Hollywood Story: Scream| medium = Television Production| publisher=E! Entertainment Television| location= United States| date = October 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, her schedule commitments meant she would be unable to remain in the leading role, so she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker who dies early in the film.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; The production felt that killing off an actress of Barrymore's stature early on would be a risk but thought that it would be shocking to the audience and make them believe that no other character was safe.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt; Following Barrymore's changed role, [[Alicia Witt]] and [[Brittany Murphy]] auditioned for the lead and the production also considered contacting [[Reese Witherspoon]]. The role was ultimately given to [[Neve Campbell]] after the director saw her in ''[[Party of Five]]'', believing she could best embody a character who was "innocent" but also able to handle herself while dealing with the physicality and emotions of the role.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt; Though reluctant to undertake another horror film so soon after ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'',&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt; Campbell chose to do ''Scream'' as it would be her first leading role and she "adored" the character, saying "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie."&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt; The production wanted a recognizable face for the role of [[news reporter]] [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]], offering it to both [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]].&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; [[Courteney Cox|Cox]], who was starring in the hit [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Friends]]'' at the time, was not considered due to her history of playing softer, kinder characters. Cox however lobbied hard for the role for that reason, wishing to play a "bitch" character, her efforts ultimately succeeding when she was cast.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt; Actresses [[Melinda Clarke]] and [[Rebecca Gayheart]] auditioned for the role of [[Tatum Riley]] before [[Rose McGowan]] was cast due to her best embodying the "spunky" nature of the character.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; It was believed the collective strong female cast of Campbell, Barrymore, Cox and McGowan would help draw a significant female audience to the film.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt;

Kevin Patrick Walls, who played Barrymore's boyfriend Steve Orth in the opening of ''Scream'', was one of the final candidates for the role of Sidney's boyfriend, [[Billy Loomis]], alongside [[Justin Whalin]] before it was won by [[Skeet Ulrich]].&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="screamultimatecollectionbonus"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = September 26, 2000 | title = Ultimate Scream Collection DVD Bonus Feature Screen Tests | medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Ulrich had a prior working relationship on ''The Craft'' which they believed help them better develop the relationship between Sidney and Billy.&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt; [[David Arquette]] was also approached for the role of Billy Loomis but instead wanted the role of Dewey. The role was described as "[[beefcake|hunky]]" instead of the younger, "goofier" approach of Arquette but Craven appreciated the idea and cast him in the role.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt; [[Matthew Lillard]] was cast by chance as he had accompanied his then-girlfriend to a separate audition where ''Scream'' [[casting director]] Lisa Beach saw him and asked him to audition, where he secured the role of [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]].&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The role of [[Randy Meeks]] was contested between [[Jamie Kennedy]] and [[Breckin Meyer]] with the production favoring Kennedy.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Having no major role prior to ''Scream'', the studio wanted a more prominent actor than Kennedy in the role but the production were adamant that he was the best choice and successfully fought to keep him in.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; [[Roger L. Jackson]], voice of the character [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]], was picked at the end of several weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa. The production had originally intended to only use his voice temporarily but ultimately decided that it was perfect for the role.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = February 4, 2000 | title = Scream 3- Commentary by Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier &amp; Marianne Maddalena | url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was intentionally kept from meeting many members of the cast in all three original ''Scream'' films as it was thought it would help their performance if they could not put a face to the menacing voice. The calls made by his character were genuine phone calls conducted on set by Jackson to the characters, again with the intention of aiding the interaction between his character and the character being "stalked" in a scene.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt;

For ''Scream 2'', Campbell had been contracted for a possible sequel before filming began on ''Scream''. However actors with surviving characters had a sequel option added after it was known which character would be eligible to appear in the next film.&lt;ref name="fangoria162"/&gt; In interviews, the production staff of ''Scream 2'' stated they believed that Barrymore's role in ''Scream'' added an element of respectability to the genre that made actors normally reluctant to engage a horror film, eager to sign on to ''Scream 2''.&lt;ref name="fangoria169"/&gt; Many of the actors involved including Campbell, Cox, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] and [[Jerry O'Connell]] were starring in their own television series at the time making scheduling their availability with the film difficult. Gellar in particular had also recently finished work on another Williamson-penned film, ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) which released two months prior to ''Scream 2''.

==Production==
===Writing===
''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) was conceived under the title ''Scary Movie'' by screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] as an 18-page script inspired by a series of murders by the [[Gainesville Ripper]] that Williamson had seen in a news story and his own experience alone in a friends house after discovering an open window he had not previously noticed. The treatment covered what would become the opening scene of ''Scream'' featuring [[Drew Barrymore]]. Williamson began to expand this script into what ultimately became ''Scream'' because his previous script, ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]'', was in [[development hell]], writing it in only three days in [[Palm Springs]]&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Daniel Farrands (Director) Thommy Hutson (Writer)| title = Scream: The Inside Story| medium = TV| publisher = [[The Biography Channel]] Video| location = United States| date = April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bringing it to his agent in June 1995 to put it up for sale.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; Accompanying the script were two 5-page outlines for potential sequels to the film, Williamson hoping to provide added incentive to buy the script by providing potential for a franchise.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fangoria169"/&gt; Williamson would later claim he wrote the screenplay partly because it was a film he wanted to watch and "nobody else is making it".&lt;ref name="fangoria168"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=Randy |date=January 1998|title=The Screams of Summer |journal=Fangoria |issue=168 |pages=14–18 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was self-referential, featuring characters who watched [[horror film]]s and were aware of the conventions of the genre and featured numerous homages to many preceding horror films which Williamson would claim inspired him, including ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]''.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia |first1=Chris |date=May 1997|title=One Last Scream |journal=Fangoria |issue=160 |pages=20–23 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson was told early on by his agent, Rob Paris, that the saturation of violence and gore in his script would make it "impossible" to sell and following its purchase by [[Miramax]] he was required to remove much of the gorier scenes. However, once Craven was confirmed to direct, he was able to bring much of the excised content back.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt; Williamson intended to remove a scene in the film that took place inside the fictional school's bathroom, feeling it was awkward but Craven salvaged it believing it had potential. Williamson later confirmed that he was glad Craven did so.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; The death of the character [[List of Scream characters#Principal Himbry|Principal Himbry]] was added at the request of producer [[Bob Weinstein]] who noted that there was thirty pages (thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder occurring. This later aided Williamson who was struggling to find motivation for characters to leave a party in the film's finale, now able to use the discovered corpse of the Himbry character.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt; When writing the finale, Williamson was unsure what to cite as a motivation for the killers or whether to give them one at all. Opinions were split between staff on the picture, some who felt that a motive was necessary for the audience to be given resolution while others felt it was scarier without one. Ultimately Williamson decided to do both, giving the character Billy Loomis the motive of maternal abandonment while not giving the character of Stu Macher one, instead having the character jokingly suggest "peer pressure".&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary" /&gt;

Following the release of ''Scream'', Williamson confirmed that he had considered a concept for a sequel where the character Sidney Prescott attends college and a [[copycat crime|copycat]] killer begins stalking her. Dimension Films agreed to pursue a sequel in May 1997, by which point Williamson had already written 42 pages of the new script.&lt;ref name="fangoria169"/&gt; By July 1996, filming began on ''Scream 2'', but his completed script was [[Internet leak|leaked]] on the Internet revealing much of the plot including the finale and the identity of the film's killers. As a result, the production was forced to continue filming with only a partial script as Williamson conducted rewrites, changing much of the finale, the killers victims and the killers identity.&lt;ref name="scriptleak2"/&gt; To preserve the identity of the killer or important plot points being revealed again, the actors were not given the last pages of the script until weeks before shooting and the pages that revealed the killers identity were only provided on the day the scene was shot.&lt;ref name="fangoria169"/&gt; The short production schedule on ''Scream 2'' and his work on other projects meant that Williamson's final script used for the film was detailed in some areas but lacking in others, the intention being for Craven to fill out these scenes on set.&lt;ref name="fangoria171"/&gt;

Williamson was approached by Bob and Harvey Weinstein in early 1999 to pen a script for ''Scream 3'' but at the time he was involved with the writing and directing of his original script ''Teaching Mrs. Tingle''&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; and developing the short-lived TV series ''[[Wasteland (TV series)|Wasteland]]''. Unable to write a full script, Williamson provided a draft outline for the film that involved the filming of the [[film within a film]] "Stab 3", based on the previous film's in-universe murders, that took place in the fictional town of Woodsboro from the original ''Scream''.&lt;ref name="fangoria190"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spelling |first1=Ian|date=March 2000|title=Joining the Scream Team |journal=Fangoria |issue=190 |pages=19–22 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arlington Road]]'' scribe [[Ehren Kruger]] was brought into the production by the Weinstein brothers to develop a script using Williamson's notes, though Kruger admitted that without having been involved with the characters in the previous two films he struggled to write them true to character. Early scripts by Kruger had the character of Sidney Prescott much like "[[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Linda Hamilton]] in ''[[Terminator 2]]''" at which point Craven would intervene to bring the character closer to previous iterations. Kruger admits that Craven had a hand in writing the script though he remained uncredited for it.&lt;ref name="fangoria190"/&gt; Kruger's script would differ in many ways from Williamson's original including the removal of one of the killers and the inclusion of the death of [[Cotton Weary]] who was originally absent from the film. Additionally, the film's location changed from Woodsboro to Hollywood as Kruger believed that the characters should be moving to bigger places from high school, to college to Hollywood.&lt;ref name="fangoria190"/&gt; However, there were also considerations that creating a film containing acts of murder in and around the fictional Woodsboro school would receive negative attention following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] that occurred less than a year before the film's eventual release.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; The film was given a greater emphasis on humor over violence and fared worse than previous installments both financially and critically.

Almost ten years after the last installment, in late 2009,&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; Williamson formulated a concept for a new installment and approached Bob Weinstein who, after hearing his pitch, told Williamson to begin writing a script for what would become ''Scream 4''.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stack|first1=Tim |date=April 15, 2011|title=Scream|journal=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1150|pages=30–37|publisher=[[Time Warner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell initially refused to return to the series for ''Scream 4'' forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her characters absence with Cox and Arquette's characters becoming the focus.&lt;ref name="shocktillyoudrop"/&gt; Early versions of the script involved Campbell's character being attacked and killed in the opening, a key point of contention for Weinstein who had it removed,&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; while another version had Cox and Arquette's character as parents, but this too was removed as it was believed that them having a child would be unworkable in the context of the film.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; After Williamson was forced to leave the production due to contractual commitments to ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', under threat of legal action,&lt;ref name="Scream4WilliamsonLeaves"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris|last=Eggertsen|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/24018|title=Wes Craven Discusses Kevin Williamson 'Scream 4' Controversy, Plans for Fifth Installment |date=March 31, 2011|access-date= March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversy arose in July 2010 when ''Scream 3'' writer Ehren Kruger was brought in by Weinstein to perform re-writes on Williamson's script, about which Craven was outspoken on "losing control" of the story. He would later explain that despite rewrites it was still Williamson's characters and script.&lt;ref name="TotalFilm"/&gt; Weinstein clarified that Kruger was brought in to "punch up" the film's dialog but his involvement with the writing was not to the same extent as with ''Scream 3''.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; To preserve the secrecy of the script and the identity of the film's killer, the cast were only provided with 75 pages of the 140-page-long script.&lt;ref name="the wrap2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/exclusive-mary-mcdonnell-alison-brie-join-scream-4-18952|title=Exclusive: Mary McDonnell, Alison Brie Join 'Scream 4'|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|work=[[The Wrap]]|date=July 1, 2010|access-date=March 23, 2011&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rCuHY344?url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/exclusive-mary-mcdonnell-alison-brie-join-scream-4-18952|archive-date=July 13, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the two previous installments in the series, the script underwent rewrites often, with pages sometimes only ready on the day of shooting.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt;

The script for ''Scream'' (1996), then known as ''Scary Movie'' was released for sale on a Friday and by 8 a.m. the following Monday had become involved in a significant bidding war from several studios, including [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Morgan Creek Productions|Morgan Creek]], with producer [[Cathy Konrad]] bringing it to the attention of [[Bob Weinstein]].&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; The bidding eventually rose to an amount that the choice ultimately came down to [[Oliver Stone]], who was at the time working with [[Cinergi Pictures]], and Weinstein under [[Miramax]].&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"&gt;{{Cite AV media | people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = December 20, 1996 | title = Scream – Commentary by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Williamson agreed to terms with Miramax for $400,000 plus a contract for two sequels and a third, unrelated film, believing their label, [[Dimension Films]], would produce ''Scream'' immediately and without significant restriction.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; [[Wes Craven]] was approached early on to helm the film but he was occupied with remaking ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' and so other directors including [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Danny Boyle]], [[George Romero]] and [[Sam Raimi]] were approached.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Concerns were raised by Williamson and Weinstein when many of the approached directors, having read the script, believed the film to be a comedy, making them reluctant to hire those particular directors, believing they "didn't get it".&lt;ref name="fangoria162"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spelling |first1=Ian |date=May 1997|title=Scream and Scream Again |journal=Fangoria |issue=162 |pages=66–68 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven was approached and passed on the film several times, wanting to move away from the genre, but was enticed once Drew Barrymore became involved, reasoning that it may be different from his previous works if an actress of her recognition was involved.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Ultimately the production of ''The Haunting'', at that time, fell through and Craven was able to take over directing duties on the film.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt; Close to the end of the film's production, the Weinstein brothers had the film's title changed from ''Scary Movie'' to ''Scream'' inspired by the [[Michael Jackson]] song of the [[Scream/Childhood|same name]] as Bob Weinstein felt "Scary Movie" was not suitable when the film also contained elements of satire and comedy.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The change was immediately disliked by both Williamson and Craven who considered it "stupid" but would later remark that it was a positive change.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt;

Following a successful screening with a [[test screening|test audience]] and Miramax executives, both Williamson and Craven were offered a two-picture contract for sequels to ''Scream'', Williamson already having been offered a three-picture deal by Miramax for unrelated films.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt; Bob Weinstein ordered that the film be released on December 20, 1996, a date others were critical of as it was the Christmas season where seasonal and family films were more prevalent.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Weinstein argued this fact was in the film's favor, as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; When ''Scream''&amp;apos;s first weekend takings amounted to only $6 million, it was considered that this release date gamble had failed, but the following week the takings did not drop but increased and continued the following week, leading to a total U.S. gross of over $100 million.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; As ''Scream''&amp;apos;s box-office takings grew, a lawsuit would be filed against Dimension Films by [[Sony Pictures]] who claimed that the title ''Scream'' was too similar to that of Sony's own film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'' (1995). The case was settled out of court with the details remaining secret but producer [[Marianne Maddalena]] would confirm that the production were able to use the current and potential future titles of ''Scream 2'' and ''Scream 3''.&lt;ref name="fangoria169"/&gt;

A sequel was considered in January 1997 after the first film proceeded to gross more than $50 million in its first month. ''[[Scream 2]]'' was [[greenlit]] with a budget of $24 million, and was released before the first film's anniversary.&lt;ref name="fangoria169"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Mark |date=April 1998|title=Super-Secret Scream 2 |journal=Fangoria |issue=169 |pages=20–25 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of the film suffered a significant setback when the script was leaked revealing plot details including the identity of the killers, resulting in the script being modified to change many details.&lt;ref name="scriptleak2"/&gt; In an interview, Craven commented on the rushed schedule for the film, starting in July 1997 with a December release date, with many scenes in the script provided with only a loose outline forcing him to develop scenes on set.&lt;ref name="fangoria171"/&gt; Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the film's production, including ''Scream Again'', ''Scream Louder'' and ''Scream: The Sequel'' before the studio decided to simply use ''Scream 2''.&lt;ref name="WesCravenArtofHorror"/&gt;

''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000) was released just over two years after ''Scream 2'' with Craven again attached to direct the film on a greatly increased budget of $40 million. Shortly before production began on the film, the [[Columbine incident]] occurred and with it came an increased scrutiny on the media and its effect on people, particularly films. There were considerations at the time about whether the studio should continue production of a third installment in the aftermath of the incident but the studio decided to continue, albeit with changes.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; The studio was much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in the film than with previous installments with them pressing for a greater emphasis on the series' humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio demanded that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence but Craven intervened stating that the film should either have the violence present in earlier ''Scream'' films or should be called something other than ''Scream''.&lt;ref name="fangoria190"/&gt; As with production of ''Scream'', Craven would again state in an interview that issues with censorship and the MPAA made him consider leaving the horror genre.&lt;ref name="fangoria189"/&gt;

Production of a new film, ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011) was announced in July 2008 by [[The Weinstein Company]] who approached Williamson about formulating a new script, with the intention of creating a new ''Scream'' trilogy if the fourth film proved successful.&lt;ref name="WilliamsonScriptScream4"&gt;{{cite web| title =Interviewed: Wes Craven | publisher = Entertainment Weekly| date = April 30, 2010 | url = http://scream-trilogy.net/2010/04/interviewed-wes-craven/| access-date = March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2009, Williamson managed to develop an idea for the film and potential sequels and began work on the script.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; The film was given a budget of $40 million and the principal cast were signed to the film in September 2009 followed by Craven as director in March 2010. In May 2010, [[Cathy Konrad]], producer on the original three films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company accusing them of violating an agreement that her company, Cat Entertainment, be given first rights to produce all ''Scream'' films in order to cut costs by getting a cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka, not named in the suit).&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Conrad, the details remaining confidential. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' however, claimed that Conrad received a cash payment and entitlement to a percentage of the profits derived from ''Scream 4''.&lt;ref name="ConradScream4"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Belloni | first = Matthew | title = Weinsteins Pay to Settle Producer Cathy Konrad's 'Scream 4' Lawsuit (Exclusive) | work = The Hollywood Reporter | agency = Reuters | location = Los Angeles | access-date =April 7, 2011| date =April 5, 2011 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/weinsteins-pay-settle-producer-cathy-175058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she was given an executive producer credit on the film. Williamson and Bob Weinstein came into repeated conflict with each other during production with Williamson citing the creative direction of the film as the cause while Weinstein blamed the time constraints on the film's development. Williamson and Weinstein did not speak to each other after Williamson left the production, claiming other responsibilities, and he had not seen the finished version of the film prior to its release.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeeklyWillWein"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=This Week's Cover: The bloody battle over 'Scream 4'|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=April 7, 2011|date=April 7, 2011|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/04/07/scream-4-this-weeks-cover/&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xlvfybc1?url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/04/07/scream-4-this-weeks-cover/|archive-date=April 7, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming for ''Scream'' began on April 15, 1996 and finished on June 8, 1996. Filming was intended to take place in [[North Carolina]], but the location was deemed unsuitable, with scouts unable to find useful locations that would not require extensive building or modification to make fit the requirements of the film. The production instead turned to [[Vancouver, Washington]] and Los Angeles before discovering [[Sonoma county]], California and the areas within, [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]] and [[Tomales Bay]]. The house used by Barrymore's character is situated on Sonoma Mountain Road opposite the house used in the horror film [[Cujo]] (1983). Before filming began, the production approached Santa Rosa High School about using it as Woodsboro High School. The school board insisted on seeing the script and objected to the content of the film's dialog and the foul-mouthed, aggressive character of [[List of Scream characters|Principal Himbry]].&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; The matter reached local newspapers who also raised criticism but there the production received support from students of the school and local residents who supported the economic benefits of the film's presence and others who defended its [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. Opposition to the film came from those who deplored its content of violence against children (teenagers), as the area had suffered the tragic kidnap and murder of [[Polly Klaas]] three years prior.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The matter resulted in a three-hour debate on the topic scheduled for April 16, one day after filming was to begin. Unwilling to be delayed, Craven began filming as scheduled on April 15, with the opening scene of the film featuring Barrymore&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; which took five days to complete.&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission be denied and the production was forced to find another location for the school, ultimately being offered the Santa Rosa community center, which appears as Woodsboro High School in ''Scream''.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;

For the film's killer, Williamson's script had provided Craven only with the description "masked killer", forcing him and his design team to create the [[Ghostface (Scream)#Design|Ghostface]] costume from scratch to conceal the killer's identity. While awaiting permission from Fun World, creators of the Ghostface mask design, Craven had the design team KNB Effects create an alternative that was used in two scenes before being replaced by the original Fun World design once permission was granted.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing it was not "scary", and the studio, upon reviewing the [[dailies]] footage of the opening scene, were concerned that it was progressing in a direction they did not want and there was consideration that Craven could ultimately be replaced.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; To assuage their concerns, the first thirteen minutes of the opening scene were compiled as a [[workprint]], a rough version of the finished film, and upon seeing it, the studio were content to let Craven continue and Weinstein was satisfied that the mask could be scary.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The third and final act of the film, set at a house party, was over forty minutes long and shot at a vacant property in Tomales over twenty-one nights.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The scene was considered the most difficult to shoot, as it took place entirely in one location, yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters, and as it was set at night, meant that production had to halt at daybreak.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt;

After filming completed in June, Craven spent two months editing the final product, encountering repeated conflicts with the [[Motion picture rating system|film rating]] body [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA]] concerning the content of scenes, being forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and violence to avoid an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17]].&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; Though Dimension Films had previously released NC-17 films, the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience and thus they were desperate for a less restrictive [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rating]].&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; For an early scene involving the death of the character [[Casey Becker]], Craven lied to the MPAA by claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense, in order to keep it in the film.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; In interviews, Craven indicated that the conflict was enough that, at the time, he was considering leaving the horror genre.&lt;ref name="fangoria160"/&gt; In total, Craven sent eight different cuts of the film to the MPAA before Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA, believing they misunderstood to which genre ''Scream'' belonged.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; Weinstein explained to the organisation that although he agreed it was intense, it also had comedic elements and satirized its content and was not just a horror film glorifying violence.&lt;ref name="InsideStoryScream"/&gt; The MPAA reviewed their decision and granted the film an R-rating.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;

Production of a sequel, ''[[Scream 2]]'' was [[greenlit]] in May 1997, with filming beginning on September 17, 1997 with a budget of $24 million and wrapping on October 30, 1997. Filming took place largely in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] over four weeks before moving to Los Angeles. [[Agnes Scott College]] in Atlanta and [[University of California, Los Angeles]] were used to represent the fictional Windsor College that appears in the film.&lt;ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/&gt; The opening scene featuring the premiere of the fictional "Stab" film was filmed over three days in the Vista theater on Sunset Drive, Hollywood, the exterior represented by the Rialto theater in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]].&lt;ref name="scream2filmlocations"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Tony|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/scream2.html|title=Scream 2 film locations|publisher=Movie-Locations|access-date=April 4, 2011&lt;!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xhhCNSrr?url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/scream2.html|archive-date=April 4, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of [[Extra (actor)|extras]] present in the scene, its details were leaked onto the Internet shortly after filming completed, which Craven cited as the productions first experience of a major plot leak.&lt;ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/&gt; After his interactions with the MPAA in ''Scream'', Craven sent them a copy of the film that was intentionally much more graphically violent than they were planning to release, featuring [[Omar Epps]]' [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens|character]] being stabbed in the ear three times and an extended scene of [[Randy Meeks]] death. Their idea was that the MPAA would force them to remove the content the production already did not want while keeping the content they did. However, the MPAA gave them an R-Rating for the more violent cut, stating that they felt the message of the film was significant.&lt;ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/&gt; Following a script leak early into filming, security around the production was significantly increased, with a focus on closed [[Set construction|film sets]] and strict restriction on what personnel could be present during filming and have access to the script, and with all present required to sign [[non-disclosure agreements]]. The script was printed on specialty paper to prevent [[Photocopier|photocopying]] and was often destroyed after use.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;

Filming for ''[[Scream 3]]'' began on July 6, 1999 in and around [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]], in the areas of [[San Fernando Valley]], [[Macarthur Park]], [[Beverly Hills]], [[Hollywood Hills]] and [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silverlake]],&lt;ref name="scream3filmlocations"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Tony|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/scream3.html|title=Scream 3 film locations|publisher=Movie-Locations|access-date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt; The isolated home of Campbell's character is situated in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]] and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/&gt; A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through [[movie set]] replicas of locations from ''Scream'' was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven knew he wanted to revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/&gt; Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/&gt; The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of [[List of Scream characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/&gt; So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in [[bandage]]s and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure of what his fate would be.&lt;ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/&gt;

[[Principal photography]] for ''[[Scream 4]]'' began on June 28, 2010 with a budget of $40 million and concluded on September 24, 2010.&lt;ref name="EWScream4Return"/&gt; Filming took place in [[Michigan]] in the areas of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Livonia, Michigan|Livonia]] and [[Northville, Michigan|Northville]]. In January 2011, the film underwent an additional four days of filming to reshoot two scenes, following a [[test screening]] – the opening scene and a later scene that took place in a [[parking garage]] with [[Alison Brie]].&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly1150"/&gt; Amidst criticism that the reshoots meant the film was in trouble and the result of a negative response from the test audience, director Craven countered,
{{Pull quote | They're not reshoots, we had a couple test screenings and we saw two scenes where they had moments you could add to and we just saw a spectacular opportunity...The two scenes were really good, but we saw how they could be spectacular, so we thought, let's just go for it. They were key moments of the script, so we just decided to go back and go for the grand slam on them.&lt;ref name="scream4reshoots"/&gt;}}

Craven also complimented the film's ending, labeling it "kick-ass" and stated that it remained untouched as part of the reshoot process.&lt;ref name="scream4reshoots"/&gt; In an interview, Craven also highlighted that the script was so long they had filmed many scenes which had to be cut from the final film to reduce its running time.&lt;ref name="scream4shootingcuts"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Turek|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=18643|title=Wes Craven On: Williamson Hasn't Seen Scream 4, DVD Deleted Scene, Part 5|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=March 31, 2011|access-date=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The score for the ''Scream'' series was provided by [[Marco Beltrami]], starting with ''Scream'' in what was his feature film debut. Beltrami was brought onto the production of ''Scream'' after Craven's assistant [[Julie Plec]] requested input on the now defunct site "Hollywood Cafe", asking for opinions on was "new", "fresh" and "wonderful" and was provided with Beltrami's name by several people. Craven sent for samples of Beltrami's work and was impressed by what he heard, bringing him to the set to view the first thirteen minutes of the film featuring the introduction and murder of the character [[Casey Becker]]. Craven had Beltrami produce music based on this scene and then demonstrate it, impressing Craven enough to hire him.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beltramiinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saldhana|first=Jorge|title=MARCO BELTRAMI Exclusive interview for ScoreTrack.Net|publisher=ScoreTrack.net|date=July 2003|url=http://www.scoretrack.net/beltrami.html|access-date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Scream'' (1996), the decision was made to intentionally use music to raise the tension in scenes where it was unnecessary when the characters were entering a situation where the audience may expect a killer to suddenly appear, only to not deliver on that expectation, part of the film's theme of playing with horror conventions.&lt;ref name="scream1dvdcommentary"/&gt; Craven and editor [[Patrick Lussier]] provided Beltrami with advice on how best to deliver the music during scary and tense scenes as Beltrami had no prior experience in developing a horror score.&lt;ref name="beltramiinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsospiritbeltrami"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evening with Marco Beltrami on the Phone|publisher=Bsospirit.com|url=http://www.bsospirit.com/entrevistas/beltrami_e.php|access-date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beltrami intentionally avoided conventional horror score styles and approached the film as a [[Western film|western]], taking influence from [[Ennio Morricone]], prolific composer of many western films, in the creation of ''Scream''&amp;apos;s music.&lt;ref name="beltramisite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macro Beltrami Biography | publisher = Marcobeltrami.com|url = http://www.marcobeltrami.com/biography.html| access-date = March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When scoring a theme for the character of Dewey, Beltrami approached him as a sheriff but also as a "quirky" character, using a Morricone-style guitar accompaniment to maintain the Western approach.&lt;ref name="BeltramiScoreRunMovies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mansell|first=John| title = Marco beltrami interview | publisher = Runmovies.eu|work=Soundtrack|url = http://www.runmovies.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=153:marco-beltrami-interview&amp;catid=35:interviews| access-date = April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acoustic cover of [[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s "[[Don't Fear the Reaper]]" plays softly in the background to Sidney and Billy's discussion of their relationship, which analyst Jeff Smith describes as

{{Pull quote | An ironic comment on the brutality we have just seen in the opening sequence. More importantly, however, the allusion to the Blue Öyster Cult classic recasts the song's title by literalizing its meaning. While the title itself invokes the Reaper as a popular symbol for death, the film presents us with an actual person, who not only dresses as the Grim Reaper but also unleashes homicidal vengeance on the other characters of the film. The irony here, of course, is that Billy himself proves to be one of the film's dual slashers and is, in fact, the "Reaper" to be feared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Smith|chapter=Popular Songs and Comic Allusion in Contemporary Cinema |editor1-last=Robertson Wojcik|editor1-first =Pamela| editor2-last=Knight|editor2-first =Arthur|title=Soundtrack available: essays on film and popular music|publisher=Duke University Press |year=2001|page=422| isbn = 0-8223-2800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The theme tune of Sidney Prescott, entitled "Sidney's Lament", became a signature track for the series, variations of the tune appearing across the score of ''Scream'', ''Scream 2'' and ''Scream 3''. The track features a female choral arrangement expressing "sorrow" concerning the fate of the character. In ''Scream'', Beltrami stated that the voice "spoke" for the character, "lamenting" the loss of her mother.&lt;ref name="bsospiritbeltrami"/&gt; In future films it went on to represent the murders and ensuing trauma inflicted on her.&lt;ref name="bsospiritbeltrami"/&gt; Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] called the "haunting" vocals of the track the "voice of the franchise".&lt;ref name="scream1score"/&gt; The track "Sid Wears a Dress" features in the finale of ''Scream 3'' where the sorrowful chorus of "Lament" gradually shifts [[Key (music)|key]] to represent "hope" for the characters future following the resolution of her storyline in what was then the final film in the series.&lt;ref name="scream3score1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream3scoreplusLament"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarry|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=2329|title=Scream 3|date=August 9, 1998|access-date= March 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female voice would be accompanied by a male addition for the first time in "Pied a Terror" from ''Scream 3'' to represent the brother of the character.&lt;ref name="scream3score1"/&gt;

Beltrami returned for ''Scream 2'' (1998), leading the score though there would be a late inclusion by [[Danny Elfman]] in the form of the choral track "Cassandra Aria". In addition, excerpts from the score of ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' by [[Hans Zimmer]] appeared in the film, in particular guitar work by [[Duane Eddy]], for the character 'Dewey', replacing many of the character's related tracks from the original ''Scream'' score. Beltrami later explained that the Zimmer piece was used as a [[Studio recording#The process|scratch track]] for [[test screening]] purposes before the score was finalized. The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio keep the Zimmer piece, reducing "Dewey's Theme", which Beltrami had composed to fill its place, to minor use during more serious scenes involving the character.&lt;ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsospiritbeltrami"/&gt; The Zimmer piece would continue to be used in ''Scream 3'' during scenes concerning the evolving relationship between the characters of Dewey and Gale with Beltrami appropriating and adding his own influence to the piece to blend it into the thematic ''Scream 3'' score.&lt;ref name="scream3score1"/&gt;

For ''Scream 3'', Beltrami employed seven [[orchestrator]]s to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film's score. Additionally, he experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted, unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically.&lt;ref name="scream3score1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scream3scoreplusLament"/&gt;

The original ''Scream'' has remained the most successful of the series accruing a US$173,046,663 gross worldwide and receiving a largely positive critical reception, closely followed by ''Scream 2'' with less than $1 million separating their respective box-office takings. ''Scream 3'' suffered significantly worse domestically and critically than its predecessors, taking only $89.1 million compared to ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2'' with $103 million and $101.1 million respectively. All three installments takings remained relatively equal in other territories with less than $2 million separating them, however Scream 3 remains the lowest financially performing series entry to date. ''Scream'' is currently the 518th highest-grossing movie worldwide, followed by ''Scream 2'' at 520 and ''Scream 3'' at 616.

The ''Scream'' series has received a largely positive critical response since the release of the first film in 1996 with Kevin Thomas of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' calling ''Scream'' "a bravura, provocative sendup of horror pictures" while ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''&amp;apos;s Adam Smith called it "Clever, quick and bloody funny." Other reviews appreciated the shift from the teen slasher films of the 1980s and their "endless series of laborious, half-baked sequels."&lt;ref name="sanfranScream1"&gt;{{cite news | last=Stack | first=Peter|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/12/20/DD42123.DTL | title=Satirical 'Scream' Is Out for Blood&amp;nbsp;— and Lots of It | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=December 20, 1996 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson's script received praise for its "fiendishly clever, complicated plot" which "deftly mixes irony, self-reference and wry social commentary with chills and blood spills."&lt;ref name="Scream1WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Harrington |title=Go Ahead and 'Scream' |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/screamharr.htm |date=December 20, 1996 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was less complimentary saying "[Craven] wants things both ways, capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor. Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix".&lt;ref name="Scream1NYT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |title=Scream |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/scream.html |date=December 20, 1996 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scream'' went on to rank No. 32 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''&amp;apos;s list of the '50 Best High School Movies&lt;ref name="EW50BestHighSchoolMovies"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20215654,00.html#20488998 | title=The 50 Best High School Movies | publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date = December 2008|access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and No. 13 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s 'The 100 Scariest Movie Movements'.&lt;ref name="Bravo100Scariest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml | title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments| publisher=Bravo|access-date=March 23, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml| archive-date=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' would add additional praise to the film, listing it as No. 60 on their list of the '100 Best Films of the Last 13 years'.&lt;ref name="EW100BestFilms"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20206983,00.html#20069697 | title=The 100 Best Films of the Last 13 Years| publisher=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=March 23, 2011| date=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ranked No. 482 on ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''&amp;apos;s 2008 list of 'The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'.&lt;ref name="Empire500Greatest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/4.asp | title=The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time| publisher=Empire|year=2008 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scream'' received several awards in 1996 including the [[Saturn Award]]'s [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Campbell, [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Kevin Williamson and [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] plus nominations for Best Director for Wes Craven and Best Supporting Actor for both Ulrich and Barrymore. The film was also awarded the 1997 [[MTV Movie Award for Best Movie|Best Movie]] by the [[MTV Movie Awards]].&lt;ref name="saturnaward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvmovieaward1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/1996/ |title=1996 MTV Movie Awards|publisher=Mtv.com |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scream 2'' received equally positive critical response with some critics arguing that the film surpassed the original in scares and humor. Both [[Gene Siskel]] and the ''New York Times''&amp;apos; Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to ''Scream''.&lt;ref name="janetmaslinscream2"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Janet|last1=Maslin|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E3DB103CF931A25751C1A961958260 |title=FILM REVIEW; Help! He's Back! Run! Shriek! Tempt Fate!|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 6, 1998|access-date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film failed to achieve the same success as the original in terms of awards however, winning only the 1998 MTV Movie Award for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Performance|Best Female Performance]] for Campbell&lt;ref name="mtvmovieaward1998"/&gt; plus Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Horror Film for Campbell, Cox and ''Scream 2'' respectively.

''Scream 3'' received mostly negative reviews, receiving an aggregated score of 36% on review-site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] compared to ''Scream''&amp;apos;s 83% and ''Scream 2''&amp;apos;s 81% with general consensus that "''Scream 3'' became what the series originally started out [[parody|spoofing]]" and concluded that the series "lost its freshness and originality by falling back on the old horror formulas and [[cliché]]s".&lt;ref name="rt3" /&gt; Of the characters, Roger Ebert said "[the characters] are so thin, they're transparent" but praised Campbell's appearance saying "The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute".&lt;ref name="Scream3RogerEbert"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000204/REVIEWS/2040303 | title=Scream 3 | publisher=Chicago Sun Times|date=February 4, 2000 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all reviews were negative, Kevin Thomas at the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it "Genuinely scary and also highly amusing"&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/04/entertainment/ca-60873 &lt;/ref&gt; and Tom Coates at the [[BBC]] stated that "as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect".&lt;ref name="Scream3BBC"&gt;{{cite web | last=Coates | first=Tom|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/05/24/scream3_2000_review.shtml | title=Scream 3 (2000) | publisher=BBC|date=May 24, 2001 |access-date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scream 4'' received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 59% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 169 reviews, with an average score of 5.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="rt4" /&gt; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a 52 based on 32 reviews.&lt;ref name="mc4" /&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a B minus on an A plus to F scale.&lt;ref name="EWBoxOffice"/&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars, criticizing the film for using the clichéd formula of the slasher genre.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a negative rating of one and half out of four stars saying "the problem is, the movie doesn't really care if we are laughing with it or at it".&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing the film's old-fashioned formula and lack of scare factor.&lt;ref name="EmpireReview"/&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The New York Daily News]]'' thought the film was "dated" and that "relying on obvious clichés doesn't seem ironic anymore, just easy."&lt;ref name="NYDailyReview"/&gt; The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' gave the film a mixed review, writing that "this installment is nowhere near the hip, serrated-edge blast of newness the original was in 1996. Suddenly, it's the horror thriller that, like, your parents are excited about"; however, the review praised director Wes Craven.&lt;ref name="TorontoSunReview"/&gt; Colin Covert of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' gave the film a perfect score of four out of four stars, praising the combination of scares, comedy, and twists.&lt;ref name="StarTribuneReview"/&gt;
The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' wrote that the film is "often amusing" but too long.&lt;ref name="BostonReview"/&gt; Lisa Kennedy from ''[[The Denver Post]]'' stated that ''Scream 4'' "pays plenty of homage to their 1996 original", but that it is not close to its greatness.&lt;ref name="DenverReview"/&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film, stating "It's a giddy reminder of everything that made ''Scream'' such a fresh scream in the first place,"&lt;ref name="EWReview"/&gt; while Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "''Scream 4'' finds a way to live up to its gory past while it carves out new terrors in new ways."&lt;ref name="LAReview1"/&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the movie two out of four stars, criticizing the comedic overtones.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneReview"/&gt; Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the film four out of five stars stating, "The first film is still the best, but this is much more in line with (and perhaps even better than) the fun of ''Scream 2'' and the drab ''Scream 3''. ''Scream 4''&amp;apos;s conclusion also works as a strong series ender."&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/116/1161389p1.html|title=Scream 4 Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=April 13, 2011|access-date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2018}}

Following the release of, then series finale, ''Scream 3'', the three films were collected in "The Ultimate Scream Collection" by [[Dimension Films]] on September 26, 2000, in a [[boxset]] containing ''Scream'', ''Scream 2'' and ''Scream 3''&lt;ref name="dvdUltimateScream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/scream-trilogy-4-discs-9607|title=The Ultimate Scream Trilogy|publisher=AllMovie.com|access-date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus "Behind the Scream" a short documentary about the production of the three films and additional material including [[screentest]]s of actors involved in the films, outtakes and deleted scenes.

Each film contained the additional content found in the Collector's Edition version of their US release including deleted scenes, outtakes, theatrical trailers, music videos and commentary from each respective film's crew.&lt;ref name="dvdreleaseScream1Region2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/scream-103457|title=Scream Region 2|publisher=AllMovie.com|access-date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvdreleaseScream2Region2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/scream-2-106061|title=Scream 2 Region 2|publisher=AllMovie.com|access-date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvdreleaseScream3Region2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/scream-3-103538|title=Scream 3 Region 2|publisher=AllMovie.com|access-date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the three films were collected together in a single pack, again released on February 26 and released as "Scream Trilogy".&lt;ref name="dvdreleaseScreamAllRegion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/scream-107473|title=Scream Trilogy Region 2|publisher=AllMovie.com|access-date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three original films were released individually and in a collection in [[Blu-ray Disc]] format on March 29, 2011, two weeks prior to the release of ''Scream 4'', by [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]], hosting the films in [[1080p]] [[High-definition video|high definition]].

==Soundtrack==
===''Scream''===
The ''Scream'' original soundtrack, released December 17, 1996 by the label [[TVT Records]], features 12 songs by various artists including the original piece "Trouble in Woodsboro"/"Sidney's Lament" from the film's score by [[Marco Beltrami]], most of which appeared in various scenes in the film. The piece "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]" by [[Alice Cooper]] appeared in the film but was replaced with a cover version of the song by [[The Last Hard Men (band)|The Last Hard Men]] on the album. The album was given 3 out of 5 stars by [[Allmusic]]&lt;ref name="scream1soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r248326|title=Scream Original Soundtrack|access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was considered a failure and never charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] despite the success of the film.&lt;ref name="scream1soundtrack2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/album/original-soundtrack/scream/197943#/album/original-soundtrack/scream/197943|title=Scream – Original Soundtrack|access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scream2soundtrack"/&gt;

The ''Scream'' score by Marco Beltrami would be his first time scoring a major film release and the ensuing exposure allowed him to go on to score other blockbuster films such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]''. The score would not be released commercially until July 14, 1998 by [[Varèse Sarabande]] in a dual-pack with the ''Scream 2'' score. However it was found to lack several pieces from the films, with a runtime of only 12 minutes compared to the more common 30–45 minutes normally found in original scores&lt;ref name="scream2score2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mikael |last=Carlsson |title= Scream/Scream 2 |work=Music from the Movies |url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=79 |access-date=January 27, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061116031301/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=79 |archive-date = November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the high reuse fees involved in obtaining the rights to commercially release the music.&lt;ref name="scream2soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=13 |title=Marco Beltrami - Interview |website=Soundtrack.net |date=September 8, 1998 |access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beltrami was considered to have taken inspiration from the synthetic styles of [[Éric Serra]] and other successful scores, the references becoming more pronounced in his score to ''Scream 2''. The theme for the central character Sidney Prescott, "Sidney's Lament" incorporated a "haunting" female solo vocal that would be utilized in other tracks throughout the entire film series.&lt;ref name="scream1score"&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian|last=Clemmensen|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/scream1_2.html|title=Scream/Scream 2 |date=July 21, 1998 |access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score to ''Scream'' received generally positive reviews with Mikael Carlsson labeling it as some of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years&lt;ref name="scream1score" /&gt; while Filmtracks claimed the scores had "[[Cult following|cult status]]".&lt;ref name="scream1score" /&gt;

===''Scream 2''===
The ''Scream 2'' original soundtrack was released December 2, 1997, by [[Capitol Records]] featuring 15 songs in the [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Rock music|rock]] genres by various artists, some of which are represented in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Scream-Music-Dimension-Motion-Picture/dp/B000002TLV |work=Amazon |access-date=August 23, 2018 |title=Marco Beltrami – Scream 2: Music from the Dimension Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spent ten weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200, rising as high as No. 50&lt;ref name="scream2Billboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/album/original-soundtrack/scream-2/273965|title=Scream 2 – Original Soundtrack|access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but received a lower score than its predecessor from the music guide Allmusic, gaining only 2 out of 5.&lt;ref name="scream2soundtrack" /&gt; Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic opined that the soundtrack was an attempt to compensate for the previous film's lack of a hit soundtrack, but failed to do, creating an "uneven" album of songs not "good enough to make [the artists'] own albums".&lt;ref name="scream2soundtrack2"&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Erlewine, Stephen|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/scream-2-r325710/review|title=Scream 2 Original Soundtrack Review|access-date= March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Scream 2'' score was, as in ''Scream'', developed by Marco Beltrami and was released on July 14, 1998 in a dual-pack with the score to ''Scream'' by Varèse Sarabande. The commercially released score was found to be lacking several pieces used in the film, with a runtime of only 17 minutes compared to the more common 30–45 minutes normally found in original scores.&lt;ref name="scream2score2" /&gt; Included in the missing pieces was the track "Cassandra Aria" created by [[Danny Elfman]], described by soundtrack-review site Filmtracks as "a frenzied, choral-enhanced three minutes" that remains unreleased {{as of|2011|3|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="scream1score" /&gt; The length of the released score was considered disappointing and blamed on the fees required to be paid to musicians in order to release their music.&lt;ref name="scream2score2" /&gt; The influence of several other famous composers could be heard in the score including [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Elliot Goldenthal]], [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Christopher Young]]. In particular excerpts of the Hans Zimmer's score to ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', featuring guitar by [[Duane Eddy]], would become a component of the theme tune of the character Dewey Riley.

===''Scream 3''===
The ''Scream 3'' original soundtrack was released on January 25, 2000 by [[Wind-up Records]] featuring 18 songs consisting largely of the [[Heavy metal music|metal]] genre by artists such as [[System of a Down]] and [[Powerman 5000]], some of which are represented in the film. The album fared better than its predecessors, spending fourteen weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200 and reaching a top rank of #32.&lt;ref name="scream3soundtrack1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/album/original-soundtrack/scream-3-original-soundtrack/397361#/album/original-soundtrack/scream-3-original-soundtrack/397361|title=Scream 3 – Original Soundtrack|access-date= March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scoring a 2.5 out of 5 from music guide Allmusic. Reviewer Steve Huey claims that the "high pedigree" of the albums contributors had produced a "pretty listenable album".&lt;ref name="scream3soundtrack2" /&gt;

The ''Scream 3'' score was again helmed by Marco Beltrami who employed seven [[orchestrator]]s and experimented with the recording of instruments in unusual circumstances such as physically and electronically altering the traditional sound of a piano while continuing to include a heavy vocal orchestra in his tracks&lt;ref name="scream3score1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian|last=Clemmensen|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/scream3.html|title=Scream 3 |date=February 29, 2000 |access-date= March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the film's deadline.&lt;ref name="scream3soundtrack2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/index5.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id='%20.%20(2941)%20.%20'scream|title=Scream 3 – Score|access-date= March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like previous scores in the series, the ''Scream 3'' score was released by Varèse Sarabande on February 29, 2000 with a total length of 33 minutes of music, though the album was again found to be missing certain sections of the score utilized within the film.&lt;ref name="scream3score1" /&gt; Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score, again incorporating excerpts of the score to ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' by Hans Zimmer in the track "Sid Wears a Dress".&lt;ref name="scream3score1" /&gt; Music guide Allmusic awarded the ''Scream 3'' score 2.5 out of 5.&lt;ref name="scream3score3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/scream-3-score-r466563|title=Scream 3 [Score]|access-date= March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Scream 4''===
The ''Scream 4: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' was released on April 12, 2011 by [[Lakeshore Records]].&lt;ref name="soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RPQSDC | title=Scream 4: Music from the Dimension Motion Picture | access-date=April 7, 2011 | publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack features 12 songs performed by various artists mainly of the [[Rock music|rock genre]], such as [[Ida Maria]], [[The Sounds]] and [[The Novocaines]]. The soundtrack received mixed reactions, with Gotham News stating that "This new album attempts to retain the style of the old, while speaking to the present content-diluted market. It has some success, but no cigar."&lt;ref name="soundtrack2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gotham-news.com/node/5439| title=KEVIN'S MUSIC REVIEW: SCREAM 4 ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK| access-date=April 4, 2011 | publisher=Gotham-news.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadowlocked criticized the soundtrack's overly light tone, saying that "There's little here that I would have picked for a horror movie."&lt;ref name="shadwolocked"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shadowlocked.com/201104041682/reviews/scream-4-soundtrack-review.html| title=SCREAM 4 SOUNDTRACK REVIEW| access-date=April 4, 2011 | publisher=Shadowlocked.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A score soundtrack was also released, on April 19, 2011 by [[Varèse Sarabande]].&lt;ref name="soundtrack2"/&gt; The ''Scream 4'' score was yet again developed by Marco Beltrami. It received mixed reviews. Filmtracks stating that "Despite the memorable history Beltrami has afforded the franchise musically, Scream 4 is a substantially disappointing continuation of the narrative. He and four assistant composers handle the 2011 entry from a purely functional stance, tackling individual scenes with stylistic remnants of the previous scores while accomplishing absolutely nothing new."&lt;ref name="filmtracks"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/scream4.html| title=Scre4m| access-date=April 18, 2011 | publisher=Filmtracks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soundtrack-review site Sountrackgeek gave the score a highly favorable review: "It is possibly the best score in the Scream series, because it is so incredibly forceful. It wants to be full of action and chills and it is. It's not the scariest of scores, but Scream has never been about the moody scares, but rather the surprise scare and crazy fight/chase scenes. It succeeds and I had a blast listening to this from start to finish."&lt;ref name="soundtrackgeek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soundtrackgeek.com/reviews/scream-4-soundtrack-review.php |title=Scre4m Soundtrack Review| access-date=April 18, 2011 | publisher=Soundtrackgeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Amidst the series' success, it has also been tinged with controversy with claims of real-world [[copycat crime]] inspirations and inducing violence.

In January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case became known as the "''Scream'' murder" and fell under intense media scrutiny after the boys claimed they were inspired by ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''. They would also admit to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree and purchase two [[Ghostface (Scream)#Design|Ghostface costume]]s and a [[Voice synthesizer|voice-changer]] used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist, Madeline Levine, who studied the effect of violence on children, stated

{{Pull quote | There were a whole bunch of reasons why they acted out that way. But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely.&lt;ref name="controversyCBS"/&gt;}}

The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers but the presiding judge, John Cheroske, ordered that evidence pertaining to ''Scream'' be barred and that the case not be referred to as the "''Scream'' murder", refusing media access to the [[courtroom]], intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="controversyCBS"&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 Guilty of Scream Murder |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/07/01/national/main52735.shtml |work=CBS News |access-date=March 27, 2011 |date=July 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 1999, 13-year-old Ashley Murray was stabbed multiple times in the head and back before being left for dead by his then-friends Daniel Gill, 14, and Robert Fuller, 15; he was later found and saved by an elderly man walking his dog. The pair were dubbed the "''Scream'' attackers" after it emerged that they had watched ''Scream'' shortly before the attack and drawings of the Ghostface mask were found amongst their possessions, though their actions were additionally blamed on [[physical abuse]], drugs and exposure to [[black magic]] in their home life.&lt;ref name="controversyBBC"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murphy|first1=paul|title= 'Scream' attackers given six years |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/481914.stm|access-date=March 30, 2011|work=BBC News|date=October 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray, who later testified against the pair, himself stated that he believed the film may have influenced the pair to attack him.&lt;ref name="controversyIndependent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shields|first1=Rachel|title= Victim of 1999 attack by two schoolboys demands Edlington pair get longer term |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/victim-of-1999-attack-by-two-schoolboys-demands-edlington-pair-get-longer-term-1884306.html|work=The Independent|access-date=March 30, 2011|location=London|date=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1999, following the [[Columbine incident]] and increasing news media scrutiny on the effects on society of violence in films, games and other media, the [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce committee]] held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths and the horror genre of films in particular, using the opening scene of ''Scream'' featuring the murder of [[Casey Becker]], as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children.&lt;ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="controversySenate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jenkins|first1=Dr. Henry|title= Dr. Jenkins Senate Testimony|url=http://www.digitalvillage.org/dv_jenkins1.html|work=Digital Village|access-date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, Belgian Thierry Jaradin, 24, garbed in a Ghostface mask and costume murdered 15-year-old Alisson Cambier after she rejected his romantic advances. Jaradin later claimed to police that the murder was premeditated and inspired by the ''Scream'' film trilogy.&lt;ref name="controversyGuardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Osborn|first1=Andrew|title= 'Scream' movies are blamed by teenage girl's copycat killer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/18/filmnews.film|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 30, 2011|location=London|date=November 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year a seventeen-year-old French youth, identified only as Julien, following prior failed attempts with other girls, lured a fellow pupil to a secluded spot and stabbed her to death after showing her his Ghostface mask. French authorities of the time claimed the murder as the third ''Scream'' related killing since 2000.&lt;ref name="controversyGuardian2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Webster|first1=Paul|title= French link murders to cult film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/09/filmnews.paulwebster|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 30, 2011|location=London|date=June 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (2nd century BCE) '''''Shiben''''' 世本 or '''''Book of Origins''''' was the earliest [[Chinese encyclopedia]] of origins, which recorded imperial [[Genealogy|genealogies]] from the mythical [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] down to the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE), explanations of the [[Chinese surname#Origin of Chinese surnames|origin of clan names]], and records of legendary and historical inventors.

==Title==
The title combines the common Chinese words ''shì'' [[wikt:世|世]] "generation; epoch; hereditary; world" and ''běn'' [[wikt:本|本]] "root; stem; origin; fundament; wooden tablet".

The personal name of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 627-650) was ''Shimin'' 世民, and owing to the strict [[naming taboo]] against writing an emperor's name, the ''Shiben'' 世本 title was changed to ''Xiben'' 系本 or ''Daiben'' 代本 (with the ''shi'' near-synonyms of ''xi'' 系 "system; series; family" and ''dai'' 代 "substitute; generation; dynasty").

Although this Chinese title is usually [[transliterate|transliterated]] ''Shiben'', ''Shih-pen'', etc., English translations include ''Book of Origins'' (Needham and Wang 1954: 51; Hume 1955: 279) and ''Generational Records'' (Theobald 2010).

==History==
The origins of the ''Shiben'' text are obscure. The earliest references to it date from the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE). The (111 CE) ''[[Book of Han]]'' bibliography section (''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' ) has a list of  [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE) texts including the ''Shiben'' in 15 volumes (''pian''). The (5th century) ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' says [[Sima Qian]] used the text as a source for his (109 BCE) ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (Needham and Wang 1954: 52). Several Han scholars wrote commentaries to the ''Shiben'', namely [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-6 BCE), Song Jun 宋均 (d. 76 CE), [[Ying Shao]] (140-206), and Song Zhong 宋衷 (fl. 192-210), which was the most widely copied in later editions. 

The bibliography sections of the standard ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' list various ''Shiben'' versions from the Han up through the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), but it was lost at the beginning of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279). During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), scholars collected ''Shiben'' fragments and compiled eight different versions, which were published together (Commercial Press 1957). The eight compilers were [[Wang Mo]], Sun Fengyi 孫馮翼, Chen Qirong 陳其榮, Qin Jiamo 秦嘉謨, Zhang Shu 張澎, Lei Xueqi 雷學淇. Mao Palin 茆泮林, and Wang Zicai 王梓材. With the exception of Wang Zicai's version that rearranged the text in chronological order, the others all have three similar chapters (''pian'') on ''Shixing'' 氏姓 "Clan names", ''Ju'' 居 "Residences [of Rulers]", and ''Zuo'' 作 "Inventors"; but different arrangements of noble genealogies.

The ''Shiben'' was the oldest book in the [[Chinese literature|Chinese literary]] genre of books that record inventions and discoveries, called "technological dictionaries" (Needham and Wang 1954: 51), "dictionaries of origins" or "encyclopedias of origins" (Needham et al. 1986: 212-213). These Chinese [[reference works]] were important to the study of [[natural history]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;This was the genre of lexical works devoted entirely to explaining the origins of things, inventions, customs and affairs—very characteristic of Chinese literature but liable to be puzzling to any Westerners who still cherish the illusion that that civilisation was 'timeless' and 'static'. In fact, it was historical to the core, conscious also of a kind of social evolution from primitive existence, and therefore very much concerned with origins. (Needham et al. 1986: 212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Sui dynasty]] mathematician Liu Xiaosun 劉孝孫 (fl. 605-616) wrote the ''Shishi'' 事始 "Beginning of all Affairs", which contains some 335 entries with names of various material things and devices. It was followed by the (c. 960) ''Xushishi'' 續事始 "Continued Beginning of all Affairs" by the [[Former Shu]] dynasty scholar Ma Jian 馬鑑, with 358 entries. Both of these books refer to Chinese legendary inventors (Needham and Wang 1954:52). Later encyclopedias of origins in this genre were much larger. Two from the Song dynasty were the (1085) ''Shiwu jiyuan'' 事物紀原 "Records of the Origins of Affairs and Things" compiled by Gao Cheng 高承, and the (1237) ''Gujin yuanliu zhilun'' 古今源流至論 "Essays on the Course of Things from Antiquity to the Present Time", which was started by Lin Dong 林駧 and completed by Huang Lüweng 黃履翁. The Qing dynasty scholar Chen Yuanlong 陳元龍 produced the largest encyclopedia of origins, the (1735) ''Gezhi jingyuan'' 格致鏡元 "Mirror of Scientific and Technological Origins" (Needham et al. 1986: 213). 

==Content==
Modern researchers continue to use information from the ancient ''Shiben''. For instance, Chinese ''[[zupu]]'' "[[genealogy books]]" cite information from its elaborate genealogies of the ruling houses and the origins of clan names. 

The early [[history of science and technology in China]] regularly cites ''Shiben'' records about names of the legendary, semi-legendary, and historical inventors of all kinds of devices, instruments, and machines. The textual entries for naming inventors are mostly [[Gnomic poetry|gnomic]] 4-character lines, for instance (Needham and Wang 1954: 51), ''Bo Yi zuojing'' 伯益作井 "[[Yi (husbandman)|Bo Yi]] invented well(-digging)" [to help control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]]]; ''Hu Cao zuoyi'' 胡曹作衣 "Hu Cao invented clothing"; and ''Li Shou zuoshu'' 隸首作數 "Li Shou invented computations". Since many of these inventors were allegedly ministers of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], the value of the ''Shiben'' is not for the actual [[history of science]], but for the systematization that it brings to the body of legendary technological lore (Needham and Wang 1954: 51).

The famous Chinese inventor [[Lu Ban]] or Gongshu Pan (507–440 BCE) and the [[Quern-stone#Rotary hand quern|rotary hand quern]] provides a good example. The ''Shiben'' says ''Gongshu zuo shiwei'' 公輸作石磑 "Gongshu invented the stone (rotary) mill". The (1725) ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' encyclopedia glosses this with a commentary from the ''Shihwu zhiyuan'' encyclopedia or origins (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;He made a plaiting of bamboo which he filled with clay (''ni'' 泥), to decorticate grain and produce hulled rice; this was called ''wei'' 磑 (actually ''long'' 礱). He also chiseled out stones which he placed one on top of the other, to grind hulled rice and wheat to produce flour; this was called ''mo'' (磨). Both originated in the Chou time. (tr. Needham and Wang 1965: 189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''teachings of the Báb''' refer to the teachings of Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad who was the founder of [[Bábism]], and one of three central figures of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. He was a merchant from [[Shiraz, Iran|Shíráz]], [[Persia]], who at the age of twenty-four (on 23 May 1844) claimed to be the promised [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qá'im]] (or [[Mahdi]]). After his declaration he took the title of ''[[Báb]]'' meaning "Gate". He composed hundreds of letters and books (often termed ''[[Tablet (religious)|tablets]]'') in which he stated his messianic claims and defined his teachings, which constituted a new ''sharí'ah'' or religious law. His movement eventually acquired tens of thousands of supporters, was virulently opposed by Iran's Shi'a clergy, and was suppressed by the Iranian government leading to thousands of his followers, termed Bábís, being persecuted and killed. In 1850 the Báb was shot by a firing squad in [[Tabriz|Tabríz]].

==Summary==

The teachings of the Báb can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus.  His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] and other [[Hadith|Islamic traditions]].  While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to [[legislation|legislative]] pronouncements and to philosophical elucidation.  In the philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the [[metaphysics]] of being and creation, and in the legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united.&lt;ref name="saiedi27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the Báb's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms.&lt;ref name="saiedi49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three stages==

===Interpretation of the Qur'an===
In his earliest years the Báb focused on explanations and commentaries on verses of the Qur'an, and on the teachings that represent "true Islam" "until the day of resurrection".&lt;ref name="saiedi40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica_bab"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bāb, Sayyed `Ali Mohammad Sirazi | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bab-ali-mohammad-sirazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, while many Islamic injunctions remained in force in his writings, the Báb claimed that he had the authority to clarify issues relating to the details of Islamic [[Sharia]]. He used this genre against the grain of the established tradition, and he interpreted Islamic texts and traditions to transform, reverse and redefine the conventional meanings.&lt;ref name="saiedi40"/&gt; For example, he tended to diverge from standard Muslim practices by making requirements stricter, such as enjoining additional [[prayer]]s. Discussion of Shí'í millenarian themes were also an important part of the early works and gave his movement an [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] edge; this was the day of the return of the [[Mahdi]], of the victory and dominion of God. They gave the Bábí movement a widespread popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1987|pp=33, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works frequently quoted and provided commentary on passages from the [[Qur'an]]. Unlike classical Qur'anic commentaries by theologians or [[Sufi]]s, however, he usually commented on the meaning of the text letter by letter rather than the meanings of the words and sentences, allowing him to use a sacred text as a point of departure for revelation on a theme distantly related or even unrelated to the Qur'anic passage. The Báb's overall approach to texts and many Islamic doctrines was [[symbol]]ic and metaphorical, and he often rejected literal interpretations of apocalyptic doctrines. While he sometimes used Sufi terminology, his reasoning and approach are distinct from any other school of thought.&lt;ref name="amanat2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | authorlink= Abbas Amanat| title = Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran | publisher =  Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 1989 | pages = 143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Báb taught that the realm of [[language]], as well as all other aspects of phenomenal reality, including natural and cultural objects were symbolic of a deeper spiritual meaning. He taught that everything that exists in the world is a sign that proclaims the sovereignty of [[God]].  In this way, reality is a type of language that consists of words and letters that celebrate the divine revelation in all things.&lt;ref name="saiedi53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative pronouncements ===
The Báb's early doctrines started to change in 1848 when he abrogated Islamic shari'ah law. The Bábí shari'ah included its own form of pilgrimage to the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage#House of the Báb, Shiraz|Báb's house in Shiraz]]. A [[Bahá'í calendar|Bábí calendar]] of nineteen months of nineteen days was defined that started on Persian [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw-Ruz]] and included a four-day intercalary period (to raise the total days to 365, 19 times 19 being only 361). The last 19-day month, falling in March, was the Bábí month of [[fasting]]. Bábí obligatory prayer was different from Muslim practice as well, but was deemphasized compared to [[dhikr]], repetition of various scriptural verses. Laws regulating marriage discouraged [[polygamy]], forbade concubinage, and instituted a year of waiting before a [[divorce]] could be completed.&lt;ref name="Smith34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1987|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws, and the removal of any explicit need for women to veil themselves, potentially improved the status of women to a considerable degree. The Báb, however, never explicitly delineated a principle of equality of the sexes, and other regulations continued the separation of the sexes in public.

The themes of [[jihad]] and [[martyrdom]] also remained important in the Báb's writings. The Báb often wrote theoretically about jihad in the sense of armed struggle, but he never explicitly announced the beginning of a jihad, and he completely undermines the concept of jihad by defining holy war in a way as to make it contingent on impossible conditions, thus nullifying it.&lt;ref name="saiedi21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various Bábí struggles appear to have primarily involved defensive jihad. Martyrdom, an immensely important theme in Shí'ism, was important to Bábís as well, with the siege of the Bábí fort at [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi|Shaykh Tabarsí]] being viewed as a Bábí recapitulation of the events of [[Karbila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1987|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of individual Bábís were martyred in public, usually in ways that inspired admiration or even allegiance to their cause.

Several of the Báb's writings following his return to Chiriq in August 1848 to his execution in July 1850, such as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Kitáb-i-Asmá' (The Book of Names)|Kitáb-i-Asmá']], discussed ritual practices largely unrelated to the actual circumstances of the Bábí community.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; The Báb's writings also contained many codified chronograms, cabalistic interpretations, [[Talismans in the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths|talismanic figures]], astrological tables, and numerical calculations, some of which appear to be similar to the [[Nuqtavi]] cabalistic symbolism. The number [[19 (number)|19]] appears in many parts of the Báb's writings, which also resembles Nuqtavi documents.&lt;ref name="ei_nuktawiyya"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia of Islam |year= 1999 |article=Nuktawiyya | first = H | last = Algar | publisher = Koninklijke Brll NV | location = Leiden, The Netherlands |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/nuk-t-awiyya-SIM_5976?s.num=0&amp;s.q=Nuktawiyya}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some elements found in the Nuqtavi school are confirmed in the writings of the Báb, the literal emphasis that the Nuqtavi school placed on letters as direct elements of divine creation are foreign to the Báb's teachings; his teachings have little to do with the issue of the actual letters or their literal divine character, but instead, concern a mystical world view where the sacred character of human beings is the image of God.&lt;ref name="saiedi53"/&gt;

The Báb also developed legal principles that were intended to be implemented in a theocratic Bábí state if He whom God shall make manifest approved and implemented them.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; The rules of this state included the burning of non-Bábí books and the banning of non-Bábís from residence within its boundaries.&lt;ref name="Smith34" /&gt;

=== Philosophical elucidation===
In his later writings the Báb described the divine or eternal essence to be unknowable, indescribable and inaccessible. The Báb compared the divine to the [[sun]] which remains single, although it appears under different names and forms in the persons, prophets, whom it is in manifested in. Some of these teachings exhibit features common to earlier Shite sects such as the [[Ismaili]]s and the [[Hurufism|Hurufis]].&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ei_bab"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia of Islam |year= 1999 |article=Bāb | first = A | last = Bausani | publisher = Koninklijke Brll NV | location = Leiden, The Netherlands |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ba-b-COM_0079?s.num=2&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=B%C4%81b}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his teaching on the need for successive "prophetic cycles" is completely an original conception.&lt;ref name="ei_bab" /&gt; He also reinterpreted Shí'í eschatological terms, such as "resurrection", "Judgment Day", and "paradise" and "hell".&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; He stated that "Resurrection" means the appearance of a new revelation, and that "raising of the dead" refers to the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion. He further stated that "Judgment Day" alludes to the time a new [[Manifestation of God]] comes, and his acceptance or rejection by the Earth's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="esslemont"&gt;{{cite book |author= Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink=John Esslemont |year= 1980 |title= Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition= 5th |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-160-4 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Báb taught that with his revelation the [[end times]] had come and the age of resurrection had started, and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle.&lt;ref name="amanat_journal"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam | first= Abbas | last = Amanat| authorlink = Abbas Amanat | editor= Stephen J. Stein, ed. | journal = The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism | volume =  III |location = New York | publisher =  Continuum | year = 2000 | pages =230–254 | url = http://bahai-library.com/amanat_resurgence_apocalyptic_islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Shí'í millenarian beliefs were reinterpreted so radically that few of the popular traditional expectations were left.  Another constant theme in his works, especially in the [[Persian Bayán]], is that of [[He whom God shall make manifest]]: a [[messianic figure]] who would come after him. Bábís were exhorted to leave a chair for him at all gatherings and constantly to be prepared to accept him.

'''''The Beetles of the World''''' is a series of books devoted to [[Coleopterology]]. [[Sciences Nat]] published the 24 first volumes; the following volumes and the supplements were published by [[Hillside Books, Canterbury]].

The first book was published in French ''Les Coléoptères du Monde'' in 1981 by [[Sciences Nat]], the author was Jacques Rigout and the book is a revision the genus ''[[Batocera]]''. The author printed the book himself, page by page. A professional bounded the volume. The printing was of 500 copies and it was soon out of print. A second edition was printed by a professional in 1986.

New authors came quickly to publish in the series. There were French specialists such as Gilbert Lachaume (Goliathini), [[Jean-Pierre Lacroix]] (Lucanidae), Patrick Bleuzen (Cerambycidae), Thierry Porion (Curculionidae), [[Roger-Paul Dechambre]] (Dynastidae), [[Marc Soula]] ([[Rutelinae]]) or Patrick Arnaud (Scarabaeidae), but also authorities from Belgium: [[Vincent Allard]] (Cetoniidae); Switzerland: Tiéry Lander (Buprestidae); Mexico: Miguel-Angel Morón (Rutelidae); Italy: Pierfranco Cavazzuti, Pietro Ratti, Achile Casale (Carabidae); and Germany: Karl Werner (Cicindelidae). These authors also frequently published entomological articles in the journal ''[[Bulletin de la Société Sciences Nat]]''.

'''''The Bluejacket's Manual''''' is the basic handbook for [[United States Navy]] personnel.  First issued in 1902 to teach new recruits about [[naval]] procedures and life and offer a reference for active sailors, it has become the "bible" for Navy personnel, providing information about a wide range of Navy topics.  The current version, issued in 2017, is the 25th Edition and is given to all enlistees.&lt;ref name="store"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usni.org/store/books/professional-books-sea-services/blue-and-gold-professional-series/bluejackets-manual-25t | title = Bluejacket's Manual, United States Navy |edition=25th | work = [[United States Naval Institute]]  | accessdate = 2018-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before 1902, the Navy had at least two books for training young men in naval procedure. ''Seamanship'', by Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], was the primary textbook about [[seamanship]] at the [[United States Naval Academy]] but was not used by [[enlisted]] men; many sailors at the time were still illiterate and in any case, the [[oral tradition]]s and procedures of petty officers were the basis of enlisted sailors' education.  ''The Seaman's Handbook'' by [[Lieutenant Commander|LCDR]] [[Stephen B. Luce]], saw general use in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]], but less in the Navy.&lt;ref name="turns100"&gt;{{cite web

1902 saw the first publication of ''The Bluejacket's Manual'', written by [[Lieutenant]] [[Ridley McLean]], as well as the ''Recruit's Handy Book''. Every enlistee received the latter, and by [[World War I]], both were being issued to every recruit. The ''Handy Book'' was discontinued in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="turns100" /&gt;

Some manuals published between 1903 and early 1915 have inconsistent edition numbering.  The 1903, 1905, 1907 and 1908 were considered the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions by the authors and the Naval Institute. In 1914, Franklin Publishing was contracted to publish the 1914 and 1915 book and pamphlet manuals. Because 1914 was the first time Franklin published the manual, they published their edition as the First Edition, the early 1915 version as the 2nd and the late 1915 one as the 3rd. A single numbering system was restored with the 3rd edition, late 1915 Manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weenink|first=R.A.|title=The Bluejacket's Manual|url=http://www.bluejacketsmanual.com/file-BJM/bluejacketsmanual.htm|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centennial Edition===
The 2002 Centennial Edition, also called the 23rd Edition, saw several modifications, including a reversion to its original title: ''Bluejacket's''.&lt;ref name="store" /&gt;  The "Navy Education and Training" chapter was expanded and the "Naval Missions and Heritage" chapter was added.&lt;ref name="store" /&gt;

The current (25th) edition's official author is retired [[Commander]] Thomas J. Cutler, who called the work as a "collaborative effort".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The '''''Book of Giants''''' is an [[apocryphal]] Jewish book which expands a narrative in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Its discovery at [[Qumran]] dates the text's creation to before the 2nd century [[Anno Domini|BC]].

The ''Book of Giants'' is an [[antediluvian]] (pre-flood) narrative that was received primarily in Manichaean literature and known at [[Turpan]]. However, the earliest known traditions for the book originate in Aramaic copies of a ''Book of Giants'' in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].    Furthermore, references are found in: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:1-4, 1 Enoch, and visions in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel 7:9-14]].  This book tells of the background and fate of these [[Nephilim]] in the flood.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Giants From Qumran: Texts, Translation, and Commentary by Loren T. Stuckbruck. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in ancient Jewish tradition==
The Book of Giants has long been known as a work which circulated among the [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] as a composition attributed to [[Mani (prophet) |Mani]]. During the twentieth century a number of finds shed considerable light on the literary evidence for the Book of Giants. The discoveries and publications of Manichaean fragments from the Book of Giants discovered at Turfan have substantiated the many references to its circulation among, and use by the Manichaens. Further identification of the Manichaean Book of Giants was revealed in 1971 when [[Jozef Milik|J.T. Milik]] discovered several Aramaic fragments of Enochic works among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, J. C. (2016). Jewish lore in Manichaean cosmogony: studies in the ''Book of Giants'' traditions. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These fragmentary scrolls were the primary source utilized by Mani{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in the compilation of his book and confirmed the Book of Giants as an independent composition from the second temple period.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Giants From Qumran: Texts, Translation, and Commentary by Loren T. Stuckbruck. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the fragments discovered at Qumran, ten manuscripts of the ''Book of Giants'' are identified by [[Loren Stuckenbruck|Stuckenbruck]].  These fragments (1Q23 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/1Q23-1], 1Q24 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/1Q24-1], 2Q26 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/2Q26-1], 4Q203 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q203-1], 4Q530 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q530-1], 4Q531 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q531-1], 4Q532 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q532-14], 4Q556 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q556-1], 4Q206 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q206-3], and 6Q8 [http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/6Q8-1]) were found in caves 1, 2, 4, and 6 at the site.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Giants From Qumran: Texts, Translation, and Commentary by Loren T. Stuckbruck. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries led to further classification of the Enochic works. In the third group of classification, ten Aramaic manuscripts contain parts of the ''Book of Giants'' which were only known through the Manichaean sources until the recognition of it at Qumran.&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 1 by George W. E. Nickelsburg. 2001. pgs. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much speculation regarding the original language of the Book of Giants. It was generally believed to have had a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin.  Indeed, the discovery of this text in Qumran has led scholars{{whom|date=December 2017}} to believe that the book was initially composed in [[Aramaic]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 1 by George W. E. Nickelsburg. 2001. pgs. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of ''The Book of Giants'' in the Dead Sea Scrolls==
''The Book of Giants'' comprises a group of Aramaic fragments.  Because of the fragmentation of the ''Book of Giants'', it is difficult to know the order of the content. This work is related to the 1 Enoch analogue, which tells a story of the giants that is far more elaborate. Further, the Qumran Book of Giants bore resemblance to the Manichaean ''Book of Giants'' that followed after it. 

''The Book of Giants''&lt;ref&gt; Schiffman, L. H., &amp; VanderKam, J. C. (2008). Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea scrolls. [electronic resource]. Oxford ; New York : Oxford University Press, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; is an expansive narrative of the biblical story of the birth of giants in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis 6.1-4]]. In this story, the giants came into being when the sons of God had sexual intercourse with mortal women who birthed a hybrid race of giants. These giants partook in destructive and immoral actions, which devastated humanity. When [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] heard of this, he was distressed and asked God to bring judgement to the giants. In his mercy, God chose to give the giants a chance to repent by transmitting dreams to two giants named Ohyah and Hahyah who relayed the dreams to an assembly of giants. The giants were perplexed with the dreams, so they sent a giant named Mahaway to Enoch’s abode. Enoch interceded on their behalf and gave tablets to the giants with the meaning of the dreams and God’s future judgment. When the giants heard this, many chose to act in defiance to God. While the [[Qumran]] fragments were incomplete at this point, the Manichaean fragments tell of the hosts of God subduing the race of giants through battle.

Most of the content in the Book of Giants is derived out of 1 Enoch 7:3-6 . This passage sheds light on the characterizing features of the Giants. It reveals that the Giants were born of the sons of god and daughters of man. The giants began to devour the works of men and went on to kill and consume them. They also sinned against the birds and beasts of the sky, creeping things and the fish of the sea. It also mentions that the giants devoured the flesh of one another and they drank the blood. [7] This act of drinking blood would have horrified the people.[8]There is further evidence of this in Leviticus 17:10-16. In this passage there are strict rules regarding the blood of the animal. In verse 10 and 11, it says, “I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood and I will cut them off from the people. For the life of the creature is in the blood.”

The text relates how some giants, named Ohya, Hahya, and Mahway, sons of the fallen angels, have some dreams that foresee the biblical Flood.[9] A brief mention of one of these giants, Ohya, is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Nidah, Ch 9), where it is said "סיחון ועוג אחי הוו דאמר מר סיחון ועוג בני אחיה בר שמחזאי הוו" ("Sihon and Og [from the Book of Numbers] were brothers, as they were the sons of Ohia the son of Samhazai [one of the leaders of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch])". The version found at Qumran also describes the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba.

==Interpretive issues between Qumran and Turfan==
Although we can glean much information out of the fragments of the narrative, there are still many unknowns and issues that scholars heavily debate. Firstly, the authorship of the ''Book of Giants'' is still questionable.  As mentioned earlier, there was very little usage of this manuscript which leaves scholars with many queries. The Qumran discoveries ruled out the Manicheans as being the composers of the ''Book of Giants''. However the usage of 1 [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] assumes that the basis of the text would also fall under an unknown author or the idea that it was a [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudegraph]] text. This leads scholars to question the originality and legitimacy of this book.

The books of Daniel and 1 Enoch both have similarities to Ohyah and Hahyah’s (two giants) visions. Both have writings of the king of heaven sitting on his throne, and the Aramaic text A12 has similar writings. However, the text differs from these two as God comes down from heaven, but the basic premise remains the same. There are different versions of the ''Book of Giants'', which can cause issues. Furthermore, though both versions are said to derive from the same script, both are very different in their content. The Manichaean version has many differences from the Aramaic version and does not have the same visions in it.

According to [[Jozef Milik|J.T. Milik]], the Book of Giants is believed to have been a part of the Pentateuch of Enoch along with [[Book of Enoch|the Book of Watchers, the Book of Dreams, the Epistle of Enoch and the Astronomical Book]]. All of these would have been significant from the beginning of the first century. However, during the [[Christian era]], this collection was altered and this narrative was replaced by the [[Book of Parables]]. The sparse copies of these books could have been due to a lack of overall use after it was replaced by the Book of Parables.&lt;ref&gt;The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4 edited by J.

'''''The Canadian Encyclopedia''''' (abbreviated as ''TCE'') is a source of information on [[Canada]] published by [[Historica Canada]] of Toronto. Articles appear in [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]]. It is available online, at no cost. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' includes 14,000 articles in each language on numerous subjects including history, popular culture, events, people, places, politics, arts, [[First Nations]], sports and science.

The website also provides access to the ''Encyclopedia of Music in Canada'', The ''Canadian Encyclopedia Junior Edition'', ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine articles and ''Timelines of Canadian history''.

==History==
Canada had been without a national [[encyclopedia]] since the 1957 ''[[Encyclopedia Canadiana]]''. When looking through the Canadian entries in existing encyclopedias such as Random House, [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalist]] [[Mel Hurtig]] found blatant errors (e.g., [[Brian Mulroney]] was a famous Liberal prime minister) and omissions. In response, in the 1980s he launched a project to create a wholly new Canadian encyclopedia with support from [[Alberta Premier]] [[Peter Lougheed]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/how-canada-got-an-encyclopedia-to-call-its-own/article1747473/ "How Canada got an encyclopedia to call its own"] Jane Taber, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. 7 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Editor-in-Chief [[James Harley Marsh]] recruited more than 3,000 authors to write for it.

They made index cards for every fact in the encyclopedia, signed off by the researcher, and sourced from three sources. They had to have every article read by three outside readers. Then the whole thing was proofread by an independent source.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/citizen-mel-part-1-2-1.2920524|title=Citizen Mel, Part 1 &amp; 2|publisher=[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]|author=Paul Kennedy|date=June 28, 2012|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were over 3,000 people who contributed to the content and accuracy of the encyclopedia's entries.

The first edition of ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' was published in three volumes in 1985 ({{ISBN|0-88830-269-X}}) for $125/set and sold out within days of publication –  a Canadian bestseller (150,000 sets sold in six months). A revised and expanded edition (in four volumes) was released in 1988 ({{ISBN|0-88830-326-2}}) and sold out as well. It was the first encyclopedia in the world to use a computer to help compile, typeset, design, and print it. It was encoded in a [[markup language]] precursor of HTML.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

In September 1990, Hurtig published the five-volume ''Junior Encyclopedia of Canada'' ({{ISBN|0-88830-334-3}}), the first encyclopedia for young Canadians.

Hurtig sold his publishing company to [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]] in May 1991 and with it the encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mel-hurtig/ "Mel Hurtig"] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, McClelland &amp; Stewart published the first digital [[CD-ROM]] edition ({{ISBN|0-7710-2041-4}}). Today, Historica Canada, a not-for-profit foundation, publishes the encyclopedia for free online.

'''''The Tower of London''''' is a novel by [[William Harrison Ainsworth]] serially published in 1840. It is a historical romance that describes the history of [[Lady Jane Grey]] from her short-lived time as Queen of England to her execution.

==Background==
During 1840, Ainsworth was busy writing the serial ''The Tower of London'' while writing a serial for ''Guy Fawkes'' and while planning to start his own magazine. Both novels began their publication in January 1840, with ''The Tower of London'' being published on its own until December 1840. Ainsworth celebrated the conclusions of ''The Tower of London'' with a large dinner party near the printers of his works, Bradbury and Evans, at the Sussex Hotel. The work was illustrated by George Cruikshank.&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 pp. 228, 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[Image:Tower of London, April 2006.jpg|right|thumb|The Tower of London seen from the River Thames]]
The plot begins with Lady Jane Grey, wife of Guilford Dudley and daughter-in-law to the Duke of Northumberland, as she enters the [[Tower of London]] on 10 July 1553. Prior to her entrance into the Tower, she ruled as Queen of England for nine days after she and her husband were put on the throne by the Duke of Northumberland. Soon after, Mary I was able to take control of England and sent the Duke to be executed. Dudley, to gain back the kingdom, formed a rebellion, which results in failure and the imprisonment of both himself and his wife. After the imprisonment, Simon Renard, the Spanish Ambassador to England, arranges a marriage between Mary and Philip of Spain to bring a Catholic take over of England.&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the book alternate between historical background and the plot of Lady Jane. In Book II, incidents throughout the history of England from William the Conqueror to the 1820 Cato Street conspiracy are mentioned. The novel returns to Lady Jane busying herself with prayer as she awaits her execution with her only hope for freedom is to become a Catholic.&lt;ref name="Carver p. 241"/&gt; There are conspiracies over Mary's rule of England, which come from those who supported the imprisoned Lady Jane and also those who wish to put Elizabeth, the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII, on the throne. However, neither of these two sides succeed before the novel ends, and Lady Jane is executed.&lt;ref&gt;Worth 1972 pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illustrations===
The novel is illustrated with 40 engravings and 58 woodcuts by Cruikshank. The illustrations depict moments from the story while the woodcuts show off architectural features related to the Tower. Ainsworth was grateful for the illustrations to the novel,&lt;ref name="Carver p. 241"&gt;Carver 2003 p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote in the preface that "it was no slight satisfaction to him, that circumstances at length enabled him to carry into effect his favourite project, in conjunction with the inimitable artist whose designs accompany the work."&lt;ref name="Ainsworth p. ix"&gt;Ainsworth 1841 p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The novel begins with a preface which explains:&lt;ref name="Carver p. 241"/&gt; "It has been, for years, the cherished wish of the writer of the following pages, to make the Tower of London&amp;nbsp;– the proudest monument of antiquity, considered with reference to its historical associates, which this country, or any other possess&amp;nbsp;– the groundwork of a romance".&lt;ref name="Ainsworth p. ix"/&gt; He continues by describing his idea for the Tower itself, "Desirous of exhibiting the Tower in its triple light of a palace, a prison, and a fortress, the Author has shaped his story with reference to that end; and he has also endeavoured to contrive such a series of incidents as should naturally introduce every reflect of the old pile&amp;nbsp;– its towers, chapels, halls, chambers, gateways, arches, and draw-bridges&amp;nbsp;– so that no part of it should remain unillustrated."&lt;ref name="Ainsworth p. ix"/&gt;

[[File:Wakefield Tower Chapel - Tower of London.jpg|thumb|[[St John's Chapel, London|St John's Chapel]] in the Tower, which Lady Jane visited on her first night in the castle]]
The focus in the novel is the three aspects of the Tower of London. To further this focus, Ainsworth depicts two crownings, a wedding, executions, and even a siege of the Tower. Lady Jane has her first night at the Tower as the Queen of England, and she visits St John's Chapel, located in the White Tower. Later, she is kept as the Tower's prisoner. Overall, the Tower has gothic elements along with having a connection to the Catholic Church in its architecture. The Tower, in its style, also represented the sublime and the connection with the divine. With these various dimensions to the Tower, there is a connection between ''The Tower of London'' and Victor Hugo's ''Notre Dame de Paris'', in their emphasis on architecture and with history.&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 pp. 235, 237–240&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural descriptions within the novel tend to break up some of the aspects of the plot, but they serve to show how the Tower has changed over time. This transcends the temporal bounds of the plot to connect the origins of the Tower to the 19th century when Ainsworth published the novel. According to literary critic George Worth, "Ainsworth seems constantly to be trying to remind his readers, living in an age of urbanization and industrialization in which historic old landmarks were being swept away or defaced or 'restored' beyond recognition, that they had a heritage, one very large vested in physical structures of one kind or another, and that the heritage&amp;nbsp;[...] might soon be gone beyond recall."&lt;ref&gt;Worth 1972 pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics, in general, were viewed negatively by Ainsworth's contemporary English audience. In particular, Mary had the reputation for seeking the death of people and was dubbed "Bloody Mary". Although Ainsworth disagreed with the Catholic religion, he felt that they were part of an idealised English past, and he sought to describe them neutrally. Of Mary herself, Ainsworth emphasised aspects that made her a decent queen. Although many Catholics in the novel tried to use Mary to push Catholicism in a fanatical manner, Ainsworth introduces Cardinal Pole as a moderating figure who tries to sway Mary away from such views.&lt;ref&gt;Worth 1972 pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
''The Tower of London'' is based on the events following the death of Edward VI. Various groups tried to seize the throne, and Mary I was crowned. This brought about a restoration of Catholicism and the [[Wyatt's rebellion|rebellion]] of [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Thomas Wyatt]].&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; In depicting Mary, Ainsworth tried to overcome the view of her as "Bloody Mary" and any anti-Catholic bigotry. He felt that he could depict her without any bias as he focused on what was known about her knowledge and religious aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Worth 1972 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth was accused of sensationalising violence in his novels; for instance critic [[Richard Church (poet)|Richard Church]] remarked that Ainsworth "brought sensationalism and an atmosphere of the Chamber of Horrors into the historical novel".&lt;ref&gt;Ligocki 1972 qtd p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these assertions, Ainsworth was faithful to the sources he worked from. Most of his information was derived from [[David Jardine (barrister)|David Jardine]]'s ''A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England'' (1837), and details such as the use of the [[Scavenger's Daughter]] are based on Jardine's description of torture in the Tudor period. By recounting suffering and torture in ''The Tower of London'', Ainsworth made plain the consequences of failed political intrigue in the Tudor period. Jardine notes that members of the nobility were not tortured; Ainsworth overlooks this with the intention of showing that failure in political machinations came at a high price. In this, Ligocki feels that Ainsworth was true to the nature of the Tudor period, reflecting the "cruelty and ruthlessness of the politically ambitious of the age".&lt;ref&gt;Ligocki 1972 pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Edgar Allan Poe believes that "The authorship of this work does a little, and but a little, more credit to Mr. Ainsworth than that of 'Jack Sheppard'. It is in no spirit cavilling that we say it is rarely our lot to review a work more utterly destitute of every ingredient requisite to a good romance".&lt;ref&gt;Carver 2003 qtd p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Malcolm Elwin argues, "several of his novels&amp;nbsp;– particularly ''Tower of London'' and ''Old St. Paul's'', in spite of the absurd antics of the hero of the latter&amp;nbsp;– have undoubtedly the quality of durability. No writer could hope to surpass either as romantic histories of their particular subject."&lt;ref&gt;Elwin 1934 pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Mason, in a 1939 article, says that "History through the eyes of romance is the essence of Ainsworth at his best&amp;nbsp;– ''The Lancashire Witches'', ''Tower of London'', ''Old St. Paul's'', are romantic histories and will no doubt endure."&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1939 pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Worth, in 1972, explains that Ainsworth "spaces his [architectural] descriptions judiciously throughout the novel in such a way as to heighten the effect of the novel rather than detract from it."&lt;ref&gt;Worth 1972 p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Nicholas Rance claims that ''The Tower of London'' is an "incongruous merging of historical romance and guide book".&lt;ref&gt;Rance 1975 p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The enduring image of the Tower of London as a grim place of torture and imprisonment was largely shaped by the works of 19th-century authors, particularly Ainsworth's novel.&lt;ref name="Allen Brown"&gt;Allen Brown &amp; Curnow 1984, 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Impey &amp; Parnell 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Such was its influence in emphasising the Tudor epoch of the Tower's history, in the late 20th century historians R Allen Brown and P Curnow felt it still dominated the public perception of the castle. In their official handbook to the Tower, published in 1986, the noted that "Still an innocent visitor to the place today might be led to suppose by guides and guidebooks, that it was built almost entirely for the Tudor monarchs".&lt;ref name="Allen Brown"/&gt;

'''''Theodosia and the Serpents of Chaos''''' is a [[children's literature|children's]] [[novel]] by [[R. L. LaFevers]].

==Plot==
Theodosia Throckmorton, a clever and shrewd girl of sorts, has the harrowing and busy work of nullifying [[curse]]s in her father's [[museum]], where the darkest spells abound. However, it is delicate work, and time is running out for her to set things right. A crate arrives from Theo's mother in [[Egypt]], which contains a cursed statue of [[Bastet]]. While transferring the curse from  the statue to a wax figure, she becomes distracted and redirects it into her cat, Isis. Her hands are full enough when her mother returns from the tombs of Egypt, bringing countless cursed valuables and antiquities with her. While picking her mother up at the train station, Theodosia catches a street urchin named Sticky Will trying to pick her father's pocket. He informs her that someone is following her mother. Theo tells him she will be at the station tomorrow and he can tell her more about the man then. Back at the museum, they unload Theo's mother's trunks.Theo senses the curses on the artifacts. The most powerful is a gem called the Heart of Egypt, with the power to topple the whole of [[Great Britain]] and the entire [[British Empire]].

The next day, her brother Henry returns from boarding school. The Heart of Egypt is stolen, and Theo suspects someone from the [[British Museum]] and investigates, Henry tagging along without her consent. A Mr. Tetley is acting suspiciously, and they decide to follow him. While traveling through the Seven Dials, they meet Will and witness a man taking the Heart from Tetley, then the same man is stabbed in a churchyard. Theodosia hears the man mumble "Som set hoo", or "Somerset House". He tells Theo to speak to Wigmere, only Wigmere. She sends Henry and Will to Somerset House while she struggles to keep the man alive using her amulets. Will and Henry bring help, and Theo is introduced to Lord Wigmere, head of the [[Antiquarian Society of London|Antiquarian Society]] and The Brotherhood of Chosen Keepers, a group dedicated to nullifying curses. Theodosia is relieved to know there are others like her, but disturbed that no one else can sense the curses the way she can. Henry and Will are not told the true nature of the Keepers, although Will is taken on as a message boy later on. Theo is also angry that Wigmere may suspect her mother of stealing the Heart of Egypt, as she works closely with Count Von Braggenchnot, head of the Serpents of Chaos who will do anything to rain plague and pestilence down on [[England]].

After Theodosia escapes, she sneaks onto a ship on which her mother and father are traveling to go to Egypt. While in Egypt, Theodosia finds a hidden part of a pyramid. She discovers that the First Assistant Curator, Nigel Bollingsworth, is the traitor. Theodosia is very clever, and uses the Egyptian version of voodoo dolls to hurt Tetley. She reaches into the pocket of her pinafore and throws sand from the tomb at Nigel, the left side of his face dissolving. Clever Theo finds another tomb and returns the Heart of Egypt to its rightful place. Theodosia finds an important artifact—the Was scepter—and hits Nigel on the head with it.

The '''Whitney Museum of American Art'''&amp;nbsp;– known informally as the "'''Whitney'''"&amp;nbsp;– is an [[art museum]] located in [[Manhattan]]. It was founded in 1931 by [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] (1875–1942), a wealthy and prominent American socialite and art patron after whom the museum is named.

The Whitney focuses on 20th- and 21st-century [[American art]]. Its permanent collection comprises more than 21,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, films, videos, and artifacts of [[new media]] by more than 3,000 artists. It places a particular emphasis on exhibiting the work of living artists for its collection as well as maintaining an extensive permanent collection containing many important pieces from the first half of the last century. The museum's Annual and [[Whitney Biennial|Biennial]] exhibitions have long been a venue for younger and less well-known artists whose work is showcased there.

From 1966 to 2014, the Whitney was located at 945 [[Madison Avenue]] at [[75th Street (Manhattan)|East 75th Street]] in Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]]. The museum closed in October 2014 to relocate to a new building designed by [[Renzo Piano]] located at 99 [[Gansevoort Street]] at [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] in the [[West Village]]/[[Meatpacking District]] neighborhoods of [[Lower Manhattan]]; it reopened at the new location on May 1, 2015.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Whitney Museum 8-12 West 8th Street.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|The Whitney's original location]], at 8–12 [[8th Street (Manhattan)|West 8th Street]], between [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[MacDougal Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]]]]

[[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]], the museum's namesake and founder, was a well-regarded sculptor as well as a serious art collector. As a patron of the arts, she had already achieved some success as the creator of the "Whitney Studio Club", a New York–based exhibition space which she created in 1918 to promote the works of [[avant-garde]] and unrecognized American artists.  Whitney favored the radical art of the American artists of the [[Ashcan School]] such as [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], [[George Luks]] and [[Everett Shinn]], as well as others such as [[Edward Hopper]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Charles Sheeler]], and [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Saatchi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile.php/Whitney+Museum+Of+American+Art/4767.html | title=Whitney Museum of American Art | work=The Saatchi Gallery | accessdate=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the aid of her assistant, [[Juliana R. Force]], Whitney had collected nearly 700 works of American art. In 1929, she offered to donate over 500 works of art to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], but the museum declined the gift. This, along with the apparent preference for European [[modernism]] at the recently opened [[Museum of Modern Art]], led Whitney to start her own museum, exclusively for American art, in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/nyregion/gertrude-vanderbilt-whitneys-village-studios-birthplace-of-museum-to-admit-visitors.html?_r=0 | title=Art Studios Where Whitney Museum Was Born Will Admit Visitors | author=David W. Dunlap | date=May 16, 2016 | publisher=New York Times | access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/inside-the-breuer-building-after-the-whitney-and-before-the-met | title=Inside the Breuer Building, After the Whitney and Before the MET | author=Andrea K. Scott | date=March 12, 2016 | publisher=The New Yorker | access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney Library archives from 1928 reveal that during this time the Studio Club utilized the gallery space of [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] of the Art Students League to exhibit traveling shows featuring Modernist works.&lt;ref&gt;The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Whitney Museum Library archival items number 15405&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, architect Noel L. Miller converted three row houses on [[8th Street (Manhattan)|West 8th Street]] in [[Greenwich Village]]&amp;nbsp;– one of which, [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|8 west 8th Street (Manhattan)]] had been the location of the "Studio Club"&amp;nbsp;– to be the museum's home as well as a residence for Whitney.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Force became the first director of the museum, and under her guidance, the museum concentrated on displaying the works of new and contemporary American artists.&lt;ref name="berman1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Avis|title=Rebels on Eighth Street: Juliana Force and the Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher=Atheneum|year=1990|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the museum left its original location&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; and moved to a small structure on 54th Street connected to and behind the [[Museum of Modern Art]] on 53rd Street. On April 15, 1958, a fire on the second floor of MOMA that killed one person forced the evacuation of paintings and staff on MOMA's upper floors to the Whitney.  Among the paintings moved in the evacuation was ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' which had been on loan from the  [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=greg on |url=http://greg.org/archive/2010/09/02/moma_on_fire.html |title=MoMA On Fire &amp;#124; greg.org: the making of, by greg allen |publisher=greg.org |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to the Upper East Side===
[[File:Whitney Museum of American Art.JPG|thumb|right|267px|The Whitney Museum of American Art's former (1966–2014) home on Madison Avenue; the [[Marcel Breuer]]-designed building was leased by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] beginning in 2016. It is now known as the [[Met Breuer]].]]

In 1961, the museum began seeking a site for a larger building. The Whitney settled in 1966 at the southeast corner of [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] at 75th Street in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref name="cgraynyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/realestate/14Scapes.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=The Controversial Whitney Museum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, planned and built 1963–1966 by [[Marcel Breuer]] and Hamilton P. Smith in a distinctively modern style, is easily distinguished from the neighboring townhouses by its staircase [[façade]] made from [[granite]] stones and its external upside-down windows. In 1967, [[Mauricio Lasansky]] showed [[The Nazi Drawings]]. The exhibition traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, where they appeared with shows by [[Louise Nevelson]] and [[Andrew Wyeth]] as the first exhibits installed in the new museum.

The institution grappled with space problems for decades.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Carol |last1=Vogel |first2=Kate |last2=Taylor |date=April 11, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/arts/design/12museum.html |title=Rift in Family as Whitney Plans a Second Home |newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1973 to 1983 the Whitney operated its first branch at [[55 Water Street]], in a building owned by [[Harold Uris]] who gave the museum a lease for $1 a year. In 1983 [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] installed a Whitney branch in the lobby of its Park Avenue headquarters. In 1981 the museum opened an exhibition space in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], housed at [[Champion International]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1986"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Brenson |date=February 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/arts/art-view-museum-and-corporation-a-delicate-balance.html |title=Museum And Corporation&amp;nbsp;– A Delicate Balance |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, the Whitney entered into arrangements with Park Tower Realty, [[I.B.M.]] and [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States]], setting up satellite museums with rotating exhibitions in the lobbies of their buildings.&lt;ref name="nytimes1988"&gt;{{cite news |first=Grace |last=Glück |authorlink=Grace Glueck |date=December 4, 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/magazine/mogul-power-at-the-whitney.html |title=Mogul Power At The Whitney |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each museum had its own director, with all plans approved by a Whitney committee.&lt;ref name="nytimes1986"/&gt;

The institution attempted to expand its landmark building in 1978, commissioning UK architects [[Derek Walker]] and [[Norman Foster]] to design a tall tower alongside it, the first of several proposals from leading architects. But each time the effort was abandoned, either because of the cost or the design or both.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; In order to secure additional space for the museum's collections, then-director [[Thomas N. Armstrong III]] developed plans for a 10-story, $37.5-million addition to the Whitney's main building. The proposed addition, designed by [[Michael Graves]] and announced in 1985, drew immediate opposition. Graves had proposed demolishing the flanking brownstones down to the [[East 74th Street]] corner for a complementary addition. The project gradually lost the support of the museum’s trustees, and the plans were dropped in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes (June 22, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/arts/design/thomas-n-armstrong-iii-whitney-museum-chief-dies-at-78.html?ref=design Thomas N. Armstrong III, Museum Chief Who Once Led the Whitney, Dies at 78], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1998, the building underwent a renovation and expansion by [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]]. In 2001, [[Rem Koolhaas]] was commissioned to submit two designs for a $200 million expansion. Those plans were dropped in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (April 15, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/15/arts/whitney-scraps-expansion-plans.html Whitney Scraps Expansion Plans] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; causing director Maxwell L. Anderson to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (May 13, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/arts/director-of-the-whitney-resigns.html?ref=maxwelllanderson Director of the Whitney Resigns] ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt; New York restaurateur [[Danny Meyer]] opened Untitled, a restaurant in the museum in March 2011. The space was designed by the [[Rockwell Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hard |first=Ali |url=http://www.zagat.com/buzz/danny-meyers-untitled-debuts-in-the-whitney |title=Zagat Buzz Blog: Danny Meyer's Untitled Debuts in The Whitney, March 28, 2011 |publisher=Zagat.com |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move downtown===
[[File:Whitney Museum from west.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Gansevoort Street location view from the west (2016); the building was designed by [[Renzo Piano]]]]

The Whitney developed a new main building, designed by [[Renzo Piano]], in the [[West Village]] and [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]] sections of [[lower Manhattan]]. The new museum, located at the intersection of Gansevoort and [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]]s, was built on a previously city-owned site and marks the southern entrance to the [[High Line]] park.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2015.&lt;ref name="cgraynyt"/&gt; The construction was $422 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2015/05/02/whitney-museum-building-renzo-piano-gets-architecture-right/UKtLzaCXSF654MmGz77RwJ/story.html | title=Whitney Museum building by Renzo Piano gets its design right | work=Boston Globe | date=May 2, 2015 | accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new structure spans {{convert|200000|sqft|m2}} and 8 stories that include the city's largest column-free art gallery spaces, an education center, theater, a conservation lab and a library and reading rooms. Two of the floors are fully devoted to the museum's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;Ellie Stathaki (October 16, 2013), [http://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/under-construction-the-whitney-museums-new-hq-by-renzo-piano-in-new-york/6852 Under Construction: The Whitney Museum's new HQ by Renzo Piano in New York] ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only permanent artwork commissioned for the site&amp;nbsp;– its four main elevators&amp;nbsp;– were conceived by [[Richard Artschwager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carol |last=Vogel |date=June 6, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/arts/design/elevators-as-art-for-the-new-whitney.html |title=The Museum Elevator as Immersive Art |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new building's collection comprises over 600 works by over 400 artists.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/arts/design/new-whitney-museum-signifies-a-changing-new-york-art-scene.html?_r=0 | title=New Whitney Museum Signifies a Changing New York Art Scene | work=New York Times | date=April 30, 2016 | accessdate=May 1, 2015 | author=Roberta Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[observation deck]]s on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th floors linked by an outdoor staircase.

The new building is much more expansive and open than the old ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/01/new-whitney-museum_n_7189120.html | title=12 Things To Search For At The Brand New Whitney Museum | work=Huffington Post | date=May 1, 2015 | accessdate=May 2, 2015 | author=Katherine Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one ''New York Times'' review described the building:

{{quote|The Whitney ... has a series of events spaces at its margins: a flexible auditorium and four large terraces, three of which are linked by an outdoor staircase. ... It has timed tickets that are designed to control crowding, but people may linger longer than expected. After art they can retire to the eighth-floor cafe, the terraces or the lines of comfy leather couches facing glass walls overlooking the Hudson and Greenwich Village at either end of the fifth floor.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;}}

The museum needed to raise $760 million for the building and its endowment. In May 2011, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] announced it had entered into an agreement to occupy the Madison Avenue building for at least eight years starting in 2015, easing the Whitney of the burden of having to finance two large museum spaces.&lt;ref name=the-met-to-take-over&gt;{{cite news |first=Carol |last=Vogel |date=May 11, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/arts/design/the-met-to-take-over-whitneys-breuer-building.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=Met Plans to Occupy the Whitney’s Uptown Site |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of the old space was later postponed to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/the-year-ahead-museums-opening-in-2016/|first=Gareth|last=Harris|title=The Year Ahead: museums opening in 2016|date=January 1, 2016|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an April 30, 2015, ceremonial ribbon cutting attended by [[Michelle Obama]] and [[Bill de Blasio]],&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; the new building opened on May 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/05/01/new-whitney-museum-makes-waves-on-social-media/ | title=New Whitney Museum makes waves on social media | work=Wall Street Journal Blog | accessdate=May 1, 2015 | author=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Robert Henri - Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney by [[Robert Henri]] (1916)]]
The museum displays [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[printmaking|print]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[installation art]], video, and [[photography]]. Every two years, the museum hosts the [[Whitney Biennial]], an international art show which displays many lesser-known artists new to the American art scene. It has displayed works by many notable artists, and has featured unconventional works such as a 1976 exhibit of live [[body builder]]s, featuring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katharine|last=Lowry |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091158/index.htm |title=The Show Of Muscles At The Whitney Was Vitiated By&amp;nbsp;– 06.07.76&amp;nbsp;– SI Vault |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=June 7, 1976 |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 600 works in the permanent collection grew to about 1,300 by 1954 when the second Museum building opened, and to approximately 2,000 with the opening of the Breuer building in 1966. Today the permanent collection contains more than 18,000 works of art from many renowned artists.  Artists represented include [[Josef Albers]], [[Joe Andoe]], [[Donald Baechler]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Lucile Blanch]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Ching Ho Cheng]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Greg Colson]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[William Eggleston]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Keith Haring]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Robert Henri]], [[Carmen Herrera]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Edward Hopper]],  [[Jasper Johns]], [[Corita Kent]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Terence Koh]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Ronnie Landfield]],  [[John Marin]], [[Knox Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Paul Pfeiffer (artist)|Paul Pfeiffer]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Maurice Prendergast]], [[Kenneth Price]],  [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Man Ray]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Andy Warhol]], and hundreds of others. A photography collection was begun in 1991.

In addition to its traditional collection the Whitney has a website, called [http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/Artport Artport], that features "Net Art" that changes monthly.  The Whitney Museum of American Art will not sell any work by a living artist because it could damage that artist’s career. But it will trade a living artist’s work for another piece by the same artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |date=January 26, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html |title=The Permanent Collection May Not Be So Permanent |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent study program==
In 1968, Ron Clark, at the age of 25, established in conjunction with the Whitney Museum of American Art an independent study program (known as the ISP or sometimes the Whitney ISP), which helped start the careers of artists, critics, and curators including [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Kathryn Bigelow]], [[Roberta Smith]], and [[Félix González-Torres]], as well as many other well-known and influential cultural producers. The program includes both art history and studio programs. Each year the Independent Study Program selects fourteen students to participate in the Studio Program (artists), four in the Curatorial Program (curators) and six in the Critical Studies Program (researchers). It is a one-year program that includes many both visiting and hired artists, art historians, and critics and involves the reading of theory. Ron Clark remains director of the program..

===Directors===
The museum's current director is [[Adam D. Weinberg]] (since 2003). Former directors include [[Maxwell L. Anderson]] (1998–2003), [[David A. Ross]] (1991–1997), [[Thomas Armstrong III]] (1974–1990), and [[Juliana Rieser Force]] (1931–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800846,00.html Art: Whitney &amp; Force] ''Time Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board of Trustees===
For years Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney supported the museum single-handedly, as did her daughter, [[Flora Whitney Miller]], after her, and until 1961 its board was largely family-run. Flora Payne Whitney, served as a museum trustee, then as vice president. From 1942 to 1974 she was the museum's president and chairman after which she functioned as honorary chairman until her death in 1986. Her daughter, Flora Miller Biddle, served as its president until 1985. In 1999, her book ''The Whitney Women and the Museum They Made'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Arcade Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-55970-594-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the need for outside support finally forced the board to add outside trustees, including bankers [[Roy Neuberger]] and [[Arthur Altschul|Arthur G. Altschul]]. [[David Solinger]] became the Whitney's first outside president in 1966.&lt;ref name="nytimes1988"/&gt;

The '''Winter Palace''' ({{lang-rus|Зимний дворец|Zimnij dvorets|p=ˈzʲimnʲɪj dvɐˈrʲɛts}}) in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, was, from 1732 to 1917, the official residence of the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian monarchs]]. Today, the restored palace forms part of a complex of buildings housing the [[Hermitage Museum]]. Situated between the [[Palace Embankment]] and the [[Palace Square]], adjacent to the site of [[Peter the Great]]'s original Winter Palace, the present and fourth Winter Palace was built and altered almost continuously between the late 1730s and 1837, when it was severely damaged by fire and immediately rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;The numbering of the Winter Palaces varies. Most referees used in the writing of this page refer to the present palace as the fourth. That is: Trezzini, 1711 (I);  Mattarnovy, 1721 (II); Trezzini, 1727 (III) and Rastrelli, 1732 (IV). Thus, to agree with the majority and because these four versions were "palaces" each differing from the last rather than recreations, this will be the numbering used here. However, other sources count the log cabin of Peter the Great as the first palace, while others discount Trezzini's 1727 rebuilding and others count the 1837 reconstruction as a 5th Winter palace. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071126025206/http://spbcity.info/eng/content/view/44/30/ One source] (not used here) numbers a temporary wooden structure erected to house the court during the building of the present palace.&lt;/ref&gt; The storming of the palace in 1917 as depicted in Soviet paintings and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s 1927 film ''October'' became an iconic symbol of the [[Russian Revolution]].

The palace was constructed on a monumental scale that was intended to reflect the might and power of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. From the palace, the [[Tsar]]&lt;ref&gt;In 1721, Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] received the title of Emperor from the [[Governing Senate]]. Scholars use the titles of "Tsar" and "Emperor" (and their feminine forms) interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled over {{convert|22400000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} (almost 1/6 of the Earth's landmass) and over 125&amp;nbsp;million subjects by the end of the 19th century. It was designed by many architects, most notably [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], in what came to be known as the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabethan Baroque]] style. The green-and-white palace has the shape of an elongated rectangle, and its principal façade is {{convert|215|m|ft}} long and {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The Winter Palace has been calculated to contain 1,786 doors, 1,945 windows, 1,500 rooms and 117 staircases. Following a serious fire, the palace's rebuilding of 1837 left the exterior unchanged, but large parts of the interior were redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as a "19th-century palace inspired by a model in [[Rococo]] style".&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200"&gt;Budberg, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre occurred when demonstrators marched toward the Winter Palace, but by this time the Imperial Family had chosen to live in the more secure and secluded [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]], and returned to the Winter Palace only for formal and state occasions. Following the February Revolution of 1917, the palace was for a short time the seat of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Later that same year, the palace was stormed by a detachment of [[Red Army]] soldiers and sailors—a defining moment in the birth of the Soviet state.

== Peter the Great's Winter Palace (1711–1753) ==
[[File:1st Winter Palace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first Winter Palace, designed in 1711 for Peter the Great, by [[Domenico Trezzini]] who, 16 years later, was to design the third Winter Palace.]]

Later returning from his [[Grand_Embassy_of_Peter_the_Great|Grand Embassy]] in 1698, [[Peter I of Russia]] embarked on a policy of [[Westernization]] and expansion that was to transform the [[Tsardom of Russia]] into the [[Russian Empire]] and a major European power.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 234–243&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was manifested in bricks and mortar by the creation of a new city, Saint Petersburg, in 1703.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 355–366&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and design of the new city was intended as a conscious rejection of traditional [[Byzantine]]-influenced [[Russian architecture]], such as the then-fashionable [[Naryshkin Baroque]], in favour of the classically inspired architecture prevailing in the great cities of Europe. The Tsar intended that his new city would be designed in a Flemish renaissance style, later known as [[Petrine Baroque]], and this was the style he selected for his new palace in the city. The first Royal residence on the site had been a humble log cabin then known as the [[Cabin of Peter the Great|Domik Petra I]], built in 1704, which faced the [[River Neva]]. In 1711 it was transported to the Petrovskaya Naberezhnaya&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-petersburg.com/embankments/peters-quay/ Peter's Quay on the St Petersburg Website]&lt;/ref&gt;, where it still stands.&lt;ref name="Petrakova"&gt;Petrakova&lt;/ref&gt;  With the site cleared, the Tsar then embarked on the building of a larger house between 1711 and 1712. This house, today referred to as the first Winter Palace, was designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Architecture on the Neva. Trezzini, catalogue of works. 1711&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century was a period of great development in European royal architecture, as the need for a fortified residence gradually lessened. This process, which had begun in the late 16th century, accelerated and great classical palaces quickly replaced fortified castles throughout the more powerful European countries. One of the earliest and most notable examples was [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. Largely completed by 1710, Versailles—with its size and splendour—heightened rivalry amongst the sovereigns of Europe. Peter the Great of Russia, keen to promote all western concepts, wished to have a modern palace like his fellow sovereigns. However, unlike some of his successors, Peter I never aspired to rival Versailles.

[[File:PtheGspalace.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The third Winter Palace of 1727. Designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]] it incorporated the second Winter Palace of 1721 by [[Georg Mattarnovy]] as one of its terminating pavilions.]]

The first Winter Palace was a modest building of two main floors under a slate roof.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Peter soon tired of the first palace, for in 1721, the second version of the Winter Palace was built under the direction of architect [[Georg Johann Mattarnovy|Georg Mattarnovy]]. Mattarnovy's palace, though still very modest compared to royal palaces in other European capitals, was on two floors above a rusticated ground floor, with a central projection underneath a [[pediment]] supported by columns.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Peter the Great died in 1725.

The Winter Palace was not the only palace in the unfinished city, or even the most splendid, as Peter had ordered his nobles to construct residences and to spend half the year there.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49"&gt;Cowles, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unpopular command; Saint Petersburg was founded upon a swamp, with little sunlight, and it was said only cabbages and turnips would grow there. It was forbidden to fell trees for fuel, so hot water was permitted just once a week. Only Peter's second wife, Empress [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]], pretended to enjoy life in the new city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49" /&gt;

As a result of pressed slave labour from all over the Empire,&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58"&gt;Cowles, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; work on the city progressed quickly. It has been estimated that 200,000 people died in twenty years while building the city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58" /&gt; A diplomat of the time, who described the city as "a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies", just a few years later called it "a wonder of the world, considering its magnificent palaces".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these new palaces in Peter's beloved Flemish Baroque style, such as the [[:File:Kikin.jpg|Kikin Hall]] and the [[Menshikov Palace]], still stand.

==The palace 1725–1855==
[[File:Johrdan staircase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|upright|The principal or "[[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]]", ''(8 on the plan below)'' so-called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] the Tsar descended this [[Imperial staircase]] in state for the ceremony of the "Blessing of the Waters." It is one of the few parts of the palace retaining Rastrelli's 18th century rococo style. The massive grey granite columns were, however, added in the mid-19th century. Painting by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]].&lt;ref name="Budberg, p. 198"&gt;Budberg, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On Peter the Great's death in 1725, the city of Saint Petersburg was still far from being the centre of western culture and civilization that he had envisioned. Many of the aristocrats who had been compelled by the Tsar to inhabit Saint Petersburg left. Wolves roamed the squares at night while bands of discontented pressed [[serf]]s, imported to build the Tsar's new city and [[Baltic fleet]], frequently rebelled.

Peter I was succeeded by his widow, Catherine I, who reigned until her death in 1727. She in turn was succeeded by Peter I's grandson [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], who in 1727 had Mattarnovy's palace greatly enlarged by the architect [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; Trezzini, who had designed the Summer Palace in 1711, was one of the greatest exponents of the [[Petrine Baroque]] style, now completely redesigned and expanded Mattarnovy's existing Winter Palace to such an extent that Mattarnovy's entire palace became merely one of the two terminating pavilions of the new, and third, Winter Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p196&lt;/ref&gt; The third palace, like the second, was in the Petrine Baroque style.

In 1728, shortly after the third palace was completed, the Imperial Court left Saint Petersburg for Moscow, and the Winter Palace lost its status as the principal imperial residence. Moscow had once again been designated the capital city, a status which had been granted to Saint Petersburg in 1713. Following the death of Peter II in 1730, the throne passed to a niece of Peter I, [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland]].

=== Anna (1730–1740) ===
The new Empress cared more for Saint Petersburg than her immediate predecessors; she re-established the Imperial court at the Winter Palace and, in 1732, Saint Petersburg again officially replaced Moscow as Russia's capital, a position it was to hold until 1918.

Ignoring the third Winter Palace, the Empress on her return to Saint Petersburg took up residence at the neighbouring Apraksin Palace.&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; In 1732, the Tsaritsa commissioned the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] to completely rebuild and extend the Apraksin Palace, incorporating other neighbouring houses.&lt;ref&gt;Patrakova&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the core of the fourth and final Winter Palace is not the palace of Peter the Great, but the palace of Admiral General [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt;

The Empress Anna, though unpopular and considered "dull, coarse, fat, harsh and spiteful",&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; was keen to introduce a more civilized and cultured air to her court. She designed new liveries for her servants and, on her orders, mead and vodka were replaced with champagne and Burgundy. She instructed the [[Boyars]] to replace their plain furniture with that of mahogany and ebony,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; while her own tastes in interior decoration ran to a dressing table of solid gold and an "[[easing stool]]" of silver, studded with rubies. It was against such a backdrop of magnificence and extravagance that she gave her first ball in the newly completed gallery at the Winter Palace, which, in the middle of the Russian winter, resembled an orange grove.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; This, the fourth version of the Winter Palace, was to be an ongoing project for the architect Rastrelli throughout the reign of the Empress Anna.

===Elizabeth (1741–1762)===
{{Winter Palace}}
The infant Tsar [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], succeeding Anna in 1740, was soon deposed in a bloodless coup d'état by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Grand Duchess Elizabeth]], a daughter of Peter the Great. Delegating almost all powers to her favourites, the new Empress Elizabeth assumed a life of pleasure which led the court at the Winter Palace to be described later by the Russian historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] as a place of "gilded squalor".&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Winter Palace. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of honour to the Empress, who regarded the palace as a symbol of national prestige. Work on the building continued throughout the year, even in the severest months of the winter. The deprivation to both the Russian people and the army caused by the ongoing [[Seven Years' War]] were not permitted to hinder the progress. 859,555 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns.&lt;ref name="Brumfield1983"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brumfield|first=William Craft|title=Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBRQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=October 1983|publisher=D.R. Godine|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the labourers earned a monthly wage of just one ruble, the cost of the project exceeded the budget, so much so that work ceased due to lack of resources despite the Empress' obsessive desire for rapid completion. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for the war. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Orloff, Alexander |author2=Shvidkovsky, Dmitri |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Saint Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0-7892-0217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, a Winter Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion.

===Catherine II (1762–1796)===
It was Empress Elizabeth who selected the German princess, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, as a bride for her nephew and successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. The marriage was not a success, but it was this princess who, as [[Catherine the Great]], came to be chiefly associated with the Winter Palace. In 1762, following a coup d'état, in which her husband was murdered, Catherine paraded her seven-year-old son, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], on the Winter Palace's balcony to an excited crowd below.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not presenting her son as the new and rightful ruler of Russia, however; that honour she was usurping herself.

Catherine's patronage of the architects [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] saw the palace further enlarged and transformed.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; At this time an opera house which had existed in the southwestern wing of the palace was swept away to provide apartments for members of Catherine's family. In 1790, Quarenghi redesigned five of Rastrelli's state rooms to create the three vast halls of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. Catherine was responsible for the three large adjoining palaces, known collectively as the Hermitage—the name by which the entire complex, including the Winter Palace, was to become known 150 years later.

Catherine had been impressed by the French architect [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]], who designed the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (also in Saint Petersburg) and commissioned him to add a new wing to the Winter Palace.&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Amery|first1=Colin|last2=Curran|first2=Brian|title=St Petersburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV-BGNNDM2cC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=2006|publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7112-2492-6|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended as a place of retreat from the formalities and ceremonies of the court. Catherine christened it the Hermitage ''(14)'', a name used by her predecessor Tsaritsa Elizabeth to describe her private rooms within the palace.

The interior of the Hermitage wing was intended to be a simple contrast to that of the Winter Palace. Indeed, it is said that the concept of the Hermitage as a retreat was suggested to Catherine by that advocate of the simple life, [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=Budberg201&gt;Budberg, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it was another large palace in itself, connected to the main palace by a series of covered walkways and heated courtyards in which flew rare exotic birds.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90"&gt;Cowles, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for its fine portico and attention to details of a delicate nature,&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"/&gt; it was richly furnished with an ever-growing art collection.

[[File:Frans Hals 058.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Frans Hals]]' ''Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove'', purchased for the Winter Palace in 1764]]
The palace's art collection was assembled haphazardly in an eclectic manner, often with an eye to quantity rather than quality. Many of the artworks purchased for the palaces arrived as parts of a job lot as the sovereign acquired whole ready-assembled collections. The Empress' ambassadors in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and London were instructed to look out for and purchase thousands of priceless works of art on her behalf. Ironically, while Saint Petersburg high society and the extended Romanov family derided Russia's [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|last Empress]] for furnishing her palaces "mail order" from [[Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet|Maples]] of London, she was following the practices of Catherine the Great, who, if not exactly by "mail order", certainly bought "sight unseen."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

In this way, between 1764 and 1781 Catherine the Great acquired six major collections: those of [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]]; [[Heinrich von Brühl]]; [[Pierre Crozat]]; [[Horace Walpole]]; [[Sylvestre-Raphael Baudouin]]; and finally in 1787, the [[Lyde Browne (antiquary)|John Lyde-Brown]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_11.html|title= 1787: Purchase of the John Lyde-Brown collection, London |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These large assemblies of art included works by such masters as [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]] and [[Guido Reni|Reni]].&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt; The acquisition of 225 paintings forming the Gotzkowsky collection was a source of personal pride to Catherine. It had been put together by Gotzkowsky for Catherine's adversary, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great of Prussia]] who, as a result of his wars with Russia, could not afford to pay for it. This collection included some great Flemish and Dutch works, most notably Frans Hals' "Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove."&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_1_3.html|title= The Great Hermitage |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, the Bruhl collection brought to the Winter Palace two further works by Rembrandt, ''Portrait of a Scholar'' and ''Portrait of an Old Man in Red''.

While some aspects of this manic collecting could have been a manifestation of Catherine's desire for a recognition of her intellectual concepts,&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; there was also a more fundamental motivation: necessity. Just twenty years earlier, so scarce were the furnishings of the Imperial palaces that bedsteads, mirrors, tables and chairs had to be conveyed between Moscow and Saint Petersburg each time the court moved.&lt;ref&gt;Kluchevsky, vol IV, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the palace filled with art, it overflowed into the Hermitage. So large did Catherine's art collection eventually become that it became necessary to commission the German-trained architect Yury Velten to build a second and larger extension to the palace, which eventually became known as the Old Hermitage (''15''). Later, Catherine commissioned a third extension, the [[Hermitage Theatre]], designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This construction necessitated the demolition of Peter the Great's by now crumbling third Winter palace.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn - A Scholar.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Portrait of a Scholar'' purchased in 1769. The painting is one of several by Rembrandt in the former Imperial Collection.]]
The Empress' life within the Hermitage, surrounded by her art and friends, was simpler than in the adjacent Winter Palace; there, the Empress gave small intimate suppers. Servants were excluded from these suppers and a sign on the wall read "Sit down where you choose, and when you please without it being repeated to you a thousand times."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

Catherine was also responsible for introducing the lasting affection for all things French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture and manners.&lt;ref name=Cowles93&gt;Cowles, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; French became the language of the court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]].&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; The Winter Palace was to serve as a model for numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication and manners observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending [[Russian serfdom]]. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.

===Paul I, Alexander I, and Nicholas I (1796–1855)===
[[File:Winter Palace Rotonda1834.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rotunda of the Winter Palace|The Rotunda]] ''(26)''.

Painting by [[Yefim Tukharinov]]]]
Catherine the Great was succeeded by her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]. In the first days of his reign, the new Tsar (reported by the British Ambassador to be "not in his senses"&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;) augmented the number of troops stationed at the Winter Palace, positioning sentry boxes every few metres around the building. Eventually, paranoid for his security and disliking anything connected with his mother,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; he spurned the Winter Palace completely and built [[Saint Michael's Castle]] as his Saint Petersburg residence, on the site of his birthplace. The Tsar announced that he wished to die on the spot he was born. He was murdered there three weeks after taking up residence in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul I was succeeded by his 24-year-old son, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the contents of the Winter Palace were further enhanced when Alexander I purchased the art collection of the former French Empress, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. This collection, some of it plundered loot given to her by her ex-husband [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], contained amongst its many old masters Rembrandt's "The Descent from the Cross" and four sculptures by [[Antonio Canova]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Alexander I was succeeded in 1825 by his brother [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Tsar Nicholas was to be responsible for the palace's present appearance and layout. He not only effected many changes to the interior of the palace, but was responsible for its complete rebuilding following the fire of 1837.&lt;ref name="Crankshaw1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crankshaw|first=Edward|title=The shadow of the winter palace: Russia's drift to revolution, 1825–1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-qCAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-63782-9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
As completed, the overriding exterior form of the Winter Palace's architecture, with its decoration in the form of statuary and opulent stucco work on the pediments above façades and windows, is Baroque. The exterior has remained as finished during the reign of [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]]. The principal façades, those facing the Palace Square and the Neva river, have always been accessible and visible to the public. Only the lateral façades are hidden behind [[granite]] walls, concealing a garden created during the reign of [[Nicholas II]].&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 200.; states the gardens were created by Nicholas I; the Hermitage Museum's own website state these walled gardens were the creation of Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Nicholas II.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was conceived as a town palace, rather than a private palace within a park, such as that of the French kings at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].

[[File:Nicholas Hall (rectified).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Nicholas Hall (''6 on plan'') is the principal reception room, at the centre of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. This room was the setting for court balls. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The architectural theme continues throughout the interior of the palace. The first floor, being the [[piano nobile]], is distinguished by windows taller than those of the floors above and below. Each window is divided from its neighbour by a [[pilaster]]. The repetitive monotony of the long elevations is broken only by symmetrically placed slightly projecting bays, many with their own small [[portico]]. This theme has been constant during all subsequent rebuilding and alterations to the palace. The only external changes have been in colour: at various times in its history the palace has been painted different shades. In the eighteenth century, the palace was painted straw yellow with white and gilded ornament.  Under Nicholas I in 1837, it was painted a dull red, which it remained through the revolution and early Soviet period. Following the restoration work after World War II, it was painted green with the ornament depicted in white, the standard Soviet color scheme for Baroque buildings. (The [[Stroganov Palace]], for example, was also green and white in this period.){{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Internally, the palace appears as a combination of the Baroque and the Neoclassical. Little of Rastrelli's rococo interior design has survived; only the Jordan Staircase and the Grand Church remain in their original style. The changes to the interior were largely due to the influences of the architects employed by Catherine the Great in the last years of her life, [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi|Quarenghi]], who began to alter much of the interior of the palace as designed by Rastrelli. Catherine always wanted the latest fashions, and during her reign the more severe [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural influences, fashionable in Western Europe from the late 1760s, slowly crept towards Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt;  The neoclassical interiors were further emphasised and extended during the reign of Catherine's grandson, Nicholas I.

Quarenghi is credited with introducing the [[Neoclassical style]] to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; His work, together with that of [[Karl Ivanovich Rossi]] and [[Auguste de Montferrand]], gradually transformed Saint Petersburg into an "Empire Town". Montferrand not only created some of the palace's greatest neoclassical interiors, but also was responsible for the erection of the [[Column of Alexander]] during the reign of Nicholas I in Rossi's newly designed [[Palace Square]].

For a long time the Winter Palace was the tallest edifice in the city. In 1844, Nicholas I gave the orders to the effect that private houses should be at least 1 sazhen (2.13 m) lower than the Winter Palace. This rule was effective until 1905.&lt;ref name="Winter Palace in St Petersburg Russia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stpetersburgrussia.ru/palaces/winter_palace|title=Winter Palace|publisher=StPetersburgRussia.ru|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
[[File:Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Small Throne Room ''(10 on plan)'' was created by [[Auguste de Montferrand]] in 1833. It has columns of [[jasper]]. Diplomats gathered here on New Year's Day to offer good wishes to the Emperor.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The Winter Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows.&lt;ref&gt;Figures from King, page 169. These figures are widely quoted. However, while the figure of 1,783 windows is likely, a figure of 1,500 rooms would have to include windowless basement rooms, multiple servants rooms in the attics and closets etc. Compare the 2000 rooms in the [[Hofburg Palace|Vienna Hofburg]] and 1400 rooms of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]], which is much smaller than the Winter Palace. Available plans given by the Hermitage Museum and the original 18th century plans do not show 1,057 rooms. Cowles, p88, claims the Winter Palace had 1,500 rooms, prior to the erection of the adjoining Hermitage.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal façade is {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; The ground floor contained mostly bureaucratic and domestic offices, while the second floor was given over to apartments for senior courtiers and high-ranking officials. The principal rooms and living quarters of the Imperial Family are on the first floor, the piano nobile.&lt;ref&gt;Images of many of the principal rooms can be obtained from the links beneath the plan&lt;/ref&gt; The great state rooms, used by the court, are arranged in two [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]s, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. The original Baroque suite of the Tsaritsa Elizabeth running west, fronting the Neva, was completely redesigned in 1790–93 by Giacomo Quarenghi. He transformed the original enfilade of five state rooms into a suite of three vast halls, decorated with [[faux marble]] columns, [[bas-reliefs]] and statuary.&lt;ref name="Catherine II"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_7_1.html|title=Catherine II (1762–1796)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Division of WinterPalace.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Plan showing the use and division of the principal floor, as occupied in the 1840s. 1 (red): State and most formal rooms; 2 (dark green): Apartments of the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]; 3 (pink): Apartments of the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Empress]]; 4: Apartments of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsarevich]], other times part of principal guest suite; 5: Apartments of the [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Tsarevna]]; 6: Apartments reserved for guests of the highest rank and members of the Imperial Family; 7: Nurseries of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891)|the 3rd]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|the 4th]] in line to the throne; 8: General private rooms of the Imperial Family; 9: Principal guest suite, used immediately after their marriage by [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]] and [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg|her husband]]]]
A second suite of state rooms running south to the Great Church was created for Catherine II. Between 1787–95, Quarenghi added a new eastern wing to this suite which contained the great throne room, known as [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] ''(13)'',&lt;ref name="Catherine II"/&gt; which linked the Winter Palace to Catherine's less formal palace, the Hermitage, next door. This suite was altered in the 1820s when the [[Military Gallery]] ''(11)'' was created from a series of small rooms, to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon. This gallery, which had been conceived by Alexander I, was designed by [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] and was built between June and November 1826 under Nicolas I; it was inaugurated on 25 October 1826.&lt;ref name="MobileReference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saint Petersburg Sights: a travel guide to the top 50 attractions in St. Petersburg, Russia (Mobi Sights)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9nT8K1RucUC&amp;pg=PT84|accessdate=13 April 2011|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60778-932-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1812 Gallery, the Tsar commissioned 332 portraits of the generals instrumental in the defeat of France. The artist was the Briton [[George Dawe]], who received assistance from [[Alexander Polyakov (artist)|Alexander Polyakov]] and [[Wilhelm August Golicke]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Nicholas I was also responsible for the creation of the Battle Galleries ''(19)'', which occupy the central portion of the Palace Square façade. They were redesigned by [[Alexander Briullov]] to commemorate the Russian victories prior to 1812. Immediately adjacent to these galleries celebrating the French defeat, were rooms ''(18)'' where [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg]], Napoleon's step-grandson and the Tsar's son-in-law, lived during the early days of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The website of The State Hermitage Museum records the Duke living in these rooms, soon after his marriage to the [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Tsar's daughter]], in 1839. The Tsar built the Duke and Duchess of Leuchtenberg the [[Marinsky Palace]] (completed in 1844), thus enabling the Duke to escape to what must have been less humiliating surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire of 1837===

{{Main|Fire in the Winter Palace}}
In 1833, de Montferrand was hired to redesign the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room ''(9 &amp; 10)''. In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls from room to room until it was too late to extinguish.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71"&gt;Norman, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green HermitageFire.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fire in the Winter Palace]]'' by Boris Green]]

Once detected, the fire continued to spread, but slowly enough that the palace guards and staff were able to rescue many of the contents, depositing them in the snow in Palace Square. This was no mean feat, as the treasures of the Winter Palace were always heavy furniture and fragile ornaments rather than lighter paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/valse/parttwo.html|title= Valse des fleurs|publisher=Sitwell, Sacheveral | accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a firebreak, the Tsar ordered the destruction of the three passages leading to the Hermitage, a fortunate act which saved the building and the huge art collection.&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_2_1_2.html|title= The Fire of 1837 and Restoration of the Winter Palace |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] witnessed the conflagration—"a vast bonfire with flames reaching the sky." The fire burned for several days, and destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interior.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71" /&gt;

Seeming to ignore the size of the palace, the Tsar ordered that the rebuilding be completed within a year. The [[Marquis de Custine]] described the "unheard of efforts" that were necessary to facilitate this. "During the great frosts 6000 workmen were continually employed; of these a considerable number died daily, but the victims were instantly replaced by other champions brought forward to perish."&lt;ref&gt;de Custine, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was supervised by [[Pyotr Kleinmichel]], who had already gained a reputation for ruthlessness when serving in the [[military settlement]]s under [[Arakcheev]].&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Richard Mowbray|title=Russia Enters the Railway Age, 1842-1855|year=1998|publisher=East European Monographs|location=Boulder|isbn=0-88033-390-1|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilding of the palace took advantage of the latest construction techniques of the industrial age. The roof was supported by a metal framework, while the spans of ceilings in the great halls were supported by iron girders.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; Following the fire, the exterior, most of the principal state suites, the Jordan staircase and the Grand Church were restored to their original design and decoration by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]]. Some of the rooms, such as the second largest room in the Winter Palace, the Armorial Hall, became far more ornate, however, with a heavy use of [[gilding|gilt]].&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The smaller and more private rooms of the palace were altered and decorated in various 19th-century contemporary styles by [[Alexander Briullov]] according to whims and fashion of their intended occupants, ranging from Gothic to rococo.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The Tsarevna's crimson boudoir ''(23)'', in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private Imperial apartments]], was a faithful reproduction of the rococo style, which Catherine II and her architects started to eliminate from the palace less than 50 years earlier. One of the palace's most notable rooms was created as a result of the fire when the Jasper Room, which had been destroyed, was rebuilt as the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]], the principal reception room of the Tsaritsa's suite. The Tsar himself, for all the grandeur he created in his palaces, loved the greatest simplicity. His bedroom at the Winter Palace was spartan, with no ornaments save for some maps and an [[icon]], and he slept on a camp bed with a straw mattress.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the palace==
[[File:Amorial Hall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Armorial Hall, or Guard Room, ''(11 on plan)'' is decorated with vast [[stucco]] [[panoply|panoplies]].]]

While the state rooms occupied the northern and eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, the four corners of the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This is one of the reasons that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the [[Tsarevna]], the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the [[Tsarevich]]'s and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/hermitage.asp|title=The Winter Palace and museum|publisher=Saint-Petersburg.com|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the formal home of the Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, frequent and lavish entertaining. The dining table could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no chairs were provided.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Queen Victoria]] from [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrandChurch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|The Winter Palace's Grand Church]] today retains its original rococo decoration. The [[onion dome]] above it is one of the few concessions to an older Russian architecture allowed to be visible from the exterior. Painting by [[Eduard Hau]]]]
Guests on ceremonial and state occasions would follow a set processional route, arriving at the palace courtyard through the central arch of the south façade, and then entering the palace through the state entrance (sometimes called the ambassadors' entrance) ''(38)''. They would then proceed through the [[colonnade]]d Jordan Hall before mounting the gilded [[Imperial staircase]] ''(8)'', from where the two enfilades of state rooms spread out. The principal or Jordan Staircase, so-called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], the Tsar descended in state for the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters, is one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original 18th century rococo style, although the massive grey granite columns were added in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p. 198" /&gt;

One of the most important rooms was the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Palace's Grand Church]] ''(16)''. Granted cathedral status, it was of greater religious significance than the chapels of most European royal palaces. It was here that Romanov weddings were usually celebrated with a rigid and unchanging tradition and protocol. Even the bride's dress, and the manner of donning it, was dictated by tradition. Dressed by the Empress, the bride and her procession would pass from the Malachite Drawing Room to the church through the state rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Family were not the only residents of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the [[servants' quarters]] that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Hermitage.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] portico to the extension of Catherine II's New Hermitage, Russia's first public art gallery.]]
After the death of Catherine the Great, the Hermitage had become a private treasure house of the Tsars, who continued collecting, albeit not on the scale of Catherine the Great. In 1850, the collection of [[Cristoforo Barbarigo]] was acquired. This collection from Venice brought into the Winter Palace further works by Titian, in addition to many 16th-century Renaissance works of art.

Nicholas I, conscious of the great art galleries in other European capitals, saw that Catherine the Great's Large Hermitage ''(15)'' was vastly expanded and transformed into a purpose-built public art gallery. In 1839, German architect [[Leo von Klenze]] drew up the plans and their execution was overseen by [[Vasily Stasov]], assisted by [[Alexander Briullov]] and [[Nikolai Yefimov]].&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watkin|first=David|title=A history of Western architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39T1zElEBrQC&amp;pg=PA504|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-459-9|page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Persianova1979"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Persianova|first=Olʹga|title=The Hermitage: room-to-room guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9UrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1979|publisher=Aurora Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; With so many architects involved there were inevitably many conflicts over the design and its execution throughout the 1840s, with the Tsar having frequently to act as moderator.&lt;ref name="Museum construction"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_2.html|title=Construction of the Public Museum |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, after eleven years of building and architectural conflict, the first art museum in Russia, the Imperial Hermitage Museum, opened on 5 February 1852.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; The trebeated facades of the building were inspired by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkelesque architecture]]. It was erected in grey marble round three courtyards and the complex is noted for the asymmetrical planning of its wings and floors.&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"/&gt; By order of the Tsar, visitors to the museum were required to wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]], even in the morning. The Tsar also decreed that grey top hats were "Jewish" and dress coats "revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having negotiated the dress code, what the public saw was a huge array of art, but only a fraction of the Imperial collection, as the Winter Palace and other Imperial palaces remained closed to the viewing public.

==The last Tsars (1855–1905)==
[[File:Александр II.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] photographed in his study (24) at the Winter Palace]]
The Winter Palace was an official residence of the Russian sovereign from 1732 until 1917; however, it was their home for little more than 140 of those years. The last Tsar to truly reside in the palace was [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who ruled from 1855 to 1881, when he was assassinated. During his reign there were more additions to the contents; acquisitions included the ancient and archaeological collection of the unfortunate [[Giampietro Campana|Marchese di Cavelli]] in 1861 and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Madonna and Child" in 1865; Leonardo's second work of that same name, the so-called "Benois Madonna", was later acquired in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_30.html|title=1914: Purchase of Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna with a Flower (Benois Madonna)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander II was a constant target for assassination attempts, one of which occurred inside the Winter Palace itself. This attempt on the Tsar's life was organized by a group known as [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya (Will of the People)]] and led by an "unsmiling fanatic", [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], and his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Sophia Perovskaya]], who later became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskaya, the daughter of a former Governor of Saint Petersburg, was well placed to learn information concerning happenings within the palace and through her connections learnt of repairs being carried out in the palace's basement.&lt;ref name="Cowles209" /&gt; One of the group, a trained carpenter, was subsequently enrolled as one of the workmen. Every day he carried dynamite charges concealed amongst his tools, placing them beneath the private dining room. So great was the quantity of dynamite that the fact there was an intervening floor between the dining room and the basement was of no significance.&lt;ref name=Cowles209&gt;Cowles, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were made to detonate the bomb on the evening of {{OldStyleDate|17 February|1880|5 February}}, assassinating the Tsar and Imperial family as they dined. Fortunately for the Romanovs, a guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, and for the first time in years dinner was delayed.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; As the family left the drawing room for the dining room the bomb exploded. So great was the explosion that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. The dining room was completely demolished and 11 members of the [[Finnish Guard]] in the Guard Room below were killed and a further 30 wounded.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; The incident represents one of the first uses of a [[time bomb]] for political purposes. The ''New York Times'' (March 4, 1880) reported "the dynamite used was inclosed in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man [[Alexander Keith, Jr.|Thomas]] in Bremen some years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Larabee|first=Ann|title=The Dynamite Fiend: The Chilling Tale of a Confederate Spy, Con Artist, and Mass Murderer|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|date=2005|isbn=9781403967947}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the revolutionaries were finally successful and Alexander II was assassinated as his carriage drove through the streets of Saint Petersburg. The Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure.&lt;ref name=Cowles216&gt;Cowles, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Family then moved to the seclusion of the [[Palace of Gatchina]], some {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Saint Petersburg. By comparison with the Winter Palace, the 600 room, moated Gatchina Palace, set within forests, was a cosy family home.&lt;ref name=Cowles216/&gt; When in Saint Petersburg, the Imperial Family resided at the [[Anichkov Palace]], while the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Large economies were made in food and wine. The Tsar was highly interested in the running costs of the Palace, insisting that table linen was not to be changed daily, and that candles and soap were not replaced until completely spent. Even the number of eggs used in an omelette was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tsar economised on household expenses, he added to the Imperial art collection of both the palace and the Hermitage. Officially, the Hermitage Museum had an annual buying allowance of 5,000 rubles, but when this proved insufficient the Tsar would himself purchase items for the museum.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]], the wife of Alexander III, saw that a garden was laid out in the centre of the main courtyard in 1885, an area previously cobbled and lacking vegetation. Court architect [[Nikolai Gornostayev]] designed a garden surrounded by a granite plinth and a fountain, and planted trees in the courtyard, laying limestone pavements along the walls of the palace.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum Romanovs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_3.html|title= The Last Romanovs |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son [[Nicholas II]]. The last Tsar suspended court mourning for his father to marry his wife [[Alix of Hesse]] in a lavish ceremony at the Winter palace.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ceremony the newlywed couple retired to the Anichkov Palace, along with the Dowager Empress. There they began their married life in six small rooms.&lt;ref name="Massie1967,61"&gt;Massie 1967, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Nicholas and Alexandra established themselves at the [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]]. This was to be their favoured home for the remainder of the reign. However, from December 1895 they did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. Architect [[Alexander Krasovsky]] was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the north-west corner of the palace, including the Gothic library.&lt;ref name="VarshavskiĭRest1985"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Varshavskiĭ|first1=Sergeĭ Petrovich|last2=Rest|first2=B.|title=The ordeal of the Hermitage: the siege of Leningrad, 1941–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsWfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1985|publisher=Aurora Art Publishers|isbn=978-0-8109-1406-3|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, the wife of Nicholas II was credited for the creation of another garden (35) on the former parade ground, beneath the windows of the Imperial Family's private apartments. She had found it disconcerting that the public could stare into her windows. The garden was created by [[landscape architect]] [[Georg Kuphaldt]], the director of the [[Riga]] city gardens and parks.&lt;ref name="kavere"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kāvere| first = Anne| title =Rīgas dārzu arhitekts Georgs Kūfalts.| language = Latvian| publisher=Jumava| location = Riga| pages = 107–108| year = 2007| oclc = 191090541| isbn = 978-9984-38-349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only one of [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|two gardens]] which remain today at the palace.

During the reign of Nicholas II, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of Saint Petersburg's high society.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247"&gt;Cowles, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Empress' opinion: "Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian."&lt;ref&gt;Radziwill, pp 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end. They were briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which "no one enjoyed",&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt; then even the theatricals ceased.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt;

The final great Imperial gathering at the Winter Palace was a themed fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei I]], which took place on 11 and 13 February 1903 ([[1903 Ball in the Winter Palace]]). Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovich]] recalled the occasion as "the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low."&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I, the Empress as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire, posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; for what was to be their final photograph together.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Russia was at [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Japan]], and the newborn [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich]] was secretly ill; the Tsar and the Empress permanently abandoned Saint Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Empress to be decadent and immoral&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo. Thus it was that the Winter Palace, designed and intended to impress, reflect and reinforce the Romanovs' power, lost its [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] over a decade before the fall of the dynasty it was intended to house and glorify.

===Fall of the House of Romanov (1905–1918)===

[[File:Nicholas II of Russia painted by Earnest Lipgart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nicholas II, last Tsar of all the Russias, in the [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|Nicholas Hall]]. Portrait by [[Earnest Lipgart]], early 1900s.]]
Following the Imperial Family's move to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo,&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; the Winter Palace became little more than an administrative office block and a place of rare official entertaining. Throughout the year, the family moved from one palace to another: in March, to [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]]; in May to [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] (not the great palace, but a 19th-century villa in its grounds); in June, they cruised upon the Imperial Yacht, [[Standart (yacht)|Standart]]; August was spent in Poland, at [[Spala]], September was spent back at Livadia, before a return to Tsarskoe Selo for the Winter.&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69&gt;Massie 1967, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar betrayed his private views of Saint Petersburg in 1912, while addressing a farewell party of dignitaries and family bidding him farewell, as the family left for warmer climes: "I am only sorry for you who have to remain in this bog."&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69/&gt; However, to the Tsar's ordinary subjects, the Winter Palace was seen not only as the home of the Tsars, but a symbol of Imperial power. In this role, it was to be at the centre of some of the most momentous happenings in Russia's early 20th century history. Three of these events stand out in Russia's history: The Bloody Sunday massacre of 1905; the opening of the first State Duma in 1906, which opened in St George's Hall (13); and finally the taking of the palace by revolutionaries in 1917.

The Bloody Sunday massacre was a result of the public ignorance of the Tsar's place of residence. It occurred on {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1905|9 January}} during a demonstration march by workers toward the Winter Palace.   The closest shootings of demonstrators occurred near St. Isaac's Cathedral at the entrance to the Aleksandr Gardens leading to the Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace. The massacre was sparked when a Russian Orthodox priest and popular working class leader, [[George Gapon|Father Gapon]], announced his intention to lead a peaceful protest of 100,000 unarmed striking workers to present a petition to the Tsar, to call for fundamental reforms and the founding of a constituent parliament.&lt;ref name=Kurth78&gt;Kurth, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters were unaware that the palace was little more than an uninhabited icon of Imperial power, and that the Tsar no longer resided there. The Tsar was not informed of the planned protest until the evening before, while no suggestion was made that the Tsar should meet a deputation or send representative to accept the petition.&lt;ref name=Kurth78/&gt; Instead, the Minister for the Interior drafted additional troops. As the strikers neared the palace bearing religious icons and singing the Imperial anthem, the Tsar's troops opened fire. While the number of casualties is disputed, moderate estimates average around 1,000 men, women and children killed or injured. The massacre, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, was a serious blunder on the part of the [[Okhrana]] and was to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It was also to be the catalyst for the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorres, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Subsequently, little changed politically in Russia during this period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty|tercentenary]], but the crowds that flocked to see the processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Russia was forced to go to [[World War I|war]] as a result of the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente Alliance]]. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, in one corner of an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.
[[File:Romanovs on Balcony.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1914, the Tsar and Empress bless their troops from the balcony of the Winter Palace.]]
In the initial stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] and [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully equipped hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_31.html |title=1914: Start of World War I.

[[File:Winterpalace1914hosp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1915, the Nicholas Hall, transformed to a hospital ward.]]
As the war went badly for Russia, its catastrophes were reflected in Saint Petersburg. The Tsar had decided to lead from the front, leaving the Empress to effectively rule Russia from Tsarskoe Selo. It was an unpopular move with both the Tsar's subjects and the Romanov family, as the Empress hired and fired indiscriminately often, it was supposed, on the advice of her favourite, [[Rasputin]]. Following Rasputin's murder by the Tsar's nephew-in-law in December 1916, the Empress' decisions and appointments became more erratic and the situation worsened and Saint Petersburg fell into the full grip of revolution.

Forced to accept the hopelessness of both the war and the situation at home, on 15 March 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich]]. The Grand Duke promptly refused to accept the throne without the support of the army and his people. A [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] was appointed and many members of the former Imperial family were arrested, including the former Tsar, the Empress and their children. No member of the Romanov family have lived in the Winter Palace since the abdication in 1917 and very rarely did after 1905. Nicholas II, his wife and children were all held in captivity until they were murdered at [[Yekaterinburg]] in 1918. Other members of the former Imperial Family either met similar fates or escaped into exile.

==The Seat of the Provisional Government (1917)==
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:Zimní palác (3).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rastrelli's Neva facade upon which ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' trained her guns]]
It was this turbulent period of Russian history, known as the [[February Revolution]], which for a brief time saw the Winter Palace re-established as a seat of government and focal point of the former Russian Empire. In February 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]], based itself in the north west corner of the palace with the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Room]] ''(4)'' being the chief council chamber. Most of the state rooms were, however, still occupied by the military hospital.

It was to be a short occupation of both palace and power. By 25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was failing and, realising the palace was a target for the more militant [[Bolshevik]]s, ordered its defence.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1917/dec/27/russia.fromthearchive |title=How the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace|work=The Guardian |location=UK (eyewitness account of the storming of the Winter Palace)|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All military personnel in the city pledged support to the Bolsheviks, who accused Kerensky's Government of wishing to "surrender Petrograd to the Germans so as to enable them to exterminate the revolutionary garrison."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Thus the provisional government, assisted by a few remaining loyal servants, who had formerly served the Tsar, barricaded themselves in the palace.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Many of the administrative staff fled, leaving the palace severely under-defended allegedly by some [[Cossack]]s, [[Cadet]]s, and 137 female soldiers from the [[Women's Battalion]]. Food ordered by the occupants of the palace was commandeered by the Bolsheviks, and, in a state of siege, the Winter Palace entered the most turbulent period in its history. According to Soviet history, five thousand sailors newly arrived from [[Kronstadt]] were deployed to attack the palace, while the cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]''  positioned itself on the Neva, all its guns trained towards the Palace. Across the water, the Bolsheviks captured the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and turned its [[artillery]] towards the besieged building. As the provisional Government, now impotent, hid in the private rooms of the former Imperial Family, nervously surveying the scenes outside,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  one by one the Government buildings in Palace Square surrendered to the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; leaving the palace seemingly only hours from destruction.

At 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm, the Government held its last meeting in the Malachite Room, with the telephone and all contact with the outside world disconnected.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; A short debate determined that they would not leave the palace to attempt dialogue with the hostile crowds outside. With the palace completely surrounded and sealed, the Aurora began her bombardment of the great Neva façade as the Government refused an ultimatum to surrender. Further [[machine gun]] and light artillery fire were directed at the palace as the Bolsheviks gained entry via His Majesty's own Staircase ''(36)''. In the ensuing battle there were casualties on both sides until the Bolsheviks finally, by 2:00&amp;nbsp;am, had control of the palace. Leaving a trail of destruction, they searched room after room before arresting the Provisional Government in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|Small Dining Room]] of the private apartment ''(28)'', from where they were taken to imprisonment in the Fortress across the river. Kerensky managed to evade arrest and escape to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the capital. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]], but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]].

[[File:Malachite Room by Konstantin Ukhtomsky.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Room]], seat of the Provisional Government, who were arrested in the adjoining Private Dining Room. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky]]
Following the Government's arrest, an alleged eye witness account by an unnamed source records that the Bolsheviks began rampaging:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents smashed or carried off. The library....was forced open and ransacked.....the Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. Desks, pictures, ornaments—everything was destroyed."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Winter Palace's wine cellars literally fuelled the weeks of looting and unrest in the city which followed. Arguably the largest and best stocked wine cellar in history,&lt;ref name="Figes1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Figes|first=Orlando|title=A people's tragedy: the Russian Revolution, 1891–1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSsGW-NqYVgC|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=March 1998|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-024364-2|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, [[Chateau de Calme|Chateau d’Yquem 1847]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orlandofiges.co.uk/aPeoplesTragedybyorlandofiges.php|author=Figes, Orlando|title=Storming the Palace|publisher=Cambridge University, PBS|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law. It has been said that Petrograd, "perhaps with the biggest hangover in history, finally woke up and got back to some order."&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

The Winter Palace was now a redundant and damaged building symbolic of a despised regime, facing an uncertain future. ''[[The Storming of the Winter Palace]]'' was a [[historical reenactment]] organised by the Bolsheviks on the 3rd anniversary in 1920. With thousands of Red Guards led by Lenin, and witnessed by 100,000 spectators, the reenactment has become one of the "best known" events of the Russian Revolution.

Ironically, the Red Guard actually broke into the palace through a back door that was left open, guarded by wounded and disabled reserves. This gave rise to the occasion being described as the birth of the Soviet state.&lt;ref&gt;Explorations in Saint Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], one of the original [[Troika (triumvirate)|troika]], which led the original storming, was so impressed by the re-enactment that he commissioned [[Sergei Eisenstein]] to make his film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]''. Certain features, such as the banks of floodlights which appear in Eisenstein's film indicate that Eisenstein was more influenced by the re-enactment than the original event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft467nb2w4&amp;chunk.id=d0e44&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress Bolshevik Festivals, 1917–1920] by James Von Geldern accessed 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard.

On 30 October 1917, the palace was declared to be part of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; This must have been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur [[Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, junior|Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov]], who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private apartments]] as the most badly damaged area of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, p158&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.

Following the Revolution, there was a policy of removing all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work.&lt;ref name="Brown1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Douglas|title=Doomsday 1917: the destruction of Russia's ruling class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w90ZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Putnam|isbn=978-0-399-11615-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the distinctions between the rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even the trappings of Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by the names of their new contents, such as The Room of German Art.

Following the 1941–1944 [[Siege of Leningrad]], when the palace was damaged, a restoration policy was enacted, which has fully restored the palace.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt; Furthermore, as the Russian Government does not categorically shun remnants of the Imperial Era as was the case during Soviet rule, the palace has since had the emblems of the Romanovs restored. The gilded and crowned double headed eagles once more adorn the walls, balconies and gates. The Winter Palace is no longer the hub of a great empire, and the Romanovs no longer reside there, but the crowned Russian eagle serves as a reminder of the palace's Imperial history.

Today, as part of one of the world's best known museums, the palace attracts an annual 3.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|title=St Petersburg: Swiss Architecture on the Neva (Domenico Trezzini 1727)|publisher=Presence Switzerland, Berne, Switzerland|accessdate=11 November 2008|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150025/http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|archive-date=16 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hið íslenzka fornritafélag''', or '''The Old Icelandic Text Society''' is a [[text publication society]]. It is the standard publisher of Old Icelandic texts (such as the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], [[kings' sagas]] and bishops' sagas) with thorough introductions and comprehensive notes.

The Society was founded in 1928 by [[Jón Ásbjörnsson]] and launched its text series of medieval Icelandic literature known as ''Íslenzk fornrit'' in 1933. The series was founded as an Icelandic-language edition along the lines of the German-language series ''Altnordische Saga-Bibliothek'' (published 1892–1929). The Society's publications are distributed by the [[Icelandic Literary Society]] (Hið íslenska bókmenntafélag).
