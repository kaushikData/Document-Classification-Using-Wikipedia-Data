'''16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence''' is an international campaign to challenge [[violence against women]] and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism|title=16 days of activism|publisher=UN Women www.unwomen.org|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign runs every year from 25 November, the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]], to 10 December, [[Human Rights Day]]. It was initiated in 1991 by the first Women's Global Leadership Institute, held by the [[Center for Women's Global Leadership]] (CWGL) at [[Rutgers|Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/16_days/en/|title=WHO {{!}} 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Women"/&gt;

Currently, more than 3,700 organizations from approximately 164 countries participate in the campaign annually.

== Themes ==

Every year, the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign either introduces a new theme, or continues an old theme. The theme focuses on one particular area of gender inequality and works to bring attention to these issues and make changes that will have an impact. The Center for Women's Global Leadership sends out a "Take Action Kit" every year, detailing how participants can get involved and campaign in order to make a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://16dayscwgl.rutgers.edu/about/the-annual-themes|title=The Annual Themes|last=|first=|date=|website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first campaign theme in 1991 was entitled ''Violence Against Women Violates Human Rights,'' and women from around the world came together with the Center for Women's Global Leadership at the first International Women's Leadership Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= |title=16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence – Violence Against Women Violates Human Rights |last= |first= |date= |website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership |publisher= |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was used again in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= |title=Second Annual Campaign of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence |last= |first= |date= |website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership |publisher= |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2000, the theme was ''Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the Campaign,'' in which participants would review the accomplishments of the last 10 years of the campaign and build upon those achievements.

The '''2011 Chişinău explosion''' was a car explosion in the center of [[Chişinău]], the capital of [[Moldova]]. The explosion killed the Moldovan tennis federation chief, Igor Turcan.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13680308 Car blast kills Moldovan tennis chief Igor Turca] ''[[BBC News]]'' 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/car-bomb-blasts-capital/ Car blast in Moldovan capital] ''[[Russia Today]]'' 7 June&lt;/ref&gt; He was heading the campaign for an independent candidate in last weekend's mayoral election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/moldovan-tennis-chief-dies-in-car-explosion-2294302.html Moldovan tennis chief dies in car explosion] ''[[The Independent]]'' 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2013 New York divorce torture plot''' was a [[sting operation]] conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] against a gang that had been kidnapping [[Jewish]] men and torturing them into granting their wives [[Get (divorce document)|gets]] (religious divorces). It began with the apprehension of Rabbi '''David Wax''',&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"&gt;Loder, Stephanie (May 15, 2014) [http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/05/15/orthodox-jewish-divorce/2149822/ "Stun Guns Forced Orthodox Divorce, Prosecutors Say"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the arrest of a group of rabbis from [[New York (state)|New York]] under the direction of '''Mendel Epstein''', including '''Jay Goldstein''', '''Binyamin Stimler''', and '''Martin Wolmark''', who were involved in the planned kidnapping and torture of a fictitious Jewish husband in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], with the purpose of obtaining from him a ''get''. Epstein and his men were found guilty of attempted kidnapping in 2015, and were sentenced to prison, while Epstein's son, '''David Epstein''', was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (April 21, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/04/21/lakewood-rabbi-kidnapping-trial/26125057/ "Rabbi Guilty of Kidnapping Conspiracy, Jury Finds"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main article|Jewish views on marriage#Divorce}}
A Jewish man is allowed to divorce his wife for virtually any reason by first receiving her permission, and then giving her a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]. If she is unwilling, and his complaint against her is substantial, he can pursue a [[heter meah rabbanim]] and remarry, although one is rarely awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm|title=Judaism 101: Divorce|website=www.jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|You have to watch the man, what his habits are, where he goes, how and where you can grab him. If you have a plan, then you call the people who do the kidnapping... There is such a thing called a stun gun, and they put such a tape or something so that it shouldn't leave a mark on the surface. They administer electric shocks and it's not a dangerous thing that can damage or kill.|Epstein co-conspirator Jay Goldstein describing the gang's abduction and torture methods during a recorded phone call on December 28, 1996.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}
A Jewish woman seeking a divorce from her husband must present her complaint to a [[beth din]] with the implication of a serious physical blemish or character defect. The husband must be willing to divorce his wife, for if he gives the get unwillingly, the divorce is invalid, and any future offspring of the wife would be considered [[mamzer]]s. If the circumstances truly warrant a divorce and the husband is unwilling, the [[dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] has the prerogative of instituting community shunning measures to "coerce him until he agrees," with physical force being reserved only for the rarest of cases.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Goldstein, Joseph; Schwirtz, Michael (October 11, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/nyregion/rabbis-accused-in-kidnapping-plot-to-force-men-to-grant-divorces/ "Rabbis Said to Use Torture For Fee to Force Divorce"], ''The New York Times'' {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"&gt;Bandler, Jonathan; Lieberman, Steve (October 10, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/10/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2959369/ "FBI Arrests N.Y.

It was in this grey area of [[halakha]] that in the mid-1980s a [[rabbi]] from [[Brooklyn]], New York, Mendel Epstein, began to advocate for women seeking religious divorces from their husbands.&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;Dickter, Adam (October 16, 2013) [https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/accused-kidnap-rabbi-known-for-wild-west-rules/ "Accused Kidnap Rabbi Known For ‘Wild West’ Rules"], ''The New York Jewish Week''&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed '''The Prodfather''' by the press due to his boast of using a [[cattle prod]] against his victims, Epstein started a divorce-gang which coerced these men to give the ''get''s through the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (December 15, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/12/15/lakewood-rabbi-epstein-divorce-gets/77351110/ "10-year Sentence for Lakewood 'Prodfather' Rabbi"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. laws prohibit [[kidnapping]], [[assault]], and [[torture]], some rabbis have gone on record anonymously to sanction these otherwise "inhumane" acts against "angry husbands."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gedalyahu, Tzvi (October 10, 2013) [http://www.jewishpress.com/news/fbi-arrests-ny-rabbis-for-beating-husbands-refusing-divorce/2013/10/10/ "FBI Arrests NY Rabbis for Beating Husbands Who Refuse Divorce"], ''Jewish Press''&lt;/ref&gt; If a man got so scared from this treatment as to suffer a [[heart attack]], Epstein would instruct his gang to "Take a right turn and let him die."&lt;ref name="NYDN1"&gt;Blau, Reuven (April 22, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J.

In 1991, [[fathers' rights movement|Father's Rights]] activist Monty Weinstein staged a protest with twenty-five people outside Epstein's home, with some carrying signs that read "Stop Mendel Epstein!"&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;

== Victims ==
* '''Abraham Rubin''': On October 23, 1996 in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], Rubin was shoved into a van, beaten and [[Electroshock weapon|stun-gunned]] in his genitals until he agreed to give his wife a get. After his 3-hour ordeal, he was left bruised, bloodied, handcuffed and blindfolded at the entrance to a cemetery. Charges were dropped against his attackers by Brooklyn [[district attorney]] [[Charles Hynes]] in 2000, after Rubin "could not identify any of his assailants."&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"&gt;Samaha, Albert (December 4, 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Josh; Italiano, Laura (October 11, 2013) [https://nypost.com/2013/10/11/orthodox-rabbis-beat-me-stun-gunned-my-genitals-suit/ "Rabbis beat me, stun-gunned my genitals"], ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stephen Weiss''': An accountant, Weiss came forward in 1998, alleging that his jaw, leg, and arm were broken in 1992 by members of a ring run by Epstein and Martin Wolmark, but no arrests were made. ''[[Newsday]]'' interviewed an additional dozen residents of Borough Park and [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], all of whom claimed that they were harassed, threatened, or assaulted by men working for their estranged wives. Hynes agreed to look into the charges but, despite pressure from the victims, declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Yisrael Bryskman''': On October 16, 2010, Bryskman, an [[Israel]]i citizen, was lured from New York to the Lakewood home of David Wax, an accomplice of Epstein, where he was promised employment as a typist of [[Talmud]]ic texts.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; Bryskman entered Wax's home shortly before midnight, was shown into a second-story bedroom, and was immediately punched in the face, breaking his nose.

Teitelbaum was punched in the face, had four of his teeth knocked out, his head pushed through a wall, and his mouth stuffed with dirty socks when he tried to scream for help. When he asked why they were beating him, seeing that Chaimowitz was the one they were after, one of his attackers quoted the Talmudic dictum, "Woe to the evildoer, woe to his neighbor."&lt;ref name="December 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men Hold"&gt;Jones, Abigail (April 8, 2015) [http://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/17/fighting-be-free-lengths-orthodox-jewish-women-will-go-get-320536.html "In Orthodox Jewish Divorce, Men Hold All the Cards"], ''Newsweek''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 2, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/brooklyn_man_testifies_he_was_victim_in_lakewood_r.html "'Give A Divorce,' Attackers Yelled As They Beat Men, Victim Testifies In Lakewood Rabbi Trial"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wax implicates Epstein ==
In October 2010, David Wax and his wife Judy were arrested for their part in the Bryskman kidnapping, and Wax subsequently agreed to testify as a government witness, claiming Epstein was the head of the operation and that his son David was present in the bedroom during the Bryskman beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (February 18, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/02/lakewood_rabbi_and_three_others.html"Lakewood Rabbi Trial Underway for Kidnap, Torture of Husbands"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship dated back to the 1980s, when Epstein had forced a divorce for Wax's sister. The Bryskman case was what led federal authorities in New Jersey to begin their investigation of Mendel Epstein for his role in the crime.&lt;ref name="David Wax"&gt;Samaha, Albert (May 7, 2014) [https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/05/07/david-wax-pleads-guilty-implicates-mendel-epstein-in-nj-divorce-extortion-case/ "David Wax Pleads Guilty, Implicates Mendel Epstein in NJ Divorce Extortion Case"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI sting operation ==
In the summer of 2013, a woman dialed Martin Wolmark, an accomplice of Epstein, and told him a story about a husband who refused to give her a get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt; Wolmark said:

{{quote | You need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end...getting a guy like Mendel Epstein who's a hired hand...You need to get him to New York where someone either could harass him or nail him, plain and simple.&lt;ref name="For Role"&gt;(December 14, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/rabbi-sentenced-for-role-in-divorce-coercion-ring.html "Rabbi Sentenced for Role in Divorce-Coercion Ring"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (February 19, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/rabbi-forced-divorce-plot-spoke-hired-hand-call-article-1.2122195 "Rabbi Accused in Forced Divorce Plot is Called 'Hired Hand' who would 'Harass or Nail' Husband in Phone Recording"], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 14, 2013, she visited Epstein in Lakewood with another man she said was her brother. Epstein said to the two visitors:

{{quote | This is an expensive thing to do. Basically what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

The man then asked about Epstein's effectiveness, to which he replied:

{{quote | Wait a minute here. I guarantee you that if you're in the van, you'd give a get to your wife. You probably love your wife, but you'd give a get when they finish with you. Hopefully, there won't even be a mark on him. We prefer not to leave a mark. Because then when you do, they do go to the police, the police look at the guy. . . and basically the reaction of the police is, if the guy does not have a mark on him, then, 'Is there some Jewish crazy affair here?' They don't get involved.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein explained he would need $10,000 to approve the coercion at the [[beth din]], and $60,000 for the "tough guys", who would use [[karate]],&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; rope, a screwdriver, and plastic bags over the men's heads to get them to cooperate.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; And if all else fails, then:

{{quote | We take an electric cattle prod. If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move, you put it in certain parts of the body and in one minute the guy will know.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein also told the woman that he would not be present at the attack, planning instead to be out and about, and suggested that she do the same, explaining that being seen in public would provide them with an alibi.&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Barbara (January 25, 2017) [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/Rabbis-in-strong-arm-divorces-challenge-convictions.html"Rabbis in Strong-arm Religious Divorces Ask Court to Overturn Convictions"], ''Philly.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests ==
On October 9, 2013, 8 men wearing [[Halloween mask]]s, [[ski masks]], and [[bandanas]] &amp;ndash; one wore a [[Metallica]] [[ T-shirt]] on top of his clothes &amp;ndash; came to a warehouse in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], where they [[Muscle contraction|flexed]] and [[Shadowboxing|shadow-boxed]] as they waited for their prey, the 'recalcitrant husband' who did not exist.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Details"&gt;Lieberman, Steve and Bandler, Jonathan (October 11, 2013).

Epstein was arrested separately in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;(October 11, 2013) [http://westchester.news12.com/news/prominent-rabbi-mendel-epstein-arrested-in-divorce-extortion-case/ "Two Prominent Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Arrested in Divorce Extortion Case"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''News12 Westchester''&lt;/ref&gt;

During a federal court hearing the following day in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Gribko told a judge, "They didn't do it out of religious conviction. They did it for money."&lt;ref name="Divorce:Feds"/&gt;

On May 6, 2014, Wax pleaded guilty in federal court in New Jersey to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. He named the men arrested the previous October as his accomplices.&lt;ref name="David Wax"/&gt;

== Criminal trials ==
The trial of the main defendants commenced on February 18, 2015 at the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] in Trenton.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt; On April 21, they appeared before District Judge [[Freda L. Wolfson]], whereupon Mendel Epstein was convicted of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, while accomplices Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler were additionally convicted of attempted kidnapping. David Epstein was acquitted, in part by defence attorney Henry Mazurek's contention that David was in a business meeting in [[Cincinnati]] during Usher Chaimowitz's beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 26, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/lakewood_rabbis_son_wasnt_involved_in_forced_divor.html "Lakewood Rabbi's Son Wasn't Involved in Forced Divorce, Executive Testifies"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, Martin Wolmark, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion, was sentenced to more than 3 years in prison.&lt;ref name="For Role"/&gt; The next day, at his own sentencing, Mendel Epstein told the judge: 

{{quote | Over the years, I guess, I got caught up in my tough guy image. Truthfully, it helped me &amp;ndash; the reputation &amp;ndash; convince many of these reprobates to do the right thing."&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (December 15, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/12/lakewood_rabbi_sentenced_to_10_years_in_prison_for.html"Lakewood Rabbi Sentenced to 10 years in Prison for Divorce Kidnappings"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Epstein and Stimler were sentenced to 10 years and 3 years respectively. Wolfson said during the proceeding that "No one is permitted to commit acts of violence against another," and that the sentence was necessary in order to deter others in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community from engaging in similar paid vigilantism.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"/&gt;

One day later, Goldstein was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. Six other co-defendants also pleaded guilty before trial, and were sentenced to up to 4 years.&lt;ref name="NYDN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="December 15"&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Two Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Sentenced To Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-sentenced-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands-force-them|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Apr 21, 2015) [https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2015/three-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-convicted-of-conpsiracy-to-kidnap-jewish-husbands-in-order-to-force-them-to-consent-to-religious-divorces/ "Three Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap Jewish Husbands in Order to Force Them to Consent to Religious Divorces"], ''U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Sentenced To Eight Years In Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/orthodox-jewish-rabbi-sentenced-eight-years-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Rabbinical judge David Eidensohn of Monsey, New York said, "I'm shocked that people who call themselves rabbis would get involved in coercion." According to Eidensohn, if a woman obtains a get in such a manner and remarries, "her marriage is not legal and she would be considered living in sin. If she has children, the children are considered born out of wedlock, and that's considered a disgrace in the community."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

[[Samuel Heilman]], professor of sociology and Jewish studies at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] said, "Using force, that's the way it used to be done centuries ago. Most Jews don't operate like that anymore, but in this community... it's a sort of fundamentalist view."&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia, Mareesa (October 13, 2013). [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/13/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2976271/ "Orthodox Leaders Struggle with Divorce Gang History"], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moshe David Tendler]], rabbi and professor of medical ethics at [[Yeshiva University]] said, "The idea that a beth din can issue an order for coercion is baloney, a hoax." While conceding that he had "been with [Epstein] on matters," Tendler nevertheless considered him "unreliable."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

'''Teng Fu-ju''' ({{zh|t=鄧福如|s=邓福如|p=Dèng Fúrú|first=t}}; born 20 June 1987), known by her [[stage name]] '''A-fu''' ({{zh|c=阿福|p=Ā fú}}), is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] singer and songwriter. Prior to her solo debut in the music scene, A-fu was a member of Lazy Bomb, an indie band, and a [[Demo (music)|demo]] singer. She is known for her [[cover version]] of "[[Nothin' on You]]" by [[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]], which drew wide attention on [[YouTube]] in 2010. In May 2011, A-fu released her debut studio album, ''That's How It Is'', for which she received a nomination for Best New Artist at the [[23rd Golden Melody Awards]].&lt;ref name="goldenmelody"/&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Hsinchu City]] on 20 June 1987, A-fu grew up in the countryside in [[Xiangshan District, Hsinchu|Xiangshan District]] and in [[Changhua County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/ENT6/7966023.shtml |title=菲船事件衝擊 阿福MV郵輪夢碎 |work=UDN |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=22 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619002332/http://udn.com/NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/ENT6/7966023.shtml |archivedate=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both her parents run a rental car business together, and as they were often busy with work when she was young, A-fu and her elder sister, Hsing Ju, spent much of their childhood under the care of their aunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20130730000847-260112 | title=阿福發夢穿越古羅馬 談情賞夜景 | work=China Times | date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, A-fu still maintains a close relationship with her mother and grew up influenced by her mother's love for music, in particular songs by [[Teresa Teng]]. At a young age, A-fu entered in singing and recitation competitions. Also, at her mother's request, she learned the standard Mandarin enunciation by watching the Taiwanese educational programme ''The Daily Characters'' (每日一字) hosted by news presenter Lee Yen-chiu, which perhaps, has shaped her distinctive vocals, in a way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.udn.com/hurt633/5230339 | title=美聲素人「阿福」- 征服9億人 | work=UDN | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended Kuang-Fu High School, a [[comprehensive high school]] in Hsinchu, and graduated from [[Shih Hsin University]] with a degree in public relations and advertising in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.shu.edu.tw/web/dp/a_pc/shut01_pc5.html |title=公共關係暨廣告學系 - 知名校友 |work=SHU |accessdate=22 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223044116/http://m.shu.edu.tw/web/dp/a_pc/shut01_pc5.html |archivedate=23 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Afu teng 2013aug31 resized.jpg|thumb|A-fu in 2013.]]

During her college years, A-fu was the lead singer of an indie band called Lazy Bomb. The band released a self-titled [[Extended play|EP]] in November 2007 and disbanded shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.5music.com.tw/CDList-C.asp?cdno=428475678514 | title=首張同名EP | work=5music | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, A-fu met music producer AL (何官錠), who is also a member and keyboard player of the pop rock band Six Plus (六甲樂團).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nownews.com/n/2010/10/12/633978 | title=神祕女「聲」爆紅！四十萬網友問何方神聖？ | work=NOWnews | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started collaborating with AL as a [[Demo (music)|demo]] singer. The first demo which she recorded, titled "Sheng Sheng Man" (聲聲慢), was chosen as the ending theme song for the first season of the Chinese TV series ''[[Justice Bao (2010 TV series)|Justice Bao]]''. The ''Zhong guo feng'' music style of the song, coupled with A-fu's crystal-clear voice and diction, generated considerable buzz among the Chinese netizens. Soon after, A-fu's singing caught the attention of veteran host [[Chang Hsiao-yen]], who later signed A-fu to her record label Forward Music. While awaiting the release of her debut album, A-fu garnered media attention after uploading her first video on [[YouTube]] in September 2010, her [[cover version]] of [[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]]'s "[[Nothin' on You]]", which had racked up more than a million views within a week. She followed with more covers of popular hits, which includes "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]",  "Qing Hua Ci" (青花瓷) by [[Jay Chou]], [[Bruno Mars]]'s "[[Just the Way You Are (Bruno Mars song)|Just the Way You Are]]" and so forth. In December 2010, A-fu was featured as a [[backup singer]] during Stella Chang's comeback concert in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="2011搜尋人氣大獎／最受歡迎新人歌手─鄧福如"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tw.celebrity.yahoo.com/news/2011%E6%90%9C%E5%B0%8B%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%A3%E5%A4%A7%E7%8D%8E-%E6%9C%80%E5%8F%97%E6%AD%A1%E8%BF%8E%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%BA%E6%AD%8C%E6%89%8B-%E9%84%A7%E7%A6%8F%E5%A6%82-035402599.html | title=2011搜尋人氣大獎／最受歡迎新人歌手─鄧福如 | work=Yahoo! | accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abda and Abdjesus''' were two [[Christian]] [[bishops]] who were [[martyr]]ed at [[Kashkar (East Syrian Diocese)|Kashkar]] under [[Shapur II]]{{#tag:ref|The Greek text states that they suffered under the brother of King [[Ardashir II]] (i.e.: "ἀπεστάλη στὸ Μβεὴτ Λαβάτ, πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀρσήθ").&lt;ref name=SYNAX&gt;{{gr icon}} [http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/3197/sxsaintinfo.aspx Οἱ Ἅγιοι Αὐδᾶς, Αὐδιησοῦς, Βενιαμὶν καὶ ἄλλοι τριάντα ὀκτὼ Μάρτυρες]. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that under the reign of [[Shapur II|Shapur]], [[Ardashir II]] had served as governor-King of Adiabene, where he had reportedly persecuted Christians.|group=note}} on 16 May, in either 366 AD or 375 AD.&lt;ref name="SYNAX"/&gt; They were first placed between heavy boards to crush their bones, and later beheaded.

There may have been a political aspect to the persecution, since the king was attempting to establish [[Zoroastrianism|Mazdeism]] as the state religion and judged Christians as the natural allies of the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/53420 Lucchesi, Giovanni. "Santi Abda and Ebedieso", Santi e Beati, July 20, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In 339-340 the king began the prosecution with the help of Jews and [[Magi]] of bishop of [[Seleucia]] and Ctesifonte, Simeone Bar Sabbã, having accused him in the friendly support of [[Roman Empire]]. The historian [[Sozomen]] wrote about 22 martyrs who were tortured together. In his book he mentioned Abdas and Abdjesus in 15-th and 16-th places in his list of martyrs. This information is worth of trusting because it was written in less than 100 years after their death. ll of the martyrs were first interrogated by the king but later he charged  his brother [[Ardashir II|Ardashir]] to continue. He urged the martyrs to deny Christ and worship the Sun, but they were firm in their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/53420/ Santi Abda e Ebedieso Martiri, 16 maggio] Retrieved on 8 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Their feast day is commemorated on 16 May according to the ''Martyrologium Romanum,'' the ''Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]] of the [[Orthodox Church]]'', and in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Church]] as well. The biographical text ''[[Ausgewählte Akten Persischer Märtyrer]]'' by Oskar Braun also mentions the names of several of the other martyrs, including:
:*16 priests - Abdallah, Simeon, Abraham, [[Abda of Kashkar]], [[Ajabel]], Joseph, Han, Ebedjesu, Abdallah, John, Ebedjesu, Maris, Berhadbesciaba, Rozichaeus, Abdallah, and Ebedjesu
:*9 deacons - Eliab, Ebedjesu, Marjab, Maris, Abdias, Berhadbesciaba, Han, Simeon, and Maris
:*6 monks - Papa, Evolesus, Ebedjesu and others, and
:*7 unnamed virgins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lychnos.org/calendar/brendan-the-navigator-abbot-of-clonfert/2024-05-16/ Saints and Feasts] Retrieved on 8 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Ahusan Ihusan''' (born 3 June 1986, [[Male']], [[Maldives]]) is a controversial [[Maldives|Maldivian]] [[Journalist]],  a self-employed web designer and the owner of [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] publications; ''Dhiislam Magazine'' and ''Dhiislam Online'' news.

Ali Ahusan Ihusan is considered by many as one of the many Islamic extremist elements who facilitated the coup of 7 February 2011 in the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhivehisitee.com/parliament/islamic-extremism-maldives-alive-killing/|title = Islamic extremism in the Maldives: alive and killing - Dhivehi Sitee|date = 2012-10-19|website = Dhivehi Sitee|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for creating one of the promotional websites supporting the mass protest held on 23 December 2011 in Maldives which was supported by many Islamists of the Maldives. This mass protest played an important role in overthrowing President [[Mohamed Nasheed]]'s Government on 7 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC]]|date=7 February 2011|title= Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed resigns amid unrest|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16922570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Minivan News]]|year=2011|title=Protests proceed peacefully as a majority defends Islam]|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128090357/http://minivannews.com/politics/protests-proceed-peacefully-as-a-majority-defends-islam-29826|archive-date=28 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|last=Ahmed|first=F.|date=14 December 2011|title=Police summon protest website developer|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|access-date=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022211026/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39233|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Haveeru Daily]]|date= 23 December 2011|title= LIVE: Maldivians gather in Male for 'religious' protests (archived copy)|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352  |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111204729/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested for 24 hours by [[Maldives Police Service]] after the publication of the website which openly issued death threats to anyone who is against the doctrine of Islam ([[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic Fundamentalism]]) he followed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://english.sun.mv/675|title = Criminal Court orders release of Ahsan and custody of Hilath|website = Sun Online|access-date = 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his lawyer, Mohamed Shaheem Ali Saeed, a Maldivian Islamic scholar infamous for his illicit relations with women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minivannewsarchive.com/politics/raajje-tv-runs-footage-of-sheikh-shaheem-and-alleges-sex-scandal-30504|title=Raajje TV runs footage of Sheikh Shaheem and alleges sex scandal {{!}} Minivan News – Archive|website=minivannewsarchive.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitated his release.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Maldives Police Service later stated that they wanted to clarify as to who instructed him to develop the website and as to who published the information on it. On the following day after Ali Ahusan's release, Ali Ahusan modified the page himself  by putting a message on its homepage saying, "we'll come out against you with machetes if you protest."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Haveeru Daily]]'' 23 December 2011| LIVE: Maldivians gather in [[Male']] for 'religious' protests {{cite web|url=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111204729/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39352 |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he was neither arrested or questioned regarding this.

'''Alī ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Alī''' ({{lang-ar|علي بن محمد بن علي}}{{lrm}}; 829-868 [[Common Era|C.E.]] ) commonly called ''' al-Hadi''' (the one who shows right path) and  '''Alī an-Naqī''' was the tenth of [[the Twelve Imams]] after his father [[Muhammad al-Jawad]] and before his son [[Hasan al-Askari]]. He remained in [[Medina]] teaching until the age of 30 when he was summoned to [[Samarra]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] [[Al-Mutawakkil]]. There he was treated roughly by the caliph and his successors until, according to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned through intrigue of [[Al-Mu'tazz]] the Abbasid caliph, in 254/868, and was buried in Samarra.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabatabai|first1=Sayyid Muhammad Husayn|others= Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] | authorlink=Allameh Tabatabaei | title= Shi'ite Islam|publisher=SUNY press|pages=183–184| year=1997| isbn=0-87395-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chittick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabåatabåa'åi|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title=A Shi'ite Anthology|date=1981|others=Selected and with a Foreword by [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]]; Translated with Explanatory Notes by [[William Chittick]]; Under the Direction of and with an Introduction by [[Hossein Nasr]] |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585078182|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madelung|first1=Wilferd|title=ʿALĪ AL-HĀDĪ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-al-hadi-abul-hasan-b|website=Encyclopedia of Iranica|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=43–44|isbn=978-0-300-03531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
According to the most accurate reports he was born in 828 in a village near [[Medina]] called Sorayya&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt; to the ninth Shiite Imām, Muhammad al-Taqi, (also known as Imam [[Muhammad al-Jawad]]), and Lady Samānah or Susan, who was originally a [[Berber people|Berber]]&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt; (from Northwest Africa). His father bestowed upon him the surname ''Abul-Hasan'', after the surnames given to his grandfather [[Ali al-Ridha]] and his great grandfather [[Musa al-Kadhim]]. To differentiate between these three Abul Hasan, narrators usually call Musa al-Kadhim, abul Hasan the first, call Ali al-Ridha, Abul Hasan the second and call al-Hadi Abul Hasan the third.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moezzi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moezzi|first1=Mohammad Ali Amir|title=The Divine Guide in Early Shi'ism : The Sources of Esotericism in Islam|date=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585069722|page=65,174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imamate==
After his father's death in 835, Ali al-Hadi assumed the official role of [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamate]] at the age of 7 or 8. The followers of his father were in agreement on his Imamate, except for a minor group who gathered around his older brother Musa who when dissociated himself from them, they turned to al-Hadi.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt; [[Historians]] have mentioned that after his father's assassination at the will of [[Al-Mu'tasim]], the Abbasid caliph ordered Umar bin al-Faraj to find a teacher in [[Medina]] for the young Imam (that must be one of the enemies of the [[Ahlul Bayt]])  in order to prevent Shiites from meeting him. He found al-Junaydi for this task, however, al-Junaydi often reported on the Imam's intelligence saying that the boy would provide perspectives on literature and understanding of the [[Quran]] and the revelations within. Al-Junaydi, impressed by him, concluded that it could only be by divine causes that the boy could be so knowledgeable, as a result, he dropped the animosity he had held towards the family of the prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Al Askari Mosque.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Al-Askari Mosque]] before the [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|2006 bombing]]]]
Throughout the later years of his [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamate]], which coincided with the eight remaining years of the caliphate of [[Al-Mansur]], and five years of the caliphate of next caliph [[Al-Wathiq]], he lived peacefully in [[Medina]] engaging himself in teaching a large number of pupils mostly from [[Iraq]], [[Iran|Persia]], and [[Egypt]]. later on, however, the new Caliph, [[Al-Mutawakkil]], became suspicious of the young Imam and decided to watch him more closely.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Dwight M.|title=The Shi'ite Religion: A History of Islam in Persia and Irak|year=1933|pp=210–216|publisher=BURLEIGH PRESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summoning to Sammara===
After [[Al-Mutawakkil]] came to throne, the governor of [[Medina]], ʿAbdallāh ibn Moḥammad, wrote the caliph warning him about the activity of al-Hadi saying that he was given money with which he could buy weapons that could be used to revolt against the Caliph. When al-Hadi learned of what Abdullah bin Muhammad had told the caliph, he sent a letter to Mutawakkil defending himself against the accusations and complained about the governor.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt; Apparently convinced of the harmless piousness of al-Hadi, Motawakkel wrote back to al-Hadi stating that he had deposed the governor. He nevertheless asked the Imam to come to [[Samarra]] (a military camp, not far from [[Baghdad]] which was the capital of [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] at the time).{{efn|according to Madelung this letter as quoted by Kolaynī and Shaikh Mofīd may be authentic though its date was wrongly conveyed to Mofid as 243/857 instead of 233/848.}} At the same time, Mutawakkil ordered Yahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, to go to Medina both to investigate Abdullah's claims and to bring al-Hadi to Samarra. Yahya then searched the Imam's house and found nothing more than copies of the [[Quran]] and other religious books. It is said that when the imam approached Baghdad many people gathered to see him. The governor of the city himself rode out of the city to welcome him and stayed a part of night with him. At Sammera, however, the caliph did not immediately receive him, though assigned a house for his staying.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moezzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=386–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Mutawakkil had no reason to be suspicious of al-Hadi, he insisted that he stay in Samarra under house arrest. According to [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]], he was still able to move in the city and communicate with his followers, giving them instructions or receiving through them the annual [[Khums]] (the financial contributions of the faithful).&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;

====Narration====
Yahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, is narrated to have reported his experience as follows: "The Caliph Mutawakkel sent me to Medina with orders to bring Ali ibn Muhammad to answer certain accusations that had been made against him. When I arrived, his household made such wailing and lamentation as I had never heard. I tried to quiet them and assured them that I had received no orders to do him any harm. And when I searched the house where he lived, I found only a Quran, books of prayer and such things. So while I took him away, I offered him my services and showed him very high respect. But one day on the journey, when the sky was clear and the sun just rising, Ali put on a cloak when he mounted his horse and knotted the animal's tail. I was surprised at this, but it was only a little while afterwards that a cloud came up and there was a regular torrent of rain. Then Ali turned to me and said, ''I know that you did not understand that you saw me do, and that you imagine that I have had some unusual knowledge of this affair. It is not, however, as you supposed, but as I was brought up in a desert, I know the winds that come before rain. This morning the wind blew which does not deceive, and I noticed the odor of rain and so prepared for it.'' On our arrival in Baghdad, our first visit was to Ishak ibn Ibrahim, of the family of Tahir, who was the governor of the city. He said to me, ''O Abu Yahya, this man (Ali) is a descendant of  the Apostle of God. You know Mutawakkil, and have influence with him, but if you urge him to kill this man, the Prophet, himself will be your enemy.'' I replied that I saw nothing in  the conduct of Ali except what was altogether praiseworthy.
I went on to Samarra, where I saw Wasif, the Turk, for I was one of his intimate friends. ''I swear before God,'' he said to me, ''if a single hair of the head of this man falls, I will myself demand satisfaction.'' I was somewhat surprised at the attitude taken by these men, and when I informed Mutawakkil of what I had heard in praise of the Imam, he gave him a handsome present and treated him with all sorts of honor."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble Arguments==
Al-Hadi contributed to the books of ''argumentation'' that were compiled by Shiite scholars among which was a theological treatise on human [[Free Will]] and some other short texts and statements ascribed to al-Hadi are quoted by Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan ibn ʻAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn Shuʻbah al-Harrānī.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With a Hashemite clan member===
It is said that once a scholar came in where al-Hadi had a meeting with masters of [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] (the clan prophet Muhammad had belonged to). Al-Hadi seated the scholar beside himself and treated him with great respect. The Hashemite protested saying: "why do you prefer him to the masters of [[Banu Hashim]]?’
Al-Hadi said: "Beware to be from those whom God has said about, ''Have you not considered those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God that it might
decide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw''.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:23 Quran, 3:23]}}
Do you accept the [[Quran|Book of God]] as a judge?" asked al-Hadi. They all said, "O son of the [[Muhammad|messenger of God]], we do." Then al-Hadi tried to prove his stance by saying, "Has [[God]] not said ''God will exalt those of you who believe, and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees?''{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#58:11 Quran, 58:11]}}
God does not accept for a knowledgeable believer but to be preferred to an unknowledgeable believer, just as He wants a believer to be preferred to an unbeliever. God has said, ''God will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees''. Has He said, ''God will exalt those, who are given honor of lineage, in high degrees?'' God has said, ''Are those who know and those who do not know alike?''{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#39:9 Quran, 39:9]}} Then, how do you deny my honoring him for what God has honored him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With ibn as-Sikkit ===
On one occasion, al-Mutawakkil organized a conference to be held in his palace with theologians and jurisprudents he had invited. He had asked Ya'qub ibn Isaak known as ibn as-Sikkit to ask al-Hadi the questions that he didn't think the Imam could answer. One of the questions was that why God had sent [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] with the rod and white hand, sent [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] with the healing of the blind and leprous and giving life to the dead, and sent [[Muhammad]] with the [[Quran]] and sword?
Al-Hadi's answer goes as follows:
"Allah sent Moses with the rod and white hand in a time where the predominant thing among people was magic. Therefore, Moses came to them with that and defeated their magic, dazed them, and proved authority over them. And Allah sent Jesus Christ with the healing of the blind and leprous and the giving of life to the dead by the will of Allah in a time where the predominant thing among people was medicine. Therefore, Jesus Christ came to them with that and defeated and dazed them. And Allah sent Muhammad with the Quran and sword in a time where the predominant things among people were sword and poetry. Therefore, Muhammad came to them with the Quran and sword and dazed their poetry, defeated their sword, and proved authority over them." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With Yahya ibn Aktham===
[[Yahya ibn Aktham|Yahya bin Aktham]] was another scholar who was invited to try the imam. It is said that after al-Hadi's answer to Yahya's questions, he turned to al-Mutawakkil and advised him saying, "We do not like you to ask this man about anything after my questions to him … In showing his knowledge there will be strengthening to [[Rafida]] (the Shiite)." One of the questions is the following:&lt;ref name="Qarash399-403"&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=399–403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tell me why [[Ali]] (the first Shiite Imam) killed the people of (the battle of) [[Battle of Siffin|Siffin]] …whether they were attacking or fleeing and he finished off the wounded, but on the day of al-Jamal ([[Battle of the Camel]]) he did not ... Rather, he said, ''Whoever keeps to his house will be safe.'' Why did he do that? If the first decision was right, so the second would be wrong."

Al-Hadi replied: "The [[Imam]] of the people of the Battle of the Camel was killed and they had no leader to refer to. They went back to their homes without fighting, deceiving, or spying. They were satisfied (after the defeat) not to fight any further. But the people of Siffin belonged to a prepared company with a leader who supplied them with spears, armor, and swords, caring for them, giving them good gifts, preparing great monies for them, visiting their sick, curing their wounded, giving sumpters to their footers, helping their needy, and returning them to the fight…"&lt;ref name="Qarash399-403" /&gt;

===Theological argumentations===
Whether or not it was possible to see God, was one of the common issues discussed at the time of al-Hadi who believed it was impossible to see Him. He argued that "seeing is not possible if there is no air (space) between the seer and the seen thing through which sight goes through. If there is no air and no light between the seer and the seen thing, there will be no sight. When the seer equals the seen thing in the cause of sight between them, sight takes place, but those who compare the seer (man) to Allah, they are mistaken because they liken Allah to man…for effects must relate to causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue that the Imam dealt with was the belief that God has a body (the embodiment of God). Al-Hadi chastised those who believed it and stated that, "He, who claims that Allah is a body, is not from us, and we are free from him in this world and the after-world...body (substance) is created, and it is Allah Who has created and embodied it."&lt;ref name="Qarashi119"/&gt; To attribute Allah with embodiment is to characterize Him with need and to limit Him to a body. Essentially, it is wrong to equate God with created things due to His nature as our creator.&lt;ref name="Qarashi119"&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ali al-Hadi also expressed strong feelings about the impossibility of describing God's Essence. The rationale behind his objection was that God is so great that, as humans, we are incapable of conceiving how truly amazing He is, and that the only one that can truly describe God is God Himself. He then uses this as a segue into the belief that true Muslims, the Prophet, and the [[The Fourteen Infallibles|infallible imams]] cannot be described either, because their obedience to God draws them closer to the Essence of God, and descriptions cannot wholly encompass their virtuous qualities that result from submitting to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humiliating the Imam and al-Mutawakkel's death==
It is said that Mutawakkil showed courtesy toward the imam in [[Samarra]], and even preferred his judgment to other [[Faqīh|Faqihs]]; in the same time however, he troubled and even tried to kill the Imam.{{efn|It is said that Mutawakkil once gave order for his assassination and "In open durbar he ordered his chamberlain to bring the imam to his presence, and summoned four servants with naked swords to stand ready when the order was given to slay him. When the Imam left the hall of audience, the four servants stood by the door with drawn swords, but instead of striking him they threw away the swords, and fell at his feet and humbly saluted him. Mutawakkil inquired the cause of such strange conduct. They said that they saw near the Imam a person with a drawn sword 'who said: 'If you give any trouble to the Imam I will slay you all,' so they dared not obey the Caliph's order to slay him."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;}}{{efn|According to Tabatabai Mutawakkil especially opposed to Ali, whom he cursed openly. He even ordered the mausoleum of Husayn in Karbala to be torn down to the ground.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen"/&gt;
Mutawakkel was  envious of the Imam because Imam’s position was exalted among the public. He wanted to belittle the Imam. His [[vizier]] counseled him, recommending him to give up, because it would make the public blame and criticize him. But he paid no attention to his [[vizier]].&lt;ref&gt;Qarashi2007p.416&lt;/ref&gt; To try to humiliate the Imam, Motawakkil ordered that the Imam along with the officials and notables, (so that it wouldn't look like the act was intended for the imam) dismount and travel on foot during a hot summer day while the caliph remained mounted on his horse. Zuraqa the chamberlain of al-Mutawakkil has narrated that he saw the Imam  who had almost suffered a heat stroke, was breathing and sweating hard, so he approached him to calm him down by saying "Your cousin (Mutawakkil) did not intend to hurt you particularly." Al-Hadi looked at him and said "Stop that!" And then recited this [[Quran]]ic verse, ''Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied''.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#11:65 Quran, 11:65]}} The ''promise'' here refers to the punishment which is mentioned in the previous verse for unjust people .{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#11:64 Quran, 11:64]}} Zuraqa related that he had a  Shiite teacher who had been among his intimate friends. Zuraqa says "when I went home, I sent for him. When he came to me, I told him about what I heard from the Imam. He changed color and said to me, ''Be careful and store all what you have! Al-Mutawakkil shall die or be killed after three days.'' I was affected by his speech and asked him to leave. Then I thought with myself and said that it would not harm me to take precautions. If something like that happened, I would have taken my precaution, and if not, I would lose nothing. I went to the house of al-Mutawakkil and took all my money. I deposited them with one of my acquaintances."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three days of that event, plotters assassinated the caliph; one of the assassins was actually his son, al-Muntasir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account of this prediction stated that the Imam was imprisoned by the caliph, and it was that act which provoked the Imam to foretell of his death.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;

==Character==
Ali al-Hadi was given a vast number of descriptive names throughout his life, among which al-Naqi (the pure one), al-Hadi (the Guide) were the most famous. However al-Askari (military; due to the town he had to live in was a military camp), [[Faqīh]] (jurisprudent), al-Aalim (knowledgeable) and At-Tayyib (generous, kind-hearted, good-natured…) were also among his epithets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is said that al-Hadi exhibited extreme generosity, though himself at times had no money to pay with either. An example of which is an account that describes how a nomadic man came to the Imam to tell him of how he was heavily in debt and in need of assistance. Al-Hadi, being short of money himself, gave the man a note saying that he was in debt to the nomad, and instructed him to meet the Imam in a place where he had a meeting, and to insist that the Imam pay back the recorded debt. The nomad did as he was told, and the Imam apologized to the nomad in front of those at the meeting for being incapable of paying him back. The officials at the meeting reported the Imam's debt to the caliph, al-Mutawakkil, who then sent the Imam 30,000 [[dirham]]s, with which he then presented to the nomad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Twelver Shiism, he is described as being endowed with the knowledge of the languages of the [[Persian language|Persians]], Slavs, Indians and [[Nabataeans]] in addition to foreknowing unexpected storms and as accurately prophesying other events. In the presence of al-Mutawakkil, he unmasked a woman falsely claiming to be [[Zaynab bint Ali|Zaynab]], daughter of [[Ali]], by descending into a [[Asiatic lion#Former range|lion]]'s cage in order to prove that lions do not harm true [[Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib|descendants of Ali]]&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; (a [[Hijaz Mountains#Wildlife|similar miracle]] is attributed to his great-grandfather, [[Musa al-Kadhim]]).&lt;ref name="Sheikh al Mufid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/masoom/bios/7thimam.html |title=The Infallibles Taken from Kitab al Irshad By Sheikh al Mufid |accessdate=2008-11-20 |work=al-islam.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hadi's miracles made some people to believe the claim of some Heretics like Ibn Hasakah who preached to people that al-Hadi was in fact God, and that they themselves were prophets sent by the imam to guide the [[Muslim]]s. It is quoted from al-Hadi as denying them and instructing people about the extremists saying "Desert them! May Allah curse them. Block them up into narrow passages and if you find any of them, split his head with stone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Qarashi|2007|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Al-Askari Mosque 2006.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Al-Askari Mosque]] in [[Samarra]], Iraq destroyed by bombings twice in 2006–2007]]

Al-Hadi was poisoned by an agent of Al-Mu'tazz, who was the Abbasid leader of the time, and passed away in the year 254 of the Islamic calendar (868 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jawadi|first1=Allama Zeeshan Haider|title=Nuqoosh Ismat|page=747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Damatus Sakiba, Volume 3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anwarul Husainia, Volume 2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sawaiqul Mohriqa|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tadkira Khawasul Ummah, Nurul Absar|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hijri Gregorian Converter|url=http://www.islamicity.org/hijri-gregorian-converter/#|website=IslamiCity|publisher=IslamiCity}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Hasan al-Askari]] became the Imam after him.

The [[Al-Askari Shrine|tomb of al-Hadi]], which became also the tomb of his son Hasan al-Askari afterwards, is an important place of Shiite pilgrimage. It was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adamec|first1=Ludwig W.|title=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810871724|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another attack was executed on 13 June 2007, which led to the destruction of the two minarets of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast hits key Iraq Shia shrine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6747419.stm|accessdate=September 14, 2016|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi blast damages Shia shrine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4738472.stm|accessdate=September 14, 2016|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in Iraq said Al Qaeda was responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Bowley (13 June 2007). "Minarets on Shiite Shrine in Iraq Destroyed in Attack". New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hadi's son [[Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi|Abū Jafar Muhammad]], is said to had died before his father in [[Samarra]]. His other sons were Hasan and Ja'far, from whom [[Hasan al-Askari|Hasan]] became the next Imam.&lt;ref name="Madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; According to some sources and pedigrees belonged to [[Naqvis]], however, four more sons namely Hussain, Abdullah, Zaid, and Mussa are attributed to the tenth Imam.{{efn|The statement of 7 sons has been made by "Moulvi Syed Basheer Hussain compiler of "Shajrat-e-Saddat-e-Amroha". These seven names have also been referred in by the writer of book "Anwar-e-Alsadat" remarking the point of controversy in number of sons. In addition, there are at least two personalities whose hand written pedigree from top (Ali al-Naqi) to bottom confirm the sons of Imam Ali al-Naqi al-Hadi as seven in number.&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naqvi|first1=Syed Maqsood|title=Riaz-ul-Ansab|date=1991|publisher=Izhar Sons Printer|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=81|language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Naqvi"/&gt;

Besides Hasan al-Askari, three sons, Hussain, Muhammad, and Jafar, as well as one daughter, Ailia, from different wives have been mentioned by various biographic [[scholars]], including [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|Shaikh Mufeed]]. Issues of these sons are traceable in different pedigree books published by researchers from time to time.&lt;ref name="Najfi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Najfi|first1=Maulana Syed Safdar Hussain |title= Ahsanul Maqal ( Translation of Arabic Book Muntahal Aamaal fi tarikh al-Nabi wal Aal compiled by [[Abbas Qumi|Sheikh Abbas Qumi]]) |date=2014| publisher= Misbahulquran Trust |location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=261–262 |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abidi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed Ali|first1=Syed |title=Hazrat Imam Ali Naqi (Translation of Book compiled by Association of Writers of Idra Dar-e-Raha Haq, Qum Iran |date=1991| publisher= Dar'us Saqafa ul-Islamia |location=Karachi, Pakistan|page=5 &amp; 6 |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naqoosh e Ismat"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Jawwadi |first1=Syed Zeeshan Haider |title= Biography of 14 Infallibles |date=2000| publisher= Mahfooz Book Agency (2nd Edition) |location=Karachi, Pakistan|page=588 |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4671">'''ʿAmmar ibn ʿAlī ibn Abī al-Ḥusayn al-Kalbī''' was a member of the [[Kalbid]] family and a military commander for the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in its [[Arab–Byzantine wars|wars]] with the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Sicily]] and [[southern Italy]] in the 950s.

==Biography==
As evidenced by his ''[[nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]'', Ammar hailed from the Arab [[Banu Kalb]] tribe, and belonged to an aristocratic family established in [[Ifriqiya]] since the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]]. The family had evidently embraced the [[Fatimid]] regime after the overthrow of the [[Aghlabids]] in 909, and his father Ali had served the Fatimids with distinction, being killed by the rebellious populace in [[Agrigento]] in 938. Along with his brother [[al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi|Hasan]], Ammar belonged to the close circle around [[Jawdhar]], the powerful chamberlain and chief minister of Caliph [[al-Mansur Billah]].{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=240}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=‘Ammār b. ‘Alī b. Abī l-Ḥusayn (#20275)}}

In spring or early summer 956, Caliph [[al-Mu'izz]] dispatched him to [[Sicily]] at the head of a [[Fatimid navy|fleet]], to confront the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Ammar inflicted a heavy defeat on the Byzantine fleet, and the Fatimids under Ammar's brother Hasan and [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] scored further victories and raided [[Calabria]]. The local Byzantine commander, [[Marianos Argyros]], visited the caliphal court and arranged for truce, but it was soon broken and warfare resumed. In spring 957, Ammar crossed from Sicily to Calabria, but the Fatimids themselves suffered heavy losses in a storm. Another effort by Argyros to renew the truce in autumn failed, and in the next year, Ammar and Hasan defeated his forces in Sicily; but soon after, as the Fatimid fleet was returning from Calabria to Sicily, it was again wrecked in a storm off [[Palermo]], in which Ammar perished (on 24 September 958, according to the ''[[Cambridge Chronicle (medieval)|Cambridge Chronicle]]''; [[al-Maqrizi]] places these events two years earlier). As a result, al-Mu'izz accepted new Byzantine proposals for a renewed five-year truce. Ammar's body was recovered among the wreckage, and buried by his brother Hasan in Sicily.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=‘Ammār b. ‘Alī b. Abī l-Ḥusayn (#20275); al-Ḥasan b. ʻAlī b. Abī l-Ḥusayn al-Kalbī (#22558)}}{{sfn|Halm|1996|pp=394–396, 403–404}}

Ammar's son [[al-Hasan ibn Ammar al-Kalbi|Hasan]] also served against the Byzantines in Sicily and Italy before going to newly conquered [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]],{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=241–242, 320}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=al-Ḥasan b. ‘Ammār al-Kalbī (#22562)}} where he rose to become chief minister under Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] in 996–997, before being overthrown and executed by [[Bajarwan]].{{sfn|Daftary|1992|pp=186–187}}

'''Azathoth''' is a deity in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and [[Dream Cycle]] stories of writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and other authors.  He is the ruler of the [[Outer God]]s.

==H. P. Lovecraft==

===Inspiration===
The first recorded mention of Azathoth was in a note Lovecraft wrote to himself in 1919 that read simply, "AZATHOTH—hideous name". Mythos editor [[Robert M. Price]] argues that Lovecraft could have combined the biblical names [[Anathoth]] ([[Jeremiah]]'s home town) and [[Azazel]]—mentioned by Lovecraft in "[[The Dunwich Horror]]".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, [https://archive.is/20090108052810/http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/63/70/ "The Dunwich Horror"], ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Price also points to the [[alchemy|alchemical]] term "[[Azoth]]", which was used in the title of a book by [[Arthur Edward Waite]], the model for the wizard Ephraim Waite in Lovecraft's "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, ''The Azathoth Cycle'', pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another note Lovecraft made to himself later in 1919 refers to an idea for a story: "A terrible pilgrimage to seek the nighted throne of the far daemon-sultan Azathoth."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Price, ''The Azathoth Cycle'', p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Frank Belknap Long]], Lovecraft ties this plot germ to ''[[Vathek]]'', a novel by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] about a supernatural [[caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Frank Belknap Long, June 9, 1922; cited in Price, ''The Azathoth Cycle'', p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft's attempts to work this idea into a novel floundered (a 500-word fragment survives, first published under the title "[[Azathoth (short story)|Azathoth]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythostomes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=70 "H. P. Lovecraft's original fragment, 'Azathoth'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814112342/http://mythostomes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=70 |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the journal ''Leaves'' in 1938),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/fiction/az.asp "Publication History for H. P. Lovecraft's 'Azathoth'"], The H. P. Lovecraft Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; although Lovecraftian scholar Will Murray suggests that Lovecraft recycled the idea into his [[Dream Cycle]] novella ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'', written in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''The Azathoth Cycle'', p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price sees another inspiration for Azathoth in [[Lord Dunsany]]'s [[Mana-Yood-Sushai]], from ''[[The Gods of Pegana]]'', a creator deity "who made the gods and thereafter rested." In Dunsany's conception, MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI sleeps eternally, lulled  by the music of a lesser deity who must drum forever, "for if he cease for an instant then MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI will start awake, and there will be worlds nor gods no more." This oblivious creator god accompanied by supernatural musicians is a clear prototype for Azathoth, Price argues.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''The Azathoth Cycle'', pp. viii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
Aside from the title of the novel fragment, ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'' was the first fiction by Lovecraft to mention Azathoth:

{{bquote|[O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity&amp;mdash;the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, ''The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath'', in ''At The Mountains of Madness'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lovecraft referred to Azathoth again in "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931), where the narrator relates that he "started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] beyond angled space which the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' had mercifully cloaked under the name of Azathoth".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Whisperer in Darkness", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Here "nuclear" most likely refers to Azathoth's central location at the nucleus of the cosmos and not to [[Nuclear physics|nuclear energy]], which did not truly come of age until after Lovecraft's death.

In "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]" (1932), the protagonist Walter Gilman dreams that he is told by the witch Keziah Mason that "He must meet the [[Nyarlathotep|Black Man]], and go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos.... He must sign in his own blood the book of Azathoth and take a new secret name.... What kept him from going with her...to the throne of Chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name 'Azathoth' in the ''Necronomicon'', and knew it stood for a primal horror too horrible for description."&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dreams in the Witch House", ''At the Mountains of Madness'', pp. 272–273.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman wakes from another dream remembering "the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen flute", and decides that "he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the ''Necronomicon'' about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, "The Dreams in the Witch House", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; He later fears finding himself "in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of Chaos wherein reigns the mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth".&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, "The Dreams in the Witch House", p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet Edward Pickman Derby, the protagonist of Lovecraft's "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]", is a poet whose collection of "nightmare lyrics" is called ''Azathoth and Other Horrors''.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Thing on the Doorstep", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last major reference in Lovecraft's fiction to Azathoth was in 1935's "[[The Haunter of the Dark]]", which tells of "the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose center sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demonic flute held in nameless paws".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Haunter of the Dark", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to a friend who jokingly claimed descent from Jupiter, Lovecraft drew up a detailed genealogy charting his and fellow novelist Clark Ashton Smith's shared descent from Azathoth, through Lovecraft's creation [[Nyarlathotep]] and Clark-Smith's [[Tsathoggua]], respectively.  As nowhere stated in Lovecraft's published work, primordial Azathoth here is made ancestor, through his children Nyarlathotep, "The Nameless Mist," and "Darkness," of [[Yog-Sothoth]], [[Shub-Niggurath]], [[Nug and Yeb]], [[Cthulhu]], [[Tsathoggua]], several deities and monsters unmentioned outside the letter, and a few of Lovecraft's and Ashton-Smith's fancifully-posited human forbears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Selected Letters of H.

==Other writers==

===August Derleth===
Many other Mythos writers have referred to Azathoth in their stories. [[August Derleth]], in his novel ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'', depicts the entity as a leader in a cosmic upheaval akin to [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion in [[Christian mythology]]. In a passage attributed to the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' of [[Abdul Alhazred]], Derleth writes:

{{bquote|(T)hose daring to oppose the [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]] who ruled from Betelgueze, the [[Great Old Ones]] who fought against the Elder Gods...were instructed by Azathoth, who is the blind idiot god, and by [[Yog-Sothoth]]....&lt;ref&gt;August Derleth, ''The Lurker at the Threshold'', in ''The Watchers Out of Time'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another passage, Derleth quotes a prophecy:

{{bquote|(Y)e blind idiot, ye noxious Azathoth shal arise from ye middle of ye World where all is Chaos &amp; Destruction where He hath bubbl'd and blasphem'd at Ye centre which is of All Things, which is to say Infinity....}}

The Elder Gods punished Azathoth by rendering him mindless and blind, according to Derleth.

===Ramsey Campbell===
In "[[The Insects from Shaggai]]", [[Ramsey Campbell]] describes the extraterrestrial creatures of the title as worshippers of "the hideous god Azathoth", practicing "obscene rites" that involved "atrocities practiced on still-living victims" in Azathoth's conical temple. After fleeing from the destruction of their home planet of [[Shaggai]], the [[Insects from Shaggai|insects]] teleported the temple across the universe, eventually ending up in a forest near Campbell's fictional town of [[Goatswood]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Campbell, "The Insects from Shaggai", ''The Azathoth Cycle'', pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Shea, the narrator of Campbell's story, enters the temple after visiting the forest and discovers a twenty-foot idol that "represented the god Azathoth&amp;mdash;Azathoth as he had been before his exile Outside":

{{bquote|[I]t consisted of a [[bivalve|bivalvular]] shell supported on many pairs of flexible legs. From the half-open shell rose several jointed cylinders, tipped with [[polyp]]ous appendages; and in the darkness inside the shell I thought I saw a horrible bestial, mouthless face, with deep-sunk eyes and covered with glistening black hair.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, "The Insects from Shaggai", pp. 89, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the story's climax, Shea catches a glimpse of "what the idiot god might ''now'' resemble":

{{bquote|I saw something ooze into the corridor&amp;mdash;a pale grey shape, expanding and crinkling, which glistened and shook gelatinously as still-moving particles dropped free; but it was only a glimpse, and after that it is only in nightmares that I imagine I see the complete shape of Azathoth.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, "The Insects from Shaggai", pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "[[The Mine on Yuggoth]]", Edward Taylor had found Azathoth's other name, N______ (not given in full) in the [[Revelations of Glaaki]]. If one is confronted by a mythos being, the name, if spoken, will scare it away. Edward Taylor fails to use it.

===Gary Myers===
[[Gary Myers (writer)|Gary Myers]] makes frequent mention of Azathoth in his stories, both those set in the Lovecraftian [[Dreamlands]] and those set in the waking world.  In "The Snout in the Alcove" (1977), the dreamer protagonist is distressed to find himself in the Dreamlands to which he had vowed never to return.  He had made his vow because of a prophecy which said that:

{{bquote|[P]resently the benign Elder Ones would be deposed by infinity’s Other Gods, who would drag the world down a black spiral vortex to the central void where the demon sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark....&lt;ref&gt;Gary Myers, "The Snout in the Alcove", ''The Year's Best Fantasy Stories 3'', pp. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "The Last Night of Earth" (1995), the Dreamlands sorcerer Han briefly ponders:

{{bquote|[T]he allegorical figure of Azathoth, the primal monster who had given birth to the stars at the beginning of time, and who, according to an obscure tradition, would devour them at its end.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, "The Last Night of Earth", ''The Azathoth Cycle'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "The Web" (2003), the two teen protagonists read this passage from an internet version of the ''Necronomicon'':

{{bquote|Azathoth is the Greatest God, who rules all infinity from his throne at the center of chaos. His body is composed of all the bright stars of the visible universe, but his face is veiled in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, "The Web", ''The Disciples of Cthulhu II'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Thomas Ligotti===
[[Thomas Ligotti]]'s [[short story]] "The Sect of the Idiot" ([[1988 in literature|1988]]) mentions a circle of non-human worshippers composed of wizened, hideous creatures. The story's [[epigram]]&amp;mdash;a "quotation" from the ''Necronomicon''&amp;mdash;reads "The primal chaos, Lord of all... the blind idiot god&amp;mdash;Azathoth," suggesting that it is that entity whom the creatures worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ligotti, "The Sect of the Idiot" (1988), ''The Azathoth Cycle'', 93&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligotti has stated that many of his short stories make allusions to Lovecraft's Azathoth, although rarely by that name. An example of this is the story "Nethescurial", which portrays an omnipresent, malevolent, creator deity once worshipped by the inhabitants of a small island. This being slowly infiltrates the life of the story's narrator, first via a manuscript describing its cult.

===Nick Mamatas===
[[Nick Mamatas]]'s [[2004 in literature|2004]] novel ''[[Move Under Ground]]'', set in a world where [[Cthulhu]] has taken power and only the [[Beat generation|Beats]] oppose him, the power of the Great Old Ones twists the [[constellation]]s into new shapes, using them as vessels for his surrogates; among them, [[Jack Kerouac]] observes the "red stars of Azathoth". [[Neal Cassady]] later becomes a chosen one of Azathoth, gaining immense powers to be used against Cthulhu in the process.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game===
In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' RPG]], Azathoth is categorized as an [[Outer God]] together with Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, and others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==''The Azathoth Cycle''==
In 1995, [[Chaosium]] published ''The Azathoth Cycle'', a [[Cthulhu Mythos anthology]] focusing on works referring to or inspired by the entity Azathoth. Edited by Lovecraft scholar [[Robert M. Price]], the book includes an introduction by Price tracing the roots and development of the Blind Idiot God. The contents include:

== Diseases and conditions treated ==

=== Cystic Fibrosis ===
[[Cystic fibrosis]] (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a [[genetic disorder]] that affects mostly the lungs, but also the [[pancreas]], [[liver]], [[kidneys]], and [[intestines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = BP | last2 = Freedman | first2 = SD | year = 2009 | title = Cystic fibrosis | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9678| pages = 1891–904 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60327-5 | pmid = 19403164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major advances over the past few years in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) have resulted in dramatic improvements in longevity and [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] for many patients. However, [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] dysfunction remains responsible for much of the [[morbidity]] and mortality associated with the disorder. Physiotherapy has long played an important role in the respiratory management of the disease, and has had to adapt to the changes in disease pattern from infancy to adulthood. The role of the physiotherapist is not limited to airway clearance, but also includes encouragement and advice regarding exercise, [[Neutral spine|posture]] and mobility, inhalation therapy and, in the later stages of the disease process, non-invasive respiratory support. It is generally felt that the use of [[chest physiotherapy]] in CF has lacked good scientific basis, and the current call for [[evidence-based medicine]] requires physiotherapists to scrutinize their practice closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1305881 | pmid=10911816 | volume=93 Suppl 38 | title=Physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis | year=2000 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=27–36 | last1 = Prasad | first1 = SA | last2 = Tannenbaum | first2 = EL | last3 = Mikelsons | first3 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) ===
[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), among others, is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by chronically poor airflow. It typically worsens over time. The main symptoms include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], cough, and excess [[sputum]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Vestbo, Jørgen (2013). "Definition and Overview". Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; As COPD gets worse, subject may be short of breath even when one does simple things like get dressed or fix a meal. It gets harder to eat or exercise, and breathing takes much more energy. People often lose weight and get weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/tc/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-overview|title=COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)-Topic Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) ===
[[Deep vein thrombosis]], or deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scarvelis | first1 = D | last2 = Wells | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = Diagnosis and treatment of deep-vein thrombosis | journal = CMAJ | volume = 175 | issue = 9| pages = 1087–92 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.060366 | pmid = 17060659 | pmc=1609160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as [[venous thromboembolism]].

== Techniques ==

=== Chest physiotherapy:Postural drainage ===

=== Active cycle of breathing techniques ===
The ''active cycle of breathing techniques'' (ACBT) is a flexible regimen comprising breathing control, [[thoracic]] expansion exercises and the FET, frequently combined with gravity-assisted positioning. Increasing [[lung volumes]] during thoracic expansion allows air to get behind distal secretions via collateral ventilatory channels. During a [[forced expiratory volume|forced expiratory]] manoeuvre, compression and narrowing occurs within the airways at a point dependent on lung volume (the equal pressure point). This is shifted distally as a forced expiration is continued to low lung volume, thereby mobilizing peripheral secretions.

This technique has been reported to be an effective and efficient means of airway clearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pryor | first1 = JA | last2 = Webber | first2 = BA | year = 1979 | title = Evaluation of the forced expiration technique as an adjunct to postural drainage in treatment of cystic fibrosis | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 417–18 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6187.417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wilson GE, Baldwin AL, Walshaw MJ.

== Assessment Tests ==

=== 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) ===
[[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] is an evidence-based intervention for the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In clinical practice, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to assess changes in functional exercise capacity in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation with the primary outcome reported being the distance walked during the test (i.e. 6MWD). The 6MWD has demonstrated [[internal validity|validity]] and [[Reliability (research methods)|reliability]] after one familiarisation test and the capacity to detect changes following pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition to assessing the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation, 6MWD may be used to quantify the magnitude of a patient's disability, prescribe a walking programme, identify patients likely to benefit from a rollator and to identify the presence of exercise-induced [[hypoxemia]].

== Current concepts ==
[[Randomized trial]]s have demonstrated that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can improve [[dyspnea]], exercise tolerance, and health-related quality of life. Rehabilitation has traditionally been provided in [[Health care#Secondary care|secondary care]] to patients with moderate to severe disease. However, current concepts are recommending that it should be delivered in a primary and community care setting for patients with milder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Shoulder|url=https://www.local-physio.co.uk/articles/shoulder-pain/frozen-shoulder|publisher=www.local-physio.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several opportunities for spreading the word for PR in primary care. One of these is to improve access to PR for all those disabled by their disease by the increase of community schemes. One such scheme being utilised in [[Health care in Canada|Canada]] is reviewed. The essential components of PR include behavior change, patient self-management and prescriptive exercise. In the last decade new strategies have been developed to enhance the effects of exercise training. An overview of these new approaches being an adjunct to exercise training is reviewed. Although the role of exercise training is well established, we are only just beginning to appreciate the importance of behavior change and patient self-management in contributing to improved health and diminished healthcare resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ambrosino | first1 = N | last2 = Casaburi | first2 = R | last3 = Ford | first3 = G | last4 = Goldstein | first4 = R | last5 = Morgan | first5 = MD | last6 = Rudolf | first6 = M | last7 = Singh | first7 = S | date = Jun 2008 | title = Developing concepts in the pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD.

'''Castor and Pollux''' were two [[elephant]]s kept at the [[zoo]] [[Jardin des Plantes]]&lt;ref&gt;Sources are split on the location of the elephants. There were zoos at both gardens, and both kept elephants around the time of the siege.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]]. They were killed and eaten, along with many other animals from the zoo, in late 1870 during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|Siege of Paris]]. The two elephants may have been siblings, and were named after the [[Castor and Pollux|twin brothers]] of Greek and Roman mythology. They had been popular before the siege for giving rides on their backs around the park, but the food shortages caused by the German blockade of the city eventually drove the citizens of Paris to kill them for their [[Elephant meat|meat]].

==History==
On 19 September 1870, Prussian forces encircled Paris. Rather than bombarding the city into surrender the German high command decided to blockade the city to force a quick surrender. The Parisians managed to hold out until 28 January 1871 (when they surrendered after three days of shelling ordered by [[Otto von Bismarck]] who had tired of the ineffective tactics of the high command). During the siege food became scarce and the populace were forced to turn to unusual sources for their meat.
[[File:Menu-siegedeparis.jpg|thumb|left|The Christmas Day menu from a Parisian restaurant featured fine wines and dishes of exotic animals.]]

When vegetables, butter, milk, cheese and the regularly consumed meats began to run out, the Parisians turned first on the [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s. [[Horse meat]] had been introduced by the butchers of Paris four years earlier as a cheap alternative source of meat for the poor, but under siege conditions it quickly became a luxury item. Though there were large numbers of horses in Paris (estimates suggested between 65,000 and 70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege) the supplies were ultimately limited. Champion racehorses were not spared (even two horses presented to [[Napoleon III]] by [[Alexander II of Russia]] were slaughtered) but the meat soon became scarce. [[Cat meat|Cats]], [[Dog meat|dogs]], [[mice]] and [[rat]]s were the next selection for the menu. There was no control over rationing until late in the siege, so while the poor struggled, the wealthy Parisians ate comparatively well; the Jockey Club offered a fine selection of gourmet dishes of the unusual meats including ''Salmis de rats à la Robert''. There were considerably fewer cats and dogs in the city than there had been horses, and the unpalatable mice and rats were difficult to prepare, so, by the end of 1870, the butchers turned their attention to the animals of the zoos. The medium and large sized [[herbivore]]s, such as the [[antelope]], [[camel]]s, [[deer]], [[kangaroo]], [[yak]]s and [[zebra]] were first to be killed. Some animals survived: the [[monkey]]s were thought to be too akin to humans to be killed, the [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s were too dangerous, and the [[hippopotamus]] of the Jardin des Plantes also escaped because the price of 80,000 [[French franc|francs]] demanded for it was beyond the reach of any of the butchers. Menus began to offer exotic dishes such as ''Tête d'Ane Farcie'' (Stuffed Donkey's Head), ''Côtes d'Ours'' (Bear Ribs), ''Chat flanqué des Rats'' (Cat with Rats), ''Cuissot de Loup, Sauce Chevreuil'' (Haunch of [[Wolf]] with a Deer Sauce), ''Terrine d'Antilope aux truffes'' ([[Terrine (food)|Terrine]] of Antelope with [[truffles]]), ''Civet de Kangourou'' ([[Kangaroo meat|Kangaroo]] Stew) and ''Chameau rôti à l'anglaise'' (Camel roasted ''à l'anglaise'')

The demise of the elephants was recorded in the ''[[Lettre-Journal de Paris]]'' (commonly known as the ''Gazette des Absents''), a twice-weekly periodical published during the siege by [[Damase Jouaust]] and delivered, along with the mail, by [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] to avoid the encircling Prussian forces. The ''Gazette des Absents'' reported that Castor had been killed on 29 December 1870 and Pollux the following day, both by [[Dum-dum|explosive steel-tipped bullets]] fired from a range of 10&amp;nbsp;m by M. Devisme. However, a menu from 25 December was already offering ''Consommé d'Eléphant'' so it is likely that the dates are wrong. The elephants were bought by M. Deboos of the  Boucherie Anglaise in [[Boulevard Hausmann]] for 27,000 francs for the pair. M.Deboos did well out of the purchase: the trunks sold as a delicacy for 40 or 45 francs a pound, the other parts for about 10 to 14 francs a pound. By all accounts, elephant was not tasty. [[Thomas Gibson Bowles]], who was in Paris during the siege, wrote that he had eaten camel, antelope, dog, donkey, mule and elephant and of those he liked elephant the least. [[Henry Labouchère]] recorded:

{{quote|text=Yesterday, I had a slice of Pollux for dinner. Pollux and his brother Castor are two elephants, which have been killed. It was tough, coarse, and oily, and I do not recommend English families to eat elephant as long as they can get beef or mutton.&lt;ref&gt;Labouchère January 6th&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Chief''' (1932–1968) was a horse owned by the [[United States Army]]. He has been credited as the Army's last living operational [[Horses in warfare|cavalry mount]]. Mustered into service in 1940 in [[Nebraska]], Chief was posted to [[Fort Riley]] and served with the [[9th Cavalry Regiment|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment]]s before being sent to the U.S. Army Cavalry School. In 1949–1950, he was put out to pasture and eventually died in 1968.

==Early life and military service==
Chief was foaled in 1932 and added to the cavalry muster roll in 1940 at [[Fort Robinson]], having been purchased that year from LA Robinson of [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]], for $163.&lt;ref name="neb"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chief, 1932–1968 |url = https://history.nebraska.gov/collections/chief-1932-1968-rg4261am |website = History Nebraska |publisher = Nebraska History Museum |access-date = June 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[bay (color)|bay]] with white markings, standing 15.25 hands (15.49 dm) high and weighing {{convert|1,030|lbs|adj=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Shuford |first1 = E.L. |title = Death of 'Chief' Ended Cavalry Era |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21965709/death_of_chief_ended_cavalry_era/ |access-date = July 18, 2018 |work = Asheville Citizen-Times |via = [[Newspapers.com]] |date = March 8, 1970 |page = 6C }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief was described as an "all around good cavalry horse" who was especially skilled at jumping and was popular and well-liked among cavalry troopers.&lt;ref name="lansing"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Carter |first1 = Joseph |title = Last U.S. Cavalry Horse Still Prances Like a Colt |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21965726/last_us_cavalry_horse_still_prances/ |access-date = July 18, 2018 |work = [[Lansing State Journal|The State Journal]] |location = Lansing, MI |agency = [[United Press International]] |via = Newspapers.com |date = November 25, 1962 |page = D20}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Chief was posted to [[Fort Riley]] and assigned to the [[10th Cavalry Regiment]], though was later transferred to the [[9th Cavalry Regiment]].&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt; In June 1942 he was transferred, again, to the U.S. Army Cavalry School and promoted to Advanced Cavalry Charger.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt;

==Retirement==
At the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States Army terminated its main equestrian training program; between 1949 and 1950, horses under age 16 were sold at auction while older horses, numbering around 100 and including Chief, were put to pasture.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Carter |first1 = Joseph |title = Last Cavalry Mount Lives a Life of (Fort) Riley |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21965740/last_cavalry_mount_lives_a_life_of/ |access-date = July 18, 2018 |work = The Courier-Journal |location = Louisville, KY |agency = United Press International |via = Newspapers.com |date = December 9, 1962 |at = §5, p. 7 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief lived the rest of his life at the Fort Riley Riding Club where he was given a double box stall and private corral.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Possible Companion for Chief |url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21965809/possible_companion_for_chief/ |access-date = July 18, 2018 |work = [[Albuquerque Journal]] |agency = [[Associated Press]] |via = Newspapers.com |date = July 17, 1964 |page = C1 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">'''Christiana Juliana Oxenstierna''' (23 September 1661 – 27 February 1701) was a Swedish [[nobility|noble]]. She was the center of a great social [[scandal]] when she married a non-noble against her family’s consent. Her case caused a debate about the law for marriage between nobles and non-nobles.

== Biography ==

She was the daughter of statesman and marshal [[Count]] Gabriel Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (d. 1673) and Countess Maria Christiana von Löwenstein und Scharfeneck (d. 1672; in turn she was the only surviving daughter of [[Elisabet Juliana Banér|Countess Elisabeth Juliana of Erbach]] –later wife of the Swedish [[Field Marshal]] [[Johan Banér]]– in her first marriage) and sister of Count Gustaf Adolf Oxenstierna. As an [[orphan]], she was taken care of by her paternal aunt, Countess Anna af Dohna.

The vicar (since 1687) of the French Lutheran church in [[Stockholm]], Nikolaus Bergius, was lodged in the [[palace]] of Dohna. Bergius suffered from severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and Dohna asked her niece to comfort him. Oxenstierna and Bergius fell in love and Bergius proposed, but Oxenstierna declined, as she knew she would be an outcast from her family and the nobility if she consented. Her family found out and banned every plans of a marriage. Bergius was separated from her in 1688–89. Their relationship was eventually taken up again. After a priest had agreed to conduct the ceremony, Oxenstierna and Bergius were married in 1691. The marriage was kept a secret, and she remained with her unknowing family. In 1692, she became pregnant; she moved to her spouse, and everything was made public.

It became a great scandal. Her family contested the legality of the marriage, and her brother, the count, reported them to [[Hovrätt]]en, to the [[Swedish House of Lords]] and presented the [[Charles XI of Sweden|monarch]] with an appeal to bring the couple to court for committing a criminal act by breaking: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"common law, guardian law, noble privileges, the law of the church as well as Your Majesty’s law of illegal marriages", by: "having dared to harm the rank of nobility by such a illegal act, in the Kingdom as well as abroad, and damaging its privileges, of such a degree that, if it is not made an example of, would unavoidably have the scandalous effect to break the public order, that a noblewoman, regardless of what kind, should be liberated."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; He also suggested that the law should be enforced against marriages between nobles and non-nobles (1693).

Christiana Oxenstierna replied to her brother: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"If You wish Your hatred and persecution to last as long as our lives, so it will; You will with no doubt be spared the burden soon enough and harm Yourself as much as others; I will not loose a thing thereby. If You will be as a Christian, it will be as dear to me as the wish that you will give your children treasures which rust and moths can not alter, and that we will one day meet were a Count and a master Bergius will weigh as much."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court of the Swedish House of Lords made the verdict that a serious crime had been committed, but as the King had commented that the matter was but a private affair, the case was not pursued further.

She broke off her contact with her family and the nobility and spent the rest of her life with her spouse, spending her time as a teacher for poor children. In 1701, she died in childbirth, giving her spouse all her assets in her will, because their four children (three sons and a daughter) all died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adelsvapen.com/genealogi/Oxenstierna_af_Korsholm_och_Wasa_nr_8 ''Grevliga ätten Oxenstierna af Korsholm och Wasa'' in: adelsvapen.com] (in Swedish) [retrieved 16 February 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Her family demanded she be buried discreetly, and denied her a place in her father's [[crypt]], but as she was the only person to have repaired and taken care of the crypt, her right to be buried there could not be denied. At her funeral, "Two Countesses Oxenstierna and one Miss Banér as well as other noblewomen prepared her corpse and lifter her with their own hands in to the coffin".

== In culture ==

In 1704, as a reply to the debate and slander which were still very much alive about her controversial person, her former spouse published her biography: ''Kort Beskrifning af then Högwälborna Frus, Fru Christina Juliana Oxenstiernas Lefwernes Lopp'' (A description of the life of the honorable lady, lady Christina Juliana Oxenstierna) (1704). It was reprinted by Pehr Adolph Sondén as: ''Minne af Christiana Juliana Oxenstjerna'' (Memory of Christina Juliana Oxenstierna) (1836).

'''''Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners''''' (''Cléopâtre essayant des poisons sur des condamnés à mort'') is an 1887 painting by the French artist [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. It is now in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]]. It shows [[Cleopatra VII]] sitting at a banquet observing the effects of poisons on prisoners condemned to death.

Cabanel had always had a taste for historical and [[orientalism|orientalist]] themes and when the painting was first seen by the Parisian public he was feted by the critics and showered with honours. Several international collectors attempted to buy the painting.

'''Tina Watson''' was a 26-year-old [[United States|American]] woman from [[Helena, Alabama|Helena]], [[Alabama]], who died while [[Recreational diving|scuba diving]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], on 22 October 2003. Tina had been on her [[honeymoon]] with her new husband, fellow American Gabe Watson, who was initially charged by Queensland authorities with his wife's murder. Watson pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter]] and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

Evidence presented at the trial included Watson's differing accounts of what had happened on that day, of the couple's diving experience (or lack thereof), and of Tina's [[life insurance]]. While Watson was serving his term in Australia, authorities in Alabama flagged an intention to charge him with murder at a later date. After his release, he was [[deportation|deported]] to Alabama on the condition that he would not be [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] if found guilty of murder. Watson was then put on trial, but on 23 February 2012, Judge Tommy Nail dismissed the murder case due to lack of evidence.

==Background==
Christina Mae "Tina" Watson (nee Thomas) was born in [[West Germany]] on 13 February 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/27816953/christina-mae-watson|title=Christina Mae “Tina” Thomas Watson (1977-2003) -...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; before relocating to the [[United States|U.S.]] while still a baby.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://casefilepodcast.com/case-51-tina-watson/|title=Case 51: Tina Watson - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2017-04-23|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 1980, she was legally [[adoption|adopted]] by Tommy and Cindy Thomas. They lived in [[Walker County, Alabama|Walker County]], [[Alabama]], with her younger sister before moving to [[Louisiana]] then [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; David Gabriel "Gabe" Watson met Tina while they were students at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flynn|first=Asher|last2=Fitz-Gibbon|first2=Kate|title=New book A Second Chance for Justice asks new questions about the case of the "honeymoon killer" Gabe Watson|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/new-book-says-tight-justice-system-let-honeymoon-killer-gabe-watson-off-the-hook/story-fnat7jnn-1226585289574|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[Herald Sun]]|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they began dating in January 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite an earlier diagnosis of [[paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia]] (PSVT), Tina took beginning diving lessons in January 2003, and earned her certification just before her wedding to Gabe on 11 October 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Watson was a purportedly qualified certified rescue diver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinister twist to death on the reef|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/sinister-twist-to-death-on-the-reef/story-e6frg6nf-1111113413940|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with experience in the lake at [[Oak Mountain State Park]]. Watson had completed 55 dives by the time of their marriage, and Tina 5. The couple had planned a scuba trip in the [[Great Barrier Reef]] for their [[honeymoon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Tuck|title=Gabe Watson 'hung out and asked for hugs' on other dive boat as others tried to save Tina's life|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/gabe-watson-hung-out-and-asked-for-hugs-on-other-dive-boat-as-others-tried-to-save-tinas-life/story-e6freoof-1226272315822|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Courier-Mail|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flew to [[Sydney]] for a week before heading to [[Townsville]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They chose to dive the popular yet difficult wreck of [[SS Yongala|SS ''Yongala'']], a passenger ship that sank in 1911, even though Watson had limited open ocean experience and Tina had never dived in the ocean or below 9 metres.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dive company had also offered an orientation and guided dive with a dive master, which the couple had refused.

==Incident==
[[File:SS Yongala wreck.jpg|thumb|180px|A buoy marks the site of the SS ''Yongala'']]
At around 10:30 am on 22 October, during an excursion from the dive boat ''Spoilsport'' to the site of ''Yongala'', Tina lost consciousness and sank to the bottom, {{convert|30|m|ft}} below the water's surface within two minutes of beginning the dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitt|first=Bill|title=Honeymoon Death Dive|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20214220,00.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson claimed the currents were stronger than they expected and that he responded to a signal from Tina to return to the dive rope, where he noted a look of worry on her face before she accidentally knocked his mask and air regulator loose. When Watson recovered his sight, Tina was sinking too quickly for him to retrieve her and he quickly surfaced to get help. He also stated that an ear problem prevented him from diving deeper to help her and that there was nothing in his training as a rescue diver "about how to get somebody" in trouble to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabe Watson's police interview |url=http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2008/01/23/10038_hpnews.html |website=[[Townsville Bulletin]] |accessdate=21 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012044115/http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2008/01/23/10038_hpnews.html |archivedate=12 October 2009 |date=23 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other divers nearby at the time, including Dr. Stanley Stutz, saw Watson engaged in an underwater "[[bear hug]]" with his "flailing" wife, after which he headed for the surface while Tina fell to the ocean floor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One diver, Gary Stempler, photographed Tina by chance while taking a picture of his own wife that showed Tina in the background. The photo showed her lying face-up on the ocean floor, something that did not come to light until a couple of weeks later when the pictures were developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shears|first=Richard|title=Diver's dying moments captured by tourist|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news-2/divers-dying-moments-captured-by-tourist/story-e6frfkvr-1111114932560|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[News.com.au]]|date=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson climbed aboard the ''Spoilsport'' and alerted dive instructor Wade Singleton, who brought Tina to the surface after ten minutes underwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was taken aboard the adjacent dive boat ''Jazz II'', where a doctor tried to resuscitate her for 40 minutes while Watson remained on the ''Spoilsport''.&lt;ref name="Sep5"&gt;''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' "By the time Gabe stood trial, prosecutors noted he'd given 16 different versions of what happened", pg. 42-47, 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The day following the death, Tina's [[autopsy]] was performed by Professor David Williams, consultant [[forensic pathologist]] to the Queensland Coroner. Williams found florid evidence of [[air embolism]], but no degenerative disease. He gave the cause of death as [[drowning]].&lt;ref name="inquest" /&gt; Due to the unexpected nature of Tina's death and the implausible and conflicting statements given by Watson, the death was investigated by the State Coroner's office. A [[coroner's inquest|coronial inquiry]] was held, as is the usual practice in Australia. Watson declined to return to Australia, so did not testify during the inquest but gave evidence through his lawyers to the inquest and to the [[Queensland Police]]. During the inquest, prosecutors submitted evidence that Watson's story contradicted the record of his actions stored by his [[dive computer]]. They suggested the possibility that he turned off Tina's regulator and held her until she was unconscious, then turned the air back on and let her sink before surfacing himself. As evidence, they described the many painstaking re-enactments of various scenarios conducted by police divers. Tina's father claimed that Watson had asked Tina, shortly before their wedding, to increase her [[life insurance]] and make him the sole beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shears|first=Richard|title=Horrific picture of drowned diver captured in underwater tourist snap - but was it murder?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-495274/Horrific-picture-drowned-diver-captured-underwater-tourist-snap--murder.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[Mail Online]]|date=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Nicole|title=American charged over Barrier Reef diving death|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2281404.htm|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|PM]]|date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil action commenced in Alabama===
In March 2005, Watson launched legal action in Alabama's [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]] [[circuit court|Circuit Court]] to recoup the cost of the couple's trip after the travel insurance company refused a payout. He was seeking $45,000 for the accidental death plus compensation for trip interruption, medical expenses, phone calls, taxi fares, fees for extra credit card statements and unspecified punitive damages for mental and emotional anguish. The action was dismissed in May 2008 at Watson's request on the grounds the Australian investigation into his wife's death caused him "to reasonably apprehend that he risks self-incrimination in this case". His Australian legal team believed "it was not in his best interest" to pursue the damages claim and his U.S.-based lawyer, Bob Austin, added that his client would not be voluntarily "going back to Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balogh|first=Stefanie|title=Gabe Watson drops action, fearing 'self-incrimination'|url=http://www.news.com.au/newstest2/archive-old-assets/scuba-husband-drops-honeymoon-claim/story-e6frfkyi-1111116394050|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=News.com.au|date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment==
On 19 June 2008, the Coroner laid the following charge:&lt;blockquote&gt;That on the 22nd day of October 2003 at the site of the historical shipwreck ''Yongala'' forty-eight nautical miles south east from the port of Townsville in the state of Queensland, David Gabriel Watson murdered Christina Mae Watson.&lt;ref name=inquest/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was reported that the Coroner found "[it was likely ] that Watson [had] killed his 26-year-old wife by turning off her air supply and holding her in an 'underwater bear hug' until she was dead";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/aapstory.aspx?StoryName=524905|title=US diver accused of killing wife in Qld|date=24 October 2008|work=thewest.com.au|accessdate=21 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029032838/http://www.thewest.com.au/aapstory.aspx?StoryName=524905|archivedate=29 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the coroner had made no such finding.&lt;ref name=inquest&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquest into the death of Christina Mae WATSON known as Tina WATSON|url=http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/86727/cif-watson-cm-20080424.pdf|work=[[Coroners Court of Queensland]]|publisher=Queensland Courts|date=20 June 2008|accessdate=3 November 2013|location=Townsville|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After resisting [[extradition]] for six months, Watson travelled voluntarily from the U.S. to Australia in May 2009 to face trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the trial on 5&amp;nbsp;June 2009, he pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to, and was convicted of, [[manslaughter]]. [[Crown prosecutor]] Brendan Campbell pointed out that over time Watson had given police sixteen different versions of what had happened to Tina and that none of those versions matched what the only eyewitness had seen. When Tina was brought to the surface, her regulator was still in her mouth, her tank still had air, and tests indicated no faults with her equipment. Campbell described Watson as an experienced diver trained in rescuing panicked divers, who had allowed his wife to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to retrieve her. Watson did not inflate Tina's [[buoyancy control device]] (BCD) or remove her [[weight belt]], and had failed to fulfill his obligations as her "dive buddy" by not sharing his alternative air source. Watson was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to be suspended after serving only twelve months.&lt;ref name="Sep5"/&gt;

===Reaction to the sentence===
Tina's family stated that Watson's twelve-month term was an embarrassment to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bentley|first=Amelia|title=Honeymoon scuba killer's 12-month sentence 'ludicrous'|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/honeymoon-scuba-killers-12month-sentence-ludicrous-20090605-bxsh.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day following the trial, [[Attorney General of Alabama|Alabama Attorney General]] [[Troy King]] lodged an [[appeal]] with the [[Queensland Supreme Court]] and also wrote to [[Queensland Attorney-General]] [[Cameron Dick]]. [[Fairfax Media]] reported that the letter was leaked to them and published part of it in their newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duff|first=Eamonn|last2=Bachelard|first2=Michael|title=US challenges killer husband wrist-slap|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/us-challenges-killer-husband-wristslap-20090606-bz7r.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queensland [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], Tony Moynihan SC, issued a statement, which said:
"The decision to accept Mr Watson's plea of guilty to manslaughter was made after a careful and thorough examination of the admissible evidence, and was not taken lightly. Given the complex circumstantial nature of the case, Mr Watson's admission that he breached his duty to render assistance to his wife ultimately meant there was no reasonable prospect of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was guilty of murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellett|first=Christine|title=We couldn't prove it: DPP|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/we-couldnt-prove-it-dpp-20090609-c1v4.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2009, Dick announced the state would appeal against the inadequacy of Watson's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honeymoon killer appeal: father's thanks|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/honeymoon-killer-appeal-fathers-thanks-20090618-cij9.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 June 2009|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
The appeal was heard by the Queensland Court of Appeals on 17&amp;nbsp;July 2009. The Crown asked the court to increase Watson's prison term to two and a half years. The [[defense (law)|defence]] argued that Watson had had a momentary lapse in judgment, had been accused of a crime he did not commit, and had voluntarily returned to Australia to co-operate with the court, and that the penalty imposed by the trial judge was fair and just.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oberhardt|first=Mark|title=Judge too soft in Gabe Watson sentencing, says solicitor-general|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/judge-too-soft-in-gabe-watson-sentencing-says-solicitor-general/story-e6freon6-1225751415990|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings on appeal were handed down on 18&amp;nbsp;September 2009. Two members allowed the prosecution's appeal, increasing Watson's period of incarceration by six months to a total of eighteen. One justice by minority opinion was in favour of dismissing the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|title=Jail term extended for honeymoon dive killer|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/jail-term-extended-for-honeymoon-dive-killer-20090918-fu8c.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further incidents==
Tina was buried in her native Pelham, [[Alabama]]. Her remains were [[exhumation|exhumed]] in 2007 and moved to a different lot bought by Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4818156.ece|title=Tina Watson: the bride who drowned at the Barrier Reef|last=Ham|first=Paul|date=28 September 2008|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=2 February 2010|location=London}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being informed by her family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site, even when chained down, police surveillance videos showed Watson removing them with bolt cutters and throwing them in trash cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2008/01/25/10097_news.html | newspaper=Townsville Bulletin | title= Caught on film | first=Andy | last=Toulson | date=25 January 2008 | accessdate=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson later said he removed them because they were "big, gaudy, plastic arrangements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why I took flowers from Tina's grave: Honeymoon killer Gabe Watson breaks silence on US TV|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/honeymoon-death-gabe-watson-breaks-silence-on-us-tv/story-e6freoof-1226285885608|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The Courier-Mail|date=1 March 2012|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grave was unmarked until 2009, when Watson provided a [[Footstone|foot marker]], prompting her father to request her body be returned for reburial. In 2011, the Probate Court removed Watson as administrator of Tina's estate and appointed her father, who also wants her school and college pictures and yearbooks returned. Watson has appealed against the ruling and refused to provide the court with an inventory of Tina's possessions. Pending Watson's trial, the [[Alabama Circuit Courts|Alabama Circuit Court]] ordered him to stay away from the grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Tuck|title='Honeymoon killer' Gabe Watson refuses to hand over Tina Thomas' body|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news-2/killer-refuses-to-hand-over-tinas-body/story-e6frfkvr-1226092718403|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=News.com.au|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial in United States==

===Alabama investigation===
In May 2010, King announced he had information not yet made public and wanted to try Watson for [[capital murder]], asserting jurisdiction based on the theory that the alleged crime was planned in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/23/justice/alabama-honeymoon-trial/|title=Murder case dismissed in death of newlywed wife}}&lt;/ref&gt; King petitioned Australia for the evidence held by police, but was refused access until he gave an undertaking that the death penalty would not be imposed, as required under Australian law. This condition has been strongly criticised by King and Don Valeska, chief of the Attorney General's violent crime division, who stated: "If an Australian woman was killed here, we would immediately send the evidence there. We would not presume to tell the Australian authorities how to run their criminal justice system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/02/post_436.html|title=Australian DA wants no death penalty if charges filed here in honeymoon death|last=Thomas-Ogle|first=Marienne|date=9 February 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]]|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the announcement, Watson's parents came to the defence of their son, breaking their public silence on the case. Friends and family of Watson questioned whether he had any motive for the murder, noting that his affection for Tina had seemed genuine, there was no life insurance policy naming him as beneficiary, and he appeared to be emotionally devastated for an extended time following her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/05/gabe_watsons_family_speaks_7_y.html|title=Gabe Watson's family speaks 7 years after his wife, Tina Watson, drowned on Australian honeymoon|last=Robinson|first=Carol|date=9 May 2010|work=The Birmingham News|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, King assured the Queensland Attorney-General he would not seek the death penalty if Watson was tried in the U.S. for his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US rules out death penalty for honeymoon dive killing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-rules-out-death-penalty-for-honeymoon-dive-killing-20100629-zjcg.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 June 2010|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010 it was announced Watson would be released in November and was likely to be deported to the US, where he faced being charged with murder. Valeska stated he would pursue an additional charge of kidnapping by deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/honeymoon-killer-may-face-new-charge-20100814-123or.html|title=Honeymoon killer may face new charge|last=Martin|first=Lisa|date=14 August 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was placed before a grand jury in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/date-set-in-honeymoon-dive-killer-case/story-e6frev00-1225935506842|title=Date set in honeymoon dive killer case|last=Paul|first=Nathan|date=7 October 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson was released from prison on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2010. He was transferred to an [[Australian immigration detention facilities|immigration detention centre]] while his deportation was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honeymoon killer Gabe Watson heads to Melbourne|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news-2/honeymoon-killer-gabe-watson-released-from-jail-in-queensland/story-e6frfkvr-1225951669938|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=News.com.au|date=11 November 2010|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Australian authorities sought further written assurances from the US Attorney General that he would not face the death penalty in Alabama if convicted of murder. Under international human rights law, Australia could not deport Watson if he faced execution in his home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia in dilemma over deportation of Honeymoon Killer to the U.S.|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/australia-dilemma-over-deportation-honeymoon-killer-us-246954|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;November 2010 he was deported to the United States and immediately arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/honeymoon-killer-gabe-watson-leaves-australia-20101125-187sg.html|title=Honeymoon killer Gabe Watson leaves Australia|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|date=25 November 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest===
Alabama prosecutors charged Gabe with murder at the conclusion of his prison sentence in Australia after finding what they claimed was evidence he had plotted to kill his wife while still in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/great-barrier-reef-honeymoon-dive-killer-in-us-kill-plot-20090609-c1av.html|title=Great Barrier Reef honeymoon dive killer 'in US kill plot'|last=Kellett|first=Christine|date=9 June 2009|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Birmingham grand jury indicted Watson on murder charges in October 2010. In July 2011, the Circuit Court set the trial date for 13&amp;nbsp;February 2012; Watson was released on bond.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Tuck|title=Gabe Watson to go to trial in February 2012 in Alabama charged with murdering wife Tina|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/world/honeymoon-killer-gabe-watson-to-go-to-trial-in-february-2012-in-alabama-charged-with-murdering-wife-tina/story-e6frea8l-1226093499022|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New evidence===
Colin McKenzie, a key diving expert in the original investigation who had maintained that "a diver with Watson's training should have been able to bring Tina up", subsequently retracted much of his testimony after being provided with Tina and Gabe's diver logs, certificates and medical histories, to which he had not previously had access. McKenzie claimed Gabe should not have been allowed in the water and never as a dive buddy for his wife, who had no open water scuba experience. Tina had heart surgery to correct an irregular heartbeat two years earlier but on her dive application had stated that she had never had heart problems or surgery. Professor Michael "Mike" Bennett, a leading expert in [[Diving medicine|dive medicine]], stated that Tina was unfit to dive without clearance from a cardiologist. Gabe had received his [[Rescue Diver|rescue certification]], normally a four-day course, after completing a two-day course in an Alabama quarry. He had no rescue experience and little open water experience.&lt;ref name="Age1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patrick|first=Peter|title=Death at 27 metres|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/death-at-27-metres-20110421-1dqgf.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Watson a 'coward but not a killer'|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/watson-a-coward-but-not-a-killer-20110422-1dr35.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=22 April 2011|agency=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McKenzie, "He had no hope of being competent, he could barely save himself [that day] let alone his wife; I don't believe he intended to kill her." Revelations that Watson needed help to don his diving equipment that day underscored that he was a "dangerous amateur" who showed "a complete lack of courage" when he abandoned his wife. The dive company had offered an orientation and guided dive with a dive master, which both Tina and Gabe had refused. Company head Mike Ball said his people took Watson at his word, believing he was an experienced and certified rescue diver. The company later pleaded guilty to contravening safety standards (their code of conduct said both Gabe and Tina must be supervised by at least a [[divemaster]] on the dive in question) and was fined $6,500, plus costs of $1,500.&lt;ref name="Age1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Age2"/&gt;

===Dismissal of the case===
Alabama judge Tommy Nail ruled that evidence of Watson's behaviour following Tina's death was inadmissible. Nail also blocked Tina's father from giving evidence regarding Watson's alleged attempts to increase Tina's life insurance. On 23 February 2012, Nail acquitted Gabe for lack of evidence without the defence needing to present its case. Nail said that the state's evidence was "sorely lacking" and that the prosecution could not prove that Watson had any financial motive. Prosecutor Don Valeska said that this was the first time he had had a trial end in a judge's acquittal in the 41 years he had been trying cases. Regarding the judge's decision, Thomas said, "It should have gone to the jury for them to decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Rick|title=Murder case dismissed in death of newlywed wife|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/23/justice/alabama-honeymoon-trial/index.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Reeves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">'''Delta 6 desaturase''' (D6D or Δ-6-desaturase) is a [[desaturase]] enzyme that converts between types of fatty acids (termed ''6'' after [[omega-6 fatty acids]]), which are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] nutrients in the human body.  The enzyme is molecularly identical across all living things (preserved across [[Kingdom (biology)]]) it is present in animals, plants, and [[cyanobacteria]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JM, Lee H, Kang S, Park WJ | title = Fatty Acid Desaturases, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Regulation, and Biotechnological Advances | journal = Nutrients | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 23 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26742061 | pmc = 4728637 | doi = 10.3390/nu8010023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakamura"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura MT, Nara TY | title = Structure, function, and dietary regulation of delta6, delta5, and delta9 desaturases | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 24 | pages = 345–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15189125 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.24.121803.063211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

D6D is one of the 3 [[fatty acid desaturase]]s present in humans along with Δ-5 and [[Delta-9 desaturase|Δ-9]], named so because it was thought to convert only [[omega-6]] fatty acids, but actually converts some others also, and is obligatory to build the longer chain [[omega-3 fatty acids]] from other simpler fatty acids in humans {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  In humans, it is encoded by the [[FADS2]] gene {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Molecular activity==
D6D is an [[desaturase]] enzyme, i.e. introduces a double bond in a specific position of long-chain fatty acids.  Among them, it converts between various forms of [[Omega-3]] and [[Omega-6]] fatty acids{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}:
* primarily (in humans):
** cis-[[linoleic acid]] to [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA)
** [[Palmitic acid]] to [[Sapienic acid]]
* less efficiently in humans:
** [[alpha-Linolenic acid|ALA]] to [[Stearidonic acid]], along with an [[elongase]] to provide EPA. 
** Tetracosatetranoic acid to tetracosapentanoic acid, an intermediate step between EPA to DHA synthesis.

D6D is obligatory along with various [[elongase]]s to convert to longer chain omega-3's, such as between ALA to EPA as well as EPA to [[Docosahexanoic acid|DHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Dharmendra Kumar | last = Meena | name-list-format = vanc | title = HUFA and PUFA: Structures, Occurrence, Biochemistry And Their Health Benefits | url = http://aquafind.com/articles/HUFA-and-PUFA.php | work = Aquafind Aquatic Fish Database }} &lt;/ref&gt;

GLA deficiencies in animals including humans have shown wide effects down the line -- [[Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid|Dihomogamma-linolenic acid]] (DGLA) and [[Prostaglandin E1]] deficiency.  PGE1 activates [[T lymphocytes]], inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and thrombosis, is important in gonadal function and raises [[cyclic AMP]] levels in many tissues. It is a good candidate for a key factor lost in aging.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  It also affects viability of [[sperm]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roqueta-Rivera M, Stroud CK, Haschek WM, Akare SJ, Segre M, Brush RS, Agbaga MP, Anderson RE, Hess RA, Nakamura MT | title = Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation fully restores fertility and spermatogenesis in male delta-6 desaturase-null mice | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 360–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19690334 | pmc = 2803238 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M001180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref name="ncbi2010"/&gt;

==Variability==
Levels of D6D rapidly fall rapidly in the testes and more slowly in the liver in aging rats.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horrobin DF | title = Loss of delta-6-desaturase activity as a key factor in aging | journal = [[Medical Hypotheses]] | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 1211–20 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 6270521 | doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(81)90064-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  D6D is a long chain [[PUFA]] rate limiter, has greater affinity for ALA than for linoleic acid, nevertheless many diets have far more linoleic acid present, resulting in reduced levels of [[alpha-Linolenic acid]] to [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Mardi A. | last = Parelman | name-list-format = vanc | journal =  Today's Dietitian | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 14  | date = May 2015 | url = http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/050515p14.shtml | title = Omegas: Dissecting the Science on Omega-3 Supplements }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tend to have higher levels of D6D due to the effects of [[estrogen]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

==Inhibiting factors==
* alcohol, radiation, diabetes
* lack of zinc, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, the pineal hormone, melatonin, and possibly vitamin B3.&lt;ref name=pmid6270521/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

==Agonists==
* Moderate food restriction (up to 300%)
* Low levels of Omega-3's.

'''Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada''' (June 29, 1919 – April 10, 2008) was a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  He was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Archbishop of Mexico]] in [[Mexico City]] (1977–1994) and was [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of [[Mexico]]. In the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of June 30, 1979 in [[Vatican City]] [[Pope John Paul II]] created him [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal Priest]] of the [[titular church]] of ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary Immaculate of Tiburtino]]''.

==Life==
Corripio y Ahumada was [[ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on October 15, 1942. He served as a diocesan priest in his hometown of Tampico for ten years. On December 27, 1952, [[Pope Pius XII]] appointed him [[auxiliary bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tampico|Diocese of Tampico]].  On March 19, 1953, he was consecrated [[titular bishop]] of Zapara. On February 25, 1956, he became [[Bishop]] of the diocese.

[[Pope Paul VI]] elevated Corripio y Ahumada on July 25, 1967 to Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antequera|Antequera]] in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. On March 11, 1976, he was transferred to become Archbishop of the [[Archdiocese of Puebla de los Angeles]] in the state of [[Puebla]]. The Pope transferred Corripio y Ahumada once again on July 19, 1977 to the post of Archbishop of Mexico.

Upon assuming the papal throne, Pope John Paul II appointed Corripio y Ahumada a member of the [[College of Cardinals]]. He was a member of various departments of the [[Roman Curia]] while serving his archdiocese.

He retired on September 29, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-c.htm#Corripio The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''Ex Parte Lutchman''''', an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[Inheritance|succession]] law, the deceased had left certain property to his six children in equal shares in a validly executed will. One of the deceased’s children took out three life insurance policies on his father’s life and explained to his father that in order for him (the son) to get the benefits of the policies when he (the father) died, he (the father) must draft a new will. The only provision in the second will was that the son was appointed the sole [[heir]] of the insurance policies, so he did not deal with any of the rest of his estate. Furthermore, he accidentally included a revocation clause in the new will, so its effect was that everything except the insurance policies devolved according to the law of intestate succession. At that stage, extra-marital children of persons marriage in terms of Hindu custom could not inherit [[intestate]]. The children of the deceased approached the court to declare the second will invalid insofar as it revoked the previous will. The court held that the revocation clause in the second will was obviously a mistake, so this clause was held to be ''pro non scripto'' (as if it had not been written).

The '''Rationality Debate'''—also called the '''Great Rationality Debate'''—is the question of whether humans are [[rationality|rational]] or not. This issue is a topic in the study of [[cognition]] and is important in fields such as [[economics]] where it is relevant to the theories of [[market efficiency]].

Many studies in [[experimental psychology]] have shown that humans often [[reason]] in a way that is inaccurate or imperfect—that they do not naturally chose the ideal method or solution.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=356}} An example of a problem which causes difficulty and debate is the [[St. Petersburg paradox]].{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=360}} This is a lottery which is constructed so that the [[expected value]] is infinite but unlikely so that most people will not pay a large fee to play. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] explained that, in this case, mathematicians refined their formulae to model this pragmatic behaviour.{{sfn|Gigerenzer|1991|p=21}} [[Keith Stanovich]] characterizes this as a [[Panglossian]] position in the debate—that humans are fundamentally rational and any variance between the [[normative]] position and empirical outcomes may be explained by such adjustments.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=361}}

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], '''green slime''' is an [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ooze]], a category of monster. It is more akin to a [[plant]] than an animal. It is a horrible, fetid growth, resembling a bright green, sticky, wet moss which grows on the walls and ceilings of caves, sewers, dungeons, mines, and the like.

==Creative origins==
The description of various "genera" and "species" of corrosive mineral oozes encountered by unwary miners underground, that can eat unnoticed through skin and flesh to the bone, date back at least to the works of [[Georg Agricola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=agricola+corrosive&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RVYDsOa_dr&amp;sig=kKL7TTmV1ZoF72ejiGyG8bbwLfc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=De Natura Fossilium |author=Georg Agricola |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWoChuYV2GUC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=agricola+corrosive&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mHGbaGLgwh&amp;sig=2I99jILqEJKUQmySgxmGoUPT22c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA113,M1|title=De Re Metallica |author=Herbert Clark Hoover (commentary) |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these might have been inspired by cavers' contacts with peculiar lifeforms in caves with a high [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[sulfuric acid]] content which are even more corrosive than the environments they inhabit, such as the "[[snottite]]s", "red goo", and "green slime" encountered in the real-world [[Cueva de Villa Luz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caveslime.org/analytic_research_villaLuz.html|title=Project: Cueva de Villa Luz (Cueva de las Sardinas)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of green slime as an invasive life form that overgrows its victims, as depicted in ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', also has roots in science fiction, such as the 1968 film ''The Green Slime'', and horror such as [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s short story "The Voice In The Night".

==Publication history==
The green slime first appeared in the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set]] (1974).

The green slime appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|D&amp;D Basic Set]]'' (1977, 1981, 1983) and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).

The green slime appeared in first edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in the original ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

The green slime appeared in second edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Zeb" Cook|Cook, David]], et al. ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993) under the "ooze" entry.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Doug, ed. ''[[Monster Manual|Monstrous Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The green slime appeared in the third edition ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (2000) as a dungeon hazard,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Monte, [[Skip Williams]], and [[Jonathan Tweet]]. ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the 3.5 revised ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' (2003).

Green slime appeared in the fifth edition  ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' as a dungeon hazard.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Crawford]], [[Christopher Perkins (game designer)]] and James Wyatt. ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and habits==
The '''green slime''' is notably different from other [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|oozes]]. Being a growth, it is fixed to one place and cannot move or attack. For the most part, it is forced to feed off of vegetable, organic or metallic substances in an underground wall. If it grows on a ceiling, however, it can sense if someone passes below, and drops onto them. Living creatures touched by a green slime eventually turn into green slime themselves. Green slime is vulnerable to light, heat, frost, and ''cure disease'' spells.

Green slimes are mindless and cannot speak. As such, they are regarded as [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|neutral]] in alignment.

A green slime will regrow if even the tiniest residue remains, and can germinate to form a full sized [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ooze]] again years later. In the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' universe, huge colonies of green slime exist deep beneath the earth.

'''Growth hormone''' ('''GH'''), also known as '''somatotropin''' (or as '''human growth hormone''' [hGH or HGH] in its human form), is a [[peptide hormone]] that stimulates growth, [[cell (biology)|cell]] reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in [[human development (biology)|human development]]. It is a type of [[mitogen]] which is specific only to certain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-[[amino acid]], single-chain [[polypeptide]] that is synthesized, stored and secreted by [[somatotropic cell]]s within the lateral wings of the [[anterior pituitary]] gland.

GH is a stress hormone that stimulates production of [[IGF-1]] and raises the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids.&lt;ref name="pmid21584161"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ranabir S, Reetu K | title = Stress and hormones | journal = Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–22 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21584161 | pmc = 3079864 | doi = 10.4103/2230-8210.77573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5960526"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenwood FC, Landon J | title = Growth hormone secretion in response to stress in man | journal = Nature | volume = 210 | issue = 5035 | pages = 540–1 | date = April 1966 | pmid = 5960526 | doi = 10.1038/210540a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] form of hGH called '''somatropin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is used as a [[prescription drug]] to treat children's growth disorders and adult [[growth hormone deficiency]]. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies, by prescription from a doctor. In recent years in the United States, some doctors have started to prescribe growth hormone in GH-deficient older patients (but not on healthy people) to increase vitality.   While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial.   At this time, HGH is still considered a very complex hormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.&lt;ref name="ped"&gt;{{cite book | author = Powers M |veditors=Leaver-Dunn D, Houglum J, Harrelson GL | title = Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers | edition = | publisher = Slack Incorporated | location = | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 331–332 | chapter = Performance-Enhancing Drugs| quote = | isbn = 1-55642-594-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its role as an [[anabolic]] agent, HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982,  and has been banned by the [[IOC]] and [[NCAA]].  Traditional [[urine]] analysis does not detect [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] with HGH, so the ban was unenforceable until the early 2000s, when [[blood test]]s that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens, Greece]] targeted primarily HGH.&lt;ref name=ped/&gt;  Use of the drug for performance enhancement is not currently approved by the [[FDA]].

GH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in [[industrial agriculture]] and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production.  These uses have been controversial.  In the United States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called [[bovine somatotropin]] for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin.

==Nomenclature==

The names ''somatotropin'' (''STH'') or ''somatotropic hormone'' refer to the [[growth hormone 1|growth hormone]] produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated ''hGH''. The main growth hormone produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology has the approved generic name ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) ''somatropin'' and the brand name ''Humatrope'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daniels ME | title= Lilly's Humatrope Experience | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 10 | pages = 812 | year = 1992 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0792-812a | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992 Humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent,&lt;ref name="pmid16799101"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saugy M, Robinson N, Saudan C, Baume N, Avois L, Mangin P | title = Human growth hormone doping in sport | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 40 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = i35-9 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16799101 | pmc = 2657499 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2006.027573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in this context is referred to as HGH.

===Gene===
{{Main|Growth hormone 1|Growth hormone 2}}
Genes for human growth hormone, known as [[growth hormone 1]] (somatotropin; pituitary growth hormone) and [[growth hormone 2]] (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17&lt;ref name="urlGH1 growth hormone 1 (Homo sapiens) - Gene - NCBI"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2688 | title = GH1 growth hormone 1 (Homo sapiens) - Gene  | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlGH2 growth hormone 2 (Homo sapiens) - Gene - NCBI"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2689 | title = GH2 growth hormone 2 (Homo sapiens) - Gene | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are closely related to [[somatomammotropin|human chorionic somatomammotropin]] (also known as [[placental lactogen]]) genes. GH, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and [[prolactin]] belong to [[Somatotropin family|a group of homologous hormones]] with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity.

=== Structure ===

The major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 [[amino acid]]s and a molecular weight of 22,124 [[Atomic mass unit|daltons]]. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different [[species]], only human and [[Old World monkey]] growth hormones have significant effects on the human [[growth hormone receptor]].&lt;ref name="pmid12082127"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yi S, Bernat B, Pál G, Kossiakoff A, Li WH | title = Functional promiscuity of squirrel monkey growth hormone receptor toward both primate and nonprimate growth hormones | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 1083–92 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12082127 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[molecule|molecular]] isoforms of GH exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood. In particular, a variant of approximately 20 kDa originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio,&lt;ref name="pmid12217902"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung KC, Howe C, Gui LY, Trout G, Veldhuis JD, Ho KK | title = Physiological and pharmacological regulation of 20-kDa growth hormone | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

===Regulation===
{{See also|Hypothalamic–pituitary–somatotropic axis}}

Secretion of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary is regulated by the [[Neurosecretion|neurosecretory]] nuclei of the [[hypothalamus]]. 
These cells release the peptides [[Growth hormone-releasing hormone]] (GHRH or ''somatocrinin'') and [[Somatostatin|Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH or ''somatostatin'') into the [[hypophyseal portal system|hypophyseal portal]] venous blood surrounding the pituitary.
GH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion.&lt;ref name="isbn0-321-53910-9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Bartholomew EF, Martini F, Nath JL | title = Fundamentals of anatomy &amp; physiology | edition = | publisher = Pearson Education Inc | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2009 | origyear = | pages = 616–617 | quote = | isbn = 0-321-53910-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Somatotropic cell]]s in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland then synthesize and secrete GH in a pulsatile manner, in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus. 
The largest and most predictable of these GH peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref name="Takahashi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi Y, Kipnis DM, Daughaday WH | title = Growth hormone secretion during sleep | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 2079–90 | date = September 1968 | pmid = 5675428 | pmc = 297368 | doi = 10.1172/JCI105893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Otherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals. Nearly fifty percent of GH secretion occurs during the third and fourth [[NREM sleep]] stages.&lt;ref name="pmid11817985"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehta A, Hindmarsh PC | title = The use of somatropin (recombinant growth hormone) in children of short stature | journal = Paediatric Drugs | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–47 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11817985 | doi = 10.2165/00128072-200204010-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Surges of secretion during the day occur at 3- to 5-hour intervals.&lt;ref name=ped/&gt; The plasma concentration of GH during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref name="pmid808970"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Natelson BH, Holaday J, Meyerhoff J, Stokes PE | title = Temporal changes in growth hormone, cortisol, and glucose: relation to light onset and behavior | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 229 | issue = 2 | pages = 409–15 | date = August 1975 | pmid = 808970 | doi = 10.1152/ajplegacy.1975.229.2.409 | url = http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/229/2/409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Function ===
[[File:Endocrine growth regulation.svg|thumb|240px|Main pathways in endocrine regulation of growth.]]

Effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as [[anabolism|anabolic]] (building up).  Like most other protein hormones, GH acts by interacting with a specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on the surface of cells.

Increased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of GH.  Height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms:

# Because [[polypeptide]] hormones are not fat-[[soluble]], they cannot penetrate [[cell membranes]]. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]].&lt;ref name="Binder_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Binder G, Wittekindt N, Ranke MB | title = Noonan Syndrome: Genetics and Responsiveness to Growth Hormone Therapy | journal = Horm Res |date=February 2007 | volume = 67 | isbn = 978-3-8055-8255-1 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = 45–49 | doi=10.1159/000097552 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nQ9ilbixQEgC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=gh+growth+hormone+ras&amp;q=gh%20growth%20hormone%20ras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of [[chondrocyte]]s of [[cartilage]].
# GH also stimulates, through the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]],&lt;ref name="Binder_2007"/&gt; the production of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1, formerly known as somatomedin C), a hormone homologous to [[proinsulin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch2/s5ch2_19.htm | title = Actions of Anterior Pituitary Hormones: Physiologic Actions of GH | publisher = Medical College of Georgia | year = 2007 | access-date = 2008-01-16 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111163402/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch2/s5ch2_19.htm | archive-date = 2008-01-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[liver]] is a major target organ of GH for this process and is the principal site of IGF-1 production. IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an [[endocrine gland|endocrine]] and an [[autocrine]]/[[paracrine]] hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on [[osteoblast]] and [[chondrocyte]] activity to promote bone growth.

In addition to increasing height in children and adolescents, growth hormone has many other effects on the body:
* Increases [[calcium]] retention,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and strengthens and increases the [[mineralization of bone]]
* Increases [[muscle]] mass through [[sarcomere]] [[hypertrophy]]
* Promotes [[lipolysis]]
* Increases [[protein synthesis]]

==Clinical significance==

===Excess===

The most common disease of GH excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. These somatotroph [[adenoma]]s are benign and grow slowly, gradually producing more and more GH. For years, the principal clinical problems are those of GH excess. Eventually, the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches, impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves, or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement.

Prolonged GH excess thickens the bones of the jaw, fingers and toes, resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits, referred to as [[acromegaly]]. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]), muscle weakness, excess [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and reduced sexual function.

GH-secreting tumors are typically recognized in the fifth decade of life. It is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood, but, when it does, the excessive GH can cause excessive growth, traditionally referred to as [[gigantism|pituitary gigantism]].

Surgical removal is the usual treatment for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as [[pegvisomant]] may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like [[octreotide]] (somatostatin agonist) and [[bromocriptine]] ([[dopamine agonist]]) can be used to block GH secretion because both somatostatin and [[dopamine]] negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Deficiency===
{{Main|Growth hormone deficiency}}
The effects of [[growth hormone deficiency|growth hormone (GH) deficiency]] vary depending on the age at which they occur.  Alterations in [[somatomedin]] can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms; failure of tissues to respond to [[somatomedin]], or failure of the [[liver]] to produce [[somatomedin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical-Surgical Nursing: Patient-Centered Collaborative Care|last=Ignatavicius|first=Donna|last2=Workman|first2=Linda | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Saunders|year=2015|isbn=978-1455772551|edition=8|pages=1267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major manifestations of GH deficiency in children are [[growth failure]], the development of a [[short stature]], and delayed sexual maturity.  In adults, [[somatomedin]] alteration contributes to increased [[osteoclast]] activity, resulting in weaker bones that are more prone to [[pathologic fracture]] and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, deficiency is rare in adults, with the most common cause being a [[pituitary adenoma]].&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molitch ME, Clemmons DR, Malozowski S, Merriam GR, Shalet SM, Vance ML, Stephens PA | title = Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1621–34 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16636129 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-2227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other adult causes include a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or [[Injury|trauma]], and very rarely idiopathic GHD.&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006" /&gt;

Adults with GHD "tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life".&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"/&gt;

Diagnosis of GH deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process, usually culminating in GH stimulation tests to see if the patient's pituitary gland will release a pulse of GH when provoked by various stimuli.

==Psychological effects==

===Quality of life===

Several studies, primarily involving patients with [[Growth hormone deficiency|GH deficiency]], have suggested a crucial role of GH in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level. Adults with GH deficiency often have higher rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] than those without.&lt;ref name="Prodam_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prodam F, Caputo M, Belcastro S, Garbaccio V, Zavattaro M, Samà MT, Bellone S, Pagano L, Bona G, Aimaretti G | title = Quality of life, mood disturbances and psychological parameters in adult patients with GH deficiency | journal = Panminerva Medica | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 323–31 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23123585 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Growth hormone#Replacement therapy|GH replacement therapy]] has been proposed to treat depression as a result of GH deficiency, the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown.&lt;ref name="Prodam_2012"/&gt;

===Cognitive function===

GH has also been studied in the context of [[cognitive function]], including learning and memory.&lt;ref name="Nyberg_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nyberg F, Hallberg M | title = Growth hormone and cognitive function | journal = Nature Reviews. Endocrinology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 357–65 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23629538 | doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2013.78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GH in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of GH deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nyberg_2013"/&gt;

==Medical uses==
{{Main|Growth hormone therapy}}

===Replacement therapy===
Treatment with exogenous GH is indicated only in limited circumstances,&lt;ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"/&gt; and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects. GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, benefits have variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being.

===Other approved uses===
GH can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH.  Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are [[Turner syndrome]], [[chronic renal failure]], [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[intrauterine growth restriction]], and severe [[idiopathic short stature]]. Higher ("pharmacologic") doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal ("physiologic"). Despite the higher doses, side-effects during treatment are rare, and vary little according to the condition being treated.

One version of rHGH has also been FDA approved for maintaining muscle mass in [[wasting]] due to [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="pmid11367383"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilden D | title = Human growth hormone available for AIDS wasting | journal = GMHC Treatment Issues | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–11 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 11367383 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-label use===
{{Main|HGH controversies}}

[[off-label use|Off-label]] prescription of HGH is controversial and may be illegal.&lt;ref name="DEA: Genotropin"&gt;DEA, US Department of Justice. [http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/hgh.pdf DEA: Genotropin] Quote: "The illicit distribution of hGH occurs as the result of physicians illegally prescribing it for off-label uses, and for the treatment of FDA-approved medical conditions without examination and supervision"&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for GH as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published a study wherein GH was used to treat 12 men over 60.&lt;ref name="pmid2355952"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudman D, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA, Lalitha PY, Goldberg AF, Schlenker RA, Cohn L, Rudman IW, Mattson DE | title = Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 2355952 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199007053230101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the conclusion of the study, all the men showed statistically significant increases in lean body mass and bone mineral density, while the control group did not.  The authors of the study noted that these improvements were the opposite of the changes that would normally occur over a 10- to 20-year aging period.  Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti-aging agent.&lt;ref name="pmid17227934"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Bravata DM, Olkin I, Nayak S, Roberts B, Garber AM, Hoffman AR | title = Systematic review: the safety and efficacy of growth hormone in the healthy elderly | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–15 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17227934 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-146-2-200701160-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlNo proof that growth hormone therapy makes you live longer, study finds"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.physorg.com/news88140162.html | title = No proof that growth hormone therapy makes you live longer, study finds  | date = 2007-01-16 | work = | publisher = PhysOrg.com | pages = | quote = | access-date = 2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hgh.html Stephen Barrett, M.D. Growth Hormone Schemes and Scams]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to organizations such as the controversial [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] promoting the use of this hormone as an "anti-aging agent".&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{cite news | author = Kuczynski A  | title = Anti-Aging Potion or Poison? | publisher = New York Times | date = 1998-04-12 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Stanford University School of Medicine [[meta-analysis]] of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of GH on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2&amp;nbsp;kg and decreased body fat by the same amount.&lt;ref name="pmid17227934"/&gt; However, these were the only positive effects from taking GH.  No other critical factors were affected, such as bone density, cholesterol levels, lipid measurements, maximal oxygen consumption, or any other factor that would indicate increased fitness.&lt;ref name="pmid17227934" /&gt; Researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength, which led them to believe that GH merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth. This would explain the increase in lean body mass.

GH has also been used experimentally to treat [[multiple sclerosis]], to enhance [[weight loss]] in [[obesity]], as well as in [[fibromyalgia]], [[heart failure]], [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]], and burns. GH has also been used experimentally in patients with [[short bowel syndrome]] to lessen the requirement for intravenous [[total parenteral nutrition]].

In 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the [[Crime Control Act of 1990]], that amended the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], that classified [[anabolic steroids]] as [[controlled substances]] and added a new section that stated that a person who "knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services" has committed a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;Mannfred A. Hollinger. Introduction to Pharmacology, Third Edition. CRC Press, 2002 {{ISBN|9780415280341}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wbhAeKwhmj0C&amp;pg=PA367 Pg 376]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/333 21 U.S. Code § 333 - Penalties]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH.&lt;ref name="DEA: Genotropin"/&gt;  This section has also been interpreted by some doctors, most notably&lt;ref&gt;News Author: Laurie Barclay, MD, CME Author: Désirée Lie, MD, MSEd for Medscape. October 28, 2005 [http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/515665 Growth Hormone Deemed Illegal for Off-Label Antiaging Use]&lt;/ref&gt; the authors of a commentary article published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 2005, as meaning that ''prescribing'' HGH off-label may be considered illegal.&lt;ref name="pmid16249424"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perls TT, Reisman NR, Olshansky SJ | title = Provision or distribution of growth hormone for "antiaging": clinical and legal issues | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 16 | pages = 2086–90 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16249424 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.16.2086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And some articles in the popular press, such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use (which is clearly illegal) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe HGH off-label: "Unlike other prescription drugs, HGH may be prescribed only for specific uses. U.S. sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands."&lt;ref name=Caruso&gt;David Caruso and Jeff Donn for the Associated Press.

March 2012 [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/03/human-grown-hormone-hollywood-201203 Hollywood's Vial Bodies]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2012 article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', when asked how HGH prescriptions far exceed the number of adult patients estimated to have HGH-deficiency, Dragos Roman, who leads a team at the FDA that reviews drugs in endocrinology, said "The F.D.A. doesn't regulate off-label uses of H.G.H. Sometimes it's used appropriately. Sometimes it's not."&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;

===Side-effects===

Injection-site reaction is common.  More rarely, patients can experience  joint swelling, joint pain, [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], and an increased risk of [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="pmid17227934" /&gt;   In some cases, the patient can produce an immune response against GH.  GH may also  be a risk factor for [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="pmid16284435"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freedman RJ, Malkovska V, LeRoith D, Collins MT | title = Hodgkin lymphoma in temporal association with growth hormone replacement | journal = Endocrine Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 571–5 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16284435 | doi = 10.1507/endocrj.52.571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver GH (which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established.&lt;ref name="pmid12147369"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swerdlow AJ, Higgins CD, Adlard P, Preece MA | title = Risk of cancer in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the UK, 1959-85: a cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 360 | issue = 9329 | pages = 273–7 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12147369 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09519-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance enhancement==
{{Main|Growth hormone in sports}}

The first description of the use of GH as a doping agent was Dan Duchaine's "Underground Steroid handbook" which emerged from California in 1982; it is not known where and when GH was first used this way.&lt;ref name="pmid19467612"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holt RI, Erotokritou-Mulligan I, Sönksen PH | title = The history of doping and growth hormone abuse in sport | journal = Growth Hormone &amp; IGF Research | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–6 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19467612 | doi = 10.1016/j.ghir.2009.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance. Some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes.&lt;ref name="pmid18347346"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Bravata DM, Olkin I, Friedlander A, Liu V, Roberts B, Bendavid E, Saynina O, Salpeter SR, Garber AM, Hoffman AR | title = Systematic review: the effects of growth hormone on athletic performance | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 148 | issue = 10 | pages = 747–58 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18347346 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-148-10-200805200-00215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlAthletes Don't Benefit From Human Growth Hormone, Study Finds - Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awlswGxIiU5c&amp;refer=home | title = Athletes Don't Benefit From Human Growth Hormone, Study Finds  | author = Randall T | date = 2008-03-17 | format = | work = | publisher = Bloomberg | quote = | access-date = 2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlSteroid Nation: Review from Stanford says HGH no benefit as PED"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://grg51.typepad.com/steroid_nation/2008/03/review-from-sta.html | title = Steroid Nation: Review from Stanford says HGH no benefit as PED | author = Gaffney G  | date = 2008-03-17  | publisher = Steroid Nation | access-date = 2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many athletic societies ban the use of GH and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it. However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor.

==Dietary supplements==

To capitalize on the idea that GH might be useful to combat aging, companies selling [[dietary supplement]]s have websites selling products linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as "HGH Releasers". Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations.&lt;ref name="urlAtlas Operations, Inc."&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm215918.htm | title = Atlas Operations, Inc. | author = Singleton ER | date = 2010-06-04 | work = Warning Letter | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | access-date = 2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural use==

In the United States, it is legal to give a bovine GH to dairy cows to increase milk production, and is legal to use GH in raising cows for beef; see article on [[Bovine somatotropin]], [[cattle feeding]], [[dairy farming]] and the [[beef hormone controversy]].

The use of GH in [[poultry farming]] is illegal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/chicken_from_farm_to_table/index.asp#6 |title=Chicken from Farm to Table &amp;#124; USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service |publisher=Fsis.usda.gov |date=2011-04-06 |access-date=2011-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903125813/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/chicken_from_farm_to_table/index.asp |archive-date=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USP&amp;A FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uspoultry.org/faq/faq.cfm | title=Poultry Industry Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=U.S Poultry &amp; Egg Association | access-date=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, no chicken meat for sale in Australia is administered hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=14&amp;issue=6 | title=Hormones | publisher=Australian Chicken Meat Federation | access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug development history==
{{Main|Growth hormone treatment#History}}
The identification, purification and later synthesis of growth hormone is associated with [[Choh Hao Li]].  [[Genentech]] pioneered the first use of [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] human growth hormone for human therapy in 1981.

Prior to its production by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the [[pituitary gland]]s of [[cadaver]]s.  Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed.  Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy to the treatment of idiopathic short stature.&lt;ref name = "Maybe_1984"&gt;{{cite book | author = Maybe, Nancy G | editor = Arthur P. Bollon | title = Recombinant DNA products: insulin, interferon, and growth hormone | edition = | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1984 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = Direct expression of human growth in ''Escherichia coli'' with the lipoprotein promoter | quote = | isbn = 0-8493-5542-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an Old World monkey, the [[rhesus macaque]], were conducted by John C. Beck and colleagues in Montreal, in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="pmid13421688"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck JC, Mcgarry EE, Dyrenfurth I, Venning EH | title = Metabolic effects of human and monkey growth hormone in man | journal = Science | volume = 125 | issue = 3253 | pages = 884–5 | date = May 1957 | pmid = 13421688 | doi = 10.1126/science.125.3253.884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study published in 1957, which was conducted on "a 13-year-old male with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma," found that: "Human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage&amp;nbsp;... (and) there was a retention of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium.&amp;nbsp;... There was a gain in body weight during both periods.&amp;nbsp;... There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone. This was most marked with the human growth hormone.&amp;nbsp;... Impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone. No change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone."&lt;ref name="pmid13421688"/&gt;  The other study, published in 1958, was conducted on six people: the same subject as the Science paper; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years; a 15-year-old female with well-documented hypopituitarism secondary to a craniopharyngioma; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases;  a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.&lt;ref name="pmid13595475"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck JC, McGARRY EE, Dyrenfurth I, Venning EH | title = The metabolic effects of human and monkey growth hormone in man | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 1090–105 | date = November 1958 | pmid = 13595475 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-49-5-1090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, unusual cases of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] were found in individuals that had received cadaver-derived HGH ten to fifteen years previously.  Based on the assumption that infectious prions causing the disease were transferred along with the cadaver-derived HGH, cadaver-derived HGH was removed from the market.&lt;ref name = "isbn0-07-144011-9"/&gt;

In 1985, biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the U.S. and elsewhere.

As of 2005, recombinant growth hormones available in the United States (and their manufacturers) included Nutropin ([[Genentech]]), Humatrope ([[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]]), Genotropin ([[Pfizer]]), Norditropin ([[Novo Nordisk|Novo]]),  and Saizen ([[Merck Serono]]). In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a version of [[rHGH]] called [[Omnitrope]] (Sandoz).&lt;ref name="FDA_biosimilars"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04P0231/04P-0231-pdn0001.pdf |title=FDA Response to three Citizen Petitions against biosimilars |work=FDA |date=30 May 2006 |access-date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sustained-release form of growth hormone, Nutropin Depot (Genentech and Alkermes) was approved by the FDA in 1999, allowing for fewer injections (every 2 or 4 weeks instead of daily); however, the product was discontinued by Genentech/Alkermes in 2004 for financial reasons (Nutropin Depot required significantly more resources to produce than the rest of the Nutropin line&lt;ref name="urlGenentech and Alkermes Announce Decision to Discontinue Commercialization of Nutropin Depot"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_June_1/ai_n6050768 | title = Genentech and Alkermes Announce Decision to Discontinue Commercialization of Nutropin Depot | date = 2004-06-01 | work = Press Release | publisher =  Business Wire | access-date = 2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{Nihongo|'''Hachikō'''|ハチ公|extra=November 10, 1923 – March 8, 1935}} was a Japanese [[Akita Inu|Akita]] dog remembered for his remarkable loyalty to his owner, {{nihongo|[[Hidesaburō Ueno]]|上野 英三郎|Ueno Hidesaburō}}, for whom he continued to wait for over nine years following Ueno's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unbelievable-facts.com/2013/05/the-tale-of-most-loyal-dog-hachiko.html | title=Unbelievable Facts | accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hachikō was born on November 10, 1923 at a farm near the city of [[Ōdate, Akita|Ōdate]], [[Akita Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollywood the latest to fall for tale of Hachiko |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/06/25/national/hollywood-the-latest-to-fall-for-tale-of-hachiko/ |publisher=[[Kyodo News]] |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor at the Tokyo Imperial University, brought him to live in [[Shibuya, Tokyo]] as his pet. Hachikō would meet Ueno at Shibuya Station every day after his commute home. This continued until May 21, 1925, when Ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while at work. From then until his death in March 8, 1935, Hachikō would return to Shibuya Station every day to await Ueno's return. 

During his lifetime, the dog was held up in Japanese culture as an example of loyalty and fidelity. Well after his death, he continues to be remembered in worldwide popular culture, with statues, movies, books, and appearances in various media. Hachikō is known in Japanese as '''''chūken Hachikō''''' (忠犬ハチ公) "faithful dog Hachikō", ''hachi'' meaning "eight" and the suffix ''-kō'' indicating affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Kotobank |title=Kō (公) |url =http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%85%AC |quote=人や動物の名前に付けて，親しみ，あるいはやや軽んずる気持ちを表す。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Shibuya Station in Pre-war Showa era.JPG|thumb|left|[[Shibuya Station]] as it was in the Taishō and Pre-war Shōwa eras (1912–1945).]]
Hachiko, a golden brown Akita,  was born on November 10, 1923 at a farm located in [[Ōdate, Akita|Ōdate]], [[Akita Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. In 1924,  [[Hidesaburō Ueno]], a professor in the agriculture department at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]], took Hachikō as a pet and brought him to live in [[Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]]. Ueno would commute daily to work, and Hachikō would leave the house to greet him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The pair continued the daily routine until May 21, 1925, when Ueno did not return. The professor had suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], while he was giving a lecture, and died without ever returning to the train station in which Hachikō waited.

Each day, for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachikō awaited Ueno's return, appearing precisely when the train was due at the station.

Hachikō attracted the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those working at the station, were not necessarily friendly. However, after the first appearance of the article about him in ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' on October 4, 1932, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/218509/Dog_faithfully_awaits_return_of_his_master_for_past_11_years Dog faithfully awaits return of his master for past 11 years] story Posted Aug 18, 2007 by Chris V.

===Publication===
One of Ueno's students, Hirokichi Saito, who developed expertise on the [[Akita Inu|Akita]] breed, saw the dog at the station and followed him to the Kobayashi home, the home of Ueno's former gardener, Kuzaboro Kobayashi,&lt;ref&gt;Bouyet, Barbara. ''Akita, Treasure of Japan, Volume II.'' Hong Kong: Magnum Publishing, 2002, page 5. {{ISBN|0-9716146-0-1}}. Accessed via Google Books April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; where he learned the history of Hachikō's life. Shortly after the meeting, the former student published a documented census of Akitas in Japan. His research found only 30 purebred Akitas remaining, including Hachikō from Shibuya Station.

He returned frequently to visit Hachikō, and over the years he published several articles about the dog's remarkable loyalty. In 1932, one of his articles, published in ''Asahi Shimbun'', placed the dog in the national spotlight.

[[File:Hachiko funeral.jpg|thumb|Last known photo of Hachikō - pictured with his owner's partner Yaeko Ueno (front row, second from right) and station staff in mourning in Tokyo on March 8, 1935.]]

Hachikō became a national sensation. His faithfulness to his master's memory impressed the people of Japan as a spirit of family loyalty to which all should strive to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachikō's vigil as an example for children to follow. A well-known Japanese artist rendered a sculpture of the dog, and throughout the country, a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.

Eventually, Hachikō's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of Emperors.&lt;ref name="Skabeland"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.berfrois.com/2011/09/aaron-herald-skabelund-hachiko/ |title=Canine Imperialism |first1=Aaron Herald |last1=Skabelund |publisher=Berfrois |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Hachikō died on March 8, 1935 at the age of 11. He was found on a street in Shibuya.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Hollywood the latest to fall for tale of Hachiko," ''The Japan Times'', June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, scientists finally settled the cause of death of Hachikō: the dog had both [[Terminal illness|terminal]] [[cancer]] and a [[Dirofilaria immitis|filaria infection]]. There were also four [[yakitori]] skewers in Hachikō's stomach, but the skewers did not damage his stomach or cause his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_japan_faithful_dog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305182929/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/as_japan_faithful_dog|title=Mystery solved in death of legendary Japanese dog|archivedate=5 March 2011|work=yahoo.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/03/04/national/worms-not-skewer-did-in-hachiko/|title=Worms, not skewer, did in Hachiko|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze statues===
[[File:Hachiko Statue, Shibuya.jpg|thumb|The Hachikō Statue at Shibuya Station in Tokyo is a popular meeting place.]]

In April 1934, a bronze statue based in his likeness sculpted by Teru Ando was erected at [[Shibuya Station]] ({{Coord|35|39|32.6|N|139|42|2.1|E|type:landmark_scale:1000}}), and Hachikō himself was present at its unveiling. The statue was recycled for the war effort during [[World War II]]. In 1948, the Society for Recreating the Hachikō Statue commissioned{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Takeshi Ando, son of the original artist, to make a second statue. When the new statue appeared, a dedication ceremony occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Lesléa. ''Hachiko Waits''. Macmillan, 2004.

Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on February 25, 2011. {{ISBN|0-8050-7336-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7336-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new statue, which was erected in August 1948, still stands and is a popular meeting spot. The station entrance near this statue is named "Hachikō-guchi", meaning "The Hachikō Entrance/Exit", and is one of Shibuya Station's five exits.

''[[The Japan Times]]'' played an April Fools' joke on readers by reporting that the bronze statue was stolen a little before 2:00 AM on April 1, 2007, by "suspected metal thieves". The false story told a very detailed account of an elaborate theft by men wearing khaki workers' uniforms who secured the area with orange safety cones and obscured the theft with blue vinyl tarps. The "crime" was allegedly recorded on security cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/april_fool_a.html |title=METAL THIEVES SUSPECTED: Shibuya's 'loyal dog Hachiko' vanishes overnight |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=The Japan Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222100255/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/april_fool_a.html |archivedate=December 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statue stands in Hachikō's hometown, in front of [[Ōdate Station]]. In 2004, a new statue of Hachikō was erected in front of the [[Akita Dog Museum]] in [[Odate]], Japan.

After the release of the American movie ''[[Hachi: A Dog's Tale]]'' (2009) filmed in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the Japanese Consulate in the United States helped the [[Blackstone Valley]] Tourism Council and the city of [[Woonsocket]] to unveil an identical statue of Hachikō at the [[Woonsocket Depot Square]], which was the location of the "Bedridge" train station featured in the movie.

On March 9, 2015, the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tokyo unveiled a bronze statue depicting Ueno returning to meet Hachikō at the [[University of Tokyo]], Japan to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/02/11/hachiko-japans-most-loyal-dog-finally-reunited-with-owner-in-heartwarming-new-statue-in-tokyo |title=Hachiko, Japan's most loyal dog, finally reunited with owner in heartwarming new statue in Tokyo |website=rocketnews24.com |date=11 February 2015 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was sculpted by Tsutomo Ueda from Nagoya and depicts a very excited Hachikō jumping up to greet his master at the end of a workday. Ueno is dressed in a hat, suit, and trench coat, with his briefcase placed on the ground. Hachikō wears a studded harness as seen in his last photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/hachiko-statue-university-of-tokyo/20013|title=Hachiko Statue University of Tokyo - Tokyo - Japan Travel - Japan Tourism Guide and Travel Map|work=JapanTravel|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hachikō' "speaks"===
In 1994, the [[Nippon Cultural Broadcasting]] in Japan was able to lift a recording of Hachikō barking from an old record that had been broken into several pieces. A huge advertising campaign ensued and on Saturday, May 28, 1994, 59 years after his death, millions of radio listeners tuned in to hear Hachikō bark.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/06/03/japans-hero-barks-from-beyond-the-grave/aa761354-d891-4bed-b451-6f123f5fbd44/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9214069d56d7 Retrieved 13 Nov 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Shibuya ward started new minibus (officially called "community bus") routes in the ward, and nicknamed them "[[:ja:ハチ公バス|Hachiko-bus]]".  Now there are four different routes.

In July 2012, rare photos from Hachikō's life were shown at the [[Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp.e.mu.hp.transer.com/est/kyodo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shibuya|Shibuya ward]] as part of the "Shin Shuzo Shiryoten" (Exhibition of newly stored materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201206160043|title=Shibuya museum showcases last photo of loyal pooch Hachiko|date=2012-06-16|publisher=The Asahi Shimbun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718073400/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201206160043|archivedate=2012-07-18|author=Ohmoro, Kazuya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, a previously undiscovered photograph of Hachikō was published for the first time. The image, which was captured in 1934 by a Tokyo bank employee, shows the dog relaxing in front of Shibuya Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002513920|title=Rare photograph shows Hachiko relaxing alone at Shibuya Station|date=2015-11-05|newspaper=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114153909/http://the-japan-news.com:80/news/article/0002513920 |archive-date=2015-11-14 |dead-url=yes|author=The Yomiuri Shimbun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yaeko Sakano===
'''{{nihongo|Yaeko Sakano|坂野 八重子|Sakano Yaeko}}''', more often referred as '''Yaeko Ueno''', was an unmarried partner to Hidesaburō Ueno for about 10 years until his death in 1925. Hachikō was reported to have shown great happiness and affection towards her whenever she came to visit him. Yaeko died on 30 April 1961 at the age of 76 and was buried at a temple in [[Taitō]], further away from Ueno's grave, despite her requests to her family members to be buried with her late partner.

In 2013, Yaeko's record which indicated that she had wanted to be buried with Ueno was found by Sho Shiozawa, the professor of the University of Tokyo. Shiozawa was also the president of the Japanese Society of Irrigation, Drainage and Rural Engineering, which manages Ueno’s grave at [[Aoyama Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160520/p2a/00m/0na/017000c|title=Remains of Hachiko master's wife reinterred with husband, famously loyal dog|date=2016-05-20|work=Mainichi Daily News|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on November 10, 2013, which also marked the 90th anniversary of the Birth of Hachikō, Sho Shiozawa and Keita Matsui, a curator of the [[Shibuya Folk and Literary Shirane Memorial]] Museum, felt the need that Yaeko to be buried together with Ueno and Hachikō.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/life/In-love-and-death-30289231.html|title=In love and death  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process began with willing consent from the Ueno and Sakano families and the successful negotiations with management of the Aoyama Cemetery. However, due to regulations and bureaucracy, the process took about 2 years. Shiozawa also went on as one of the organizers involved with the erection of bronze statue of Hachikō and Ueno which was unveiled on the grounds of the University of Tokyo on March 9, 2015 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Hachikō's death.

==Reunion of Hachikō family==
On 19 May 2016 during the ceremony at the Aoyama Cemetery with both Ueno and Sakano families in present, some of the ashes of Yaeko Sakano were buried with Ueno and Hachikō, her name and the date of her death was inscribed on the side of his tombstone, thus fulfilling the reunion of Hachikō's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vergil.hateblo.jp/entry/2016/05/21/100809|title=もうひとつの「ハチ公」物語 - 読む・考える・書く|date=1463792889|work=読む・考える・書く|access-date=2018-04-06|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By putting the names of both on their grave, we can show future generations the fact that Hachikō had two keepers," Shiozawa said. "To Hachikō the professor was his father, and Yaeko was his mother," Matsui added.

In Japan itself, it was not an unprecedented story.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

According to [[Nihongi]], during the reign of [[Emperor Sushun]]-Tennō, a warrior named [[Yorozu of the Tottori-be]] ([[:ja:捕鳥部万|ja]]), vassal of Mononobe no Moriya no Ōmuraji and commander of hundred soldiers, was suspected of plotting a rebellion against the Soga clan, who happened to just kill the man. Yorozu fled alone to hide in the countryside, but he was pursued by Imperial Court soldiers. He escaped them with great ingenuity until he got shot in the knee by an arrow. Though he claimed being innocent, loyal to the Emperor and ready to surrender, the soldiers still came for the kill. Despite his injury, Yorozu deflected their arrows (Yadomejutsu), and proceeded on cutting down more than 30 of them with his sword. Probably exhausted by this martial prowess, Yorozu destroyed his bow, threw his sword into a river (in a similar fashion as the knight [[Roland]] le Preux) and finally stabbed himself in the throat with a dagger (this way of committing suicide was quite common in China at the time of [[Spring and Autumn period]]). The local governor of Kawachi received the order to cut Yorozu's corpse to pieces and expose it in order to make an example, but the white dog of Yorozu fled with his head in his mouth and brought it upon an ancient burial mound. Yorozu's dog then laid down close by and starved to death while mourning his master. The Imperial Court was moved by the dog's loyalty :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''The case of this dog is one that is rarely heard of in the world, and should be shown to after ages. Let Yorozu's kindred be made to construct a tomb and bury their remains''."

{{Information science}}
'''Informatics''' is a branch of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]]. It involves the practice of [[information processing]] and the engineering of [[information system]]s, and as an [[discipline (academia)|academic field]] it is an [[applied science|applied]] form of [[information science]]. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems. As such, the field of informatics has great breadth and encompasses many subspecialties, including disciplines of [[computer science]], [[information systems]], [[information technology]] and [[statistics]]. Since the advent of computers, individuals and organizations increasingly process information digitally. This has led to the study of informatics with computational, mathematical, biological, cognitive and social aspects, including study of the social impact of information technologies.

==Etymology==
{{see also|Computer science#Etymology}}

In 1956 the German computer scientist [[Karl Steinbuch]] coined the word ''Informatik'' by publishing a paper called ''Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung'' ("Informatics: Automatic Information Processing").&lt;ref&gt;[http://helios.informatik.uni-kl.de/euology.pdf Karl Steinbuch Eulogy – Bernard Widrow, Reiner Hartenstein, Robert Hecht-Nielsen ]&lt;/ref&gt; The English term ''Informatics'' is sometimes understood as meaning the same as [[computer science]]. The German word ''Informatik'' is usually translated to English as  ''computer science''.

The [[French language|French]] term ''informatique'' was coined in 1962 by [[Philippe Dreyfus]]&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Phillipe. ''L’informatique.'' Gestion, Paris, June 1962, pp. 240–41&lt;/ref&gt; together with various translations—informatics (English), also proposed independently and simultaneously by [[Walter F. Bauer]] and associates who co-founded ''[[Dataproducts#Informatics|Informatics Inc.]]'', and ''informatica'' (Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch), referring to the application of computers to store and process information.

The term was coined as a combination of "information" and "automatic" to describe the science of [[automation|automating]] information interactions.
The morphology—''informat''-ion + -''ics''—uses "the accepted form for names of sciences, as conics, linguistics, optics, or matters of practice, as economics, politics, tactics",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and so, linguistically, the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing.

==History==
{{see also|History of computer science|History of computing}}

The culture of library science promotes policies and procedures for managing information that fosters the relationship between library science and the development of information science to provide benefits for health informatics development; which is traced to the 1950s with the beginning of computer uses in healthcare (Nelson &amp; Staggers p.4).  Early practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no formal education programs set up to educate them on the informatics science until the late 1960s and early 1970s. Professional development began to emerge, playing a significant role in the development of health informatics (Nelson &amp;Staggers p.7)
According to Imhoff et al., 2001, healthcare informatics is not only the application of computer technology to problems in healthcare but covers all aspects of generation, handling, communication, storage, retrieval, management, analysis, discovery, and synthesis of data information and knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare. Furthermore, they stated that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as follows: To provide solutions for problems related to data, information, and knowledge processing. To study general principles of processing data information and knowledge in medicine and healthcare.

This new term was adopted across Western Europe, and, except in English, developed a meaning roughly translated by the English ‘computer science’, or ‘computing science’. [[Alexander Ivanovich Mikhailov|Mikhailov]] advocated the Russian term ''informatika'' (1966), and the English ''informatics'' (1967), as names for the ''theory of scientific information'', and argued for a broader meaning, including study of the use of information technology in various communities (for example, scientific) and of the interaction of technology and human organizational structures.
:''Informatics is the discipline of science which investigates the structure and properties (not specific content) of scientific information, as well as the regularities of scientific information activity, its theory, history, methodology and organization.''&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailov, A.I., Chernyl, A.I., and Gilyarevskii, R.S. (1966) "Informatika – novoe nazvanie teorii naučnoj informacii." ''Naučno tehničeskaja informacija'', 12, pp. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage has since modified this definition in three ways. First, the restriction to scientific information is removed, as in business informatics or legal informatics. Second, since most information is now digitally stored, computation is now central to informatics. Third, the representation, processing and communication of information are added as objects of investigation, since they have been recognized as fundamental to any scientific account of information. Taking ''information'' as the central focus of study distinguishes ''informatics'' from ''[[computer science]].'' Informatics includes the study of biological and social mechanisms of information processing whereas computer science focuses on the digital computation. Similarly, in the study of representation and communication, informatics is indifferent to the substrate that carries information. For example, it encompasses the study of communication using gesture, speech and language, as well as digital communications and networking.

In the English-speaking world the term ''informatics'' was first widely used in the compound [[medical informatics]], taken to include "the cognitive, information processing, and communication tasks of medical practice, education, and research, including information science and the technology to support these tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Greenes, R.A. and Shortliffe, E.H. (1990) "Medical Informatics: An emerging discipline with academic and institutional perspectives." ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 263(8) pp. 1114–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such compounds are now in use; they can be viewed as different areas of "''applied informatics''".
Indeed, "In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69363-why-an-informatics-degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

Informatics encompasses the study of systems that [[knowledge representation|represent]], [[information processing|process]], and [[communication|communicate]] information.
However, the [[theory of computation]] in the specific discipline of [[theoretical computer science]], which evolved from [[Alan Turing]], studies the notion of a [[complex system]] regardless of whether or not [[information]] actually exists. Since both fields process information, there is some disagreement among scientists as to field hierarchy; for example [[Arizona State University]] attempted to adopt a broader definition of informatics to even encompass [[cognitive science]] at the launch of its [https://web.archive.org/web/20061025101825/http://sci.asu.edu/index.php School of Computing and Informatics] in September 2006.

A broad interpretation of ''informatics'', as "the study of the structure, algorithms, behaviour, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems," was introduced by the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1994 when it formed the grouping that is now its [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]]. This meaning is now (2006) increasingly used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.henley.reading.ac.uk/IRC/ University of Reading], [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/ Sussex], [http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/ City University], [http://www.infc.ulst.ac.uk/ Ulster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420164145/http://www.infc.ulst.ac.uk/ |date=2006-04-20 }}, [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/home/index.php Bradford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517090122/http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/home/index.php |date=2006-05-17 }}, [http://www.informatics.manchester.ac.uk/  Manchester] and [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iri/ Newcastle]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030907164628/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iri/ |date=2003-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]], of the UK Funding Councils, includes a new, ''Computer Science and Informatics,'' unit of assessment (UoA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/pubs/2006/01/docs/f23.pdf UoA 23 Computer Science and Informatics, Panel working methods]&lt;/ref&gt; whose scope is described as follows:
:''The UoA includes the study of methods for acquiring, storing, processing, communicating and reasoning about information, and the role of interactivity in natural and artificial systems, through the implementation, organisation and use of computer hardware, software and other resources. The subjects are characterised by the rigorous application of analysis, experimentation and design.''

==Academic schools and departments==
{{advert||date=September 2018}}
Academic research in the informatics area can be found in a number of disciplines such as [[computer science]], [[information technology]], [[Information and Computer Science]], [[information system]]s, business [[information management]] and [[health informatics]].

In France, the first degree level qualifications in Informatics (computer science) appeared in the mid-1960s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In English-speaking countries, the first example of a degree level qualification in Informatics occurred in 1982 when Plymouth Polytechnic (now the [[Plymouth University|University of Plymouth]]) offered a four-year BSc(Honours) degree in Computing and Informatics – with an initial intake of only 35 students.  The course still runs today &lt;ref&gt;BSc(Hons) Computing Informatics – University of Plymouth [http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/1926/BSc+(Hons)+Computing+Informatics/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the longest available qualification in the subject.

At the [[Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering]] ([http://www.soic.indiana.edu Bloomington], [http://informatics.iupui.edu Indianapolis] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091009165240/http://www.informatics.ius.edu/ Southeast]), informatics is defined as "the art, science and human dimensions of information technology" and "the study, application, and social consequences of technology." It is also defined in Informatics 101, Introduction to Informatics as "the application of information technology to the arts, sciences, and professions." These definitions are widely accepted in the [[United States]], and differ from British usage in omitting the study of natural computation.

[[Texas Woman's University]] places its informatics degrees in its department of Mathematics and Computer Science within the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, though it offers interdisciplinary Health Informatics degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.twu.edu/informatics/ |title=Informatics - Texas Woman's University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informatics is presented in a generalist framework, as evidenced by their definition of informatics ("Using technology and data analytics to derive meaningful information from data for data and decision driven practice in user centered systems"), though TWU is also known for its nursing and health informatics programs.

At the [[University of California, Irvine]] [http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics/ Department of Informatics], informatics is defined as "the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use and impact of information technology.  The discipline of informatics is based on the recognition that the design of this technology is not solely a technical matter, but must focus on the relationship between the technology and its use in real-world settings. That is, informatics designs solutions in context, and takes into account the social, cultural and organizational settings in which computing and information technology will be used."

At the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] [http://informatics.umich.edu/ Informatics interdisciplinary major], informatics is defined as "the study of information and the ways information is used by and affects human beings and social systems. The major involves coursework from the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, where the Informatics major is housed, as well as the School of Information and the College of Engineering.  Key to this growing field is that it applies both technological and social perspectives to the study of information. Michigan's interdisciplinary approach to teaching Informatics gives a solid grounding in contemporary computer programming, mathematics, and statistics, combined with study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems. Experts in the field help design new information technology tools for specific scientific, business, and cultural needs."  Michigan offers four curricular tracks within the informatics degree to provide students with increased expertise. These four track topics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informatics.umich.edu/informatics/curriculum |publisher=University of Michigan |title=Curriculum - Informatics - University of Michigan |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Internet Informatics'': An applied track in which students experiment with technologies behind Internet-based information systems and acquire skills to map problems to deployable Internet-based solutions. This track will replace Computational Informatics in Fall 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concentration: Informatics - LSA Students - University of Michigan|url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/students/academicsrequirements/concentrationsminors/informatics/concentrationinformatics|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130107070418/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/students/academicsrequirements/concentrationsminors/informatics/concentrationinformatics|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 January 2013|website=archive.li|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data Mining &amp; Information Analysis: Integrates the collection, analysis, and visualization of complex data and its critical role in research, business, and government to provide students with practical skills and a theoretical basis for approaching challenging data analysis problems.
* ''Life Science Informatics'': Examines artificial information systems, which has helped scientists make great progress in identifying core components of organisms and ecosystems.
* Social Computing:  Advances in computing have created opportunities for studying patterns of social interaction and developing systems that act as introducers, recommenders, coordinators, and record-keepers. Students, in this track, craft, evaluate, and refine social software computer applications for engaging technology in unique social contexts. This track will be phased out in Fall 2013 in favor of the new bachelor of science in information. This will be the first undergraduate degree offered by the School of Information since its founding in 1996.  The School of Information already contains a Master's program, Doctorate program, and a professional master's program in conjunction with the School of Public Health.  The BS in Information at the University of Michigan will be the first curriculum program of its kind in the United States, with the first graduating class to emerge in 2015.  Students will be able to apply for this unique degree in 2013 for the 2014 Fall semester; the new degree will be a stem off of the most popular Social Computing track in the current Informatics interdisciplinary major in LSA.  Applications will be open to upper-classmen, juniors and seniors, along with a variety of information classes available for first and second year students to gauge interest and value in the specific sector of study.  The degree was approved by the University on June 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMSI plans new undergraduate degree|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|work=University of Michigan School of Information|accessdate=11 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221221859/http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with a new degree in the School of Information, there has also been the first and only chapter of an Informatics Professional Fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi, chartered in Fall 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kappa Theta Pi (KTP)|url=https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/kappathetapi|accessdate=19 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902055835/https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/kappathetapi|archivedate=2 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Washington, Seattle]] [https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics Informatics Undergraduate Program], Informatics is an undergraduate program offered by the [https://ischool.uw.edu/ Information School]. Bachelor of Science in Informatics is described as "[a] program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. Includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management." Washington offers three degree options as well as a custom track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics/degree-options |publisher=University of Washington Information School |title=Degree Options |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data Science Option: Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that works to extract knowledge or insight from data. It combines fields such as information science, computer science, statistics, design, and social science.
* Human-Computer Interaction: The iSchool’s work in human-computer interaction (HCI) strives to make information and computing useful, usable, and accessible to all. The Informatics HCI option allows one to blend your technical skills and expertise with a broader perspective on how design and development work impacts users. Courses explore the design, construction, and evaluation of interactive technologies for use by individuals, groups, and organizations, and the social implications of these systems. This work encompasses user interfaces, accessibility concerns, new design techniques and methods for interactive systems and collaboration. Coursework also examines the values implicit in the design and development of technology.
* Information Architecture: Information architecture (IA) is a crucial component in the development of successful Web sites, software, intranets, and online communities. Architects structure the underlying information and its presentation in a logical and intuitive way so that people can put information to use. As an Informatics major with an IA option, one will master the skills needed to organize and label information for improved navigation and search. One will build frameworks to effectively collect, store and deliver information. One will also learn to design the databases and XML storehouses that drive complex and interactive websites, including the navigation, content layout, personalization, and transactional features of the site.
* Information Assurance and Cybersecurity: Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (IAC) is the practice of creating and managing safe and secure systems. It is crucial for organizations public and private, large and small. In the IAC option, one will be equipped with the knowledge to create, deploy, use, and manage systems that preserve individual and organizational privacy and security. This tri-campus concentration leverages the strengths of the Information School, the Computing and Software Systems program at UW Bothell, and the Institute of Technology at UW Tacoma. After a course in the technical, policy, and management foundations of IAC, one may take electives at any campus to learn such specialties as information assurance policy, secure coding, or networking and systems administration.
* Custom (Student-Designed Concentration): Students may choose to develop their own concentration, with approval from the academic adviser. Student-designed concentrations are created out of a list of approved courses and also result in the Bachelor of Science degree.

One of the most significant areas of application of informatics is that of organizational informatics. Organizational informatics is fundamentally interested in the application of information, information systems and ICT within organisations of various forms including private sector, public sector and voluntary sector organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2002). Information Systems: an introduction to informatics in Organisations. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|0-333-96390-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2009). Business Information Systems. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|978-0-230-20368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, organisational informatics can be seen to be a sub-category of [[social informatics]] and a super-category of [[business informatics]]. Organizational informatics are also present in the computer science and information technology industry. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''John Beveridge''', [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (8 August 1848{{spaced ndash}}15 March 1916) was a New South Wales businessman, sportsman and local government politician, who served as an Alderman (1886–1891) and [[Municipality of Redfern|Mayor of Redfern]] (1891).

==Early life and background==
Beveridge was born 8 August 1848 in the town of [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]], [[New South Wales|Colony of New South Wales]]. He was the son of John Beveridge, a baker and [[Confectionery|confectioner]], and Jane Greig, who as assisted migrants had emigrated from [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], to Sydney on 16 January 1839. At the age of 19, Beveridge entered the mercantile firm of ''George Griffiths and Co.'' in 1867. On 8 August 1871 he was married to Priscilla Wright, the [[Anglo-Irish]] daughter of teacher and later principal of the [[Sydney Teachers College|Fort Street Training School]] John Wright (1822–1887),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13657570 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 May 1887 |accessdate=15 April 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, by the Rev. Robert Lewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13243090 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=14 August 1871 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63621940 |title=Leaders in Our Mercantile World. |newspaper=[[Illustrated Sydney News]] |date=22 August 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge and his wife Priscilla had seven children: John Stuart (1872–1874),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13339415 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 November 1874 |accessdate=15 April 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Beveridge|Percy]] (1875–1947), Mabel (1878–1955), Harry (1882–1943), Violet (1886–1975), Cecil (1888–1946)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22252748 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=22 June 1946 |accessdate=18 April 2015 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Stuart (1893–1916). In 1880 he was made a partner in the firm, and on the retirement of Griffiths became the owner, which specialised in "wholesale grocery and general merchandise" from its premises on the corner of [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and Young streets, Sydney.&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt;

A prominent member of the flourishing business community in Sydney and Redfern, Beveridge became involved as a member of the [[Sydney Chamber of Commerce]] and as a director of the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Corporation of New South Wales, the Sydney Real Estate Bank and the Australian Traders' Fire Insurance Company.&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt; Beveridge also became a member of the Redfern Branch of the [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13697600 |title=MEETINGS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 September 1888 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A keen sportsman, Beveridge was a member of the Cricket Union (vice-president in 1889) and was instrumental in the development of the Surry United Cricket Club, being captain from 1879 (now the Surry Hills Cricket Club).&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt;

==Public service==
Beveridge eventually stood for office as a free trader and became an [[alderman]] unopposed on [[Municipality of Redfern|Redfern Municipal Council]] for Belmore Ward on 20 September 1886, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Alderman [[Francis Augustus Wright]], and was re-elected in February 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13642295 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW |date=21 September 1886 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13672542 |title=THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND NOMINATIONS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 February 1888 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article222438175 |title=BOROUGH OF REDFERN. |newspaper=New South Wales Government Gazette |issue=550 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=28 September 1886 |accessdate=2 June 2016 |page=6578 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at [[Redfern Town Hall]] to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of free trader John Martin for a by-election to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Redfern|Redfern]]; the meeting was attended by [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]] who also spoke in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13695695 |title=REDFERN ELECTION. ADDRESS BY MR. J. A. MARTIN. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 September 1888 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beveridge strongly aligned himself with the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the [[New South Wales colonial election, 1889|1889 colonial election]], but was unsuccessful, missing out by a margin of over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712311 |title=Advertising |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |issue=15,868 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=30 January 1889 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712655 |title=Advertising |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |issue=15,870 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 February 1889 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green |first1=Antony |title=NSW Elections – Redfern 1889 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1889/Redfern.htm |website=NSW Elections Index |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=27 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826001442/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1889/Redfern.htm |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712299 |title=THE REDFERN ELECTORATE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 January 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article160793841 |title=THE ELECTIONS IN NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |location=SA |date=9 February 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=37 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], on the advice of Free Trader Minister for Public Instruction, [[Joseph Carruthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article219922146 |title=PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARDS. |newspaper=[[New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=316 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 June 1890 |accessdate=29 May 2016 |page=4632 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 1891 Beveridge was elected to be mayor of the council and was instrumental in making Redfern the first suburb in Sydney to have electricity and electric street lighting, which occurred when the Council voted unanimously in 1891, following the recommendations of the improvements committee, to build its own power station in Turner Street to power the suburb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114311716 |title=Advertising |newspaper=Evening News |issue=7376 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 January 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13814379 |title=REDFERN. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 February 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113884043 |title=A Redfern Loan. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|location=Sydney |date=24 April 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge then proposed and passed through council a loan of £50,000 for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article235888446 |title=A REDFERN BOROUGH LOAN. |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |issue=3688 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 April 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article235877997 |title=THE PROPOSED REDFERN LOAN. |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |issue=3691 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=28 April 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement by the council was later affirmed and protected by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] when it passed the ''Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/borela1895nb376.pdf|website=austlii.edu.au|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by May 1891 Beveridge had resigned as mayor and an alderman for Redfern prior to his candidacy for the [[New South Wales colonial election, 1891|1891 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113882008 |title=Resignation of the Mayor of Redfern. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|location=Sydney |date=30 May 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vacancy in Belmore Ward was subsequently filled by [[William Poole (Australian politician)|William Poole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article222097361 |title=BOROUGH OF REDFERN. |newspaper=New South Wales Government Gazette |issue=397 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 June 1891 |accessdate=2 June 2016 |page=4632 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge stood again as a Free Trade candidate for Redfern, reaffirming his support for the Free Trade vision for [[Australian Federation]] and noting that overall wages in New South Wales were higher compared to Victoria and taxation was lower owing to the Free Trade system in NSW, a system "that is best for the commercial interests of the colony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13828422 |title=REDFERN. THE FREETRADE BUNCH. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=17 June 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge was however again unsuccessful at the June election which saw the Free Traders lose out to the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] and the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green |first1=Antony |title=NSW Elections – Redfern 1891 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1891/Redfern.htm |website=NSW Elections Index |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=27 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826001528/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1891/Redfern.htm |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following this defeat, Beveridge returned to business, taking up a high-ranking position in the Sydney office of the [[New York Life Insurance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66444966 |title=News in Brief. |newspaper=Windsor and Richmond Gazette|location=NSW |date=13 October 1894 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, ''George Griffiths and Co.'' to David Cohen and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article219925564 |title=Transfer of Trade-mark (registered No. 3,533) under sec. 6 of Trade-marks Act 28 Vic.

===Lithgow===
By 1896, Beveridge had opened his own retail business in the rural and mining town of [[Lithgow]] and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the ''[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]]'' noted: "no doubt, ere long Mr. [Beveridge] will take a leading part in matters connected with the welfare of the town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and a matter of a few months will decide whether he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72548695 |title=TOPICS OF THE DAY. |newspaper=Windsor and Richmond Gazette|location=NSW |date=23 May 1896 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on [[City of Lithgow|Lithgow Municipal Council]], but received only 6 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14036705 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=NSW |date=10 February 1896 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108865231 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Evening News]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=8 February 1897 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the "Beveridge Cup" for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician [[Joseph Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71333288 |title=Country Clubs. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=9 September 1899 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=52 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A supporter of [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation]], Beveridge was nominated to attend the People's Federal Convention at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in November 1896, which had convened to discuss the 1891 draft Constitution being proposed for the Commonwealth of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article156708966 |title=People's Federal Convention. |newspaper=[[The National advocate|National Advocate (Bathurst, NSW : 1889 - 1954)]] |location=Bathurst, NSW |date=18 November 1896 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important recommendation made by the convention was that the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] should be directly-elected.

By 1901, Beveridge had moved again to the Riverina town of [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], and opened his own general merchandise store, "''Beveridge &amp; Co.''", in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article140157722 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Riverine Grazier]] |issue=3452 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 May 1902 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not long before Beveridge again returned to Cricketing circles, gaining much respect in the Hay Cricket Association, later serving as vice-president, and rising to be President of the Hay Chamber of Commerce in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article144653851 |title=Hay Chamber of Commerce. |newspaper=[[Riverina Times, Hay Standard and Journal of Water Conservation]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 October 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1901, Beveridge was elected as Honorary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the Hay Free Trade Association and later assisting in the campaign of Free Trade candidate [[James Ashton (politician)|James Ashton]] for the seat of [[Division of Riverina|Riverina]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143538934 |title=FREETRADE. |newspaper=The Riverine Grazier |issue=3340 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=22 February 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143542414 |title=THE FEDERAL ELECTION. |newspaper=The Riverine Grazier|issue=3349 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 March 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Sydney===
After moving back to Sydney with his family, in later years he served as the general manager of the Merchants' and Traders' Employment Bureau, which his brother Peter had purchased in July 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85864250 |title=FROM WEEK TO WEEK. |newspaper=[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]] |location=NSW |date=25 July 1908 |accessdate=29 March 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau's offices were sited within the New York Mutual Life Building at 14 [[Martin Place]], Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sands Sydney, Suburban and Country Commercial Directory|url=http://cdn.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/learn/history/archives/sands/1910-1919/1913-part18.pdf|publisher=City of Sydney|accessdate=7 December 2015|date=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge moved with his family to a new residence, "Violet" in Balfour Road, [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], but in later years his health suffered greatly owing to "acute heart trouble", which led to his death aged 67 on 15 March 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15655339 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=17 March 1916 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121178683 |title=DEATH OF MR.

'''Karmein Chan''' was a 13-year-old [[Australians|Australian]] girl who was abducted from her home in  [[Templestowe, Victoria]], during the night of 13 April 1991 and was subsequently murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silvester|first=John|title='Mr Cruel' filmed his victims, say police|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/04/07/1143916721667.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=8 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==
Chan was at home babysitting her two younger sisters while both her parents worked at a Chinese restaurant they owned in the nearby Melbourne suburb of [[Eltham, Victoria|Eltham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heath |first1=Sally |title=Agony and hope of the waiting family |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22082532/the_age/ |accessdate=22 July 2018 |work=The Age |date=11 April 1992 |page=20 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan and her sisters were confronted by a man in a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] with a knife.

==Related events==
There had been several abductions of girls in Melbourne prior to the abduction of Chan by an offender known in the media as [[Mr Cruel]]. [[Victoria Police]] had started scaling down Operation Challenge the day before Chan's abduction that had been established to investigate two abductions in which the victim was raped and an earlier home invasion also involving rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobin|first1=Bruce|title=Why Mr Cruel has to be caught|work=The Age|date=11 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detectives believed that Chan would be released the same as previous girls abducted. 

==Investigation==
On 6 May 1991, 23 days after Chan's abduction, Victoria Police formed the Spectrum Taskforce to investigate Chan's abduction and to continue Operation Challenge investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobin|first1=Bruce|title=Police receive 400 calls on kidnap drawings|work=The Age|date=28 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reward of $100,000 was offered for information on her abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karmein Chan $100,000 award announced 1991 |url=http://www.vicpolicenews.com.au/rewards/3405-karmein-chan.html |website=Victoria Police News |publisher=Victoria Police Media Unit |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401022649/http://www.vicpolicenews.com.au/rewards/3405-karmein-chan.html |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keeping All Students Safe Act''' refers to a pair of  [[American (USA)|American]] legislative proposals introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 6, 2011 as  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381: H.R. 1381] and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]  on December 16, 2011 as [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020].  The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school.  The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.&lt;ref name="HR4247"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4247: HR4247] Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act, H.R. 4247, U.S. House of Representatives, Dec. 9, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), Ranking Member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]], and Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS).

==Background &amp; Legislative History==
Restraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely.  Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.&lt;ref name="S2020"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 2, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects.&lt;ref name="GAO1"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122526.pdf  U.S. GAO Report] United States Government Accountability Office, “Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers,” May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found "hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-oks-bill-limiting-teachers-in-restraint-seclusion-of-students-q93u2gl-137984118.html Journal Sentinel], “Senate OKs Bill Limiting Teachers In Restraint, Seclusion Of Students,” Journal Sentinel, Jan. 24, 2012.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the incidents involved children with [[disabilities]] who are enrolled in [[special education]], the GAO reported.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;

The GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint.  The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room.  Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time.

She testified that other children were denied access to food, water, and the bathroom while isolated in seclusion confinement rooms.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;  The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.  Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104277070 National Public Radio] Joseph Shapiro, “Report: Discipline Methods Endanger Disabled Kids,” National Public Radio, May 19, 2009.

The United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group.  The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt417/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt417.pdf  House Report 111-417], U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education &amp; Labor, House Report 111-417, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools, Feb. 23, 2010.

It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.

As there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  The GAO found that only five states kept records.  In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08.

On December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller.  It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/12/09/restraint-bill-introduced/6448/ Disability Scoop], Michelle Diament, “Lawmakers Unveil Restraint And Seclusion Bill,” Disability Scoop, December 9, 2009.

Restraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011.  On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS).&lt;ref name="HR1381"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381], H.R. 1381, Keeping All Students Safe Act, April 6, 2011.

==Description of the Keeping All Students Safe Act==
This section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011.  The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.

The House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation.  The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation.  Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning.  
 
The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation.  The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe.  The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020 sec 4] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 4, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381 sec 5], Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 5, H.R. 1381, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture.  Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

Both bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;   There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;

Both bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners.  Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students.  The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

The Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;   Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-1649-filed.pdf  Federal Register], Medicaid Program; Use of Restraint and Seclusion in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Providing Psychiatric Services to Individuals Under Age 21; Interim Final Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. 7148, Jan. 22, 2001.  Retrieved March 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Congressman Miller on Introduction==

When Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-07/pdf/CREC-2011-04-07-pt1-PgH2413-7.pdf#page=1  Congressional Record House], Congressman George Miller, Congressional Record, April 6, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on Introduction==
Senator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so.  He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices.  . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that.  . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-16/pdf/CREC-2011-12-16-pt1-PgS8735.pdf  Congressional Record Senate], Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, Dec. 16, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin" /&gt;

==Related Events==
In March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection.  It reported that students with disabilities made up  represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school.  For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint.  CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use.  African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint.  Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf  CRDC Data Collection] Dept. of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, Revealing New Truths About Our Nation’s Schools, March 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">[[File:Lithotomy position.jpg|thumb|Lithotomy position.]]
The '''lithotomy position''' is a medical term referring to a common position for surgical procedures and medical examinations involving the pelvis and lower abdomen, as well as a common position for [[childbirth]] in Western nations. The lithotomy position involves the positioning of an individual's feet above or at the same level as the hips (often in stirrups), with the [[perineum]] positioned at the edge of an examination table. References to the position have been found in some of the oldest known medical documents including versions of the [[Hippocratic oath]] (see [[lithotomy]]); the position is named after the ancient surgical procedure for removing [[kidney stones]] and [[bladder stones]] via the [[perineum]]. The position is perhaps most recognizable as the 'often used' position for childbirth: the patient is laid on the back with knees bent, positioned above the hips, and spread apart through the use of [[stirrup]]s.

The position is frequently used and has many obvious benefits from the doctor's perspective. Most notably the position provides good visual and physical access to the perineal region. The position is used for procedures ranging from simple pelvic exams to surgeries and procedures including those involving [[reproductive|reproductive organs]], [[urological|urology]], and [[gastrointestinal]] systems. New observations and scientific findings, combined with a greater sensitivity to patient needs have raised awareness of the physical and psychological risks the position may pose for prolonged surgical procedures, pelvic examinations, and, most notably, childbirth.

==Use for prolonged surgical procedures==
Some studies have found a significant relationship between prolonged surgical procedures with the patient in the lithotomy position and a circulatory complication known as [[compartment syndrome]],&lt;ref name="pmid10893585"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anema JG, Morey AF, McAninch JW, Mario LA, Wessells H |title=Complications related to the high lithotomy position during urethral reconstruction |journal=Journal of Urology |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=360–3 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10893585 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5347(05)67360-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5347(05)67360-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11336771"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen SA, Hurt WG |title=Compartment syndrome associated with lithotomy position and intermittent compression stockings |journal=[[Obstet Gynecol]] |volume=97 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=832–3 |date=May 2001 |doi= 10.1016/S0029-7844(00)01141-8|pmid=11336771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nerve injury by pressure is also possible, the femoral or peroneal nerve are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Manski, D: Online textbook of urology http://www.urology-textbook.com/lithotomy-position.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use for childbirth==
A Cochrane Review found that the lithotomy position may not be the ideal position for child birth, noting that while it makes care easier for physicians by placing the patient in an easily accessible position, it is often harder on birthing mothers as use of the lithotomy position can narrow the birth canal by up to a third. In lieu of the lithotomy position, the Cochrane Review recommended birthing mothers make informed choices about birthing positions and find the position that is most comfortable for them.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/rhl/reviews/langs/CD002006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use for pelvic examinations==
Patients have reported feeling a loss of control and increased sense of vulnerability when examined in the lithotomy position because they cannot see the area being examined. Other, equally effective positions have been suggested for examinations of conscious patients.&lt;ref name="urlEditorials&amp;nbsp;— July 1, 2000 - American Family Physician"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000701/editorials.html |title=Editorials&amp;nbsp;— July 1, 2000 - American Family Physician |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16803941"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Seehusen DA, Johnson DR, Earwood JS, etal |title=Improving women's experience during speculum examinations at routine gynaecological visits: randomised clinical trial |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=333 |issue=7560 |pages=171 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16803941 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38888.588519.55 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16803941 |pmc=1513491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micah True''' (November 10, 1953&amp;nbsp;– March 27, 2012), born '''Michael Randall Hickman''' and also known as '''Caballo Blanco''' (white horse), was an American [[ultrarunning|ultrarunner]] from [[Boulder, Colorado]], who received attention because of his depiction as a central character in [[Christopher McDougall]]'s book ''[[Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen|Born to Run]]''.&lt;ref name="FirstPost"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/46121/body-runner-micah-true-caballo-blanco-found#ixzz1qnjUNip9 |title=Body of runner Micah True, 'Caballo Blanco', found |work=[[The First Post]] |location=London |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ecmj9C8?url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/46121/body-runner-micah-true-caballo-blanco-found |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzler"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Metzler|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; True's inclusion in the book garnered him some attention in ultrarunning circles, and some readers credited him as their inspiration for taking up the sport.&lt;ref name="Byars"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Byars|2012a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-01/micah-true-dead/53919320/1 |title=Renowned runner Micah True's body found |work=[[USA Today]] |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66efcbNZr?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-01/micah-true-dead/53919320/1 |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Christie|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="au"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/micah-true-a-super-athlete-3182951.html |title= Micah True, a super athlete |work=[[The Age]] |location= Melbourne |date=April 3, 2012 |format= Video |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bryan|2012a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 90s True spent several months per year trail running in [[Central America]]. In 2003 True decided to organize a race for the [[Tarahumara people]] in Mexico that would help them preserve their culture and running heritage. True died on March 27, 2012, during a run in the [[Gila Wilderness]], part of the [[Gila National Forest]] in southwestern New Mexico.

==Life==
Micah True was born ''Michael Randall Hickman'' in [[Oakland, California]], the son of a [[World War II]] Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Shapiro|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second of four children.&lt;ref name="LastRun"/&gt; He grew up traveling the country as his family relocated to various nationally located Marine Corps bases.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; His family was conservative [[Roman Catholic]], but True aligned himself with the counter-culture movement of the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;

True attended [[Humboldt State University]], where he studied [[Eastern religion]]s and [[Native American history]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; To earn money he began prizefighting in informal boxing bouts, using the name "Gypsy Cowboy," and perhaps taking the occasional dive for an easy payday.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;&lt;ref name=CM-B2R&gt;{{Harvtxt|McDougall|2009}} prizefighting in college pp.276-277.  returned to Colorado p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1974 and 1982, Hickman was a professional middleweight boxer, fighting under the name Mike "True" Hickman. His career record was 9 wins (KO 2), 11 losses (KO 9), and 0 draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |url= http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=28561&amp;cat=boxer |work=BoxRec |title= Mike Hickman |accessdate= April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point True spent 10 months living in a cave in [[Hawaii]] where he fell in love with a rich girl.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; It was when she left him, he said, that he took up long-distance running.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; He also changed his name from Michael Hickman to Micah True.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; (The name Micah comes from the [[Bible]], while True came from the name of a beloved pet: True Dog.)&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;

By 1982 True had moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where he began working as a self-employed furniture mover.&lt;ref name="LastRun"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bearak|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then he had become a "trailrunning bum" (like a "surfing bum or a climbing bum").&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; For almost 20 years, he spent winters running in Mexico, Guatemala, and Central America, averaging {{convert|170|mi|km}} per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brick|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Harvtxt|McDougall|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would return to Boulder during the summers to earn enough money to live on the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=CM-B2R/&gt; Among villagers he became known as "El Caballo Blanco" or "The White Horse" for his long blond hair and pale skin.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;

In 1993 True came in contact with the [[Tarahumara people|Tarahumara]] or Rarámuri runners from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua, Mexico]]. In 1994 he began spending his winters running in the [[Copper Canyon]]s, where he built a hut and began establishing a relationship with the Tarahumara natives.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;[[File:Copper Canyons marathon in Urique.jpg|thumb|Copper Canyons marathon in Urique|left]]

==Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon==
In 2003 True decided to organize a race for the Tarahumara natives that would help them preserve their culture and running heritage.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; The first Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon was held on March 23, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=True|first=Micah|title=Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon|url=http://coppercanyonultra.com/Historical.html|accessdate=21 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413231025/http://coppercanyonultra.com/Historical.html|archivedate=13 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though turnout was small, it became an annual tradition.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/foundation-formed-to-keep-alive-runner-micah-trues-ultra-marathon-in-copper-canyon/2012/04/09/gIQAtSje6S_story.html |title=Foundation formed to keep alive runner Micah True’s ultra-marathon in Copper Canyon |publisher=Washington Post |place=Albuquerque, New Mexico |date=April 9, 2012 |df= }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outside"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Castellanos"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Castellanos|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 True got the idea of having American ultrarunners to compete with the Tarahumara.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; After initially reaching out on the internet, he wrote an article in ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'', elucidating many of the lessons he internalized from the [[Tarahumara people]].&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{Harvtxt|McDougall|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/322859/20120402/caballo-blanco-micah-true-found-dead-gila.htm |author=Staff Reporter |work=[[International Business Times]] |title=Caballo Blanco Dead: Micah True Found Beside a Stream, Fans Respond to Death of a Legend |date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66efRZ1ZG?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/322859/20120402/caballo-blanco-micah-true-found-dead-gila.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contacted [[Christopher McDougall]], a writer for ''Men's Health'', who would later write the book ''[[Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen|Born to Run]]''.

The 2012 event took place on March 12 and was the largest ever with hundreds of participants. Most were local Tarahumara, known for their running endurance, both as a general means of travel and while participating in ceremonial, team-based, long distance running events, most famously the Rarajipari, or ball game. In addition to prize money for the top ten finishers, the event awards seed corn vouchers to all runners who complete the distance. The race has its start and finish in the town square of [[Urique]], Chihuahua, Mexico, covering an estimated {{convert|50|mi|km}} of single track trail and dirt road.&lt;ref name="Byars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Outside"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/blog/born-to-run-caballo-blanco-interview.html |work=[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]] |date=March 31, 2010 |title=Born to Run: Caballo Blanco Interview |format=Video |author=Outside Online |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66eeGgqtz?url=http://www.outsideonline.com/blog/born-to-run-caballo-blanco-interview.html |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/sports/ultrarunner-micah-true-found-dead-in-new-mexico.html |title=Missing Ultramarathoner Found Dead in New Mexico |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 2012 |agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |page=SP10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ed3AUyQ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/sports/ultrarunner-micah-true-found-dead-in-new-mexico.html?_r=1 |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Born to Run''==
[[File:Tarahumara.jpg|thumb|Tarahumara women selling baskets, blankets and oranges]]
In 2009 True was featured prominently in Christopher McDougall's best selling book ''[[Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen|Born to Run]]''.{{#tag:ref|The book was on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]] for more than four months, although book critic Dan Zak, writer of the Style section of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' thought it contained extraneous efforts to be "gonzo and overly clever".&lt;ref name=Zak&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061901078.html |last1= Zak |first1= Dan |title= Running, the Natural Way |work= Washington Post |date= June 21, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091027125057/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061901078.html |archivedate= October 27, 2009 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha|name=book}} &lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; The book told the story of the Copper Canyons ultra marathon and the Tarahumara, while promoting the [[endurance running hypothesis]], arguing that humans left the forests and moved to the savannas by developing the ability to run long distances in order to hunt prey by simply outlasting them in a long chase.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html |last1=Parker-Pope |first1=Tara |title=The Human Body is Built for Distance Well |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66enpKZwg?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html?_r=1 |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming a central character in a best selling book changed True's life significantly.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; Previously he had lived a quiet simple life, not seeing himself as the eccentric and amazing person in the book. He said he sometimes felt like he had to "live up to the expectations of the book" and told people that the book contained exaggerations and inaccuracies.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; Nevertheless, he became active on Facebook where he encouraged people to follow him. It was through Facebook that he met Maria Walton, who became his girlfriend for the last two years of his life.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt;

True also began using his celebrity status to help raise funds for the annual Copper Canyon race. He spoke at various events, beginning with a [[Saucony]] sponsored event in Utah, and then eventually traveling to Sweden, Denmark, and England.&lt;ref name=LastRun/&gt; According to Walton, True was never comfortable with his fame, only wanting to be known as someone who was genuine and real.&lt;ref name="Heil"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heil|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and race continuation==
On March 27, 2012, True failed to return after heading out for a run in the [[Gila Wilderness]], part of the [[Gila National Forest]] in southwestern New Mexico. He departed from the Wilderness Lodge in [[Gila, New Mexico|Gila]], saying he was going for a 12-mile (19&amp;nbsp;km) run. A subsequent [[mountain rescue]] effort involved three aircraft and at least nine [[search and rescue]] teams in off-road vehicles and on horseback, looking across {{convert|200,000|acre}} of high desert.&lt;ref name="Stainburn"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Stainburn|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Camera"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_20300894/body-ultrarunner-micah-true-58-found-new-mexico |title=Body of ultrarunner Micah True, 58, found in New Mexico wilderness |date=April 1, 2012 |work=[[Denver Post]] |agency=[[Camera (newspaper)|The Daily Camera]] |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66efwwliv?url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_20300894/body-ultrarunner-micah-true-58-found-new-mexico |archivedate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Searchers included ultra-runners such as [[Scott Jurek]], [[Kyle Skaggs]], [[Timothy Olson]], and many athletes and friends who had participated in the 51 mile Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon.&lt;ref name="VanHoven"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Van Hoven|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31 True was found dead with his legs dangling in a stream.&lt;ref name="Bryan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wulfhorst"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Wulfhorst|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local sheriff said there were "no obvious signs of trauma",&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Taylor|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although True had scrapes and abrasions on his hands, arms, and knees, suggesting a fall.&lt;ref name=Heil/&gt; His remains were removed by horseback. Because of difficult terrain and remote location, the recovery was not completed until April 1.&lt;ref name="Byars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stainburn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wulfhorst"/&gt; An [[autopsy]]&lt;ref name="Bryan"/&gt; was inconclusive with respect to the actual [[cause of death]], revealing, however, that True was suffering from idiopathic [[cardiomyopathy]], which had caused the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] of his heart to become enlarged. The autopsy report of the [[Coroner|Office of the Medical Investigator]] of New Mexico noted that "the decedent did not have a regular physician and no medical records, particularly [[electrocardiogram]]s or [[blood pressure]] readings were available for review" and "the best determination is that of unclassified cardiomyopathy which resulted in a [[cardiac dysrhythmia]] during exertion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bryan|2012c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Dr. James O'Keefe Jr., the director of Preventative Cardiology Fellowship Program and the Director of Preventative Cardiology at Cardiovascular Consultants at the Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, a large cardiology practice in Kansas City, looked at the pathology report and believes that Micah True's enlarged thickened heart with scar tissue is a pathology some extreme endurance athletes develop termed [[Pheidippides|Phidippides]] cardiomyopathy by Peter A. McCullough in research conducted with Justin E. Trivax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22222888 | doi=10.1002/clc.20994 | volume=35 | title=Phidippides cardiomyopathy: a review and case illustration. | date=Feb 2012 | journal=Clin Cardiol | pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe Jr., James (27 November 2012). "Run for your life! At a comfortable pace and not too far," TEDxUMKC. retrieved 1 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCullough and Trivax's hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.005|title = Potential Adverse Cardiovascular Effects From Excessive Endurance Exercise|last = O'Keefe|first = James|date = June 2012|journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings|doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.005|pmid = 22677079|access-date = March 12, 2015|pmc=3538475|volume=87|pages=587–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; "this pathology occurs because endurance sports call for a sustained increase in cardiac output for several hours" which puts the heart "into a state of volume overload. It has been shown that approximately one-third of marathon runners experience dilation of the right atrium and ventricle, have elevations of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, and in a smaller fraction later develop small patches of cardiac fibrosis that are the likely substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivax | first1 = Justin E. | last2 = McCullough | first2 = Peter A. | year = 2012 | title = Phidippides Cardiomyopathy: A Review and Case Illustration | url = | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 69–73 | doi = 10.1002/clc.20994 | pmid=22222888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTMN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/04/06/micah-trues-death-may-have-ripple-effect-for-raramuri-indians-106860 |title=Micah True's Death May Have Ripple Effect for Rarámuri Indians |author=ICTMN Staff |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |date=April 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66qJtm079?url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/04/06/micah-trues-death-may-have-ripple-effect-for-raramuri-indians-106860 |archivedate=April 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple memorial gathering was held at [[Colorado Chautauqua]] in Boulder on April 6, in which friends ran up [[Flagstaff Mountain, Boulder, Colorado|Flagstaff Mountain]] in Colorado and assembled on the Chautauqua park lawn to swap stories and remembrances of him.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Byars|2012b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to True's role in the organization and production of the [[Copper Canyon]] [[Ultramarathon]], after his death the continuation of the event was placed in doubt.&lt;ref name="Bryan"/&gt; Soon after True's death, the charitable foundation Norawas de Raramuri was formed again as part of an effort to keep the Copper Canyon race going.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt; It was decided the event would continue under the direction of Micah True's girlfriend Maria Walton and Fuego y Agua Events LLC. Director Josue Stephens. In honor of Micah, the race has since taken the name by which it has always been known in Mexico, [[Ultramaraton Caballo Blanco]].

A '''morgue''' or '''mortuary''' (in a [[hospital]] or elsewhere) is used for the storage of human [[corpse]]s awaiting identification or removal for [[autopsy]] or respectful  [[burial]], [[cremation]] or other method.  In modern times corpses have customarily been [[refrigerated]] to delay [[decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: A Field Manual for First Responders|last=Morgan|first=Oliver|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|year=2006|isbn=92 75 12630 5|location=|pages=49|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and lexicology==
''Mortuary'' early 14c., from Anglo-French mortuarie "gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner," from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius "pertaining to the dead," from Latin ''mortuus'', pp. of ''mori'' "to die" (see mortal (adj.)). Meaning "place where bodies are kept temporarily" first recorded 1865, a euphemism for earlier English term "deadhouse."

''Morgue'' from the [[French language|French]] ''morgue'', which means 'to look at solemnly, to defy'. First used to describe the inner wicket of a [[prison]], where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century [[Paris]], being used to describe part of the [[Grand Châtelet|Châtelet]] used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses.

''Morgue'' is predominantly used in [[North American English]], while ''mortuary'' is more common in [[British English]], although both terms are used interchangeably. The [[euphemism]]s “Rose Cottage” and “Rainbow’s End”&lt;ref&gt;BBC documentary - ''Fry's Planet Word: Episode 3: "Uses and Abuses"''  9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used in [[United Kingdom|British]] hospitals to enable discussion in front of patients, the latter mainly for children.

A person responsible for handling and washing bodies is now known as a [[diener]], morgue attendant, or [[autopsy]] technician.

==Types of cold chambers==

There are two types of mortuary cold chambers:
;Positive temperature
Bodies are kept between 2&amp;nbsp;°C (36&amp;nbsp;°F) and 4&amp;nbsp;°C (39&amp;nbsp;°F). While this is usually used for keeping bodies for up to several weeks, it does not prevent decomposition, which continues at a slower rate than at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;''Zentralblatt der allgemeine Pathologie''; 1957 May 4; 96(5-6):280-86; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13457004?log$=activity NIH.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Negative temperature
Bodies are kept at between &amp;minus;10&amp;nbsp;°C (14&amp;nbsp;°F) and &amp;minus;50&amp;nbsp;°C (&amp;minus;58&amp;nbsp;°F). Usually used at forensic institutes, particularly when a body has not been identified. At these temperatures the body is completely [[Freezing|frozen]] and [[decomposition]] is very much reduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Mortuaries across the globe==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
[[Image:A Scene in the New York Morgue.jpg|thumb|right|The first morgue in [[New York City]], opened in 1866 at [[Bellevue Hospital]]]]
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|right|An [[autopsy]] is performed in the morgue. This image was the [[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp|Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]]]

In some countries, the body of the deceased is [[embalmed]] before disposal, which makes refrigeration unnecessary.

In many countries, the family of the deceased must make the burial within 72 hours (three days) of death, but in some other countries it is usual that burial takes place some weeks or months after the death. This is why some corpses are kept as long as one or two years at a hospital or in a [[funeral home]]. When the family has enough money to organize the ceremony, the corpse is taken from the cold chamber for burial.

In some funeral homes, the morgue is in the same room, or directly adjacent to, the specially designed ovens, known as [[retort]]s, that are used in funerary [[cremation]]. Some religions dictate that, should a body be cremated, the family must witness its incineration. To honor these religious rites, many funeral homes install a viewing window, which allows the family to watch as the body is inserted into the retort. In this way, the family can honor their customs without entering the morgue.

Oversized mortuary fridge spaces have been installed in British hospitals to cope with the increase in obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London mortuaries install more fridges for obese bodies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-44337436 |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waiting mortuary=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect [[Waiting mortuary]] --&gt;
A '''waiting mortuary''' is a mortuary building designed specifically for the purpose of confirming that deceased persons are truly deceased. Prior to the advent of modern methods of verifying death, people feared that they would be buried alive. To alleviate such fears, the recently deceased were housed for a time in waiting mortuaries, where attendants would watch for signs of life. The corpses would be allowed to decompose partially prior to burial. Waiting mortuaries were most popular in 19th-century Germany, and were often large, ornate halls.

A bell was strung to the corpses to alert attendants of any motion. Although there is no documented case of a person being saved from accidental burial in this way,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |authorlink= Mary Roach|title=[[Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers]] |year=2003 |publisher= [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location= |isbn= 0-393-32482-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is sometimes erroneously believed that this was the origin of the phrase “saved by the bell”, whilst in fact, the phrase originates from the sport of [[boxing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/311000.html Saved by the bell at Phrases.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate meanings==

In [[American English]]:

*'''Morgue''' is used to refer to the room in which [[newspaper]] or [[magazine]] [[publisher]]s keep their back issues and other historical references, as they serve a similar purpose to human morgues. See [[Morgue file]].
*'''Morgue''' is used in some science fiction books as the name for the armory aboard ships, when they contain some form of powered armor. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*'''Mortuary''' can also refer to a [[funeral home]].

In 1970 there was a series of criminal prosecutions in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] against various members of the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/427/427.F2d.239.772.34604.html |title=427 F.2d 239 |publisher=Bulk.resource.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges ranged from criminal conspiracy to felony murder.  All indictments stemmed from the murder of 19-year-old Alex Rackley in the early hours of May 21, 1969.  The trials became a rallying-point for the [[American Left]], and marked a decline in public support, even among the black community, for the Black Panther Party.

==The crime==
On May 19, 1969, members of the [[Black Panther Party]] kidnapped fellow Panther [[Alex Rackley]], who had fallen under suspicion of informing for the FBI.  He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated for two days until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers.&lt;ref name=tape&gt;Paul Bass, [http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/rackley_trial_tape_surfaces/ Black Panther Torture “Trial” Tape Surfaces], New Haven Independent, Feb 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, national party chairman [[Bobby Seale]] visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of [[Yale University]] for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 | title = New York Magazine | author1 = New York Media | first1 = LLC | date = 1970-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive, though it was never proven that he went inside or knew about Rackley's treatment.

Early the next day, three Panthers - [[Warren Kimbro]], [[Lonnie McLucas]], and national Panther "Field Marshal" [[George Sams, Jr.]] - drove Rackley to the nearby town of [[Middlefield, Connecticut]].  Kimbro shot Rackley once in the head and McLucas shot him once in the chest.  They dumped his corpse in the [[Coginchaug River]], where it was discovered the next day.

Police raided the Panther headquarters, eventually arresting nine [[New Haven]] area Black Panthers (in addition to two juveniles).   McLucas and Sams were captured later.

Sams and Kimbro confessed to the murder, and agreed to testify against McLucas in exchange for a reduction in sentence.  Sams also implicated Seale in the killing, telling his interrogators that while visiting the Panther headquarters on the night of his speech, Seale had directly ordered him to murder Rackley.  In all, nine defendants were indicted on charges related to the case.  In the heated political rhetoric of the day, these defendants were referred to as the "New Haven Nine", a deliberate allusion to other ''cause-celebre'' defendants like the "[[Chicago Seven]]".

==Protest and unrest==
The first trial was that of Lonnie McLucas, the only person who physically took part in the killing who refused to plead guilty.  In fact, McLucas had confessed to shooting Rackley, but since some of the charges brought against him made him eligible for the [[death penalty]], a not-guilty plea was the only logical trial strategy.

Jury selection began in May 1970.  The case and trial were already a national ''cause célèbre'' among critics of the Nixon administration, and especially among those hostile to the actions of the [[FBI]].  Under the Bureau's then-secret "Counter-Intelligence Program" ([[COINTELPRO]]), FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had ordered his agents to disrupt, discredit, or otherwise neutralize radical groups like the Panthers.  Hostility between groups organizing political dissent and the Bureau was, by the time of the trials, at a fever pitch.  Hostility from the left was also directed at the two Panthers cooperating with the prosecutors.  Sams in particular, never widely popular in the movement, was accused of being an informant, and lying to implicate Seale to hide his own complicity with the FBI.

Beginning with the pretrial proceedings, tens of thousands of supporters of the Panthers arrived in New Haven individually and in organized groups.  They were housed and fed by community organizations and by sympathetic Yale students in their dormitory rooms. The Yale college dining halls provided basic meals for everyone.  Protesters met daily ''en masse'' on the [[New Haven Green]] across the street from the Courthouse (and one hundred yards from Yale's main gate) to hear protest speakers. Among the speakers were [[Jean Genet]], [[Benjamin Spock]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and [[John Froines]] (an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon).  Teach-ins and other events were also held in the colleges themselves.

Towards midnight on May 1, two bombs exploded in Yale's [[Ingalls Rink]], where a concert was being held in conjunction with the protests.&lt;ref name="BassRae"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bass |first1=Paul |last2=Rae |first2=Douglas |authorlink2=Douglas W. Rae |title=Murder in the Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale, and the Redemption of a Killer |publisher=Basic Books |year=2006 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rink was damaged, no one was injured, and no culprit was identified.&lt;ref name="BassRae"/&gt;

Yale chaplain [[William Sloane Coffin]] stated, "All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts," while Yale President [[Kingman Brewster Jr.]] issued the statement, "I personally want to say that I'm appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S."  Brewster's generally sympathetic tone enraged many of the university's older, more conservative alumni, heightening tensions within the school community.

As tensions mounted, Yale officials sought to avoid deeper unrest and to deflect the real possibility of riots or violent student demonstrations.  [[Sam Chauncey]] has been credited with winning tactical management on behalf of the administration to quell anxiety among law enforcement and New Haven's citizens, while [[Kurt Schmoke]], a future [[Rhodes Scholar]], mayor of [[Baltimore, MD]] and Dean of [[Howard University]] School of Law, has received kudos as undergraduate spokesman to the faculty during some of the protest's tensest moments. Ralph Dawson, a classmate of Schmoke's, figured prominently as moderator of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY).

In the end, compromises between the administration and the students quashed the possibility of violence. While Yale (and many other colleges) went "on strike" from May Day until the end of the term, like most schools it was not actually "shut down".   Classes were made "voluntarily optional" for the time and students were graded "Pass/Fail" for the work done up to then.

==Trials==

[[File:Sketch of four head representations, including Ericka Huggins, Warren Kimbro, Bobby G. Seale and George Sams Jr.jpg|thumb|Courtroom portraits including Huggins, Kimbro, Seale and Sams, 1970.]]
McLucas's trial set new records for the scale of judicial proceedings in Connecticut. It was the first in Connecticut to have [[metal detector]]s installed at the courtroom doors; jury selection took six weeks, a Connecticut record, and the jury deliberated for six days, another Connecticut record.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers2.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite impassioned accusations from protesters that McLucas was being railroaded into the electric chair by a "racist jury,"&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jonathan, "How do you try a revolutionary? A Black Panther trial in New Haven," ''Village Voice'', July 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; the jurors (ten white, two black) acquitted him on the most severe charges, convicting him instead on the sole charge of conspiracy to commit murder.  His defense attorney declared, "The judge was fair, the jury was fair, and, in this case, a black revolutionary was given a fair trial."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902777,00.html Justice In New Haven]," in ''Time'' Magazine, September 14, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  McLucas was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison.  His two collaborators in the murder, who had  pleaded to second degree murder, were released after four years.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/8-6-01/FTR-bobbyseale.HTML |title=Gadfly Online |publisher=Gadfly Online |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 1970, [[Bobby Seale]] went on trial alongside [[Ericka Huggins]], founder of the New Haven chapter.  This trial was an even larger undertaking, involving a full four months of jury selection.  Seale's attorney emphasized that it was only Sams' testimony that tied Seale to Rackley's murder. Huggins's voice was heard on a tape recording of the victim's interrogation, played for the jury. Her lawyer argued that Huggins had been acting under duress.&lt;ref name="tape"/&gt; The jury was unable to reach a verdict, deadlocked 11 to 1 for Seale's acquittal and 10 to 2 for Huggins' acquittal. On May 25, 1971 Judge Harold Mulvey stunned courtroom spectators by dismissing the charges against Huggins and Seale saying, "I find it impossible to believe that an unbiased jury could be selected without superhuman efforts -- efforts which this court, the state and these defendants should not be called upon either to make or to endure".&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, March 1, 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/01/nyregion/harold-m-mulvey-86-judge-at-tense-black-panther-trials.html Harold M. Mulvey, Judge at Tense Black Panther Party Trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Both the Panthers and the FBI suffered damage to their reputations, after the public exposure of their most unsavory activities.

In 1971, a group of left-wing radicals calling themselves the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burglarized an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], which was found to be spying on [[Swarthmore College]] students and faculty.  Among the materials stolen in this break-in were documents revealing the nature of the COINTELPRO program.  Within the year, Director [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]] declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO], retrieved July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Panthers, the Seale trial may have been the height of their national exposure and their popularity among the broader left-wing movement.  A string of violent confrontations with law-enforcement, along with the trials and convictions of national party leaders that followed, left the movement spent and adrift, and by the mid-1970s it was largely inactive.

The trial surfaced again in the news in 2000, when former first lady [[Hillary Clinton]] ran for U.S. Senate in the state of New York.  Anti-Clinton activists discovered that during the trials, Clinton (then a Yale law student named Hillary Rodham) volunteered  to monitor the trial for violations of civil rights, for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].   Widely circulated mass [[e-mails]] erroneously ascribed to Clinton responsibility for "getting the defendants off," and also blamed the future head of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] [[U.S. Justice Department]]'s [[Civil Rights Division]], [[Bill Lann Lee]], who was a Yale undergraduate at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/panthers.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Black Panthers and Hillary Clinton |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both were much too junior to have had any role in the actual legal defense, according to John Elvin of the conservative newsmagazine ''[[Insight on the News]]'', "Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, [[David Brock|[David] Brock]] and [[Roger Morris (American writer)|Roger Morris]] for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as [[Barbara Olson]]'s Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]'s contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/h/hillarypanthers.htm |title=Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder-Truth! |publisher=Truthorfiction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee apparently played no prominent role in any protests.&lt;ref name="hillary.html"&gt;[http://tafkac.org/ulz/hillary.html Urban Legend Zeitgeist: Hillary Clinton and the Black Panthers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Kelly Moye revealed that he was a police informant recruited to infiltrate the Panthers by Nick Pastore, head of New Haven Police's Intelligence Division. George Sams held a gun to Moye's head and demanded he turn over his car. Rackley was driven to his death in Moye's car. The police followed Moye's car as it left toward the murder destination but lost sight of the car prior to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/after_37_years_spy_comes_in_from_cold/ After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold, by Paul Bass, New Haven Independent, Aug 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The State Police discovered Rackley's body the next day. This epilogue was detailed in an article "After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold" by Paul Bass, author of Murder In The Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale and the Redemption of a Killer.

Detective [[Nick Pastore]], who arrested Seale and brought him to New Haven to stand trial, went on to become New Haven's Chief of Police, widely renowned for his successful policy of [[community policing]], and now heads a nonprofit advocacy group in [[Washington, DC]] named Criminal Justice Policy. Thirty one years later, when Seale returned to New Haven to speak at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]], Pastore decided to attend and even presented Seale with a pink [[Porcelain pigs|porcelain pig]] and a hug, congratulating him for continuing "the struggle".&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"/&gt;

[[Championship (dog)|Ch.]] '''Obo''' (1882–1895), was an [[American Cocker Spaniel]] who is considered to be the father of the modern breed, though physically, he was different from today's American Cocker.&lt;ref name="happyhealthy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palika|first=Liz|title=Cocker Spaniel: Your Happy Healthy Pet|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-39060-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVdraCvRVNcC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22obo+ii%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FNvyEoHTUO&amp;sig=oBp4Vjd-RpumIPbFjgjLBsL0cOI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wVk7TZLOJJCJhQfj84DICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22obo%20%22&amp;f=false|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his day, he was a successful [[conformation show|show]] dog, winner of many Best-in-Show titles.

==Background==
The Obo kennel of Spaniels were owned by James Farrow, who was breeding dogs from the 1870s onwards. Obo's sire and namesake, Obo, was whelped on June 14, 1879. F. E. Schofield, an authority on Spaniels, wrote, "Obo, it goes without saying, was the greatest force in the revival of the Cocker."&lt;ref name="lloyd16"&gt;[[#lloyd1939|Lloyd (1939)]]: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Obo was so well known for his victories in [[conformation show]]s that his owner, Farrow, spoke of an offer made from America, "The dog's stock did so well in America that one hundred guineas was offered by an American breeder for the use of this Spaniel for one season's stud service. The offer was refused."&lt;ref name="lloyd18"&gt;[[#lloyd1939|Lloyd (1939)]]: p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and career==
J. P. Willey of [[Rollinsford, New Hampshire#Salmon Falls Village|Salmon Falls]], [[New Hampshire]], was already a [[cocker spaniel]] breeder in America when he attempted to purchase Obo from Farrow in England. He was turned down, but managed to purchase Chloe II, a successful female Cocker Spaniel show dog and had her mated to Obo prior to her being shipped to the United States.&lt;ref name="mercer111"&gt;[[#mercer1890|Mercer (1890)]]: p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chloe II's litter came two males, Obo and Black Silk, and a female named Black Gem. Black Gem would die from [[Canine distemper|distemper]] after returning from winning the Produce Stake at a New York show.&lt;ref name="mercer111"/&gt;
Obo was shown for the first time at [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] in September 1883, where he placed first. He would go on to have further wins at [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[New York City]]. Obo II's trophy for Best Cocker Spaniel from the New Haven Kennel Club show in 1884 was gifted to the American Spaniel Club in 2004.&lt;ref name=ascoboii /&gt; Obo's [[American Kennel Club]] number was 4911.&lt;ref name="mercer121"&gt;[[#mercer1890|Mercer (1890)]]: p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

His puppies were also highly successful, winning puppy prizes at Lowell, first and second at New York and the top three puppy places at New Haven.&lt;ref name=ascoboii /&gt; Four of his best known offspring are Red Brucie, Sandspring Surmise, Midcliff Miracle Man and Limestone Laddie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Charlotte|title=The Cocker Spaniel|year=1997|publisher=Capstone Press|isbn=978-1-56065-540-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BN3aRpI4pVUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22obo+ii%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEo7TcK6MYGGhQeC-tWLCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22obo%20ii%22&amp;f=false|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Obo II was the sire of the first dark red Cocker Spaniel in America, Little Miss Rover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iby|first=Judith P.|title=The Cocker Spaniel|year=1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-87605-381-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_DdzZ3KfQMC&amp;q=%22obo+ii%22&amp;dq=%22obo+ii%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tFc7TfiLDc22hAejtbnxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgo|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Modern writers consider Obo to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel. He was different from the modern breed, being {{convert|10|in|cm}} tall with a long body.&lt;ref name="happyhealthy"/&gt;

Obo died on January 2, 1895, and was buried on the property of his owner in Salmon Falls village in Rollinsford.  Today, the grave is located behind the [[Rollinsford Grade School]] in the town of Rollinsford.  At the request of the American Spaniel Club, the grave site was registered with the Rollinsford Historical Society as a historical monument.&lt;ref name=ascoboii&gt;{{cite web|title=Obo|url=http://www.asc-cockerspaniel.org/index.php/history/articles-and-artifacts/194-obo-ii.html|publisher=American Spaniel Club|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Obo II Grave site.jpg|thumb|Grave marker of Obo II.]]. The gravestone is listed to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing resource to Rollinsford Grade School.  


Obo was the first American example of the Obo type which was recognisable on both sides of the Atlantic in many dogs with the prefix "Obo" or "Omo". H. S. Lloyd in the 1939 edition of ''The Popular Cocker Spaniel'' pointed out that compared to the Cocker Spaniel breed of the 1930s that the Obo type was low to the ground and a "trifle full in eye".&lt;ref name="lloyd18"/&gt;

'''Otto I''' (born 954, died 31 October or 1 November 982) was the [[Duke of Swabia]] from 973 and [[Duke of Bavaria]] from 976. He was a member of the [[Ottonian dynasty]], the only son of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf of Swabia]] and his wife Ida, and thus a grandson of the Emperor [[Otto I]] and his Anglo-Saxon wife [[Eadgyth]]. His sister [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen|Mathilde]] was the abbess of [[Essen Abbey]].{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}}

Otto was only three years old when his father died in 957. He was raised at the court of his grandfather, Otto I, who seems to have adopted him and raised him alongside his own son, the future Emperor [[Otto II]], born late in 955. The latter regarded him as both "nephew and brother" (''nepos ac frater'').{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} When the childless Duke [[Burchard III of Swabia]] died in 973, Otto II transferred the Swabian duchy to his nineteen-year-old nephew and brother, whose father had been Burchard's predecessor.{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} The elder Otto became a close confidante of his younger sovereign.

In 976 the imprisoned Duke [[Henry the Wrangler]] of Bavaria was formally dismissed from office for rebellion. In his place the emperor appointed Otto of Swabia, who became the first ruler of two duchies in medieval Germany.{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} The [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[March of the Nordgau]] were also taken from Henry, but were not bestowed on Otto, thus their history is separate from that of Bavaria from this point on.{{sfn|Duckett|1967|p=99}}{{sfn|Stälin|1886|p=725}} In 977, while the emperor was campaigning elsewhere, Otto helped crush the [[War of the Three Henries (977–978)|revolt of the Three Henries]]—the deposed duke of Bavaria, Bishop [[Henry I (bishop of Augsburg)|Henry I of Augsburg]] and Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]]—by successfully besieging the leaders in [[Passau]].{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} The army of Bavarians that was ambushed by [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia]] near [[Plzeň]] while on its way to join the emperor at this time may have been sent by Duke Otto.{{sfn|Duckett|1967|p=99}}{{sfn|Stälin|1886|p=725}}

In 980 Otto accompanied the emperor on his south Italian campaign, fighting both the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicilian Arabs]]. He survived the [[Battle of Stilo|defeat near Crotone]] on 13/14 July 982 and a subsequent ambush by an Arab force. Assigned to take the news of the campaign back to Germany, he died ''en route'', of wounds received in battle, either 31 October or 1 November, at [[Lucca]].{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} His father had also died south of the Alps. His family brought his body back and had it buried in the [[:de:St. Peter und Alexander (Aschaffenburg)|collegiate church of Saints Peter and Alexander]] at [[Aschaffenburg]], which Otto had generously endowed.{{sfn|Zotz|1998|pp=694–95}} His death is noted in the contemporary Abingdon version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'': "And then, as he went home, his [the emperor's] brother's son, who was called Otto, passed away; and he was the son of the [[aetheling]] Liudolf, and this Liudolf was son of Otto the Elder and King Edward's daughter".{{sfn|Swanton|1998|p=124|ps=.

'''Oxytocin Treatment for Postpartum Depression'''

[[Oxytocin|Oxytocin (OT)]] has potential to be a treatment for [[Postpartum depression|Postpartum Depression (PPD)]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Oxytocin is released when a mother cares for her child, making the interaction pleasurable&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Mothers that report high levels of infant-mother bonding and demonstrate responsive and sensitive parenting generally show increased levels of OT and brain reward center activation during play sessions&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. According to Slattery and Neumann, the oxytocin system of mothers experiencing PPD may have altered activity&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  These mothers have trouble bonding with their infants when they are born&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. An experiment found that mothers, who have low attachment ratings to adults and their infants, also have lower levels of OT when caring for their children&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is thought that women experiencing PPD may benefit from intranasal OT because this treatment would help the mother feel happier and assist her in bonding with the child &lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Another experiment shows that administering OT to a mother sheep increases the amount of care that she gives to offspring &lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Further experimentation needs to be done in order to determine the effectiveness of OT as a treatment for Postpartum Depression&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Intranasal Administration==
Intranasal (IN) administration, as opposed to more conventional routes, such as oral or intravenous infusion, offers an alternative method for drug delivery.  This method is often the preferred method&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  [[Oxytocin|Oxytocin (OT)]] is a neuropeptide that can be administered in this manner. IN delivery methods are gaining popularity due to the non-invasive nature of the method.  IN generally does not require complicated sterile preparations, is relatively painless, and often can be administered quickly by a medical doctor, or in some cases the patient.  IN maximizes the convenience and comfort of the patient, making a treatment regimen more likely to be followed&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  During [[Postpartum depression|Postpartum Depression (PPD)]], some women may be less likely to seek treatment if treatment is inconvenient.  In addition, new mothers (especially if suffering with depression) may feel socially isolated or overwhelmed by responsibilities of caring for a new infant.  IN not only provides a convenient delivery method, but is also a logical choice based on efficacy.  Tissue in nasal cavities is highly vascular, providing a large surface area for absorption.  Large surface areas allow for quick drug onset, meaning greater potential for the drug to reach the central nervous system without undergoing [[first-pass metabolism]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Avoiding first-pass metabolism allows more of the drug to be available for treatment.  Gastrointestinal discomfort and digestive side-effects can also be avoided by IN dosage&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  IN delivery allows OT to cross the [[blood brain barrier]], expediting the drug to the central nervous system&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and cerebrospinal fluid.  The blood-brain-barrier normally protects the brain by blocking certain chemicals and toxins from reaching the brain.  Increased levels of OT can be found in salivary samples after intranasal administration of the neuropeptide.  Salivary OT levels can remain higher than baseline levels four hours after dosage, suggesting that OT is still producing an active response&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  This may be an effective way of monitoring levels of OT levels during short-term treatment or help identify women at risk of or have a history of PPD.  Though OT can be administrered intravenously (and is sometimes the appropriate method depending on the medical situation), IN administration offers many advantages that make it an ideal choice for short-term treatment.

==Side Effects==
A review of 38 randomized and controlled trials suggests that short-term use of intranasal oxytocin appears to have few side-effects, with no difference when compared to a placebo group.  Short-term use of intranasal [[Oxytocin|oxytocin (OT)]] appears to be equally safe in vulnerable individuals as well as those deemed healthy.  Three adverse incidents have been reported; two were thought to be caused by actual misuse of the nasal spray and one was linked with a more lengthy treatment regimen.  The most frequently reported subjective sensation was calmness; however, there were no detectable differences between groups of OT use and placebo&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Given that [[Postpartum depression|Postpartum Depression (PPD)]] is not a chronic illness in nature, short-term intranasal OT treatment may be a logical application to alleviate some of the negative consequences associated with PPD.  Effects of OT that may be beneficial are reduced levels of anxiety, increased trust levels and increased eye gaze&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;, all which could be beneficial side-effects for women suffering from PPD.  Duration of treatment seems to be a key factor in safety.  Allergic reactions, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular conditions should always be considered, but especially so if treatment is long-term.  OT can modify heart rates and cause excessive fluid intake (antidiuretic effect).  Intravenous infusion (IV) of oxytocin is often used to induce labor and enhance milk lactation during postpartum care.  IV use can cause side-effects such as cardiovascular manifestations in the form of [[tachycardia]] and [[bradycardia]].  In addition, nausea, vomiting, and headaches can occur with IV application.  Less frequently, water intoxication, skin rash, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Experimentation==
Intranasal oxytocin (OT) has been used to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with [[Postpartum depression|Postpartum Depression (PPD)]].  Research by McErlean and Dadds suggests that intranasal OT, when combined with behavioral interventions, can remediate some of the mother-infant disturbances associated with PPD.  This was the first study to evaluate both the individual effects of OT and the combined effects of OT in conjunction with maternal coaching.  The study consisted of seventy-seven mothers (with sub-clinical levels of PPD) with infants ranging from eight to thirty weeks.  In addition to the mother-baby interaction coaching, randomly selected mothers were treated with either 24IU OT or a placebo nasal spray over a period of two sessions; measurements were taken over a course of three time periods.  Both questionnaire data and observational data, such as eye contact, positive vocalizations, and interaction quality, were used for evaluation purposes.  There were significant interactions between the therapy and the OT in regard to maternal behavior.  OT also seemed to benefit those mothers who were not involved with the therapy when compared to those that received the placebo nasal spray&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  OT has also been linked with lowering the human stress response&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Lowering a stress response in women that are suffering from PPD may be beneficial to the infant-mother bond.  Studies have shown that breast-feeding causes levels of plasma OT to increase in women.  Experiments designed and performed in the 1980s helped researchers understand the correlation between breastfeeding prior to a stressful event and the decreased stress response observed during the peripartum period.  As part of this experiment, lactating women were asked to either breastfeed their infant or hold their infant for a fifteen-minute period approximately thirty minutes before being subjected to a [[Trier social stress test|Trier Stress Test (TSST)]].  During the TSST, women were asked to give an unprepared speech and calculate mental arithmetic in front of an audience.  Results indicate that the women that breastfed their infant exhibited less stress during the TSST in comparison to the women that just held their infant&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Rising OT levels during breastfeeding may contribute to the lower stress situation.

'''Pharasmanes II the Valiant''' or '''the Brave''' ({{lang-ka|ფარსმან II ქველი}}) was a king of [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]] ([[Kartli]]) from the [[Pharnavazid dynasty]], contemporary of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]] (r. 117–138). Professor [[Cyril Toumanoff]] suggests AD 116–132 as the years of Pharasmanes’ reign. He features in several [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] accounts.

==Life==

The medieval Georgian annals report Pharasmanes' joint rule with Pharasmanes Avaz, [[diarchy|diarchs]] (one source has the extra pair: Rok and Mihrdat), but several modern scholars consider the Iberian diarchy unlikely as it is not corroborated by the contemporary evidence. Pharasmanes is reported to have been the son of his predecessor, King [[Amazasp I of Iberia|Amazasp I]]. He is said to have married [[Ghadana of Armenia|Ghadana]], daughter of King [[Vologases III of Parthia]] who ruled in [[Armenia]]. According to the medieval ''Life of Kings'', the traditional friendship of the two dyarchs soured at the instigation of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] wife of Mihrdat. Toumanoff regards this information a back-projection of the historically recorded enmity of [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]] and his brother [[Mithridates of Armenia]].&lt;ref name="traditio"&gt;Toumanoff, Cyril. Chronology of the Early Kings of Iberia. ''Traditio'' 25 (1969), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle then continues a story of an Armenian-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] alliance and their invasion of the [[Parthian Empire|Iranian]]-backed Iberia in which Pharasmanes finds his death.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', pp. 289-290. Peeters Publishers, {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[File:Armazi Bilingual.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pharasmanes II is mentioned on [[Armazi stele of Serapit]].]]

The ''[[Georgian royal annals]]'' describe Pharasmanes in the following way:
{{cquote|ფარსმან ქუელი იყო კაცი კეთილი და უხუად მომნიჭებელი და შემნდობელი, ასაკითა შუენიერი, ტანითა დიდი და ძლიერი, მჴნე მჴედარი და შემმართებელი ბრძოლისა, უშიში ვითარცა უჴორცო და ყოვლითავე უმჯობესი ყოველთა მეფეთა ქართლისათა, რომელნი გარდაცვალებულ იყვნეს უწინარეს მისსა.&lt;br/&gt;Pharasmanes the Valiant was a man of kindness and abundance and compassion, beautiful of his age, of big and strong body, courageous horseman and inspirational warrior, fearless as fleshless and all the greater with everything of all the kings of [[Kartli]], who were dead before him.&lt;ref&gt;Georgian royal annals, p. e. 51, l. e. 2-3-4-5-6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The contemporary Classical authors, with more solid historical background, focus on Pharasmanes’ uneasy relations with Rome. He refused in 129 to come and pay homage to the emperor [[Hadrian]].

According to the Aelius Spartianus, one of the authors of [[Augustan History]]:
{{cquote|And when some of the kings came to him, he treated them in such a way that those who had refused to come regretted it. He took this course especially on account of Pharasmanes, who had haughtily scorned his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;The Historians of Ancient Rome: An Anthology of the Major Writings, Ronald Mellor, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aelius Spartianus, The Life of Hadrian, XIII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pharasmanes then went touring the East, and prompted the [[Alans]] to attack the neighboring Roman provinces by giving them a passage through his realm, even though the emperor had sent him greater gifts including a [[war elephant]], than to any other king of the East. In his pique, Hadrian dressed some 300 criminals in the gold-embroidered cloaks which were part of the return gift of Pharasmanes, and sent them into the arena.

According to Spartianus:
{{cquote|He showed a multitude of favours to many kings, but from a number he even purchased peace, and by some he was treated with scorn; to many he gave huge gifts, but none greater than to the king of the Iberians, for to him he gave an elephant and a band of fifty men, in addition to magnificent presents. And having himself received huge gifts from Pharasmanes, including some cloaks embroidered with gold, he sent into the arena three hundred condemned criminals dressed in gold-embroidered cloaks as an insult to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Aelius Spartianus, The Life of Hadrian, XVII&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:King Pharasmanes on Fasti Ostienses.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]'' which mentions King Pharasmanes' visit to Rome.]]
Eventually, the ancient sources report a highly honored visit paid by Pharasmanes to Hadrian’s successor [[Antoninus Pius]]. According to [[Cassius Dio]], he came to Rome as guest of [[Antoninus Pius]], together with his wife, son, and noble retinue where he was especially honored, being allowed to sacrifice in the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] and to have his equestrian statue in the [[Temple of Bellona (Rome)|temple of Bellona]], and also the emperor increased the territory of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Kavtaradze, Giorgi Leon (June 2000). "[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/komblema/orte.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:28:18 Caucasica II: The Georgian Chronicles and the Raison d'Ètre of the Iberian Kingdom]", ''Orbis Terrarum'': p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; This Pharasmanes, however, might have been [[Pharasmanes III of Iberia|Pharasmanes III]], Pharasmanes II’s possible grandson.&lt;ref name="traditio"/&gt;  This visit was recorded on a fragment of the [[Fasti Ostienses]].&lt;ref&gt;Vidman, Ladislav (1982) ''Fasti Ostienses: edendos, illustrandos, restituendos, curavit Ladislavs Vidman''. p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Georgian royal annals]]'' King Pharasmanes was poisoned by the [[chef]] sent by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].
{{cquote|მაშინ სპარსთა გება-ყვეს სიმარჯუე ესე, რამეთუ მოიყვანეს მზარეული ერთი, და აღუთქუეს მას კეთილი დიდი, და რქუეს ესრეთ, ვითარმედ: "წარვედ და შემწყნარე ფარსმან ქუელსა, და წარიტანე შენ თანა წამალი სასიკუდინე, და შეუზავე საჭმელსა თანა მისსა და შეაჭამე". ხოლო წარვიდა მზარეული იგი და ყო ეგრეთ, ვითარცა უთხრეს სპარსთა მათ. და ესრეთ მოკლა ფარსმან მეფე ქუელი.&lt;br&gt;And then the Persians tried to have some adroitness, and they brought one chef, and promised him great bestowal, and they told him: "Go and serve Pharasmanes the Valiant, and carry with yourself a medicine of death, and mix it with his meal and make him eat it". And a chef went and did so, as the Persians told him to. And that's how he killed Pharasmanes, the valiant king.&lt;ref&gt;Georgian royal annals, p.e. 53, l.e. 3-4-5-6-7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Pickles''' (born 1962 or 1963; died 1967) was a black and white [[collie]] dog, known for his role in finding the stolen [[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]] in March 1966, four months before the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was scheduled to kick off in [[England]].

==Trophy theft==
{{main article|Theft of the Jules Rimet Trophy}}
The World Cup trophy was stolen on the afternoon of Sunday 20 March 1966.  It had been on public display in a glass cabinet during the "Sport with Stamps" [[Stanley Gibbons]] [[Stampex]] [[Philatelic exhibition|rare stamp exhibition]] at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Methodist Central Hall]] in Westminster.  The thief evaded the round-the-clock security, and ignored rare stamps with a value of £3 million to steal the [[silver-gilt]] trophy, which was generally thought to be worth far less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/20/newsid_2861000/2861545.stm 1966: Football's World Cup stolen]. BBC, On This Day&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone call from a man who called himself "Jackson" to [[Joe Mears]], chairman of [[Chelsea F.C.]] and [[The Football Association]], alerted him that a package would be left at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] the following day: it contained a £15,000 ransom demand, accompanied by the removable lining from the top of the trophy.  The package was turned over to the police, who arranged to meet "Jackson".  However, when they arrested the man who had mailed the package, whose real name was Edward Betchley, he claimed that he was a middleman, and the real culprit, a man he called "The Pole", was never identified.  Betchley was eventually convicted for demanding money with menace, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. If indeed there were other persons involved in the theft, no one else has ever been found. &lt;ref&gt;[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History Of Football'' Reed International Books Limited. 1996. p.133 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery==
The rest of the trophy was found on Sunday 27 March, just seven days after it was stolen, wrapped in newspaper lying by the front wheel of a neighbor's car in [[Beulah Hill]], [[Upper Norwood]], South [[London]], by the four-year-old Pickles, while taking a walk with his owner, David Corbett, who worked as a Thames lighterman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alastair | last=Reid | title=The World Cup | date=10 September 1966 | publisher= | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1966/09/10/1966_09_10_152_TNY_CARDS_000286584?currentPage=3 | work =The New Yorker | page =3 | accessdate =2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/23/newsstory.sport1 A twist in the tale], The Observer, 23 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspicion of involvement in the theft was attached briefly to David Corbett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world's strangest mysteries|year=1987|publisher=Gallery Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8317-9678-2|page=545|chapter=The Canine Sherlock Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[England national football team|England]] won the trophy, as a reward, Pickles was invited to the celebration banquet.

Corbett collected nearly £5,000 as a reward.&lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to nearly £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5000|1966}} }} in today's pounds&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35872662|title=How Pickles the dog found the World Cup trophy - 50 years on|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the money to buy a house in [[Lingfield, Surrey]], in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Owner-looks-life-dog-World-Cup/story-28623899-detail/story.html I'd love a Pickles statue on Wembley Way', says owner of dog which found World Cup in Croydon], Croydon Advertiser, 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Pickles was awarded the silver medal of the [[Dogs Trust|National Canine Defence League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/30-second-news-three-stories/ Pickles, the World Cup dog, gets his reward], British Pathé, 7 April 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The Football Association had a replica of the cup made in base metal, for publicity use, so the gold original could be kept safe.  The original cup was awarded permanently to Brazil after the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], but it was stolen from the headquarters of [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in December 1983 and never recovered.  The replica was bought by FIFA at auction in 1987 for £254,000, and it is held by the [[National Football Museum]] in [[Manchester]].

==Later life==
Pickles starred with [[Eric Sykes]] and [[June Whitfield]] in the 1966 film ''[[The Spy with a Cold Nose]]''.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;  He also appeared on several television programmes, including ''[[Blue Peter]]'' and ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]''.  He was also named "Dog of the Year", and awarded a year of free food by pet food manufacturer [[Spillers]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Pickles died in 1967 when he was strangled by his [[choke chain]] lead that caught on a tree branch while he was eating cheddar cheese near his new home in Surrey.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Fleckney | title=How Pickles the dog dug up the accursed World Cup | date=10 June 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/790191.How_Pickles_the_dog_dug_up_the_accursed_World_Cup/ | work =This Is Local London | accessdate =2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;
He was buried in his owner's back garden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/pickles/corbett/234 Tribute to Pickles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403044424/http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/pet-tribute/pickles/corbett/234 |date=3 April 2016 }}, Lost &amp; Fond&lt;/ref&gt; and his collar is on display in the [[National Football Museum]] in [[Manchester]].

An entirely fictional version of the story was told in a 2006 [[ITV Network|ITV]] drama written by [[Michael Chaplin (writer/producer)|Michael Chaplin]], called ''Pickles: The Dog Who Won The World Cup''. He was voiced by [[Harry Enfield]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814261/ Pickles: The Dog Who Won the World Cup (2006) (TV)], IMDB&lt;/ref&gt;

A plaque was put up in September 2018, near the spot where Pickles found the World Cup Trophy on Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood.

The steamship '''''Bannockburn''''' was a Canadian registered steel-hulled freighter which disappeared on [[Lake Superior]] in snowy weather on November 21, 1902.&lt;ref name=BEE2&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, sunk, 25 Nov 1902 | newspaper=[[Buffalo News|Buffalo Evening News]] |pages= |date=November 28, 1902 |url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/56750/data?n=2 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was sighted by the captain of a passing vessel, the SS ''Algonquin'', around noon of that day but minutes later disappeared.  The wreck of the ship has never been found, with the exception of an oar and a life preserver, and no bodies were ever recovered.  Within a year of her disappearance she acquired a reputation as a [[ghost ship]] and became known as '''The [[Flying Dutchman]] of the Great Lakes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marmuseum.ca/MillsUpdateSept04.html |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410114735/http://www.marmuseum.ca/MillsUpdateSept04.html |title=Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Kingston| archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOO"&gt;{{cite book|first=John Robert |last=Colombo |title=Mysteries of Ontario |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YGFLAQ-Cu6sC&amp;pg=PA186 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |year=1999 |publisher=Dundurn |isbn=978-0-88882-205-5|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |title=Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes |last=Boyer |first=Dwight |edition=1st |year=1968 |publisher=Freshwater |location=Cleveland, Ohio |isbn= 978-0912514475 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the ship prior to sinking==
The ''Bannockburn'' had technically sunk once before, on the morning of October 15, 1897: under Captain John Irving, laden with grain and destined for Kingston, Ontario from Chicago, Illinois, she had struck the wing wall of Lock No. 17 of [[Welland Canal]] and sprung a leak sending her to the bottom of the shallow canal where she took on nine feet of water before coming to rest. However, no lives were lost and she was raised afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title=Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, leak, sunk, 15 Oct 1897 | newspaper=[[Buffalo News|Buffalo Evening News]] | pages=| language=| publisher=| date=October 15, 1897 | url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/55867/data?n=1 | accessdate =October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had also been badly damaged several months prior when she ran on the rocks near Snake Island Light on the morning of April 27 while at full speed—however, after dumping 30,000 bushels of grain cargo she was able to float&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| coauthors=| title=Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, sunk, 27 Apr 1897 | newspaper=Milwaukee Evening |location=Wisconsin | pages=| language=| publisher=| date=April 21, 1897 | url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/58916/data?n=3 | accessdate =October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again no lives were lost though her forefoot and frame were badly stove in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| coauthors=| title=Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, sunk, 27 Apr 1897 | newspaper=[[Buffalo News|Buffalo Evening News]] | pages=| publisher=| date=May 1, 1897 | url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/58916/data?n=3 | accessdate =October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology of disappearance==
The final voyage of the ''Bannockburn'' began at the Canadian lakehead near what is now known as [[Thunder Bay]], under Captain George R. Wood. She was [[downbound]] carrying 85,000 bushels of wheat,  leaving the city of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] on November 20 and headed for [[Georgian Bay]].  She suffered a slight grounding but no apparent damage on her way out to the open lake, and her departure was delayed one day.  She recommenced her journey on the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Annual report |author=Canada. Dept. of Marine |year=1903 |page=129 |publisher=Ottawa, Printer to the King |place=Ottawa, Canada

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometime that day, Captain James McMaugh of the [[downbound|upbound]] ''Algonquin'', another lake freighter, reported viewing her through binoculars about {{convert|7|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast of him, about {{convert|80|mi|abbr=on}} off [[Keweenaw Peninsula|Keweenaw Point]] and {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} off [[Isle Royale]].  He was well-acquainted with her profile and he stated that he viewed her "several times" over the course of a few minutes to note her progress, which was very nearly on course. At a certain moment, however, he attempted to spot her and was surprised that he was unable to do so.  He blamed this sudden disappearance on the somewhat foggy weather, and dismissed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bannockburn Probably Lost |first= |last= |url= http://www3.gendisasters.com/michigan/15801/lake-superior-mi-unknown-location-steamer-bannockburn-lost-nov-1902 |newspaper=Daily News Record| location=Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan |date= November 29, 1902|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A powerful winter storm raked Lake Superior that night.  At 11:00 pm the nightwatch pilothouse crew of the passenger steamer ''Huronic'', also upbound on the lake, reported seeing lights on a ship they passed in the storm which they believed were in the pattern of those of the ''Bannockburn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Off watch: today and yesterday on the Great Lakes |last=Young |first=Anna G. |year=1957 |page=94 |publisher=Ryerson |place=Toronto |isbn= |oclc=3612374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no signals of distress were observed, and the two ships passed each other without incident.

The ''Bannockburn'' was reported overdue the following morning at the [[Soo Locks]], but given the weather the previous night, this was not considered unusual.  When she still did not report several days later, however, the fear that she had been lost began to grow.

On November 25 the steamer ''John D. Rockefeller'' passed through a field of floating debris near [[Stannard Rock Light]] which might have been that of the ''Bannockburn'',&lt;ref name=BEE1&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| coauthors=| title =Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, sunk, 25 Nov 1902 | newspaper=[[Buffalo News|Buffalo Evening News]] | pages=| language=| publisher=| date=November 30, 1902 | url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/56750/data?n=2 | accessdate =October 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though at this time the ''Bannockburn'' had not yet been reported lost and the crew of the ''Rockefeller'' did not know what might have caused the debris field. By November 30, the ship and crew were officially given up as "lost".&lt;ref name=BEE1/&gt;

By November 26, under pressure from the increasingly distressed families of the crew, a Mr. L.L. Henderson, a manager of the Montreal Transportation Company, claimed he had received a wire from the Chicago office of the underwriter's association which was providing insurance coverage for the ship.  He told a local newspaper, ''The Fort Williams Times Journal'', that the message read: "The steamer Bannockburn Has been located on the north shore of Lake Superior opposite [[Michipicoten Island]].  Crew safe."&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}  He later admitted he had no positive information as to her whereabouts but had based his hopeful assertion on news he had heard from the ''Germanic'', another freighter, that she had been seen safely anchored there.

Eventually the underwriters came to the conclusion that the ''Bannockburn'' had stranded on [[Caribou Island]].  This island is surrounded by a dangerous reef, and its lighthouse had been intentionally turned off on November 15.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;{{rp|p.22}}  If the captain of the ''Bannockburn'' had been hoping to spot its warning light in the darkness of the storm on the 21st, the only evidence he would have had of his closing proximity would have been the shock of the hull striking the reef itself.

On Friday, December 12, the Captain of the Grand Marais Lifesaving Station found a cork life preserver from the ''Bannockburn'' washed up on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Bannockburn (Propeller), C102093, sunk, 25 Nov 1902 | newspaper=Port Huron Daily Times | pages =   | language =   | publisher =   | date = December 13, 1902  | url = http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/56750/data?n=2  | accessdate =October 30, 2011 |oclc=12267844}}&lt;/ref&gt; This item is the only known wreckage from the ship ever to have been recovered.

Captain Wood, from Port Dalhousie, Ontario, was the oldest person aboard the vessel, at age 37.  Most of the crew were between the ages of 17 and 20.  His first mate, Alex Graham, was also from Port Dalhousie, Ontario.  One of the ship's two [[Helmsman|wheelsmen]], Arthur Callaghan, was only 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Shipwrecks, monsters, and mysteries of the Great Lakes |last=Butts |first=Ed |year=2010 |pages=34–35 |publisher= Tundra Books of Northern New York |place=Plattsburgh, New York |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AQffnhGHgGEC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22bannockburn%22+ship+dutchman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I9uvTsvpL6TUiAKT3-we&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bannockburn%22%20ship%20dutchman&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |isbn=978-1-77049-206-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the ship was considered to be of recent manufacture (at nine years old it was still thought of as almost new) the overall inexperience of her crew might have been a factor in her being lost.  Such young crews, however, were common on the Great Lakes at the turn of the 20th century because they were inexpensive to hire and shipping firms had strong financial incentives and no legislative reason not to take advantage of this whenever they might, even in Canada.

There are many theories as to what went wrong. Captain McMaugh proposed that the ship might have experienced a boiler explosion&lt;ref name=BEE2/&gt; though he did not hear one and no charred wreckage typical of such an explosion was later found anywhere along the route that the ''Bannockburn'' was known to have taken.  Alternatively, the at-that-time uncharted danger of the [[Superior Shoal]] might also have been the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

When the Soo locks were drained at the end of that season, a hull plate from a ship was found in the lock. It was supposed to have belonged to the ''Bannockburn'', and without it her hull would have had an unknown weak point.

The only known memorial to the ''Bannockburn'' is a stone tablet in a church in Port Dalhousie, Ontario. It is in memory of her captain, and was purchased by his brother.&lt;ref name=MOO/&gt;

'''SS ''Jane Miller''''' was a [[Cargo Ship]] that sank with the loss of 28 lives near [[Wiarton, Ontario]] on [[Georgian Bay]] on November 25, 1881. Her wreck was discovered in 2017 resting upright in over {{convert|100|ft|m}} of water.

== History ==
The ''Jane Miller'' was built in 1879 for James Miller &amp; Sons, and was used as a small freighter along the [[Bruce Peninsula]] and [[North Channel (Ontario)|North Channel]] of Georgian Bay. In September 1879 she collided with the schooner ''Mountaineer'' at night on Owen Sound, badly damaging the schooner. It was sold to Andrew Port in June 1880 to be used in general freight service along the south shore of Georgian Bay, the east side of the Bruce Peninsula, and [[Manitoulin Island]].&lt;ref name=ghost&gt;Boyer, Dwight ''Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.238}}&lt;ref name=mhgl&gt;[http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/59542/data Jane Miller (Propeller), sunk, 23 Nov 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sinking ==

On the afternoon of November 25, 1881, the ''Jane Miller'' departed [[Owen Sound]] with a load of cargo. She arrived in [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]], where thirty additional tons of cargo was loaded, much of which was stored on deck. The ''Jane Miller'' departed Meaford in the late afternoon headed for Spencer's Wharf near Wiarton as a blizzard began to blow with winds from the southwest. The strong winds and rough seas required a stop en route at Big Bay for additional cordwood for fuel. Departing Big Bay between 8 and 9 PM, eyewitnesses saw the ''Jane Miller'' pass White Cloud Island and enter Colpoys Bay. As she approached Spencer's Wharf, the blizzard intensified for a few minutes, and when the snow abated the ''Jane Miller'' had vanished without a trace.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;{{rp|p.240-243}}&lt;ref name=mhgl/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The ''Jane Miller'' had little to no permanent [[ballast]] on board, instead relying on the weight of her fuel and cargo in her hold to keep her properly trimmed. It was speculated that the blizzard had resulted in the ''Jane Miller'' consuming more of her fuel than expected, and that combined with the extra cargo loaded at Meaford, had become top heavy. When the snowstorm increased in intensity in Colpoys Bay, a strong gust of wind flipped her on her side, and she sank in minutes.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;{{rp|p.244}}

On December 4th three men started rowing from near Spencer's wharf towards White Cloud Island to see if they could find any indication of the missing ship. Half a mile northeast of Spencer's wharf they discovered a patch of discoloured water with air bubbles rising to the surface. Bearings from certain objects on the shore were made, and the position was later determined to be very close to the last observed location of the ''Jane Miller''. Continuing on to White Cloud Island they found in a bay several items, including "oars, some pins of the lifeboat, a piece of a mast, and a steamers gang plank".&lt;ref name=mhgl/&gt;. The tugboat ''Tommy Wright'' dragged the area hoping to find the wreck, but was unsuccessful as soundings revealed depths greater than 33 fathoms (198 feet or 60.35 metres) in the area. &lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;{{rp|p.244}}

A historical plaque was erected near Spencer's Wharf to commemorate the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Grey25.html|title=Loss of the "Jane Miller" Historical Plaque|website=www.ontarioplaques.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were an additional ten passengers whose names were not recorded, bound for Lion Head or Tobermory to work as labourers over the winter.

== Shipwreck ==
The wreck of the ''Jane Miller'' was discovered on July 27, 2017 by a shipwreck hunting team made up of Jared Daniel, Jerry Eliason and Ken Merryman operating with a permit issued by the [[Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport]]. The discovery was announced on November 25, 2017, the 136th anniversary of the sinking. The wreck is upright, in over 100 ft of water. The pilothouse, smokestack, and upper deck cabins have collapsed, but the hull is mostly intact, and the mast and three lifeboat davits are still in place. The permit did not allow for the divers to enter, but Daniel reported seeing sixteen corpses inside the hull. Merryman admitted that he was unsure if they had seen any human remains, since the wreck is heavily encrusted with zebra mussels, making identification of any such remains very difficult. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gowan |first1=Rob |title=136-year-old shipwreck found in Georgian Bay -- and bodies may be on board |url=https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/136-year-old-shipwreck-found-in-georgian-bay-and-bodies-may-be-on-board |website=Toronto Sun |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent investigation of the wreck by divers from the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and [[Canadian Forces]] did not find any human remains. Despite this, the wreck of the ''Jane Miller'' has been designated a protected archaeological site under the Ontario Heritage Act, and Merryman has not released the exact position and depth of the wreck, in order to further protect the site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gowan |first1=Rob |title=Police investigation doesn't find human remains on Jane Miller |url=https://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/news/local-news/police-investigation-doesnt-find-human-remains-on-jane-miller |website=Owen Sound Sun Times |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex strike''', sometimes called a '''sex boycott''', is a [[Strike action|strike]], a method of [[non-violent resistance]] in which one or multiple persons (usually [[women]]) refrain from [[Human sexual behavior|sex]] with their partners to achieve certain goals. It is a form of temporary [[sexual abstinence]].

Sex strikes have been used to protest many issues, from [[war]] to [[Gang#Gang violence|gang violence]].

== Historical ==
[[File:Lysistrate (Marble Stele).jpg|thumb|Marble stele of [[Lysistrate]]]]

=== Ancient Greece ===
The most famous example of a sex strike in the arts is the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Aristophanes]]' work ''[[Lysistrata]]'', an [[anti-war]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=27673724 Lucy Burns, sex-strikes through the ages.]&lt;/ref&gt; The female characters in the play, led by the eponymous Lysistrata, withhold sex from their husbands as part of their strategy to secure peace and end the [[Peloponnesian War]].

=== Nigeria ===
Among the [[Igbo people]] of Nigeria, in pre-colonial times, the community of women periodically formed themselves into a Council, a kind of women's trade union. This was headed by the Agba Ekwe, 'the favoured one of the goddess Idemili and her earthly manifestation'. She carried her staff of authority and had the final word in public gatherings and assemblies. Central among her tasks was to ensure men's good behaviour, punishing male attempts at harassment or abuse. What men most feared was the Council's power of strike action. According to Ifi Amadiume, an Igbo anthropologist: "The strongest weapon the Council had and used against the men was the right to order mass strikes and demonstrations by all women. When ordered to strike, women refused to perform their expected duties and roles, including all domestic, sexual and maternal services. They would leave the town ''en masse'', carrying only suckling babies. If angry enough, they were known to attack any men they met."&lt;ref&gt;Amadiume, I. 1987. ''Male Daughters, Female Husbands. Gender and sex in an African society.'' London and New Jersey: Zed Books, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World history and prehistory ===
Citing similar examples of women's strike action in [[hunter-gatherer]] and other precolonial traditions around the world, some [[anthropologist]]s argue that it was thanks to solidarity of this kind—especially collective resistance to the possibility of [[rape]]—that language, culture, and religion became established in our species in the first instance. This controversial hypothesis is known as the "[[Female cosmetic coalitions|Female Cosmetic Coalitions]]", "Lysistrata",&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Power, 1990. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_lysistrata.pdf Lysistrata, the ritual logic of the sex strike.] University of East London (Anthropology) Occasional Papers.&lt;/ref&gt; or "sex strike"&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991.

=== Colombia ===
In October 1997, the chief of the [[Military of Colombia]], General Manuel Bonnet publicly called for a sex strike among the wives and girlfriends of the Colombian left-wing guerrillas, [[drug trafficker]]s, and paramilitaries as part of a strategy—along with diplomacy—to achieve a ceasefire. Also the [[mayor of Bogota]], [[Antanas Mockus]], declared the [[Bogota|capital]] a women-only zone for one night, suggesting men to stay at home to reflect on violence. The guerrillas ridiculed the initiatives, pointing at the fact that there were more than 2,000 women in their army. In the end the ceasefire was achieved, but lasted only a short time.

In September 2006 dozens of wives and girlfriends of gang members from [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Colombia]], started a sex strike called ''La huelga de las piernas cruzadas'' ("the strike of crossed legs") to curb [[gang violence]], in response to 480 deaths due to gang violence in the [[coffee]] region. According to spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer, the specific target of the strike was to force gang members to turn in their weapons in compliance with the law. According to them, many gang members were involved in violent crime for status and sexual attractiveness, and the strike sent the message that refusing to turn in the guns was not sexy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In June 2011, women organized in the so-called Crossed Legs Movement in the secluded town of [[Barbacoas, Nariño|Barbacoas]] in southwestern Colombia, started a sex strike to pressure the government to repair the road connecting Barbacoas and its neighboring towns and cities.&lt;ref name="GNAD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/colombian-women-use-sex-strike-pressure-government-repair-road-huelga-de-piernas-cruzadas-20|title=Colombian women use sex strike to pressure government to repair road (Huelga de piernas cruzadas), 2011|website=Global Nonviolent Action Database|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They declared that if the men of the town were not going to demand action, they would refuse to have sex with them.

'''Tilapia lake virus''', or '''TiLV''', is a virus infecting populations of [[tilapia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/2/e00431-16&lt;/ref&gt; The virus is responsible for decimation of some populations and was only discovered recently.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/a-new-fish-virus-shows-how-vulnerable-our-food-supplies-are/476847/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

A '''torture chamber''' is a room where [[torture]] is inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Torture%20chamber Torture chamber.

Wordnetweb.princeton.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval torture chamber was windowless and often built underground, was lit by a few candles and was specifically designed to induce "horror, dread and despair" to anyone but those possessing a strong mind and "nerves of steel".&lt;ref name="Ryley Scott"/&gt;

Historically, torture chambers were located in royal palaces, in castles of the nobility and even buildings belonging to the church. They featured secret trap-doors which could be activated to throw victims into dark [[dungeon]]s where they remained and eventually died. The skeletal remains of people who disappeared were strewn on the floor of the hidden dungeons. Other times the dungeons under the trap-doors included pits of water where the victim was thrown to drown after a lengthy torture session in the chamber above.&lt;ref name="Alger1889"/&gt;

In Peru, the torture chambers of the [[Inquisition]] were specifically constructed with thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them and no sound could be heard from the outside. Other more sophisticated designs used principles of [[acoustics]] to muffle the screams of the tortured and included walls which recessed and protruded  in such a fashion as to reflect the screams of the victims so that the sounds would not be carried to the exterior.

The mere presence of the torture chamber was used as a form of intimidation and coercion. The victims were first shown the chamber and if they confessed they would not be tortured inside it. Other times the torture chamber was used as the final destination in a series of prison cells where the victims would gradually be moved from one type of cell to another, under progressively worsening conditions of incarceration, and if they did not recant in the earlier stages they would finally reach the torture chamber. The final stage of actually going to the torture chamber itself, just prior to the initiation of torture, was euphemistically called the "Question".&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Tower of London and Traitors Gate. In the [[Middle ages]], torture was carried out in its chambers]]
Throughout history torture chambers have been used in a multiplicity of ways starting from [[Torture#Torture in the past|Roman]] times. Torture chamber use during the Middle Ages was frequent. Religious, social and political persecution led to the widespread use of torture during that time. Torture chambers were also used during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="Spanish"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/torquemada/index.html Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition:Chapter 3.

Another example of a torture chamber, not known by many, is "The Thieves Tower" in the [[Alsace, France|Alsace]] region of France. Once a tower used for torture, it is now a small museum displaying instruments used upon the prisoners to get them to confess crimes.&lt;ref name="alsace-route-des-vins.com"&gt;[http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 Overseas Military Portal website.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104181353/http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 |date=4 November 2006 }} quote:''The Thieves Tower wasn’t a hideout for medieval criminals, but a place where they would pay for their crimes.

In [[Venice]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] had its own torture chamber, which was deemed to be of such importance that renovations started in 1507 so that the chamber walls could be kept strong and secure: "''considerata la grandissima importantia de j cameroti di la Camera del tormento che siano forti e securi''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard John Goy|title=Building Renaissance Venice: patrons, architects and builders, c. 1430–1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCUkqUZOTc8C&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=30 August 2011|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11292-4|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashoka's Hell===
{{main article|Ashoka's Hell}}
According to the narrations of [[Ashokavadana]], King [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', who built a palatial torture chamber known as ''Ashoka's Hell''. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the writings of the Ashokavadana.

According to Ashokavadana, Ashoka asked Girika, who was the official executioner of his kingdom, to design an elaborate torture chamber disguised as a beautiful and "enticing" palace adorned with all kinds of decorations and full of amenities such as exclusive baths decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and many ornaments. It was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it.&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

According to legend, beneath the veneer of beauty deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal.&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274|quote=By Xuanzang's account, King Ashoka was at first a horrid man. He had custom-built torture chambers that he enclosed in high walls. There were furnaces of molten metal, ugly sharp instruments. Every criminal in the land was consigned to this compound, all who crossed its threshold had to die.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the accounts contained in the Ashokavadana, Girika, the architect of the chamber, was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims.&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62|quote=The executioner persuades Ashoka to build a prison in which the tortures imitate those suffered in Buddhist hell [...] In response the executioner wants to kill Ashoka-on the grounds that the king has promised that no one who has entered the prison will leave it alive-...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that King Ashoka himself was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162|quote=He apparently built a torture chamber that was so horrible that people said he had descended to Hell itself to pick up design ideas.

Ashoka made Girika promise that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt; In the ''Biographical Sutra of King Ashoka'' the palace is described by the sentence: 'King Ashoka constructed a hell'.&lt;ref name="Brazier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brazier|title=The New Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-zNSbmOjVIC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29518-9|page=59|quote=There is, for instance, the account in the Biographical Sutra of King Ashoka of how the king, like any good tyrant, had a secret police force and this was backed up by a singularly sinister torture chamber.

==== Methods of coercion ====

The process of being tied and led to the torture rack inside the torture chamber was a form of intimidation and was called ''territio realis'' as opposed to ''territio verbalis oder lexis'' which was the verbal threat of torture being made at the judgment hall. ''Territio realis'' as well as the actual torture session were called ''examen rigorosum''.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AosFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA688|year=1880|publisher=A.

In the book ''Crime and criminal justice in Europe and Canada'' it is mentioned that fear was a factor in the process of torture and that there was a form of torture known as ''La présentation de la question'' or simply the "Question",&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; where the prisoner was led to the torture chamber and was shown the implements of torture. While at the chamber, sentence to full torture was pronounced but, immediately after, the prisoner was taken back to the prison cell, without actually having been tortured.&lt;ref name="Criminal Justice"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hamilton Baker|author2=Louis A.

Press|isbn=978-0-88920-118-7|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture chamber was specifically designed to evoke fear in the victims.&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Ryley Scott|title=History of Torture Throughout the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tj7vbMmuvhYC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4063-9|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually built underground and only dimly lit. Inside the chamber waited the executioner, his face completely covered apart from two holes in the garment to enable him to peer through and wearing a black hood; his menacing appearance being described as "most diabolical" and "satanic".&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

When during the Question, the view of the chamber, the torture implements and the executioner did not cause the victim to confess, a full-scale torture session was planned. To prepare for torture, the victim was stripped naked with hands tied. The penultimate step to torture included a repetition of the questions asked earlier of the victims. If the victims still proclaimed their innocence, full torture was initiated.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

The most common instrument of torture was the ''[[strappado]]'',&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt; which was a simple rope and [[pulley]] system. With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the [[shoulder joint]]s. To increase the suffering caused by the strappado, weights were attached to the feet of the victim.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt;

Church doctrine protected human life so it was problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or was too weak to continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after a break to allow time for the victim to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

Because confession under torture was not acceptable, the victim had to sign a written confession after they had made their oral confession under torture. Typically, during confession, the inquisitors demanded that the prisoner  implicate as many people as possible and not only themselves. If the prisoner resisted signing, the inquisitors could always resume the torture by claiming that they had just halted the session, just for the signing, but did not really put an end to it.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

The method of construction of the torture chamber of the [[Palais des Papes|papal palace]] at [[Avignon]], used during the Inquisition, has been described as ingenious.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles William Heckethorn|title=The Secret Societies of All Ages &amp; Countries - Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr-8FypJ7ekC&amp;pg=PA179|date=November 2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-436-3|volume=1|pages=179–|quote=The next move of the prisoner was to the torture chamber. The torture chamber in the papal palace at Avignon was constructed with diabolical ingenuity. To cause the shrieks and groans of those tortured to remain confined within the hall, each wall projects and recedes in such a manner as to exhibit a face in a different direction to that of the wall on the opposite side, and in this way the solid mass of masonry of each wall is carried upwards, the result of which peculiar structure is that shrieks were thrown back from wall to wall, and thus never could reach the outside, nor disturb the pope, toying with his concubines in the adjoining palace.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of [[Acoustics]], specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured.&lt;ref name="Crétineau-Joly1863"/&gt; The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crétineau-Joly1863"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacques Crétineau-Joly|Jacques Augustin M.

There were secret staircases and hidden spaces which were used to overhear the discussions in the prison cells.

The torture chamber was the final destination in a progression of four cell types during incarceration at the Palace of the Inquisition. The palace contained the Judgement Hall, the offices of the employees, the private apartments of the [[Grand Inquisitor]] and the detention cells adjacent to the apartments.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The detention cell gradations started with the ''cells of mercy'' reserved mainly for rich transgressors who upon bequeathing all their property to the Inquisition were normally let go after a time of detention in the cells.

For more difficult prisoners the next cell stage was the ''cell of penitence''. These were situated in small round towers of about 3 metres (ten feet) in diameter. They were painted white and included rudimentary furniture such as a stool and a bed. Very little light was allowed in. If the prisoner did not cooperate, the next step in the detention process was the [[dungeon]]. The dungeon had walls 1.5 metres (five feet) thick, double doors and was in complete darkness. No conversation of any type was allowed in the dungeon.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The food allowance for prisoners was less than a penny a day including the profit of the warden while any human refuse was removed every four days.  After a stay in the dungeon, uncooperative prisoners were moved to their final destination: the torture chamber.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt;

====Literature====
*There is a torture chamber In [[George Orwell]]'s famous novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949), [[Room 101]].
*In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (serialised in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'' from September 23, 1909, to January 8, 1910), [[Erik_(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera)|Erik]] (the Phantom's) chamber of torture consisted of a hexagonal room lined with [[mirror]]s on each wall.  Temperatures vary inside the room, and soon, without food or water, people trapped in there begin having [[hallucination]]s.  There is an iron tree in there with a [[lasso]] under it with which one can commit [[suicide]], which is the only way out.
*Harold T. Wilkins' article in the September 1929 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', titled "Secrets of Ancient Torture Chambers", describes the [fictitious] shrinking torture chamber at the Tolfi castle in [[Sicily]]  as an example of an ancient torture chamber and proposes a mechanical model to account for the contracting action of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Shrinking chamber"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=September 1929|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=402–404|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Mudford]]'s most famous tale{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} is the short story "[[The Iron Shroud]]", a classic predicament story, describes the plight of a noble Italian hero who is confined in a continuously and imperceptibly contracting iron torture chamber at Tolfi castle. The chamber walls and ceiling are slowly contracting, day by day, through mechanical means, to the point of eventually crushing and enveloping the victim, thus metaphorically becoming his iron shroud. 
*Mulford's story provided Edgar Allan Poe with the idea of the shrinking cell in his short story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]" (1842).

====Opera====
*In ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' the torture chamber is introduced with its own music while there is a dramatic scene where Judith and Bluebeard make reference to the torture chamber and the red light of its interior that escapes through its open door. The torture chamber musical introduction possesses a circular form with the introduction repeating, in a shorter form, at the conclusion of the torture chamber scene. This is in contrast to the rest of the musical composition of the opera which is ''[[through-composed]]''.&lt;ref name="Carolina1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greensboro Carl S.

====Video games====
*The protagonist in [[Exidy]]'s [[light gun]] shooter ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986) is a torturer who advances through dungeon levels, maiming and killing helpless enemies. When it was [[Porting|ported]] from arcades to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the enemies were [[dehumanization|portrayed as]] undead monsters, risen by an evil force and threatening a village. Both versions sold poorly, due to their gratuitous [[graphic violence]], which was uncommon in [[Western world|Western]] mass media at the time.

=== Technology ===

*The [[McKinley Climatic Laboratory]] has been described as the world’s largest torture chamber for aircraft undergoing [[FAA]] or military certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/chamber.html|title=Torture Chamber|author=Regis, Ed|date=May 1, 2006|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|access-date=29 July 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101192115/http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/chamber.html|archive-date=1 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} Quote: "Because airplanes must fly in the real world, the Air Force built a fake one." and "The reason that didn’t happen is just one of the technological marvels of the McKinley Climatic Laboratory, the world’s largest torture chamber for aircraft in search of FAA or military certification."&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a high-tech torture chamber, complete with loops of heavy chain, bone-crushing presses, fiery furnaces and thick electrical cables that snake ominously across the floor. The good news is that all of these cruel devices are used solely on…aircraft components."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windeby I''' is the name given to the [[bog body]] found preserved in a [[peat bog]] near [[Windeby]], Northern [[Germany]], in 1952. Until recently, the body was also called the ''Windeby Girl'', since an [[archeologist]] believed it to be the body of a 14-year-old girl, because of its slight build. Prof. Heather Gill-Robinson, a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[pathologist]], used [[DNA]] testing to show the body was actually that of a sixteen-year-old boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gill-Robinson | first = Heather Catherine | authorlink = | title = The iron age bog bodies of the Archaeologisches Landesmuseum, Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, Germany | publisher = University of Manitoba | year = 2006 | location = Manitoba | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-494-12259-4 }} (Doctors thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; The body has been radiocarbon-dated to between 41 BCE and 118 CE. &lt;ref&gt;Gebühr (2002) p. 47; cited in the corresponding article on German Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The body was discovered by commercial peat cutters in 1952, and is now on display at The Landesmuseum at the [[Gottorp|Schloß Gottorf]] in [[Schleswig]], [[Germany]]. Unfortunately, by the time the body was noticed by the peat cutters, and before the peat-cutting machinery could be shut down, a hand, a foot, and a leg had been severed from the body. The body had been very well preserved by the peat, and despite this damage it is still an important archaeological discovery. Shortly after the discovery of Windeby I, another bog body (an adult male) was found nearby and dubbed [[Windeby II]].

==Description==
The body appears to have a half-[[Shaving|shaven]] head and a [[woollen]] [[blindfold]] tied across the eyes. Recent examinations have however established that the hair over the half of the scalp was not shaven, but had rather decomposed due to being exposed to oxygen a little longer than the rest of the body. The "blindfold" is in fact a woollen band, made using the [[sprang]] technique, that was probably used to tie back the boy’s shoulder-length hair and which had slipped down over his face after death. Evidence from the body suggests that the boy had been killed, possibly as a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] or a [[punishment]]. This idea is supported by the observation that the body was discovered beneath rocks and branches, which were presumably used to hold the body down.
