The '''Federal Constitution of the [[United Mexican States (1824–1864)|United Mexican States]] of 1824''' ({{lang-es|Constitución Federal de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1824}}) was enacted on October 4 of 1824, after the overthrow of the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] of [[Agustin de Iturbide]]. In the new constitution, the republic took the name of [[First Mexican Republic|United Mexican States]], and was defined as a representative [[federal republic]], with [[Catholicism]] as the [[Confessional state|official and unique religion]].&lt;ref name="const.1824"&gt;[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318225631/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/1824index.html |date=2012-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857]].

==Background==
The [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810–1824) severed control that [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] had exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of [[First Mexican Empire|Mexico]] was formed from much of the individual territory that had comprised [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="Manchaca_161"&gt;{{harvp|Manchaca|2001|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victorious rebels issued a provisional constitution, the [[Plan de Iguala]]. This plan reaffirmed many of the ideals of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and granted equal citizenship rights to all races.&lt;ref name="Manchaca_161"/&gt; In the early days of the country, there was much disagreement over whether Mexico should be a [[federal republic]] or a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref name=edmondson71&gt;{{harvp|Edmondson|2000|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution became the first monarch, [[Agustín I of Mexico|Agustin I]].

Discontent with Agustin's national government grew, Brigadier [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] initiated an insurrection.  Generals issued the [[Plan of Casa Mata]] on 1 February 1823. The plan won the support of the provinces because it included a provision granting local authority to the provincial deputations. The election of a new legislature constituted the plan’s principal demand, because provincial leaders considered the composition of the first congress to be flawed. Following the precedent of the Hispanic Cortes, Mexican political leaders considered the executive to be subservient to the legislature. Thus, a new congress, which did not possess the liabilities of the old, could restore confidence even if the executive remained in place. Mexican politicians, of course, expected the new body to keep the emperor in check. Agustin abdicated in March 1823.

The failure of Iturbide’s short-lived empire ensured that any future government would be republican. The reconvened Mexican Cortes appointed a [[triumvirate]] called the Supreme Executive Power which would alternate the presidency among its members on a monthly basis. But the question of how the nation was to be organized remained unresolved. The Mexican Cortes, following the Cádiz model, maintained that it was sovereign since it represented the nation. The provinces, however, believed that they possessed sovereignty, a portion of which they collectively ceded to form a national government. The Cortes insisted on writing the nation’s constitution, but the provinces maintained that it could only convene a new constituent congress based on the electoral regulations of the [[Constitution of Cádiz]]. Neither side was willing to cede.  In the months that followed, the provinces assumed control of their governments through their provincial deputations. Four provinces, [[Oaxaca]], [[Yucatán]], [[Guadalajara]], and [[Zacatecas]], converted themselves into states. To avoid civil war, the Cortes acquiesced and elected a new constituent congress. Elections for a second constituent assembly, based on a convocatoria issued 26 June 1821 by the Hispanic Cortes, were held throughout the nation in August and September.  The executive branch was not restructured, because both the provinces and the new constituent congress considered it subservient to the legislature.

== Second Constituent Congress ==

The new congress, which the provinces had insisted upon since March, finally met on 7 November 1823. The second Constituent Congress was quite different from the first. It represented the provinces more equitably, and some of its members possessed instructions to form only a [[Federal Republic of Central America|federal republic]]. Oaxaca, Yucatán, [[Jalisco]], and Zacatecas, which had become states, elected state congresses, rather than provincial deputations, as the convocatoria required. The Mexico City-based national elite, which had been struggling for power since 1808, and which had taken control in 1821, lost it two years later to the provincial elites. Although some members of the national elite were elected to the new constituent congress, they formed a distinct minority. Indeed, only thirty-five of the one hundred-forty-four deputies and alternates elected to the new legislature had served in the earlier Mexican Cortes.

The constituent congress, which convened on 7 November 1823, faced very different circumstances from its predecessor. Not only had the provinces declared their sovereignty, but they had also restricted the authority of their delegates. [[Valladolid, Michoacán]], for example, declared: "This province in the federation does not wish to relinquish the major portion of its liberty and other rights; it only grants [its deputies] the authority absolutely necessary to keep the portion it retains." Mérida, Yucatán, decreed that "the elected deputies are granted only the power (...) to constitute the nation in a government that is republican, representative and federal", and that: "The federal constitution that they form and agree with the other deputies of the Constituent Congress will not have the force of law in the nation until the majority of the federated states ratify it." [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas]], was even more explicit, asserting that "The deputies to the future congress cannot constitute the nation as they deem convenient, but only as a federal republic." Guadalajara insisted that the pueblos of Jalisco wanted only a popular, representative and republican form of government. Other provinces made similar declarations.

The new congress represented regional interests. Therefore, the debate in the legislature focused on the division of power between the national and the provincial governments, not on whether Mexico would be a federal or a central republic. The delegates were divided into a [[Confederalism|confederalist]], two [[Federalism|federalist]], and one centralist faction.  The confederalists, extreme defenders of local rights like [[Juan de Dios Cañedo]], argued that only the provinces possessed sovereignty, a portion of which they collectively ceded to the union to form a national government. This interpretation meant that the provinces, or states, as Oaxaca, Yucatán, Jalisco and Zacatecas now called themselves, could subsequently reclaim the power they had relinquished. They were opposed by federalists like [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] who believed that only the nation was sovereign. In their view, although the country was organised into provinces, or states, for political purposes, the people, not the states, possessed sovereignty. The deputies, therefore, did not represent the states, but the people who constituted the nation. As the representative of the Mexican people, Congress possessed greater power and authority than the state legislatures. In a sense, they were reasserting the position which had prevailed in Cádiz in 1812. Midway between these extremes stood men like the federalist [[Ramos Arizpe]], who believed that the national government and the states shared sovereignty. Although they favoured states’ rights, they nevertheless believed that the national government had to command sufficient power to function effectively. The confederalist/federalist factions were opposed by a tiny minority of centralists who argued that sovereignty was vested in the nation and that Mexico needed a strong national government.

== Drafting a constitution ==

A committee consisting of [[Ramos Arizpe]], Cañedo, [[Miguel Argüelles]], [[Rafael Mangino]], [[Tomás Vargas]], [[José de Jesús Huerta]], and [[Manuel Crescencio Rejón]], submitted an Acta Constitutiva (draft of a constitution) on 20 November. The group completed the draft of the charter in a few days. This was possible because the document was based on the shared Hispanic political theory and practice that Mexicans, the former novohispanos, knew well, since they had played a significant role in shaping it. In the years since Napoleon had invaded Spain in 1808, the political entities that formed the Mexican nation in 1821 had undergone a series of rapid political changes that politicised the majority of the population and led to a vibrant political discourse. The Hispanic Constitution of 1812 and its institutions of government were well known; moreover, seven proposals for a Mexican constitution had been debated throughout the country in the previous months.  The constituent congress, therefore, was filled with educated individuals with diverse ideas and extensive political experience at the local, state, national, and international levels. A few, like Ramos Arizpe and [[Guridi y Alcocer]], had served in the Cortes in Spain and had participated in the discussions of the Constitution of 1812. In addition, Ramos Arizpe had been working on a federal constitution for some time. [[Lorenzo de Zavala]] was president of the congress that approved the constitution.&lt;ref name="zavala"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Mexican United States, 1824|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/constit1824.htm|website=tamu.edu|publisher=Wallace L. McKeehan|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the constitution ==

The Acta Constitutiva submitted by the committee was modelled on the Hispanic Constitution of 1812. Most of its articles were based on the Peninsular document; a few were adopted verbatim from that charter. For example, on the question of sovereignty the Hispanic Constitution stated: "Sovereignty resides essentially in the nation and, therefore, it [the nation] possesses the exclusive right to adopt the form of government that seems most convenient for its conservation and prosperity". Article 3 of the Mexican Acta Constitutiva read: "Sovereignty resides radically and essentially in the nation and, therefore, it [the nation] possesses the exclusive right to adopt by means of its representatives the form of government and other fundamental laws that seem most convenient for its conservation and greater prosperity". Although the deputies relied on their first constitutional experience, the Constitution of 1812, they did not slavishly copy the Hispanic model. Guridi y Alcocer, for example, explained that ever since he had served on the constitutional commission in the Hispanic Cortes he had maintained that sovereignty resided radically in the nation, by which he meant that the nation, as the institutional representative of el Pueblo, could not lose its sovereignty. His principal critics were radical federalists like Juan de Dios Cañedo, deputy from Jalisco, who challenged the need for an article declaring national sovereignty. He asked: that the article be deleted because in a republican federal government each state is sovereign. (…) Therefore, it is impossible to conceive how sovereignty, which is the origin and source of authority and power, can be divided among the many states. [T]hat is why the first constitution of the United States [the Articles of Confederation] (…) does not mention national sovereignty. And, therefore, (…) Article 1 which discusses the nation should not be approved because it is not appropriate in the system we now have.

The Acta, unlike the Hispanic constitution, did not grant exclusive or even preponderant sovereignty to the nation, because the states also claimed sovereignty. Accordingly, Article 6 stated: "Its integral parts are independent, free, and sovereign States in that which exclusively concerns their administration and interior government". The issue of sovereignty remained at heart a question of the division of power between the national and the state governments. It was an issue that would be debated at length in the months to come.

== Struggle among confederalists, federalists, and centralists ==

The proponents of state sovereignty—the confederalists—were challenged by some less radical federalist delegates who argued that only the nation could be sovereign. Because these men stressed the need to endow the national government with sufficient power to sustain national interests, they are often mistakenly considered centralists.  [[Servando Teresa de Mier]], their outstanding spokesman, argued that people wrongly considered him a centralist, an error that arose from an unnecessarily restrictive definition of federalism. He indicated that federalism existed in many forms: the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]] were federations, yet each was different.
Mier advocated the establishment of a unique brand of federalism suited to Mexico. He believed that local realities precluded the adoption of the extreme form of federalism—confederalism—championed by states’ righters. He declared: "I have always been in favour of a federation, but a reasonable and moderate federation. (...) I have always believed in a medium between the lax federation of the United States, whose defects many writers have indicated, (…) and the dangerous concentration [of executive power] in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]]." In his view, Mexico needed a strong federal system because the country required an energetic and decisive national government to lead it during the crucial early years of nationhood, particularly since Spain refused to recognise Mexico’s independence and the [[Holy Alliance]] threatened to intervene. For these reasons, Mier voted in favour of Article 5, which established a federal republic, while opposing Article 6, which granted sovereignty to the states.

Neither the advocates of states' rights, like Cañedo, nor the proponents of national sovereignty, like Mier, triumphed. Instead, a compromise emerged: shared sovereignty, as advocated by moderate federalists such as Ramos Arizpe. Throughout the debates, he and others argued that although the nation was sovereign, the states should control their internal affairs. The group saw no conflict between Article 3, which declared that sovereignty resided in the nation, and Article 6, which granted sovereignty to the states on internal matters. The moderates were able to forge shifting coalitions to pass both articles. First, they brought Article 3 to a vote. A coalition of the proponents of national sovereignty, the advocates of shared sovereignty, and a few centralists passed the article by a wide margin. To secure passage of Article 6, those favouring approval succeeded in having the question brought to the floor in two parts. The first vote, on the section of Article 6 which indicated that the states were independent and free to manage their own affairs, passed by a wide margin, since the wording pleased all the confederalist/federalist groups, including the one led by Father Mier. Only seven centralist deputies opposed the measure. Then Congress examined the section of Article 6 which declared that the states were sovereign. The coalition divided on this issue: Father Mier and his supporters joined the centralists in voting against the measure. Nevertheless, the proponents of states' rights and those who believed in shared sovereignty possessed enough strength to pass the measure by a margin of 41 to 28 votes.

The states did not just share sovereignty with the national government; they obtained the financial means to enforce their authority. They gained considerable taxing power at the expense of the federal government, which lost approximately half the revenue formerly collected by the viceregal administration. To compensate for that loss, the states were to pay the national government a contingente assessed for each state according to its means. As a result, the nation would have to depend upon the goodwill of the states to finance or fulfil its responsibilities.

== Weak executive branch ==

The constituent congress’s decision to share sovereignty, moreover, did not settle the question of the division of power within the national government. Although all agreed on the traditional concept of [[separation of powers]] among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, most congressmen believed that the legislature should be dominant. Recent Hispanic and Mexican experience had fostered a distrust of executive power. Therefore, the earlier Mexican Cortes had established a plural executive, the [[Provisional Government of Mexico (1823–24)|Supreme Executive Power]]. Since that body was perceived as subservient to the legislature, neither the provinces nor the Second Constituent Congress bothered to appoint a new executive. The authors of the Acta Constitutiva, however, proposed in Article 16 that executive power be conferred "on an individual with the title of president of the Mexican Federation, who must be a citizen by birth of said federation and have attained at least thirty-five years of age".  The proposal led to a heated debate that transcended the former division between states’ righters and strong nationalist coalitions. While Cañedo supported Ramos Arizpe in favouring a single executive, others, including Rejón and Guridi y Alcocer, insisted on the need to weaken executive power by establishing a plural executive.

Ramos Arizpe proposed that the president govern with the aid of a council of government. But that was not sufficient to mollify the opposition, which had the majority in congress. The opponents of a single executive presented several counter-proposals. Demetrio Castillo of Oaxaca suggested that a president, a vice-president and an alternate, called designee, should govern. Each would have a vote, but the president would cast the deciding one. Rejón, instead, recommended that three individuals form the Supreme Executive Power; their terms would be staggered so that one member would always possess seniority, but no individual would serve more than three years. Guridi y Alcocer proposed that the executive power be conferred on two persons. He argued that the best solution was to merge the experiences of ancient Rome, Spain, and the United States. Therefore, he urged that the two members of the executive power be backed by two alternates, who might resolve any differences that arose between the two members of the executive.

Article 16 of the Acta Constitutiva  was put to a vote on 2 January 1824 at an extraordinary session. It was defeated by a vote of 42 to 25. As a result, the congress did not address Article 17, which dealt with the vice-president. The proposal to establish a president and a vice-president was one of the few instances in which the second [[constitution of the United States]] served as a model. The majority did not agree with the proposal because it feared the possibility of one individual dominating Congress through military or popular forces, as Iturbide had done. The commission on the constitution revised the articles on the executive a number of times, but could not obtain support for its proposals.

The fear of provincial disorder also influenced the debate. After Articles 5 and 6 of the Acta Constitutiva had been approved, several provinces decided to implement their right to form their own government. The national administration viewed their actions with concern, particularly because some movements were also anti-European Spaniards. The revolt of 12 December in Querétaro, for example, demanded the expulsion of gachupines (Spaniards who had come to Mexico) from the country.  A similar uprising occurred later in Cuernavaca. In both instances, the national government sent forces to restore order.

Then, on 23 December, Puebla declared itself a sovereign, free, and independent state. The authorities in [[Mexico City]] immediately concluded that the military commander of the province, General [[José Antonio de Echávarri]], was responsible for the "revolt". Therefore, the government dispatched an army under the command of Generals [[Manuel Gómez Pedraza]] and [[Vicente Guerrero]] to restore order. The forces of the national government approached the capital city of Puebla at the end of December 1823. After lengthy negotiations, General Gómez Pedraza proposed that, since Congress was about to issue the convocatoria for national and state elections, the leaders of Puebla renounce their earlier action and hold new elections. The Poblanos agreed. The convocatoria was received in Puebla on 12 January 1824. Elections were held throughout the province and a new state government was inaugurated on 22 March 1824.

Although the national government had maintained order in the nation, the revolt led by General [[Jose María Lobato]] on 20 January 1824 demonstrated that the plural executive could not act with the unity of purpose and the speed necessary to quell a large scale uprising in the capital. The rebels demanded the dismissal of Spaniards from government jobs and their expulsion from the country. Lobato managed to win support of the garrisons in the capital and the government seemed on the verge of capitulation when the Supreme Executive Power convinced Congress to declare Lobato an outlaw and to grant the executive sufficient power to quell the rebellion. 
 
As a result of the crisis, the majority in Congress eventually decided to establish an executive branch composed of a president and a vice-president.  The creation of a single executive, however, did not mean that Congress had accepted a strong presidency. Most Mexicans continued to favour legislative supremacy. The Mexican charter, like the Hispanic constitution, severely restricted the power of the chief executive. The Constitution of 1824 created a quasi-parliamentary system in which the ministers of state answered to the congress. Consequently, the minister of interior and foreign relations acted as a quasi-prime minister.

The creation of a national government did not end the tensions between the provinces and Mexico City. The debate over the location of the country's capital sparked a new conflict. The national elite favoured making the "Imperial City of Mexico" the capital of the republic. The regional elites were divided. During 1823, while discussing the importance of local control, they also emphasised the need to maintain a "centre of unity", that is, a capital. However, a significant number pointedly refused to bestow that honour upon Mexico City. The special committee on the nation's capital recommended to the Constituent Congress on 31 May 1824 that another city, [[Querétaro]], become the capital, and that the territory around it become the federal district. After a heated debate, Congress rejected the proposal to move the capital from Mexico City. Thereafter, the discussion centred on whether or not a federal district should be created. The ayuntamiento and the provincial deputation of Mexico were vehemently against such action. Indeed, the provincial legislature threatened secession and civil war if Mexico City were federalised. Nevertheless, on 30 October Congress voted fifty-two to thirty-one to make Mexico City the nation’s capital and to create a federal district.

== Constitution of 1824 ==

After months of debate, Congress ratified the constitution, on 4 October 1824. The new charter affirmed that:
 
Article 3: The religion of the Mexican nation is and will permanently be the Roman, [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], Apostolic [religion]. The nation protects her with wise and just laws and prohibits the exercise of any other [religion].

Article 4. The Mexican nation adopts for its government a representative, popular, federal republic.

Article 5. The parts of this federation are the following states and territories: the states of [[Chiapas]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila and Texas]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[State of Mexico|México]], [[Michoacán]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Puebla de los Ángeles]], [[Querétaro]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Sonora and Sinaloa]], [[Tabasco]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Veracruz]], [[Jalisco|Xalisco]], [[Yucatán]] and [[Zacatecas]]; and the territories of: [[Alta California]], [[Baja California Territory|Baja California]], [[Colima|Colima Territory]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Santa Fe de Nuevo México Territory]]. A constitutional law will determine the status of [[Tlaxcala Territory|Tlaxcala]].

Article 74. The supreme executive power of the federation is deposited in only one individual who shall be called President of the United States of Mexico (Estados Unidos Mexicanos).

Article 75. There will also be a vice president who, in case of the physical or moral incapacity of the president, will receive all his authority and prerogatives.

Like the Acta Constitutiva, the Constitution of 1824 was modelled on the Hispanic Constitution of 1812, not, as is often asserted, on the U.S. Constitution of 1787.  Although superficially similar to the second U. S. Charter, and although it adopted a few practical applications from the U.S. Constitution, such as the executive, the Mexican document was based primarily on Hispanic constitutional and legal precedents. For example, although the Constitution of 1824 created a president, in Mexico the office was subordinate to the legislature. Since the Mexican republic was essentially confederalist rather than federalist, the Mexican Charter was closer in spirit to the U.S.’s first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, than to the U.S. Constitution of 1787. Entire sections of the Cádiz Charter were repeated verbatim in the Mexican document because Mexicans did not reject their Hispanic heritage, and because some of the individuals who drafted the new republican constitution had served in the Cortes of Cádiz and had helped write the 1812 Charter. Both the Hispanic Constitution of 1812 and the Mexican Constitution of 1824 established powerful legislatures and weak executives. But it would be an error to consider the Constitution of 1824 a mere copy of the 1812 document. Events in Mexico, particularly the assertion of states’ rights by the former provinces, forced Congress to frame a constitution to meet the unique circumstances of the nation.

The principal innovations—republicanism, federalism, and a presidency—were adopted to address Mexico's new reality. The monarchy was abolished because both [[Fernando VII]] and Agustín I had failed as political leaders, not because Mexicans imitated the United States' charter. Federalism arose naturally from Mexico's earlier political experience. The provincial deputations created by the Constitution of Cádiz simply converted themselves into states. However, unlike the 1812 document, the Mexican charter gave the states significant taxing power.

Although modelled on the Hispanic Constitution of 1812, the new charter did not address a number of issues included in the earlier document because the new Mexican federation shared sovereignty between the national government and the states. Thus, unlike the Constitution of Cádiz, which defined citizenship, the Mexican Constitution of 1824 remained silent on the subject. Similarly, it didn't define who possessed the [[suffrage]], nor did it determine the size of the population required to establish ayuntamientos, two significant factors in determining the popular nature of the Hispanic constitutional system.  These decisions were the prerogatives of the states.

The constitutions of the states of the Mexican federation varied, but they generally followed the precedents of the Constitution of Cádiz. Most state constitutions explicitly defined the people in their territory as being citizens of the state; they were chiapanecos, sonorenses, chihuahuenses, duranguenses, guanajuatenses, etc. Some states, such as Mexico and Puebla, simply referred to "the natives and citizens of the estate". Following the Cádiz model, all states established indirect elections. A few, however, introduced property qualifications. Many also followed the constitution of 1812 in allowing ayuntamientos in towns with more than 1,000 persons, but some raised the population requirements to 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000. Tabasco only permitted the cabeceras of the partido (district head towns) to have ayuntamientos. Article 78 of Veracruz's constitution stated that the jefe of the department "will arrange the number and function of the ayuntamientos".

== Content ==
The 1824 Constitution was composed of 7 titles and 171 articles, and was based on the Constitution of Cadiz for American issues, on the United States Constitution for the formula for federal representation and organization, and on the '''Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of Mexican America''' of 1824, which abolished the monarchy. It introduced the system of federalism in a popular representative republic with [[Catholicism]] as official religion. The 1824 constitution does not expressly state the rights of citizens. The right to equality of citizens was restricted by the continuation of military and ecclesiastical courts. The most relevant articles were:&lt;ref name="const.1824"/&gt;

:1. The Mexican nation is sovereign and free from the Spanish government and any other nation.

Although this was not stipulated in the constitution, slavery was prohibited in the Republic. [[Miguel Hidalgo]] promulgated the abolition in [[Guadalajara (Jalisco)|Guadalajara]] on 6 December 1810. President [[Guadalupe Victoria]] declared slavery abolished too, but it was President [[Vicente Guerrero]] who made the decree of ''Abolition of Slavery'' on 15 September 1829.

{{cquote|
#Slavery is abolished in the Republic.
#Therefore are free those who until this day were considered as slaves.
#When circumstances of the treasury permit it, it will compensate slave owners in the terms that are held by law.}}

{{Main|Territorial evolution of Mexico}}
At the time of the promulgation of the Constitution, the nation was composed of 19 free states and 3 territories. That same year, two changes were made in the structure, resulting finally in 19 free states, 5 territories and the federal district.

* The five Federal Territories were: '''[[Alta California]]''', '''[[Baja California Territory|Baja California]]''', '''[[Colima Territory|Colima]]''', '''[[Tlaxcala Territory|Tlaxcala]]''', and '''[[Santa Fe de Nuevo México Territory|Santa Fe de Nuevo México]]'''.
* The Federal District was established around the [[Mexico City|City of México]] on November 18, 1824.

== Reactions ==
Due to the influence of Spanish liberal thought, the fragmentation that had been gradually consolidated by the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in [[New Spain]], the newly won [[Independence of Mexico]], the size of the territory—almost 4,600,000&amp;nbsp;km² (1,776,069 sq mi)—and lack of easy communication across distances, there resulted a federal system with regional characteristics. The central states&amp;mdash;[[State of Mexico|Mexico]], [[Puebla]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Michoacán]]&amp;mdash;which were the most populated, worked as an administrative decentralization. The states of the periphery&amp;mdash;[[Zacatecas]], [[Coahuila y Texas]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Jalisco]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Nuevo León]]&amp;mdash;acquired a moderate confederalism. The states furthest from the center&amp;mdash;[[Yucatán]], [[Sonora y Sinaloa]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[The Californias|Las Californias]]&amp;mdash;acquired a radical confederalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historia de Mexico Volumen 2| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=fqQDouIxVBwC&amp;pg=PT23&amp;lpg=PT23&amp;dq=confederalismo+moderado#v=onepage&amp;q=confederalismo%20moderado&amp;f=false| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the existence of established political parties, three political tendencies are distinguished. The first still supported the empire of Iturbide, but was a minority. The second was influenced by the [[York Rite|Yorkist Lodge]] of freemasonry, whose philosophy was radical [[Federalism]] and also encouraged an anti-Spanish sentiment largely promoted by the American plenipotentiary [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Manuel Gomez Pedraza (Cancilleres de Mexico)| url =http://www.sre.gob.mx/acervo/cancilleres_i-3.pdf| language =Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the third was influenced by the [[Scottish Rite|Scottish Lodge]] of freemasonry, which had been introduced to Mexico by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] themselves, favored [[Centralized government|Centralism]], and yearned for the recognition of the new nation by Spain and the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;{{harvp|Vázquez|2009|pp=534–535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the consummation of independence, the [[Patronato real|"Royal Patronage"]] was gone, the [[Government of Mexico|federal government]] and state governments now considered these rights to belong to [[Nation state|the State]]. The way to manage church property was the point that most polarized the opinions of the political class. Members of the Yorkist Lodge intended to use church property to clean up the finances, the members of the Scottish Lodge considered the alternative [[anathema]]. According to the federal commitment, states should provide an amount of money and men for the army, or ''blood quota''. The federal budget was insufficient to pay debt, defense, and surveillance of borders, and states resisted meeting the ''blood quota'', sometimes meeting that debt with criminals.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt;

Some state constitutions were more radical and took supplies to practice ''patronage'' locally, under the banner of "freedom and progress". The constitutions of [[Jalisco]] and [[Tamaulipas]] decreed government funding of religion, the constitutions of [[Durango]] and the [[State of Mexico]] allowed the governor the practice of ''patronage'', the constitution of [[Michoacán]] gave the local legislature the power to regulate the enforcement of fees and discipline of clergy, and the constitution of [[Yucatán]], in a vanguardist way, decreed [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vázquez|2009|p=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repeal and resettlement ==
In 1835, there was a drastic shift to the new Mexican Nation. The triumph of conservative forces in the elections unleashed a series of events that culminated on 23 October 1835, during the interim presidency of [[Miguel Barragán]] (the constitutional president was [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], but he was out of office), when the "Basis of Reorganization of the Mexican Nation" was approved, which ended the [[Federation|federal system]] and established a provisional [[Centralized government|centralist system]]. On 30 December 1836, interim president [[José Justo Corro]] issued the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Constitutional Laws]], which replaced the Constitution. Secondary laws were approved on 24 May 1837.

The Seven Constitutional Laws, among other things, replaced the "free states" with French-style "[[Department (subnational entity)|departments]]", centralizing national power in [[Mexico City]]. This created an era of political instability, unleashing conflicts between the central government and the former states. Rebellions arose in various places, the most important of which were:

* [[Mexican Texas|Texas]] declared its independence following the change from the federalist system, and refused to participate in the centralized system. American settlers held a convention in [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe de Austin]] and declared the people of Texas to be at war against Mexico's central government, therefore ignoring the authorities and laws. Thus arose the [[Republic of Texas]].
* [[Yucatán]] under its condition of ''Federated Republic'' declared its independence in 1840 (officially in 1841). The [[Republic of Yucatán]] finally rejoined the nation in 1848.
* The states of [[Nuevo León]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Coahuila]] became ''[[de facto]]'' independent from Mexico (in just under 250 days). The [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] never consolidated, because independence forces were defeated by the centralist forces.
* [[Tabasco]] decreed its separation from Mexico in February 1841, in protest against centralism, rejoining in December 1842.

The [[Texas annexation]] and the border conflict after the annexation led to the [[Mexican–American War]]. As a result, the Constitution of 1824 was restored by interim President [[José Mariano Salas]] on 22 August 1846. In 1847, ''The Reform Act'' was published, which officially incorporated, with some changes, the Federal Constitution of 1824, to operate while the next constitution was drafted. This federalist phase culminated in 1853.

The [[Plan of Ayutla]], which had a federalist orientation, was proclaimed on 1 March 1854. In 1855, [[Juan Álvarez]], interim President of the Republic, issued the call for the Constituent Congress, which began its work on 17 February 1856 to produce the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico|Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857]].

'''Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore''' (AVPAS) is a copy protection consortium with other anime producers founded by [[Odex]] on 30 July 2003. The association lists over 400 titles (as of 25 May 2007) and is supported by at least one governmental agency. AVPAS is not a governmental agency by itself. It aims to monitor and combat the unauthorized distribution of video related rights, in particular anime and Japanese-related Intellectual Property. The website technically is being maintained by NetroAsia. Its main committee members are Dr. Toh See Kiat (AVPAS president), Go Wei Ho Peter (AVPAS vice president and Odex director), Sing Xin Yang (AVPAS secretary and Odex director) and Yong Yet Yuen (AVPAS Secretary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avpas.com.sg/AVPAS_Member.html |title=AVPAS Members |publisher=AVPAS.com.sg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920220901/http://www.avpas.com.sg/AVPAS_Member.html |archivedate=2010-09-20 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avpas.com.sg/members.html "Members"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722185137/http://www.avpas.com.sg/members.html |date=22 July 2012 }}. AVPAS. Retrieved 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation, along with Odex, gained considerable prominence in mid-2007 due to [[Odex's actions against file sharing|Odex's legal actions against Internet users]] in Singapore, which were ultimately rejected by the Court in January 2008.

==Efforts in tackling video infringement in Singapore==
Up to date, the AVPAS has only been known to have created a website which features the Odex Clarification Article on their homepage, has pictures of bootlegged anime and Japanese video CDs and contains a list of authorised titles.

According to the "Odex Clarification Article" on the AVPAS website, the AVPAS has also been said to have authorised Odex to carry out demands of money from anime downloaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.avpas.com.sg |title=Odex Clarification Article |publisher=Odex, avpas.com.sg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008190228/http://www.avpas.com.sg/Index.html |archivedate=2007-10-08 |quote=Odex is authorised by the Anti-Video Piracy Association (Singapore) (AVPAS), a non-profit organisation whose members consist primarily of Japanese companies involved in the anime industry...|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the AVPAS has not publicly announced its authorisation and has not commented on whether this claim by Odex is true or false.{{when|date=November 2012}}

==Controversy==
The title "AVPAS" may mislead people into believing that AVPAS is a government organization or an organization registered with the Registry of Societies (ROS). The AVPAS is also not a commercial entity by itself (not registered with ACRA) but is registered by NETROASIA PTE LTD, the "technical admin" for ODEX.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Netizens virtually unanimously agree that they did not even know about the existence of AVPAS before the Odex Saga.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The domain name for the AVPAS website was registered in April 2007, three months before Odex started the saga in July to September 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

About its sudden prominence in mid-2007, which coincided with Odex's rise to notoriety among Netizens, there have been concerns raised regarding the legitimacy and purpose of AVPAS, especially since its main committee is dominated by the Odex directors.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, Chen (12 September 2007). [http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Online%2BStory/STIStory_157007.html "Whose interests is Avpas really serving?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309023853/http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_157007.html |date=9 March 2008 }}. ''[[Straits Times]]''. Retrieved 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The AVPAS website appears to have ceased from being updated since 31 August 2007, which is coincidentally the beginning of the period when the Odex Saga started to blow over in mainstream media.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Despite being self-dubbed the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore, the AVPAS does not seem to be interested in monitoring or combating the copyright violation of non-anime or non-Japanese films as the only titles listed or displayed on its website are either anime or Japanese video titles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} No publicly known action has been taken by the AVPAS against file sharers dabbling in non-anime and non-Japanese videos.

'''Blood quantum laws''' or '''Indian blood laws''' are those enacted in the United States and the former [[Thirteen colonies]] to define qualification by ancestry as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], sometimes in relation to tribal membership. These laws were developed by European Americans and thus did not necessarily reflect how Native Americans had traditionally identified themselves or members of their [[in-group]], and thus ignored the Native American practices of absorbing other peoples by adoption, beginning with other Native Americans, and extending to children and young adults of European and African ancestry. Blood quantum laws also ignored tribal cultural continuity after tribes had absorbed such adoptees and [[multiracial]] children. Tribal enrollments were often incomplete or inaccurate because individuals refused to enroll because they didn't trust the government, families relocated before censuses were taken, or individuals were incorrectly identified by white men, who were the census takers. 

A person's blood quantum (abbreviated as BQ) is defined as the percentage of their ancestors, out of their total ancestors, who are documented as full-blood Native Americans. For instance, a person who has one parent who is a full-blood Native American and one who has no Native ancestry has a blood quantum of 1/2. Since re-establishing self-government and asserting sovereignty, some tribes may use blood quantum as part of their requirements for membership or enrollment, often in combination with other criteria. For instance, the [[Omaha Nation]] requires a blood quantum of 1/4 Native American and descent from a registered ancestor for enrollment.

In 1705 the Colony of [[Virginia]] adopted laws that limited civil rights of Native Americans and persons of one-half or more Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html |title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2 |author=Professor Jack D. Forbes |accessdate=2009-08-07 |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of California|University of California-Davis]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610050121/http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of blood quantum was not widely applied by the United States government until the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934. At that time, the [[United States government|government]] required persons to have a certain blood quantum to be recognized as Native American and be eligible for financial and other benefits under treaties or sales of land.&lt;ref name="nar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=955032|ssrn=955032|title= A Legal History of Blood Quantum in Federal Indian Law to 1935 |author=Paul Spruhan |accessdate=2009-08-07 |year=2001 |publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, however, Native American nations have re-established their own governments, asserting sovereignty in setting their own rules for tribal membership, which vary among them. In some cases, individuals may qualify as tribal members, but not as American Indian for the purposes of certain federal benefits, which are still defined in relation to blood quantum. In the early 21st century, some tribes, such as the Cherokee and Wampanoag, tightened their membership rules and excluded persons who had previously been considered members. Challenges to such policies have been pursued by those excluded. Though individuals can self-identify as Native American, Native Americans are the only racial group in the United States that has to have proof of ancestry to receive government benefits.

==Origin of blood quantum law==
European Americans passed "Indian Blood law" or blood quantum law to regulate who would be classified as Native American. The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] uses the word “Indian” twice but never bothers to define it.&lt;ref name="unenrol"/&gt; The first such law was passed in 1705 in the Colony of Virginia, to define Native Americans and to restrict the civil rights of people who were half or more Native American.&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt; In the 19th and 20th centuries, the US government believed tribal members had to be defined, for the purposes of federal benefits or annuities paid under treaties resulting from land cessions.&lt;ref name="naaa" /&gt;

Many traditionalist Native Americans, known as “irreconcilables” or “blanket Indians,” were so suspicious of the government that they refused to enroll at all, making all their descendants unenrollable as well.&lt;ref name="unenrol"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/magazine/who-decides-who-counts-as-native-american.html|title=Who Decides Who Counts as Native American?|author=BROOKE JARVIS|accessdate=2018-10-07|year=2017|publisher=[[New York Times Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native American tribes did not use blood quantum law until the [[United States government|government]] introduced the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]]. Some tribes, such as the [[Navajo Nation]], did not adopt the type of written constitution suggested in that law until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="unm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlj.unm.edu/volumes/vol8/8TLJ1LSPRUHAN.pdf|title=THE ORIGINS, CURRENT STATUS, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF BLOOD QUANTUM AS THE DEFINITION OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE NAVAJO NATION|author=Paul Spruhan|accessdate=2009-08-15|year=2008|publisher=Tribal Law Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112191550/http://tlj.unm.edu/volumes/vol8/8TLJ1LSPRUHAN.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given intermarriage among tribes, particularly those that are closely related and have settled near each other, critics object to the federal requirement that individuals identify as belonging to only one tribe when defining blood quantum. They believe this reduces an individual's valid membership in more than one tribe, as well as costing some persons their qualification as Native American because of having ancestry from more than one tribe but not 1/4 or more from one tribe. Overall, the numbers of registered members of many Native American tribes have been reduced because of tribal laws that define and limit the definition of acceptable blood quantum.

"The U.S. census decennial enumerations indicate a Native American population growth for the United States that has been nearly continuous since 1900 (except for an [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza epidemic]] in 1918 that caused serious losses), to 1.42 million by 1980 and to over 1.9 million by 1990."&lt;ref name="naaa"/&gt; In the 2000 census, there were 2.5 million American Indians. Since 1960, people may self-identify their ancestry on the US Census.&lt;ref name="naaa"/&gt; Indian activism and a rising interest in Native American history appear to have resulted in more individuals identifying as having Native American ancestry on the census.

For decades, individual tribes had established their own requirements for membership. In some cases, they have excluded members who had long been part of the tribe. Common tribal membership requirements required documented lineal descent from a Native American member listed on a prior [http://primeau.org/StandingRock1885families.html tribal rations-issue roll], or the [[Dawes Rolls]] for the '[[Five Civilized Tribes]]' in Oklahoma, or a late 19th-century [[census]]; in some cases they may also require a certain percentage of Native American ancestry, and demonstrated residence with a tribe or commitment to the community. Unlike the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act, many tribes allow members to claim ancestry in more than one tribe. For instance, the [[Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians]] accept persons of 1/4 North American Indian ancestry, plus documented descent from an ancestor listed in specific records. In part, this recognizes that the Odawa people historically had a territory on both sides of what is now the border between the US and Canada.

Each federally recognized tribe has established its own criteria for membership.&lt;ref name="naaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5355&amp;page=103|title=Tribal Membership Requirements and the Demography of "Old" and "New" Native Americans|author=Russell Thornton|accessdate=2009-09-02 |year=2008 |publisher=[[The National Academic Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the new revenues that many tribes are realizing from gambling casinos and other economic development, or from settlement of 19th-century [[land claims]], some have established more restrictive rules to limit membership.

In 2007 the [[Cherokee Nation]] voted in the majority to exclude as members those [[Cherokee Freedmen]] who had no documented ancestors on the Cherokee-by-blood list of the [[Dawes Rolls]]. However, the Cherokee Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that they were legitimate members of the tribe at that time. After the Civil War, the US required the Cherokee and other Native American tribes that had supported the Confederacy to make new treaties. They also required them to emancipate their slaves, and to give full tribal membership to those freedmen who wanted to stay in tribal territory. The Cherokee Freedmen often had intermarried and some had Cherokee ancestry at the time of the Dawes Rolls, qualifying as Cherokee by blood, but registrars typically classified them as Freedmen; registration was often inaccurate. Many individuals also refused to enroll or become documented because they didn't trust the government.&lt;ref name="unenrol"/&gt; 

Similarly, in 2000, the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] attempted to exclude two bands of Seminole Freedmen from membership to avoid including them in settlement of land claims in Florida, where Seminole Freedmen had also owned land taken by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ben. [http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/home/content/44590087.html "Dems ask DoJ to probe treatment of Indian freedmen."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522221521/http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/home/content/44590087.html |date=2009-05-22}} ''Indian Country Today,'' 2009-05-08 (retrieved 2010-04-20)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-files-amicus-brief-behalf-black-seminoles|title=CCR Files Amicus Brief on Behalf of Black Seminoles|author1=Jeff Fogel |author2=Barbara Olshansky |author3=Shayana Kadidal  |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2009-08-15 |year=2008 |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1942, the [[Seminole]] have at times tried to exclude [[Black Seminoles]] from the tribe. The freedmen were listed separately on the [[Dawes Rolls]] and suffered [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in [[Oklahoma]]. More recently, the Seminole refused to share with them the revenues of 20th-century US government settlements of land claims. The [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] has filed an ''amicus'' brief, taking up the legal case of the Black Seminoles and criticizing some officials of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] for collaborating in this discrimination by supporting tribal autonomy in lawsuits. By treaty, after the [[American Civil War]], the Seminole were required to emancipate slaves and provide Black Seminoles with all the rights of full-blood Indian members.&lt;ref name="cr" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;American Indian tribes located on reservations tend to have higher blood quantum requirements for membership than those located off reservation....[reference to table] [O]ver 85 percent of tribes requiring more than a one-quarter blood quantum for membership are reservation based, as compared with less than 64 percent of those having no minimum requirement. Tribes on reservations have seemingly been able to maintain exclusive membership by setting higher blood quanta, since the reservation location has generally served to isolate the tribe from non-Indians and intermarriage with them.&lt;ref name="naaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Issues related to blood quantum laws==
Many Native Americans have become used to the idea of "blood quantum".&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt; The blood quantum laws have caused problems in Native American families whose members were inaccurately recorded as having differing full or partial descent from particular tribes.&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="che"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingscherokee.com/articles_gene_040101.html |title=Blood Quantum - Why It Matters, and Why It Shouldn't |author=Christina Berry |accessdate=2009-09-07 |year=2008 |publisher=All Things Cherokee, personal website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610110458/http://www.allthingscherokee.com/articles_gene_040101.html |archivedate=June 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, family members or entire families have been excluded from being enrolled as members of their tribe even when they have no non-Native American ancestors.&lt;ref name="unenrol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unm"/&gt;

At certain times, some state governments classified persons with [[African American]] and Native American admixture solely as African American, largely because of racial discrimination related to slavery history and the concept of the [[one drop rule]]. This was prevalent in the [[Southern United States|South]] after [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], when white-dominated legislatures imposed legal [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], which classified the entire population only as white or colored (Native Americans, some of whom were of mixed race, were included in the latter designation). It related to the racial caste system of slavery before the [[American Civil War]]. Until 1870 there was no separate classification on the census for Indian.

The [[Lumbee]], a group that appeared to organize from a variety of [[free people of color]] on the [[North Carolina]] frontier in the 19th century, achieved state recognition as [[Croatan]] Indian in 1885 after Reconstruction.&lt;ref name="lb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLbAgZBy3_8C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=problems+with+indian+blood+and+black+indian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHEV8ZnYnJ&amp;sig=PD4JeX-D8jYMrPwQX6jgVYuBPgg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uF16SoLWBpCCNo36_PIC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Lumbee problem: the making of an American Indian people |author= Karen I. Blu|accessdate=2009-08-15 |year=1980 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtb"/&gt; This separate status allowed them to establish a school system for their children distinct from that for [[freedmen]]'s children.&lt;ref name="lb" /&gt;

The question of identity is complex. Researcher Paul Heinegg and Dr. [[Virginia DeMarce]] found that ancestors of 80 percent of free people of color (including individuals on the census later claimed as Lumbee ancestors) in the 1790 and 1810 censuses on the North Carolina frontier were descended from families of white women and [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] men, and were free in colonial Virginia because of the mother's status. Many mixed-race people in frontier areas identified as Indian, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or [[Arab]] to escape racial strictures.&lt;ref&gt;DeMarce, pp.24-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freeafricanamericans.com"&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], accessed 9 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 the Croatan Indians voted to adopt the name of Lumbee. (They were settled near the [[Lumber River]], also called the Lumbee.) They achieved limited federal recognition in 1956 as an [[ethnic]] Indian nation by a special act of the US Congress, and accepted at the time that it was without benefits. Since then, they have tried to appeal to Congress for legislation to gain full federal recognition. Their effort has been opposed by several federally recognized tribes.&lt;ref name="lb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, p.750.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, because mixed-race children were often raised in the mother's Native American culture, U.S. society considered them Native American, despite European ancestry. (As the trappers, traders and soldiers on the frontiers were mostly men, for some time most European-Native American unions were between European men and Native women.)&lt;ref name="lb"/&gt;

In 1924 Virginia passed the [[Racial Integrity Act]], which required that every individual be classified as either white or black. (Some other states adopted similar laws.) In application, the law was enforced to the standard of the "[[one drop rule]]": individuals with any known African ancestry were classified as black. As a result, in the censuses of the 1930s and the 1940s, particularly in the South's segregated society, many people of African American and Native American heritage who were either biracial or multiracial were largely classified as black, even though they identified culturally as Native American.&lt;ref name="mtb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tP7_3j3WrkC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=native+americans+with+african+ancestry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-X76NOyNdj&amp;sig=-f0v6_rn56IZ6ksa1mDHuxHwuuk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LJSHSpCADIaeMfCk1fsO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=native%20americans%20with%20african%20ancestry&amp;f=false|title=More than Black?: multiracial identity and the new racial order|author=G. Reginald Daniel|accessdate=2009-09-01 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Temple University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result negatively affected many individuals with mixed African American and Native American heritage. Because there are few reservations in the South, such individuals had to provide evidence of ancestry to enroll in a tribe. The changes in historic records erased their documentation of continuity of identity as Indian.&lt;ref name="mtb"/&gt; During the early years of slavery, some Native Americans and Africans intermarried because they were enslaved at the same time and shared a common experience of enslavement. Others made unions before slavery became institutionalized, as they worked together.&lt;ref name="afrna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountry_furthRdg1.htm|title=Park Ethnography: Work, Marriage, Christianity|author=National Park Service| date=2009-05-30|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the proposed regulations for children adopted into Native families are that they may not be federally recognized members unless they have a biological parent who is enrolled in a tribe.&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt; Such cases of adoption are probably less frequent than in the past. Historically, especially recorded during the [[colonial history of the United States|colonial]] years and the 19th century in the [[American West]], many tribes adopted young captives taken in war or raids to replace members who had died. Whether European or of another Native American tribe, the captives generally were fully assimilated into the tribal culture and were considered full members of the tribe. Generally, they remained with the tribe, marrying other members and rearing their children within the cultural tradition.

In some cases, census rolls for tribes such as the [[Cherokee]] were incomplete due to intermarriage, immigration, treaties, or because the members were not living within the boundaries of the nation, and thus would not be recorded on the census.&lt;ref name="chro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingscherokee.com/faq_proving.html |title=I Know I'm Cherokee, But How Do I Prove It? |author=Christina Berry |accessdate=2009-09-07 |year=2008 |publisher=All Things Cherokee, personal website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410142831/http://www.allthingscherokee.com/faq_proving.html |archivedate=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted above many people have identified as Native American on the [[US Census]] but are not eligible for tribal enrollment.

Some critics argue that blood quantum laws helped create racism among tribal members. The historian Tony Seybert contends that was why some members of the so-called [[Five Civilized tribes]] were slaveholders. The majority of slave owners were of mixed-European ancestry. Some believed they were of higher status than full-blood Indians and people of African ancestry.&lt;ref name="amslav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm |title=Slavery and Native Americans in British North America and the United States: 1600 to 1865 |author=Tony Seybert |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |publisher=New York Life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm |archivedate=2004-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php |title=Africans and Indians: Only in America |author=William Loren Katz |accessdate=2008-09-20 |year=2008 |publisher=William Loren Katz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513235755/http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians contend that the Cherokee and other tribes held slaves because it was in their economic interest and part of the general southeastern culture. Cherokee and other tribes had also traditionally taken captives in warfare to use as slaves, though their institution differed from what developed in the southern colonies.

===Issues with DNA ancestry testing===
No [[federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribe]] enrolls members solely based on DNA testing, as it generally cannot distinguish among tribes.&lt;ref name="genej"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://genetics.ncai.org/tribal-enrollment-and-genetic-testing.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  Some tribes may require DNA testing only to document that a child is related to particular parents. Many researchers have published articles that caution that genetic ancestry DNA testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all their questions about heritage.&lt;ref name="true2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071018145955.htm|title=Genetic Ancestral Testing Cannot Deliver On Its Promise, Study Warns|author=ScienceDaily|accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |publisher=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908|title=Deep Roots and Tangled Branches|author=Troy Duster|accessdate=2008-10-02|year=2008|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726082531/http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many African Americans believe they have some Native American ancestry. But, in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series led by historian [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], called ''[[African American Lives]]'', geneticists said DNA evidence shows that African-Native American admixture is relatively rare.&lt;ref name="African American Lives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/ahistoricalviewofrace/a/dnaandrace.htm |title=DNA Testing: review, ''African American Lives'', About.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313231943/http://racerelations.about.com/od/ahistoricalviewofrace/a/dnaandrace.htm |archivedate=March 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="African American Lives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="African American Lives PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/aalives/dna/index.html
|title=African American Lives 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates summarized the data:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Only 5 percent of African Americans have at least one-eighth Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent). On the other hand, nearly 78 percent of African Americans have at least one-eighth European ancestry (the equivalent to a great-grandparent), and nearly 20 percent have at least one-quarter European ancestry (the equivalent to a grandparent.)&lt;ref&gt;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishing, 2009, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some authors, who assert a much higher percentage of Native American ancestry, base their opinion on subjective assessment of how some African Americans look.&lt;ref name="dstu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlnn.com/ArtOct06/MoreBlacksAfricanAmerNativeAmerConnection.html |title=More Blacks are Exploring the African-American/Native American Connection |author=Sherrel Wheeler Stewart |accessdate=2008-08-06 |year=2008 |publisher=BlackAmericaWeb.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031200938/http://www.rlnn.com/ArtOct06/MoreBlacksAfricanAmerNativeAmerConnection.html |archivedate=2006-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics thought the PBS series ''African American Lives'' did not sufficiently explain such limitations of DNA testing for assessment of heritage.&lt;ref name="hr"/&gt; In terms of persons searching for ethnic ancestry, they need to understand that Y-chromosome and [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] (mitochondrial DNA) testing looks only at "direct" line male and female ancestors, and thus can fail to pick up many other ancestors' heritage.&lt;ref name="genej"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html|title=Genetic Markers Not a Valid Test of Native Identity|author1=Brett Lee Shelton |author2=J.D. and Jonathan Marks |accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |publisher=Counsel for Responsible Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer DNA tests can survey all the DNA that can be inherited from either parent of an individual, but at a cost of precision. DNA tests that survey the full DNA strand focus on "single nucleotide polymorphisms" or SNPs, but SNPs might be found in Africans, Asians, and people from every other part of the world. Full survey DNA testing cannot accurately determine an individual's full ancestry.&lt;ref name="jh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2138059|title=How African Are You?

==Implementation==
Many Native American tribes continue to employ blood quantum in current tribal laws to determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship in the tribe or Native American nation. These often require a minimum degree of blood relationship and often an ancestor listed in a specific tribal [[census]] from the late 19th century or early 20th century. The [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] of [[North Carolina]], for example, require an ancestor listed in the 1924 Baker census and a minimum of 1/16 Cherokee blood inherited from their ancestor(s) on that roll. Meanwhile, the [[Cherokee Nation]] requires applicants to descend from an ancestor in the 1906 [[Dawes Rolls|Dawes roll]] (direct lineal ancestry), but does not impose minimum blood quantum requirement. The [[United Keetoowah Band]] requires a minimum 1/4 blood quantum.

The [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] require a 5/8 blood quantum, the highest requirement of any American tribe. The [[Miccosukee]] of [[Florida]], the [[Mississippi Choctaw]], and the [[St. Croix Band of Chippewa Indians|St. Croix Chippewa]] of [[Wisconsin]] all require one-half "tribal blood quantum", also a high percentage.

At the other end of the scale, some tribes, such as the [[Kaw Nation]],&lt;ref name="Constitution of the Kaw Nation."&gt;[http://kawnation.com/?page_id=3312 "Constitution of the Kaw Nation."] ''Kaw Nation.'' 2011. Retrieved 30 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; have no blood quantum requirement.

Many tribes, such as [[Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town]] and the [[Wyandotte Nation]],&lt;ref name=oia/&gt; require an unspecified amount of Indian ancestry (known as "[[lineal descendancy]]") documented by descent from a recognized member. Others require a specified degree of Indian ancestry but an unspecified share of ancestry from the ancestral tribe or tribes from which the contemporary tribal entity is derived, such as the [[Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians]] and the [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narf.org/nill/Constitutions/poarchconstitution/poarchconst.htm "Constitution of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128083033/http://www.narf.org/nill/Constitutions/poarchconstitution/poarchconst.htm |date=2008-11-28 }} ''[[Native American Rights Fund]].'' 1 June 1985 (retrieved 25 Nov 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Many tribes today are confederations of different ethnic groups joined into a single political entity making the determination of blood quantum challenging.

Other tribes require a minimum blood degree only for tribal members born "off" (outside) the nominal [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. This is a concept comparable to the legal principles of ''[[Jus soli]]'' and ''[[Jus sanguinis]]'' in the [[nationality law]]s of modern sovereign states.

Within the United States, a statute of limitations is typically deemed to be a procedural law, meaning that a state will ordinarily apply its own statute of limitations to any case that is filed within its courts.&lt;ref name="wani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wani|first1=Ibrahim J.|title=Borrowing Statutes, Statutes of Limitations and Modern Choice of Law|journal=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/umkc57&amp;div=43&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''borrowing statute''', is a [[statute]] under which a U.S. state may "borrow" a shorter [[statute of limitations]] for a cause of action arising in another jurisdiction. The purpose of borrowing statutes is to prevent plaintiffs from engaging in [[forum shopping]] in order to find the longest available statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Statute of Limitations by State for Civil Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/limitations_by_state/index.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A borrowing statute is applied where a plaintiff sues in a state different from the state where the act that is the basis of the lawsuit occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Virginia Code, Chpt. 55, Art. 2A, Limitation on Foreign Claims|url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/ChapterEntire.cfm?chap=55&amp;art=2A|website=West Virginia Legislature|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person is injured in a car accident in state A, that person may sue the at-fault driver in state B (presuming state B has jurisdiction, usually because it is the driver's home state). If the state in which the lawsuit is filed has a borrowing statute, that state will usually apply the other state's statute of limitations, as long as it is a ''shorter'' statute of limitations than that of the borrowing state.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=The Michigan Borrowing Statute|url=https://council.legislature.mi.gov/Content/Files/mlrc/1997/borrow.htm|website=Michigan Legislative Council|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=6 November 2017}}, {{cite web|title=MCL 600.5861 Cause of action accruing without state; limitation on commencement of action.|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-600-5861|website=Michigan Legislature|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining which state is the one in which the cause of action arose, states will apply various [[choice of law]] principles, which may be very complicated.&lt;ref name="wani"/&gt; States that do not have borrowing statutes may apply their own statutes of limitation to most or all lawsuits filed in their state courts, although at times they may apply an out-of-state limitations period based upon a choice of law analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herma|first1=Kay|title=Gilbert Law Summaries on Conflict of Laws|isbn=1634591682|page=84|edition=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVTaCgAAQBAJ|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, the borrowing statute will only be applied if the plaintiff was not a resident of that state at the time the cause of action accrued;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cornicello|first1=Anthony J.|title=CPLR 202: When Cause of Action Accrues in Another Jurisdiction Longer New York Statute of Limitations Will Not Apply if Plaintiff Is Only a Domiciliary and Not a Resident|journal=St. John 's Law Review|date=June 2012|volume=59|issue=3|url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2137&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, it will only apply if the defendant was not a resident. Some states limit the use of borrowing statutes to specific types of cases, such as breach of contract actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Code of Virginia, § 8.01-247. When action on contract governed by the law of another state or country barred in Virginia.|url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter4/section8.01-247/|website=Legislative Information Service|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia|accessdate=6 November 2017}}. In Virginia, if the contract was breached in another state where it was supposed to have been performed, or validity of the contract is contested in another state where the contract was formed, then a court will apply the statute of limitations of the other state as long as it is shorter than their local statutes of limitations.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31602">The '''CME v. Czech Republic''' and '''Lauder v. Czech Republic''' were parallel cases decided by two different [[arbitral tribunal]]s in 2001. The difference in the two cases' outcomes is a prime example of conflicting decisions in international arbitration and is the subject of many treatises, with some authors going as far as calling it "''the ultimate fiasco in investment arbitration''".&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{Cite book

In 1993, US national [[Ronald Steven Lauder]] invested in [[Czech Republic|Czech]] private television broadcaster [[TV Nova (Czech Republic)|TV Nova]] through his German company (which was later succeeded by the Dutch company [[Central European Media Enterprises|Central European Media]] (CME)). Some 20 suits started in front of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|Czech courts]] and international tribunals, including [[UNCITRAL]] arbitrations CME v. Czech Republic and Lauder v. Czech Republic, after his business partner, Czech citizen [[Vladimír Železný]], effectively deprived CME of its investment by breaking off the deal between Lauder's and Železný's companies. CME and Lauder respectively sought damages for the alleged interference of the Czech Media Council, a government entity granting broadcasting licences, into the business arrangements between Lauder's and Železný's companies, which supposedly eventually contributed to losses experienced by Lauder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year a new Media law was passed, under which the Media Council was created in order to grant broadcasting licences. The [[Czech Republic]] became a [[Succession of states|successor]] to these treaties following the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]].

In 1992 a small group of Czech citizens founded a company called Central European Television 21 (CET 21) in order to acquire a licence for television broadcasting. CET 21 was cooperating with Central European Development Corporation (CEDC) effectively owned through another company by Ronald Lauder. Together they formed a new joint company named Česká nezávislá televizní společnost (ČNTS) with the participation of CET21, a Czech bank and, as a majority shareholder, a company representing the foreign investor. The key person [[Vladimír Železný]] became head of both CET21 and ČNTS. The newly established TV station [[TV Nova (Czech Republic)|TV Nova]] immediately became popular and very profitable. However, in 1999 Železný was fired from ČNTS. Subsequently, CET21 terminated its contract with ČNTS, after the latter failed to submit the Daily Log regarding the broadcasting for the next day.

The Media Council attempted to influence the relationship between the CET21 and ČNTS: firstly when the council granted a licence in 1992 and 1993, then after a new Media Law became effective around 1996, and finally in 1999 when the breach between the two companies happened.

On 19 August 1999, Ronald Lauder, majority owner of CME, which was in turn the majority owner of ČNTS, started [[UNCITRAL]] arbitration against the [[Czech Republic]] under the USA-CZ treaty ("'''London arbitration'''"). Meanwhile, on 22 February 2000, CME initiated parallel [[UNCITRAL]] arbitration proceedings against the Czech Republic under the NL-CZ treaty ("'''Stockholm arbitration'''").

==Findings==

===Procedural issues===
The tribunals had to deal with a number of procedural issues. Firstly it was the fact, that the same dispute was submitted to the Czech courts, to the other arbitration in Stockholm/London respectively, and also to [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]] as a proceeding between Železný and CME. The London arbitration observed, that neither Lauder nor the Czech Republic are parties to any of the numerous proceedings, and that none of these courts would decide on the basis of the USA-CZ treaty and that the concurrent Stockholm arbitration will base its decision on the NL-CZ treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

''(and that both bilateral investment treaties)'' are part of the laws of the Czech Republic and neither of the treaties supersedes the other.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

===Merits===
The London tribunal held that the Czech Republic "''did not take any measure of, or tantamount to, expropriation of the Claimant's property rights within any of the time periods, since there was no direct or indirect interference by the Czech Republic in the use of Mr. Lauder's property or with the enjoyment of its benefits''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

====1993 events====
Nevertheless the London tribunal found violation of the US-CZ treaty (prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory measures) as regards acts of the Media Council in the year 1993, when the Media Council insisted on CEDC (affiliated with CME) not becoming a direct shareholder of CET21:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

  |court = 
  |date = September 3, 2001
  |url= http://www.mfcr.cz/cps/rde/xbcr/mfcr/FinalAward_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Media Council was concerned with the prospect of direct participation by a foreign investor in the holder of nation-wide broadcasting licence (CET21). A new entity ČNTS was therefore created with CEDC contributing 75% of CNTS' capital while obtaining 66% ownership, a Czech bank contributing 25% of capital while obtaining 22% ownership and CET21 contributing "the right to use, benefit from, and maintain the License (...) on an unconditional, irrevocable and exclusive basis" while obtaining 12% ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

One of the Media Council's aims was to prevent direct participation of foreign capital in license holders. The arrangement in 1993 was therefore as follows: CET21 was the licence holder, CEDC provided the majority of capital, and their joint company ČNTS did the actual broadcasting. The Stockholm award evaluated the 1993 development as follows: "''The Media Council violated the ''(NL-CZ)'' Treaty when dismantling the legal basis of the foreign investor's investments by forcing the foreign investor’s joint venture company ČNTS to give up substantial accrued legal rights.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

====1996 - 1997 events====
In 1995 the Media law was amended. The most relevant modification was that the Media Council could no longer include conditions for the broadcasting operator in its decision to grant a license. Also, the new law had a much narrower definition of the term "broadcaster" as the person to whom a license was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

The companies set forward to modify the arrangement in order to address the concerns expressed by the expert opinion. In doing so, they consulted the Media Council, which in turn requested further expert opinion. After meetings with the Media Council, the companies entered a new agreement in May 1996 setting forth their legal relationship: in substance, CET21 was the holder of the License and the operator of television broadcasting, the License was non-transferable, and was not the subject of a contribution from CET21 to ČNTS. ČNTS' role was to arrange the television broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

In June 1996 the Media Council informed CET21 that the latter had breached the License by failing to make a timely announcement of changes in the registered capital, in the signing process, and in the company's registered office. It directed CET21 and ČNTS to change their registration with the Commercial Registry, particularly to modify ČNTS' business activity with respect to "''television broadcasting''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

Then, in July 1996, the Media Council started administrative proceedings against the ČNTS for broadcasting without authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

  |url= http://www.mfcr.cz/cps/rde/xbcr/mfcr/FinalAward_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in August 1996, CME and Mr. Železný entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which  the former would provide the latter with a loan of $4,700,000 for acquiring 47% of CET21's stock from the other individual shareholders. The agreement provided for Mr. Železný to exercise all his voting rights as directed by CME until full repayment of the loan. The Media Council was not informed of the change in CET21's ownership. In November, the agreement between the companies was further amended, so that ČNTS was granted the unconditional, irrevocable, and exclusive right to use and maintain the know-how and make it a source of profit for the Company, in connection with the License, its maintenance and protection. In addition, ČNTS was granted the right to acquire the License from CET21 in the case of change in the legal regulation and prevailing interpretation of the legal community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

Assessment of the situation by the two tribunals differs significantly. The London tribunal found, that there were several facts casting doubt on whether CET21 or ČNTS was actually operating the broadcasting of TV Nova: ČNTS' entry in the Commercial Registry stated that the business activity was "''operating television broadcasting on the basis of the license no. 001/1003''", ČNTS had entered into agreements with other companies for the dissemination of broadcasting, at the time Železný was head of both companies, and finally, most activities in connection with TV Nova were performed from ČNTS' large premises in Prague with an important staff, whereas CET21 had a much smaller organisation. Therefore, it assessed "''all these facts lead to confusion of the roles actually played by ČNTS and CET21 and the Media Council could legitimately fear that a situation had arisen where there had been a de facto transfer of the License from CET21 to ČNTS ... The commencement of the administrative proceedings against ČNTS for alleged unauthorized broadcasting constituted the normal exercise of the regulatory duties of the Media Council ''(and)'' was not arbitrary''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

Meanwhile, the Stockholm award states that "''the events in 1996 as documented by the exhibits to the parties' submissions are decisive in sustaining the conclusion that the Media Council in 1996 forced ČNTS and CME to agree to undermine the legal protection of CME's investment''."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite court

According to the Stockholm award all this was done in order to "''re-establish its control over the broadcasting operations of CET21/ČNTS''" which was lost due to the amendment of the Media act, which took away the Council's power to grant license subject to conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The London award on the same issue found that "''the main reason for the Media Council to direct CME, CET21 and ČNTS to bring some modifications was the same as the ground for initiating the administrative proceedings ''(...)'' i.e. the fear that the unclear legal and factual situation could actually amount to a de facto transfer of the License from CET21 to ČNTS, in violation of Media Law.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

The Stockholm award went as far as stating, that "''the Media Council was obliged to defend and secure ''(1993 ČNTS/CET21/CEDC structure) '' after having attracted foreign investment on the basis of it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

====1999 events====
On 5 August 1999, CET21 terminated its contractual relationship with ČNTS, after the latter failed to supply the Daily Log.

The events leading to this are described by the London tribunal as follows: "''Between 1997 and 1999 the Media Council did not want to take sides with respect to the dispute between CET21 and ČNTS, which was considered a commercial dispute. In particular, the Media Council's letter of March 15, 1999, whose wording is different from the one requested by Mr. Železný, expressed the Media Council's policy in a lawful and non-discriminatory manner.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

====Conclusions====
The London Tribunal in conclusion held  that "''none of the actions or inactions of the Media Council caused a direct or indirect damage to Mr. Lauder's investment.

====Dissent====
Arbitrator Jaroslav Hándl did not sign the partial CME award and made a [[dissenting opinion]] with reservations partially about facts and especially about the legal conclusions. He wrote, that "''mistakes and errors in the legal conclusions have been caused basically by the fact, that the two arbitrators seem to have firstly agreed upon the final decision as it is expressed in the Award and only thereafter they looked for the arguments to the favour of the Claimant''", that "''principally the parties to this dispute did never have an equal position''" and that he was "''excluded from any discussion''" as the two other arbitrators alone worked on the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

While the final award was signed by all arbitrators, Professor [[Ian Brownlie]], who replaced Mr Hándl, wrote a separate opinion challenging many aspects of the award.

== Aftermath ==
Final decision (including damages calculation) of the Stockholm tribunal was issued on 14 March 2003. Subsequently, the Czech Republic petitioned the [[Svea Court of Appeal]] to set aside the decision, mostly using the Jaroslav Hándl´s dissenting opinion.&lt;ref name=int/&gt; Simultaneously the Czech Republic and CME agreed, that the Czech Republic will immediately pay damages and costs of the decision to the escrow account with 1.2% interest and CME will not enforce the decision until the decision of Svea Court. On 4 April 2003 the Czech republic paid $354,943,542 on the escrow account and on 13 May 2003 the Czech republic lost the case at the Svea court.&lt;ref name=nov/&gt;

=== CME and TV Nova ===
Since 1999 influence of Vladimír Železný in TV Nova licence holder CET 21 declined. [[Jiří Šmejc]]'s MEF Holding increased its influence by providing money for new start of TV Nova, in 2002 [[Petr Kellner]]'s [[PPF (company)|PPF]] started to be strongly involved. Due to numerous legal disputes between Vladimír Železný, MEF Holding and PPF the ownership structure of CET 21 was unknown. On 14 May 2003 Vladimír Železný was removed from post of CEO of CET21, on 8 October 2003 PPF bought majority stake in ČNTS from CME for app. 1.45 CZK billion ($53.2 million) to end numerous distupes arising from 1999 events.&lt;ref name=novC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/45718-novu-opet-ziska-americka-cme.html |title=Novu opět získá americká CME |publisher=Novinky.cz |date=13 December 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |language=Czech |trans-title=TV Nova will be acquired by CME again}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in December 2004 CME announced to acquire majority stake in CET21 from PPF for $642 millions and thus to control TV Nova again.&lt;ref name=novC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bbcfc5de-4d75-11d9-b3be-00000e2511c8.html#ixzz1SbvYMfiw FT: CME agrees $642m Czech TV station deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Schmitt''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|m|ɪ|t}}; {{IPA-de|ʃmɪt|lang}}; 11 July 1888 – 7 April 1985) was a [[Conservatism|conservative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Political Theory|last=Hoffman|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317556602|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Piero Gobetti and the Politics of Liberal Revolution|last=Martin|first=James|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-61686-8|location=|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; German [[jurist]] and [[political theory|political theorist]]. Schmitt wrote extensively about the effective wielding of political power. His work has been a major influence on subsequent political theory, legal theory, continental philosophy and [[political theology]], and remains both influential and controversial due to his close association and juridical-political allegiance with [[Nazism]]. He is known as the "crown jurist of the [[Third Reich]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2127676 Carl Schmitt's Concept of the Political] by Charles E. Frye, The Journal of Politics, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Nov., 1966), pp. 818–30, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmitt's work has attracted the attention of numerous philosophers and political theorists, including [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Susan Buck-Morss]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Waldemar Gurian]], [[Jaime Guzmán]], [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;William E.

==Early years==
Schmitt was born in [[Plettenberg]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], German Empire. His parents were Roman Catholics from the German [[Eifel]] region who had settled in Plettenberg. His father was a minor businessman. He studied [[law]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and took his graduation and state examinations in then-German Strasbourg during 1915.&lt;ref name="conscience56"&gt;[[Claudia Koonz]], ''The Nazi Conscience'', 2003, p. 56 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1910 doctoral thesis was titled ''Über Schuld und Schuldarten'' (''On Guilt and Types of Guilt'').&lt;ref&gt;Cover of Carl Schmitt's dissertation from 1910: https://markkukoivusalo.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/syyllisyys.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

He volunteered for the army during 1916.&lt;ref name="conscience56" /&gt; The same year, he earned his [[habilitation]] at Strasbourg with a thesis under the title ''Der Wert des Staates und die Bedeutung des Einzelnen'' (''The Value of the State and the Significance of the Individual''). He then taught at various business schools and universities, namely at the [[University of Greifswald]] (1921), the [[University of Bonn]] (1921), the [[Technische Universität München]] (1928), the [[University of Cologne]] (1933), and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (1933–1945).

During 1916, Schmitt married his first wife, Pavla&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In Germany, "Pavla" is usually rendered as "Pawla" even though the letter "w" is used in the [[Serbian Latin alphabet|Serbian auxiliary Latin alphabet]] only for foreign words.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorotić,&lt;ref name="conscience57"&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 57 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Serbian woman who pretended to be a countess. They were divorced, though an appeal to the [[Catholic Church]] for an annulment was rejected. During 1926 he married his second wife, Duška Todorović (1903–1950), also Serbian; they had one daughter, named Anima. Subsequently, Schmitt was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] because his first marriage had not been annulled by the Church.&lt;ref name="conscience57" /&gt; His daughter Anima Schmitt de Otero (1931–1983) was married, from 1957, to Alfonso Otero Valera (1925–2001), a Spanish law professor at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] and a member of the ruling Spanish [[Falange]] party under the Franco régime. She translated several works by her father into Spanish. Letters from Carl Schmitt to his son-in-law have also been published.

==Beliefs ==
As a young man, Schmitt was "a devoted Catholic until his break with the church in the mid twenties."&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John P. ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism: Against Politics as Technology''. 1st pbk. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999:86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; From around the end of the First World War, he began to describe his Catholicism as "displaced" and "de-totalised".&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Jan-Werner. ''A Dangerous Mind: Carl Schmitt in Post-War European Thought''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2003:xxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Gross argues that his work "cannot be reduced to Roman Catholic theology given a political turn. Rather, Schmitt should be understood as carrying an atheistic political-theological tradition to an extreme."&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Raphael. ''Carl Schmitt and the Jews: The Jewish Question, the Holocaust, and German Legal Theory''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2007: 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt met [[Mircea Eliade]] in Berlin during the summer of 1942 and spoke later of Eliade to his friend [[Ernst Jünger]] and of his interest to Eliade's works.&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli Cristiano. Mircea Eliade, Carl Schmitt, René Guénon, 1942. In: Revue de l'histoire des religions, tome 219, n°3, 2002. p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="''Preussen contra Reich''"==
Apart from his academic functions, in 1932, Schmitt was counsel for the Reich government in the case "''Preussen contra Reich''" ("Prussia v. Reich") in which the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]-controlled government of the state of [[Prussia]] disputed its dismissal by the right-wing Reich government of [[Franz von Papen]]. Papen was motivated to do so because Prussia, by far the largest state in [[Germany]], served as a powerful base for the political left and provided it with institutional power, particularly in the form of the Prussian police. Schmitt, Carl Bilfinger and Erwin Jacobi represented the Reich&lt;ref name="gppcr"&gt;{{cite book |last=Balakrishnan |first=Gopal |title=The Enemy |year=2000 |publisher=Verso |isbn=1-85984-760-9|pages=168–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the counsel for the Prussian government was [[Hermann Heller (legal scholar)|Hermann Heller]]. The court ruled in October 1932 that the Prussian government had been suspended unlawfully but that the Reich had the right to install a commissar.&lt;ref name="gppcr" /&gt; In German history, the struggle resulting in the ''de facto'' destruction of federalism in the Weimar republic is known as the "''[[Preußenschlag]]''."

==Nazi period==
Schmitt remarked on 31 January 1933 that with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s appointment, "one can say that '[[Hegel]] died.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Balakrishnan (2000), p187&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wolin]] observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is Hegel qua philosopher of the "bureaucratic class" or Beamtenstaat that has been definitely surpassed with Hitler's triumph... this class of civil servants—which Hegel in the Rechtsphilosophie deems the "universal class"—represents an impermissible drag on the sovereignty of executive authority. For Schmitt... the very essence of the bureaucratic conduct of business is reverence for the norm, a standpoint that could not but exist in great tension with the doctrines of Carl Schmitt... Hegel had set an ignominious precedent by according this putative universal class a position of preeminence in his political thought, insofar as the primacy of the bureaucracy tends to diminish or supplant the prerogative of sovereign authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolin |first=Richard |year=1992 |title=Carl Schmitt: The Conservative Revolutionary Habitus and the Aesthetics of Horror |journal=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] |issue=3 |pages=424–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wohnhaus 1971-1985.jpeg|left|thumb|275px|"San Casciano", home of Carl Schmitt in Plettenberg-Pasel from 1971 until 1985]]

After the Nazis forced through the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which changed the [[Weimar Constitution]] to allow the "present government" to rule by decree, bypassing both the President, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], and the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], [[Alfred Hugenberg]], the leader of the [[German National People's Party]] &amp;ndash; which was one of the Nazi's partners in the coalition government, but was being squeezed out of existence &amp;ndash; hoped to slow down the Nazi takeover of the country by threatening to quit his ministry position in the Cabinet.  Hugenberg reasoned that by doing so, the government would thereby be changed, and the Enabling Act would no longer apply, as the "present government" that had been would no longer exist.  It was a legal opinion by Carl Schmitt which prevented this political maneuver from succeeding.  Schmitt, well known as a constitutional theorist, declared that "present government" did not refer to the specific make-up of the Cabinet when the Act was passed, but to the "completely different kind of government" &amp;ndash; that is, different from the democracy of the [[Weimar Republic]] &amp;ndash; which the Hitler cabinet had brought into existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2003) ''[[The Coming of the Third Reich]]'' New York: [[Penguin Press]]. p.371 {{isbn|0-14-303469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmitt joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 May 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 58 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, Schmitt was party to the burning of books by Jewish authors, rejoicing in the burning of "un-German" and "anti-German" material, and calling for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors influenced by Jewish ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 59 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July he was appointed State Councillor for Prussia by [[Hermann Göring]] and in November he became the president of the "Union of National-Socialist Jurists". He also replaced Hermann Heller as a professor at the [[University of Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Balakrishnan (2000), pp. 183–84&lt;/ref&gt; a position he would hold until the end of [[World War II]]. He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] dictatorship, and a justification of the ''[[Führer]]'' state concerning legal philosophy, particularly through the concept of ''[[auctoritas]]''.

In June 1934, Schmitt was appointed editor-in-chief of the Nazi newspaper for lawyers, the ''Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung'' ("German Jurists' Journal").&lt;ref name="facsimile"&gt;http://www.flechsig.biz/DJZ34_CS.pdf german original as pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In July he published in it "The Leader Protects the Law (''Der Führer schützt das Recht'')", a justification of the political murders of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] with the authority of Hitler as the "highest form of administrative justice (''höchste Form administrativer Justiz'')".&lt;ref name="DJR"&gt;Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung, 38, 1934; trans. as "The Führer Protects Justice" in Detlev Vagts, ''Carl Schmitt's Ultimate Emergency: The Night of the Long Knives'' (2012) 87(2) ''The Germanic Review'' 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt presented himself as a radical [[anti-semitism|anti-semite]] and also was the chairman of a law teachers' convention in [[Berlin]] during October 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 207 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he demanded that German law be cleansed of the "Jewish spirit (''jüdischem Geist'')", going so far as to demand that all publications by Jewish scientists should henceforth be marked with a small symbol.

Nevertheless, in December 1936, the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) publication ''[[Das schwarze Korps]]'' accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker, and a Catholic, and called his anti-semitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis' racial theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/carl-schmitt%E2%80%99s-war-liberalism-12704|title=Carl Schmitt’s War on Liberalism|last=Lind|first=Michael|date=2015-04-23|work=The National Interest|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechinastory.org/cot/carl-schmitt-in-china/|title=Carl Schmitt in China {{!}} The China Story|website=www.thechinastory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUYDQIXSEtoC&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20&amp;dq=Das+Schwarze+Korps+carl+schmitt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SqsmysksX4&amp;sig=yW5grjb8myPtqhHvLIv6cwGdAxE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSmarKyq_eAhUE1lkKHWqNBWEQ6AEwBnoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Das%20Schwarze%20Korps%20carl%20schmitt&amp;f=false|title=The Concept of the Political: Expanded Edition|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|date=2008-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226738840|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Schmitt resigned from his position as ''Reichsfachgruppenleiter'' (Reich Professional Group Leader), although he retained his job as a professor in Berlin and his title "Prussian State Councellor". Although Schmitt continued to be investigated into 1937, further reprisals were stopped by Göring.&lt;ref name="Bendersky"&gt;Bendersky, Joseph, W., ''Theorist For The Reich'', 1983, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noack"&gt;Noack, Paul, Carl Schmitt – Eine Biographie, 1996, Frankfurt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–World War II==
In 1945, Schmitt was captured by American forces and, after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home town of [[Plettenberg]] and later to the house of his housekeeper Anni Stand in Plettenberg-Pasel. Schmitt refused every attempt at [[de-nazification]], which effectively barred him from academic jobs. Despite being isolated from the mainstream of the scholarly and political community, he continued his studies especially of [[international law]] from the 1950s on, and he frequently received visitors, both colleagues and younger intellectuals, until well into his old age. Important among these visitors were [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Jacob Taubes]] and [[Alexandre Kojève]].

In 1962, Schmitt gave lectures in [[Francoist Spain]], two of which resulted in the publication, the next year, of ''Theory of the Partisan'' (Telos Press, 2007), in which he characterized the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a "war of national liberation" against "international Communism". Schmitt regarded the [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] as a specific and significant phenomenon; during the latter half of the 20th century, indicated the emergence of a new theory of warfare.

Schmitt died on 7 April 1985 and is buried in [[Plettenberg]].

==Work==

===''On Dictatorship''===
During 1921, Schmitt became a professor at the [[University of Greifswald]], where he published his essay ''Die Diktatur'' (on [[dictatorship]]), in which he discussed the foundations of the newly established [[Weimar Republic]], emphasising the office of the ''[[Reichspräsident]]''. In this essay, Schmitt compared and contrasted what he saw as the effective and ineffective elements of the new constitution of his country. He saw the office of the president as a comparatively effective element, because of the power granted to the president to declare a [[state of exception]] (''Ausnahmezustand''). This power, which Schmitt discussed and implicitly praised as dictatorial,&lt;ref name="DJR" /&gt; was more in line with the underlying mentality of executive power than the comparatively slow and ineffective processes of legislative power reached through parliamentary [[discussion]] and [[compromise]].

Schmitt was at pains to remove what he saw as a taboo surrounding the concept of "dictatorship" and to show that the concept is implicit whenever power is wielded by means other than the slow processes of parliamentary politics and the bureaucracy:

{{quote|If the constitution of a state is democratic, then every exceptional negation of democratic principles, every exercise of state power independent of the approval of the majority, can be called dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hjlenger.de/reader/schmitt%20theologie%20diktatur%20leviathan.pdf ''Die Diktatur''] &amp;sect; XV p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Schmitt, every government capable of decisive action must include a dictatorial element within its constitution. Although the German concept of ''Ausnahmezustand'' is best translated as "state of emergency", it literally means "[[state of exception]]" which, according to Schmitt, frees the executive from any legal restraints to its power that would normally apply. The use of the term "exceptional" has to be underlined here: Schmitt defines [[sovereignty]] as the power to ''decide'' the instauration of [[state of emergency|state of exception]], as [[Giorgio Agamben]] has noted. According to Agamben,&lt;ref&gt;''State of Exception'' (2005), pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt's conceptualization of the "state of exception" as belonging to the core-concept of sovereignty was a response to [[Walter Benjamin]]'s concept of a "pure" or "revolutionary" violence, which did not enter into any relationship whatsoever with right. Through the state of exception, Schmitt included all types of violence under right, in the case of the authority of Hitler leading to the formulation "The leader defends the law" ("''Der Führer schützt das Recht''").&lt;ref name="DJR" /&gt;

Schmitt opposed what he termed "commissarial dictatorship", or the declaration of a state of emergency in order to save the legal order (a temporary suspension of law, defined itself by moral or legal right): the state of emergency is limited (even if ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', by law) to "sovereign dictatorship", in which law was suspended, as in the classical state of exception, not to "save the [[Constitution]]", but rather to create another constitution. This is how he theorized [[Hitler]]'s continual suspension of the legal constitutional order during the [[Third Reich]] (the [[Weimar Republic]]'s Constitution was never abrogated, emphasized Giorgio Agamben;&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life,'' p. 168. On the February 28, 1933 decree of the ''Ausnahmezustand'' (state of exception), Agamben notes that this very term was conspicuously absent: "The decree remained de facto in force until the end of the Third Reich... The state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself."&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it was "suspended" for four years, first with the 28 February 1933 [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], with the suspension renewed every four years, implying a continual state of emergency).

===''Political Theology''===
 &lt;!-- Linked from redirect [[Politische Theologie]] --&gt;
''On Dictatorship'' was followed by another essay in 1922, titled "''Politische Theologie''" ([[political theology]]); in it, Schmitt, who at the time was working as a professor at the [[University of Bonn]], gave further substance to his authoritarian theories, analysing the concept of "free will" influenced by Christian-Catholic thinkers. The book begins with Schmitt's famous, or notorious, definition: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." By "exception", Schmitt means the appropriate moment for stepping outside the [[rule of law]] in the public interest (see discussion of ''On Dictatorship'' above). Schmitt proposes this definition to those offered by contemporary theorists of sovereignty, particularly [[Hans Kelsen]], whose work is criticized at several points in the essay.

The book's title derives from Schmitt's assertion (in chapter 3) that "all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts"—in other words, that [[political theory]] addresses the state (and sovereignty) in much the same manner as [[theology]] does God.

A year later, Schmitt supported the emergence of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] power structures in his paper "''Die geistesgeschichtliche Lage des heutigen Parlamentarismus''" (roughly: "The Intellectual-Historical Situation of Today's [[Parliamentarianism]]", translated as ''[[Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy|The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy]]'' by Ellen Kennedy). Schmitt criticized the institutional practices of liberal politics, arguing that they are justified by a faith in rational discussion and openness that is at odds with actual parliamentary [[party politics]], in which outcomes are hammered out in [[smoke-filled room]]s by party leaders. Schmitt also posits an essential division between the liberal doctrine of [[separation of powers]] and what he holds to be the nature of [[democracy]] itself, the identity of the rulers and the ruled. Although many critics of Schmitt today, such as [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] in his ''The Anatomy of Anti-Liberalism'', take exception to his fundamentally [[authoritarian]] outlook, the idea of incompatibility between liberalism and democracy is one reason for the continued interest in his [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;William E. Scheuerman, "Survey Article: Emergency Powers and the Rule of Law after 9/11", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'', Volume 14, No. 1, 2006, pp. 61–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In  chapter 4 of his ''State of Exception'' (2005), Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] argued that Schmitt's ''Political Theology'' ought to be read as a response to [[Walter Benjamin]]'s influential essay "Towards the Critique of Violence".

===''The Concept of the Political''===
Schmitt changed universities in 1926, when he became professor of law at the Handelshochschule in [[Berlin]], and again in 1932, when he accepted a position in [[University of Cologne|Cologne]]. It was from lectures at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] in Berlin that he wrote his most famous paper, "''Der Begriff des Politischen''" ("[[The Concept of the Political]]"), in which he developed his theory of "the political".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gottfried |first=Paul |title=Carl Schmitt |year=1990 |publisher=Claridge Press |isbn=1-870626-46-X |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct from party politics, "the political" is the essence of politics. While churches are predominant in religion or society is predominant in economics, the state is predominant in politics. Yet for Schmitt the political was not an autonomous domain equivalent to the other domains, but rather the existential basis that would determine any other domain should it reach the point of politics (e.g. religion ceases to be merely theological when it makes a clear distinction between the "friend" and the "enemy"). The political is not equal to any other domain, such as the economic (which distinguishes between profitable and not profitable), but instead is the most essential to identity.

Schmitt, in perhaps his best-known formulation, bases his conceptual realm of state sovereignty and autonomy upon the distinction between ''friend'' and ''enemy''. This distinction is to be determined "existentially", which is to say that the enemy is whoever is "in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such an enemy need not even be based on nationality: so long as the conflict is potentially intense enough to become a violent one between political entities, the actual substance of enmity may be anything.

Although there have been divergent interpretations concerning this work, there is broad agreement that ''"The Concept of the Political"'' is an attempt to achieve state unity by defining the content of politics as opposition to the "other" (that is to say, an enemy, a stranger. This applies to any person or entity that represents a serious threat or conflict to one's own interests.) Additionally, the prominence of the state stands as a neutral force dominating potentially fractious civil society, whose various antagonisms must not be allowed to affect politics, lest civil war result.

====Dialogue with Leo Strauss====
Schmitt's positive reference for [[Leo Strauss]], and Schmitt's approval of his work, had been instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 123&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Strauss's critique and clarifications of ''The Concept of the Political'' led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt during 1932, Strauss summarized Schmitt's political theology thus: "[B]ecause man is by nature evil, he therefore needs ''dominion''. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men ... the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state."&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the letters between Schmitt and Strauss have been published.

===''Nomos of the Earth''===
''The Nomos of the Earth'' is Schmitt's most historical and geopolitical work. Published in 1950, it was also one of his final texts. It describes the origin of the [[Eurocentric]] global order, which Schmitt dates from the [[discovery of the New World]], discusses its specific character and its contribution to civilization, analyses the reasons for its decline at the end of the 19th century, and concludes with prospects for a new world order. It defends European achievements, not only in creating the first truly global order of [[international law]], but also in limiting war to conflicts among sovereign states, which, in effect, civilized war. In Schmitt's view, the European sovereign state was the greatest achievement of [[Europe|Occidental]] rationalism; in becoming the principal agency of secularization, the European state created the modern age.

Notable in Schmitt's discussion of the European epoch of world history is the role played by the [[New World]], which ultimately replaced the [[old world]] as the centre of the Earth and became the arbiter in European and world politics. According to Schmitt, the [[United States]]' internal conflicts between economic presence and political absence, between isolationism and interventionism, are global problems, which today continue to hamper the creation of a new world order. But however critical Schmitt is of American actions at the end of the 19th century and after World War I, he considered the United States to be the only political entity capable of resolving the crisis of global order.

===''Hamlet or Hecuba''===
Published in 1956, ''Hamlet or Hecuba: The Intrusion of the Time into the Play'' was Schmitt's most extended piece of literary criticism. In it Schmitt focuses his attention on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' and argues that the significance of the work hinges on its ability to integrate history in the form of the taboo of the queen and the deformation of the figure of the avenger. Schmitt uses this interpretation to develop a theory of myth and politics that serves as a cultural foundation for his concept of political representation. Beyond literary criticism or historical analysis, Schmitt's book also reveals a comprehensive theory of the relationship between aesthetics and politics that responds to alternative ideas developed by [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]].

===''Theory of the Partisan''===
Schmitt's ''Theory of the Partisan'' originated in two lectures delivered during 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmitt |first=Carl |year=2004 |month= |title=Theory of the Partisan: Intermediate Commentary on the Concept of the Political (1963) |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=127 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been seen as a rethinking of ''The Concept of the Political''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael|last1=Hoelzl |first2=Graham|last2=Ward |title=Editors' introduction to Political Theology II |publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]] |year=2008|page=4|isbn=978-0-7456-4254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It addressed the transformation of war in the post-European age, analysing a specific and significant phenomenon that ushered in a new [[theory of war]] and enmity. It contains an implicit theory of the terrorist, which during the 21st century has resulted in yet another new theory of war and enmity. In the lectures, Schmitt directly tackles the issues surrounding "the problem of the Partisan" figure: the guerrilla or revolutionary who "fights irregularly" (p. 3).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telospress.com/main/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=318&lt;/ref&gt; Both because of its scope, with extended discussions on historical figures like [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the events marking the beginning of the 20th century, Schmitt's text has had a resurgence of popularity. [[Jacques Derrida]], in his ''Politics of Friendship'' remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite certain signs of ironic distrust in the areas of metaphysics and ontology, ''The Concept of the Political'' was, as we have seen, a philosophical type of essay to 'frame' the topic of a concept unable to constitute itself on philosophical ground. But in ''Theory of the Partisan'', it is in the same areas that the topic of this concept is both radicalized and properly uprooted, where Schmitt wished to regrasp in history the event or node of events that engaged this uprooting radicalisation, and it is precisely there that the philosophical as such intervenes again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacques|last=Derrida |title=The Politics of Friendship |publisher=Verso |year=1997|page=146|isbn=1-84467-054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schmitt concludes ''Theory of the Partisan'' with the statement: "The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmitt |first=Carl |year=2004 |month= |title=Theory of the Partisan: Intermediate Commentary on the Concept of the Political (1963) |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=127 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt's work on the Partisan has since spurred comparisons with the post-9/11 'terrorist' in recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Fairhead, Edward (2017) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14797585.2017.1410991 'Carl Schmitt’s politics in the age of drone strikes: examining the Schmittian texture of Obama’s enemy'] ''Journal for Cultural Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Through [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Andrew Arato]], [[Chantal Mouffe]] and other writers, Carl Schmitt has become a common reference in recent writings of the intellectual left as well as the right.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Lebovic, Nitzan (2008), "The Jerusalem School: The Theo-Political Hour", ''New German Critique'' (103), 97–120.&lt;/ref&gt; These discussions concern not only the interpretation of Schmitt's own positions, but also matters relevant to contemporary politics: the idea that laws of the state cannot strictly limit actions of its [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the problem of a "[[state of exception]]" (later expanded upon by Agamben).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.slideshare.net/AmineBenabdallah1/la-rception-de-carl-schmitt-par-giorgio-agamben-a-benabdallah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmitt's argument that political concepts are ''secularized theological concepts'' has also recently been seen as consequential for those interested in contemporary [[political theology]]. The German-Jewish philosopher [[Jacob Taubes]], for example, engaged Schmitt widely in his study of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], ''The Political Theology of Paul'' (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004). Taubes' understanding of political theology is, however, very different from Schmitt's, and emphasizes the political aspect of theological claims, rather than the religious derivation of political claims.

Schmitt is described as a "classic of political thought" by [[Herfried Münkler]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Herfried Münkler]], Erkenntnis wächst an den Rändern – Der Denker Carl Schmitt beschäftigt auch 20 Jahre nach seinem Tod Rechte wie Linke, in [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article583822/Erkenntnis_waechst_an_den_Raendern.html ''Die Welt''], 7 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while in the same article Münkler speaks of his post-war writings as reflecting an: "embittered, jealous, occasionally malicious man" ("verbitterten, eifersüchtigen, gelegentlich bösartigen Mann"). Schmitt was termed the "Crown Jurist of the [[Third Reich]]" ("Kronjurist des Dritten Reiches") by [[Waldemar Gurian]].

[[Timothy D. Snyder]] has asserted that Schmitt's work has greatly influenced [[Eurasianism|Eurasianist]] philosophy in Russia by revealing a counter to the liberal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/mar/20/fascism-russia-and-ukraine/|title=Fascism, Russia, and Ukraine|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|date=20 March 2014|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Renato Cristi in the writing of the present [[Constitution of Chile]] [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] collaborator [[Jaime Guzmán]] based his work on the ''pouvoir constituant'' concept used by Schmitt as well as drawing inspiration in the ideas of [[Market economy|market society]] of [[Friedrich Hayek]]. This way Guzmán would have enabled a framework for an authoritarian state with a [[free market]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]] |title=El pensamiento político de Jaime Guzmán |edition=2nd |url=http://www.lom.cl/330a726e-6617-494e-bae3-7b95b5bb19ae/El-pensamiento-pol%C3%ADtico-de-Jaime-Guzm%C3%A1n-%282%C2%AA-edici%C3%B3n%29.aspx |access-date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chose''' (pronounced: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|əʊ|z}}, French for "thing") is a term used in [[common law]] tradition to refer to rights in property, specifically a combined bundle of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law'' Chapters 7.1-7.6, Hart Publishing, Second Edition 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A chose describes the enforcement right which a party possesses in an object. The use of ''Chose'' extends from the English use of French within the courts.&lt;ref&gt;WS Holdsworth 'The History of the Treatment of Choses in Action by the Common Law' (1920) 33 Harvard LR 967, cf Goode and Gullifer Legal Problems of Credit and Security, 6th Edition, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In English and commonwealth law, all [[personal property|personal things]] fall into one of two categories, either '''choses in action''' and '''choses in possession'''.&lt;ref&gt;Re BCCI (No 8)[1998] AC 214 also Cf sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271&lt;/ref&gt; English law uses a ''chose'' to refer to a bundle of rights, traditionally relating to property which may be utilised in certain circumstances. Thus, a ''Chose in action'' refers to a bundle of personal rights which can only be enforced or claimed by a chose-holder bringing an action through the court to enforce the action. In English law, this category is enormously wide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"&gt;WS Holdsworth 'The History of the Treatment of Choses in Action by the Common Law' (1920) 33 Harvard LR 96&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with a ''Chose in Possession'' which represents rights which can be enforced or acquired by taking physical possession of the chose. This may be, for example a legal mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;The Aliakmon [1986] AC 786&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''choses in possession'' and 'choses in action'' create separate proprietary interests. What differs between each is the method in which each ''chose'' may be enforced. This is dependent on the possessory nature of the reference object.&lt;ref&gt;Quest 'Taking Security over bitcoins and other virtual currency' (2015) 7 JIBFL&lt;/ref&gt;''

Alternative, historical uses includes a '''chose local''', a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill; a '''chose transitory''', something movable that can be carried from place to place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Chose in action==
A '''chose in action''' or ''thing in action''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080419024654/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/bj/harm/not42.html Canadian Department of Justice. Bijural Terminology Records]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/things_in_action/|title=Things in action|last=Litvin|first=Michael|date=2009-10-08|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2016-07-13}} Also known as a Chose in suspense&lt;/ref&gt; is a right to sue. It has been made trite law, since ''[[Torkington v Magee]]'', that a ''chose in action'' is a legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action. It is therefore a categorisation of interests in assets, the enforcement of which cannot be secured without the use of a court.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"/&gt; It is an [[intangible asset|intangible]] [[personal property|property]] right recognised and protected by the law, that has no existence apart from the recognition given by the law, and that confers no present possession of a [[tangible property|tangible]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]] [1998] AC 214&lt;/ref&gt; Since incorporeal assets such as claims for repayment of debts, or assigned rights in contracts cannot be subject to possession, they cannot be categorised as ''choses in possession''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]] [1998] AC 214, Brice v Bannister (1878) 3 QBD 569 at 573, (Lord Coleridge)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In certain circumstances, the ''chose in action'' creates a separate proprietary right, independent from the property in which it may reference.&lt;ref&gt;Re BCCI (No 8), Re Adams [2004] EWHC 2379&lt;/ref&gt; This new property can be subject to charges or can be assigned. For example, a right to enforce and receive payment for a [[debt]], obtain money by way of [[damages]] for breach of [[contract]], or receive recompense for a wrong is a chose in action. Two consequences result from this, firstly, they are claims which cannot be executed by the chose-holder without the enforcement of legal proceedings. Second, these examples may be themselves [[Assignment (law)|assigned]], [[novation|novated]], or otherwise used by the chose-holder.&lt;ref&gt;M A Clarke, R J A Hooley, R J C Munday, L S Sealy, A M Tettenborn, P G Turner ''Commercial Law: Text, Cases and Materials' "Chapter 22: Assignment of Choses in Action", 5th Edition (2017) OUP, 859&lt;/ref&gt; If the economic value of the asset is the right to sue. Historically, documents which represented a title to a ''chose in action'' of a particular kind, such as [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s or other [[intangible property|documentary intangibles]] were themselves ''chose in possession'' because, similar to [[promissory notes]] they were [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable]] and thus could be physically seised. That is to say, they were transferred solely by delivery of the document themselves. Today, most bonds and other financial instruments have been [[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialised]] and are issued as a single [[Central securities depository|global note]]. The consequence of this is that most financial instruments are now ''choses in action''held by the beneficial party against the broker holding assets in a securities depository such [[CREST (securities depository)|CREST]], where investors own interlocking interests in trusts, rather than the actual issued note.&lt;ref&gt;Goode and Gullifer Legal Problems of Credit and Security, 6th Edition, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The development of dematerialised securities brings some objects which are termed as ''chose in action'' today full circle, such as bonds or bill of lading which the court first developed as ''choses in action'', and which, without the use of a negotiable instrument no longer operate as ''choses in possession''. Currently, claims which are treated as being "locked up" inside the paper includes [[pledge (law)|pledge]], [[Negotiable instrument|negotiables]], and custodial [[bailment]].
 
''Choses in Action'' are particularly crucial to the assignment of interests in law, and thus play a crucial role in the operation and coordination of the financial markets. Certain rights, such as a claim to rescission of a mortgage is a right of action, but ''not'' a ''chose in action'' or part of one that can be assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 ALL ER 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the category is often broadly construed, there have been numerous attempts to expand the category to allow new intangible assets to fall within the chose in action.

===Effect of Fusing of Chancery and Common Law===
The chose can either be legal or equitable. Prior to the [[Judicature Acts]], which fused the courts of Equity and the Common law into a single jurisdiction, where the chose could be recovered only by an action at law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or [[tort]]), it was termed a legal chose in action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a legacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable chose in action. Before the Judicature Acts, a legal chose in action was not assignable, i.e., the [[assignee]] could not [[lawsuit|sue]] at law in his own name. To this rule there were two exceptions:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}
# the crown had always been able to assign choses in action that are certain, such as an ascertained debt, but not those that are uncertain; and
# assignments valid by operation of law, e.g., on [[marriage]], [[death]], or [[bankruptcy]]. On the other hand, however, by the [[law merchant]], which is part of the law of England, and which disregards the rules of [[common law]], [[bills of exchange]] were freely assignable.
Prior to this point, the courts of equity could not enforce a legal chose in action and vice versa. The consequence was that, with these and certain [[statutory]] exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned chose in action must have been brought at law in the name of the [[assignor]], though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-[[plaintiff]] or as [[defendant]]. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The [[Judicature Act of 1873]], s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal ''chose in action'' could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}  This was later updated by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] s136 which outlined that assignment must be&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In writing
* Is absolute, and not by charge only 
* and written notice has been given to the obligor. 
These requirements are significant because without notice, it prevents the assignee from suing on the debt. Until the debtor has given notice, [[set-off (law)|set-off]]s continue to arise between the assignor and the debtor, the debtor does not know to pay anyone other than the debtor; and the assignee may lose priority to subsequent assignees who do provide notice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dearle v Hall]] (1828) 3 Russ 1&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between present and future choses in action has been likened to the difference between a tree and its fruit.

==Chose in possession==
A ''chose in possession''' is a phrase referring to a bundle of rights and remedies, (which in England are inextricably linked),&lt;ref&gt;See Browne-Wilkinson VC in Spain v Christie, Manson, &amp; Woods [1986] 3 All ER 28 at 35&lt;/ref&gt; of an object of [[tangible]] [[personal property]] that can be physically possessed by the owner and can be transferred by delivery. Relation, or rather, capacity of control and apparent dominion is required as the foundation of the alleged ''chose in possession''. This is impossible with incorporeal rights. Possession and possession-based techniques are of little relevance to modern financial markets, but still play a substantial role in commercial and retail lending.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;D Wines International (in liquidation) [2014] EWCA Civ 215&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore a ''chose in possession'' denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or constructive enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the [[proprietor]] or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist and at other times not subsist", as in the case of animals ''[[ferae naturae]]'' ("of a [[feral]] nature", or wild). A chose in possession is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|Married Women's Property Act]] of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=271}}

In practice, there is little difference between the utility of a chose in possession and a chose in action, outside of [[insolvency]]. However, a Chose in possession is particularly important in view of [[insolvency]] as the possessory right of the asset allows for enforcement of security irrespective of the solvency of the company. Where an asset is (1) unique and cannot be replicated, such as shares in a company amounting to board control; (2) a proprietary interest wherein account of profits of the original owed item; or (3) procedural remedies; exist, a chose in possession will be crucial in enforcement.

The '''Civil Rights Act of 1964''' ({{USStatute|88|352|78|241|1964|07|02}}) is a landmark [[civil rights]] and [[US labor law|U.S. labor law]] in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Susan (2005), ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: Landmark Antidiscrimination Legislation'', The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|1-4042-0455-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript "Transcript of Civil Rights Act (1964)"]. Retrieved July 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, [[racial segregation]] in schools, employment, and [[public accommodations]].

Powers given to enforce the act were initially weak, but were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the [[United States Constitution]], principally its power to regulate [[interstate commerce]] under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] of the laws under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and its duty to protect voting rights under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]].

The legislation had been proposed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in June 1963, but opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]] in November 1963, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed the bill forward, which in its final form was passed in the U.S. Congress by a [[United States Senate|Senate]] vote of 73–27 and [[United States House of Representatives|House]] vote of 289–126. The Act was signed into law by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the [[White House]].

==Origins==
[[File:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|left|John F. Kennedy addresses the nation about civil rights on June 11, 1963]]

The bill was called for by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in his [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] of June 11, 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-045-005.aspx|title=Radio and television address on civil rights, 11 June 1963|publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|date=1963-06-11 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he asked for legislation "giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments"—as well as "greater protection for the right to vote". Kennedy delivered this speech in the aftermath of the [[Birmingham campaign]] and the growing number of demonstrations and protests throughout the southern United States. Kennedy was moved to action following the elevated racial tensions and wave of black riots in the spring 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_104.html|title=''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years'', episode 4 "No Easy Walk (1961–1963)"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emulating the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. However, it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders, including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64h Civil Rights Act Passes in the House] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
===House of Representatives===
[[File:Civilrightsact1964.jpg|thumb|First page of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]

On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Representatives drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was "imperative".&lt;ref&gt;Loevy, Robert (1997), ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Passage of the Law that Ended Racial Segregation'', State University of New York Press, p. 171. {{ISBN|0-7914-3362-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golway, Terry and Krantz, Les (2010), ''JFK: Day by Day'', Running Press, p. 284. {{ISBN|978-0-7624-3742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president's bill went first to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Emanuel Celler]], a Democrat from [[New York (state)|New York]]. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly-owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial "Title III" that had been removed from the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957 Act]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960 Act]]. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.

Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Richard (1993), ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'', pp. 628–631&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963 and referred to the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], whose chairman, [[Howard W. Smith]], a Democrat and staunch segregationist from [[Virginia]], indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.

===Johnson's appeal to Congress===
The [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, [[Lyndon Johnson]], made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the [[bully pulpit]] he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/12295509434394-3/|title=Transition to Johnson|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a [[discharge petition|petition to discharge]] the bill from the Rules Committee; it required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many Representatives who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.

After the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.

===Lobbying efforts===
Lobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] and [[Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.|Clarence Mitchell]], Sr. of the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civilrights.org/history-leadership-conference-civil-human-rights-leadership-conference-education-fund/|title=History of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; The Leadership Conference Education Fund – The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage in the Senate===

Both had come to hear the Senate debate on the bill.

Johnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that the bill would be quickly considered by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Normally, the bill would have been referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by Senator [[James O. Eastland]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Mississippi]]. Given Eastland's firm opposition, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate.

When the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the "Southern Bloc" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA) launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirksencenter.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64_contents.htm#senate |title=A Case History: The 1964 Civil Rights Act |publisher=The Dirksen Congressional Center |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Russell: "We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-civil-rights-quotes-20140629-story.html |title=The Civil Rights Act: What JFK, LBJ, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X had to say |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyndon  Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, 2 July, 1964.jpg|thumb|[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among the guests behind him is [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]]]

Strong opposition to the bill also came from Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] &lt;!-- Thurmond was a Democrat at the time --&gt;(D-SC): "This so-called Civil Rights Proposals, which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] proposals and actions of the [[Radical Republicans|radical Republican]] Congress."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/Civil-Rights-Bill/12295509434394-8/ 1963 Year In Review – Part 1 – Civil Rights Bill] United Press International, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

After 54 days of filibuster, Senators [[Hubert Humphrey]] (D-MN), [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT), [[Everett Dirksen]] (R-IL), and [[Thomas Kuchel]] (R-CA),  introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would attract enough Republican swing votes in addition to the core liberal Democrats behind the legislation to end the filibuster. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64s Civil Rights Act – Battle in the Senate] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-W.Va.) completed a filibustering address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to [[cloture]] for any measure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Civil_Rights_Filibuster_Ended.htm Civil Rights Filibuster Ended] – United States Senate&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, the substitute (compromise) bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73–27, and quickly passed through the House–Senate [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]], which adopted the Senate version of the bill. The conference bill was passed by both houses of Congress, and was signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek, Robert (2004), ''Lyndon B.

==Women's rights==
[[File:CivilRightsAct1964-HouseRollCall-Sex-Amendment.jpg|thumb|Engrossing copy of H.R. 7152, which added sex to the categories of persons against whom the bill prohibited discrimination, as passed by the House of Representatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6037151|title=Excerpt of the Engrossing Copy of H.R. 7152, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Showing Amendments|first=|last=U.S. House of Representatives. Office of the Clerk of the House. 4/1/1789-|date=25 September 1964|publisher=|via=US National Archives Research Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Just one year earlier, the same Congress had passed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which prohibited wage differentials based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate Smith's motivation, whether it was a [[Wrecking amendment|cynical attempt to defeat the bill]] by someone opposed to civil rights both for blacks and women, or an attempt to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, Jo. "How 'Sex' Got Into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy," ''Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice'', Vol. 9, No. 2, March 1991, pp 163–184. [http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Rosalind (2008), ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'', pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger, Ted and Fisher, Allen, [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/civil-rights-act-2.html LBJ Champions the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Part 2], Prologue Magazine, The National Archives, Summer 2004, Vol. 36, No. 2 ("Certainly Smith hoped that such a divisive issue would torpedo the civil rights bill, if not in the House, then in the Senate.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages= 245–246, 249|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith expected that Republicans, who had included [[women's rights|equal rights for women]] in their party's platform since 1944,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25835 The American Presidency Project]&lt;/ref&gt; would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions. Representative [[Carl Elliott]] of Alabama later claimed, "Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights...he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dierenfield | first1 = Bruce J | year = 1981 | title = Conservative Outrage: the Defeat in 1966 of Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia | url = | journal = Virginia Magazine of History and Biography | volume = 89 | issue = 2| page = 194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' records that Smith was greeted by laughter when he introduced the amendment.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;Gold, Michael Evan. ''A Tale of Two Amendments: The Reasons Congress Added Sex to Title VII and Their Implication for the Issue of Comparable Worth.'' Faculty Publications — Collective Bargaining, Labor Law, and Labor History. Cornell, 1981 [http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=cbpubs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith asserted that he was not joking; he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. [[Martha Griffiths]],&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lynne (2001), ''Freedom's Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.&lt;ref name="Gold"/&gt; For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. He for decades had been close to the [[National Woman's Party]] and its leader [[Alice Paul]], who was also the leader in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, the author of the first Equal Rights Amendment, and a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Rosalind (2008), ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'', p. 187 notes that Smith had been working for years with two Virginia feminists on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws "protecting" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia (1989), ''On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice [[William Rehnquist]] explained in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', "The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives... the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;(477 U.S. 57, 63–64)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desegregation==
One of the most damaging arguments by the bill's opponents was that once passed, the bill would require [[desegregation busing in the United States|forced busing]] to achieve certain [[racial quotas]] in schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 251"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|page= |pages= 251–252|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the bill, such as [[Emanuel Celler]] and [[Jacob Javits]], said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] (D-MN) wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 251"/&gt; Humphrey said "if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race."&lt;ref name="'70s 251"/&gt; While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes "would be making a fool of himself," two years later the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 251"/&gt;

==Political repercussions==
{{see also|Realigning election}}
[[File:LBJ Civil Rights Act crowd.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|President Johnson speaks to a television camera at the signing of the Civil Rights Act]]

The bill divided and engendered a long-term change in the demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide [[Ted Sorensen]] that "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Kotz, Nick (2005), ''Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws that Changed America'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election".&lt;ref&gt;Branch, Taylor (1998), ''Pillar of Fire'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, however, went on to win the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]] by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brownstein |first=Ronald |title=For GOP, A Southern Exposure |date=May 23, 2009 |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20090523_2195.php |work=[[National Journal]]|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions. Though he opposed forced segregation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/conservatism-phoenix#axzz2crNUSaxp|title=Conservatism as Phoenix|author=Robert Sherrill|date=25 May 2001|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona voted against the bill, remarking, "You can't legislate morality." Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the [[24th Amendment]] outlawing the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]. He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which in his opinion violated individual liberty and [[states' rights]]. Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 83-day filibuster, including Senators [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] (D-TN) and [[J. William Fulbright]] (D-AR), as well as Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-WV), who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight.

==Major features==
(The full text of the Act is available [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript online].)

===Title I===
Barred unequal application of voter registration requirements.

Title I did not eliminate [[literacy test]]s, which were one of the main methods used to exclude Black voters, other racial minorities, and poor Whites in the South, nor did it address economic retaliation, police repression, or physical violence against nonwhite voters. While the Act did require that voting rules and procedures be applied equally to all races, it did not abolish the concept of voter "qualification", that is to say, it accepted the idea that citizens do not have an automatic right to vote but rather might have to meet some standard beyond citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964vreffect Voting Rights] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |work=CongressLink |publisher=The Dirksen Congressional Center |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[Voting Rights Act]], enacted one year later in 1965, that directly addressed and eliminated most voting qualifications beyond citizenship.

===Title II===
Outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; exempted private clubs without defining the term "private".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.wfu.edu/zulick/341/civilrightsact1964.html | title =Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title II | publisher =[[Wake Forest University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title III===
Prohibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, color, religion, or national origin.

===Title IV===
Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.

===Title V===
Expanded the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|Civil Rights Commission]] established by the earlier [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] with additional powers, rules and procedures.

===Title VI===
Prevents discrimination by programs and activities that receive federal funds. If an recipient of federal funds is found in violation of Title VI, that recipient may lose its federal funding.

'''General'''

This title declares it to be the policy of the United States that discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin shall not occur in connection with programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and authorizes and directs the appropriate Federal departments and agencies to take action to carry out this policy. This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs.
Section 601{{spaced ndash}}This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

Section 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.

Section 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act ({{usc|5|1009}}). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action "committed to agency discretion," which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.

===Title VII===
{{see also|United States labor law|Employment discrimination law in the United States}}
Title VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of [[title 42 of the United States Code]], prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see {{usc|42|2000e-2}}&lt;ref name = "Finduslaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 – CRA – Title VII – Equal Employment Opportunities – 42 US Code Chapter 21 |publisher=finduslaw |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Title VII applies to and covers an employer "who has fifteen (15) or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year" as written in the Definitions section under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e 42 U.S.C. §2000e(b)]. Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company]]'', 791 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (''See'' [[Pregnancy Discrimination#Pregnancy Discrimination Act|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]).

In very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the [[bona fide occupational qualifications]] defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the "essence" or "central mission of the employer's business", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (''[[United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|499|187|1991}} 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (''[[Dothard v. Rawlinson]]'', {{ussc|433|321|1977}} 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (''[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School — Bishop Estate]]'', 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).

Title VII allows for any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the "unlawful employment practice" for any person involved with the [[Communist Party of the United States]] or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the [[Subversive Activities Control Act]] of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act/images/act-06.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

There are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:
* Federal government; (Comment: The proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to certain federal government offices under [http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21#17 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-16])
* Federally recognized Native American tribes
* Religious groups performing work connected to the group's activities, including associated education institutions;
* Bona fide nonprofit private membership organizations.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) as well as certain [[state fair employment practices agencies]] (FEPAs) enforce Title VII (see {{usc|42|2000e-4}}&lt;ref name = "Finduslaw"/&gt;). The EEOC and state FEPAs investigate, mediate, and may file lawsuits on behalf of employees. Where a state law is contradicted by a federal law, it is overridden.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. (1999) "Chapter 2: Laws and Regulations with Implications for Assessments". [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych304-3.2.1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Every state, except Arkansas and Mississippi, maintains a state FEPA (see EEOC and state FEPA [http://www.eeocoffice.com directory ]). Title VII also provides that an individual can bring a private lawsuit. An individual must file a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of learning of the discrimination or the individual may lose the right to file a lawsuit. Title VII only applies to employers who employ 15 or more employees for 20 or more weeks in the current or preceding calendar year ({{usc|42|2000e(b)}}).

====Precedents and history====
In the early 1980s, the EEOC and some federal courts began holding that [[sexual harassment]] is also prohibited under the Act. In 1986, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', {{ussc|477|57|1986}}, that sexual harassment is sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. This case filed by plaintiff Mechelle Vinson was the first in the history of the court to recognize sexual harassment as actionable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53284947|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=0700613234|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following 1986, court cases in which the plaintiff suffers no economic loss can potentially argue for a violation of Title VII if the discrimination resulted in a hostile work environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Same-sex [[sexual harassment]] has also been held in a unanimous decision written by [[Justice Scalia]] to be prohibited by Title VII (''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|523|75|1998}}, 118 S.Ct. 998).

In 2012, the EEOC ruled that employment discrimination on the basis of [[gender identity]] or [[transgender]] status is prohibited under Title VII. The decision held that discrimination on the basis of gender identity qualified as discrimination on the basis of sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, discomfort with the fact of an individual's transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt ''Macy v.

On December 15, 2014, under a memorandum issued by [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]], the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DoJ) took a position that aligned with the EEOC, namely the prohibition of sex discrimination under Title VII encompassed the prohibition of discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status. DoJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by federal transgender employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/justice-department-announces-reversal-on-litigating-transgen |title=Justice Department Will Now Support Transgender Discrimination Claims In Litigation |author=Geidner, Chris |date=18 December 2014 |newspaper=BuzzFeed News |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] issued a directive that withdrew the Holder memorandum.&lt;ref name=BF-171005&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/jeff-sessions-just-reversed-a-policy-that-protects |title=Jeff Sessions Just Reversed A Policy That Protects Transgender Workers From Discrimination |author=Holden, Dominic |date=5 October 2017 |newspaper=BuzzFeed News |accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a copy of the directive reviewed by ''BuzzFeed News'', Sessions stated that Title VII should be narrowly interpreted to cover discrimination between "men and women".  Attorney General Session stated as a matter of law, "Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on gender identity per se."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goico|first1=Allison L.|last2=Geller|first2=Hayley|title=US Attorney General Jefferson Sessions Issues New Guidance On Transgender Employees|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-attorney-general-jefferson-sessions-issues-new-guidance-transgender-employees|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=The [[National Law Review]]|publisher=Dinsmore &amp; Shohl LLP|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devin O'Malley, speaking on behalf of the DoJ, stated "the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle [that the Department of Justice cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided], which necessitated today's action."  Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DoJ, rejected that argument, saying "[T]his memo is not actually a reflection of the law as it is — it's a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were" and "The Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court."&lt;ref name=BF-171005 /&gt;

On December 11, 2017, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in ''Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital'', in which a lower court ruled against the plaintiff, who had argued Title VII protections applied to sexual orientation. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stated in its earlier ruling that only the Supreme Court could determine if Title VII applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-lgbt/u-s-high-court-turns-away-dispute-over-gay-worker-protections-idUSKBN1E51OT |title=U.S. high court turns away dispute over gay worker protections |author=Chung, Andrew |date=11 December 2017 |publisher=Reuters |agency=Reuters |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title VIII===
Required compilation of voter-registration and voting data in geographic areas specified by the Commission on Civil Rights.

===Title IX===

Title IX made it easier to move civil rights cases from state courts to federal court. This was of crucial importance to civil rights activists{{who|date=December 2015}} who contended that they could not get fair trials in state courts.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should not be confused with [[Title IX|Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972]], which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.

===Title X===
Established the [[Community Relations Service]], tasked with assisting in community disputes involving claims of discrimination.

===Title XI===
Title XI gives a defendant accused of certain categories of criminal contempt in a matter arising under title II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII of the Act the right to a jury trial. If convicted, the defendant can be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months.

==Continued resistance==

There were white business owners who claimed that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to ban segregation in public accommodations. For example, Moreton Rolleston, the owner of a motel in Atlanta, Georgia, said he should not be forced to serve black travelers, saying, "the fundamental question [...] is whether or not Congress has the power to take away the liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customers".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Travelers, Strangers, and Jim Crow: Law, Public Accommodations, and Civil Rights in America|first=A.K.|last=Sandoval-Strausz|work=Law and History Review|volume=23|issue=1|pages=53–94|date=Spring 2005|doi=10.1017/s0738248000000055|jstor=30042844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolleston claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a breach of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and also violated the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]] Amendments by depriving him of "liberty and property without due process".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In ''[[Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States]]'' (1964), the Supreme Court held that Congress drew its authority from the Constitution's Commerce Clause, rejecting Rolleston's claims.

Resistance to the public accommodation clause continued for years on the ground, especially in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/05/1964-civil-rights-battles/100744/|title=1964: Civil Rights Battles|author=Alan Taylor|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When local college students in Orangeburg, South Carolina attempted to desegregate a bowling alley in 1968, they were violently attacked, leading to rioting and what became known as the "[[Orangeburg massacre]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJbiA_sBjzYC&amp;dq=public%20accommodation%20segregation,%20trends&amp;q=cambridge#v=snippet&amp;q=cambridge|title=Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle over Segregated Recreation in America|first=Victoria W.|last=Wolcott|date=16 August 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance by school boards continued into the next decade, with the most significant declines in black-white school segregation only occurring at the end of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s in the aftermath of the ''[[Green v. County School Board of New Kent County]]'' (1968) court decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/60-years-after-brown-trends-and-consequences-school-segregation Sean F. Reardon, Ann Owens, "60 Years After Brown: Trends and Consequences of School Segregation" ''Annual Review of Sociology'' Vol. 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments==
Between 1965 and 1972, Title VII lacked any strong enforcement provisions. Instead, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission was authorized only to investigate external claims of discrimination. The EEOC could then refer cases to the Justice Department for litigation if reasonable cause was found. The EEOC documented the nature and magnitude of discriminatory employment practices, the first study of this kind done.

In 1972, Congress passed the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972|Equal Employment Opportunity Act]]. The Act amended Title VII and gave EEOC authority to initiate its own enforcement litigation. The EEOC now played a major role in guiding judicial interpretations of civil rights legislation. The commission was also permitted for the first time to define "discrimination," a term excluded from the 1964 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_employment_opportunity_commission|title=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent court rulings==
The Constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was, at the time, in some dispute as it applied to the private sector. In the landmark ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' the United States Supreme Court had ruled, in 1883, that Congress did not have the power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] of much of its ability to protect civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/recon/civilrightsact.html "The Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875"], www.gmu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by members of the United States Supreme Court to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality.

In the 1930s, during the New Deal, the majority of the Supreme Court justices gradually shifted their legal theory to allow for greater government regulation of the private sector under the commerce clause, thus paving the way for the Federal government to enact civil rights laws prohibiting both public and private sector discrimination on the basis of the commerce clause.

After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, the Supreme Court upheld the law's application to the private sector, on the grounds that Congress has the power to regulate commerce between the States. The landmark case ''[[Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States]]'' established the constitutionality of the law, but it did not settle all of the legal questions surrounding the law.

In ''[[Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp.]]'', a 1971 Supreme Court case regarding the gender provisions of the Act, the Court ruled that a company could not discriminate against a potential female employee because she had a preschool-age child unless they did the same with potential male employees.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; A federal court overruled an [[Ohio]] state law that barred women from obtaining jobs which required the ability to lift 25 pounds and required women to take lunch breaks when men were not required to.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; In ''[[Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations]]'', the United States Supreme Court decided that printing separate job listings for men and women was illegal, which ended that practice among the country's newspapers. The [[United States Civil Service Commission]] ended the practice among federal jobs which designated them "women only" or "men only."&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

In 1974, the Supreme Court also ruled that the [[San Francisco]] school district was violating non-English speaking students' rights under the 1964 act by placing them in regular classes rather than providing some sort of accommodation for them.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|page= 270|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, a federal civil rights agency warned a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] school that its end-of-year father-son and mother-daughter baseball games were illegal according to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; President [[Gerald Ford]] intervened, and the games were allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

In 1977, the Supreme Court struck down state minimum height requirements for police officers as violating the Act; women usually could not meet these requirements.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

On April 4, 2017, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] in Chicago, sitting ''[[en banc]]'', ruled that Title VII of the Act forbids discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] by a vote of 8–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frankel|first1=Alison|title=The shrewdness of Judge Wood's opinion in LGBT workplace bias case|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/otc-lgbt-idUSKBN1772MI|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briscoe|first1=Tony|title=Court: Civil Rights Act covers LGBT workplace bias|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-law-covers-lgbt-workplace-bias-20170404-story.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the prior month, panels of both the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] in Atlanta and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in New York City had reached the [[circuit split|opposite conclusion]], finding that Title VII sex discrimination does not include claims based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haag|first1=Matthew|last2=Chokshi|first2=Niraj|title=Civil Rights Act Protects Gay Workers, Court Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/civil-rights-act-gay-workers-appeals-court.html|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 April 2017|page=A17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Despite its lack of influence during its time, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had considerable impact on later civil rights legislation in the United States. It paved the way for future legislation that was not limited to African American civil rights. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]—which has been called "the most important piece of federal legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964"—was influenced both by the structure and substance of the previous Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act was arguably of equal importance, and "draws substantially from the structure of that landmark legislation [Civil Rights Act of 1964]". The Americans with Disabilities Act paralleled its landmark predecessor structurally, drawing upon many of the same titles and statutes. For example, "Title I of the ADA, which bans employment discrimination by private employers on the basis of disability, parallels Title VII of the Act". Similarly, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, "which proscribes discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations, tracks Title II of the 1964 Act while expanding upon the list of public accommodations covered." The Americans with Disabilities Act extended "the principle of nondiscrimination to people with disabilities",&lt;ref&gt;Dinerstein, Robert D. (). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27880436 ''The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990: Progeny of the Civil Rights Act of 1964'']. [[American Bar Association]]. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; an idea unsought in the United States before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act also influenced later civil rights legislation, such as the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], aiding not only African Americans, but also women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">The '''commanding heights of the economy''' refers to existing private industry essential to the economy like public utilities, natural resources, heavy industry and transport as well as control over foreign and domestic trade. This phrase emerged from a branch of modern political philosophy concerned with organizing society and can be traced back to [[Karl Marx]]'s idea on socialism, which stresses the commanding heights and advocates for government control of it. This should not be confused with complete socialism or communism.

According to [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], a Bolshevik economist, control over the "commanding heights of the economy" would ensure "[[primitive socialist accumulation]]".{{sfn|Bonner|2013|p=86}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], the leader who along with [[Chen Yun]] introduced the [[Chinese economic reforms]], was inspired by this concept. The [[Communist Party of China]] still believes to this day that the state needs to control the economy's commanding heights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Politics of Hungary}}
The '''Constitutional Court of Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Magyarország Alkotmánybírósága}}) is a special court of [[Hungary]], making [[judicial review]] of the acts of the Parliament of Hungary. The official seat of the Constitutional Court is [[Budapest]]. Until 2012 the seat was [[Esztergom]].

The Constitutional Court is composed of 15 judges since September 1, 2011 (previously, the Court was composed of 11 judges). The members then elect the President of the Court from among its members in a secret ballot. One or two Vice-Presidents, appointed by the President of the Court, stand in for the President in the event of his absence for any reason. The constitutional court passes on the [[constitutionality]] of laws, and there is no right of [[appeal]] on these decisions. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes, and the protection of constitutional order and [[fundamental rights]] guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system.

==Establishment==
On October 19, 1989 the [[Hungarian Parliament]] passed a resolution on the establishment of the [[Constitutional Court]]. Its organisation and authority, however, had been determined earlier in the framework of the trilateral political roundtable negotiations preparing the [[democracy|democratic]] transformation of the political system.
The basic provisions on the Constitutional Court were laid down in October 1989 by Parliament by way of amending the Constitution (Article 32/A). The court was set up in order to promote the establishment of a state governed by the rule of law as well as the protection of constitutional order and fundamental rights. Act XXXII of 1989 on the Constitutional Court was passed by Parliament on 19 October 1989, and the Constitutional Court started its work on 1 January 1990.

==Changes made by the 2011 Constitution==

[http://www.euractiv.com/sites/all/euractiv/files/CONSTITUTION_in_English__DRAFT.pdf According to Draft from 25. April 2011].

The Constitutional Court (Article 24.)

(1) The Constitutional Court shall be the main authority for constitutional protection.

(2) The Constitutional Court shall

a) review the constitutionality of laws adopted, but not yet published,

b) review at the request of a judge the constitutionality of legislation
to be applied in an individual case,

c) on the basis of a constitutional complaint, review the
constitutionality of legislation or a judicial decision applied in an individual case,

d) upon  the  initiative of  the Government or one quarter of  the
Members of Parliament  review  the constitutionality of laws,

e) review the conflict of legislation with international treaties, and

f) perform other duties and authorities defined in the Constitution and in super majority laws.

(3) Acting pursuant  to  its  jurisdiction  in  its  competence under  section b)-d)  of paragraph  (2),  the Constitutional Court will  annul  laws  and  other  legal  norms,  judicial  decisions  that  it  finds  to  be unconstitutional, pursuant  to  its  jurisdiction under  section e) of paragraph  (2) annul  laws or  legal norms deemed to be in conflict with international treaties and will also rule on other issues set forth in super majority laws.

(4)  Acting pursuant to its jurisdiction under section c)-d) of paragraph (2), the Constitutional Court shall  review  the  constitutionality  of  laws  on  the  State Budget  and  its  implementation,  on  central taxes, fees and customs duties, pension and health care contributions, as well as on  the content of the statues concerning uniform requirements on local taxes only if the petition refers exclusively to the right to life and human dignity, the right to the protection of personal data, the right to freedom of  thought,  conscience  and  religion  or  the  right  connected  to  the  Hungarian   citizenship,  if  the conditions defined for adopting and promulgating the law have not been met.

(5) The  Constitutional Court is a body of 15 members, elected  by Parliament for a period of twelve years by a two-third majority of the Members of Parliament. The Parliament will elect with a  two-third majority of  the Members of Parliament a President, with a mandate that lasts until the term of the judge’s mandate. Members of the Constitutional Court may not be members of a political party and may not engage in any political activities.

==Members==
The Hungarian Constitution declares that members of the Constitutional Court shall be elected by [[Parliament]]. It also determines the rules of such elections. Impartiality is guaranteed by having proposed members of the Constitutional Court to be put forward by a nominating committee consisting of one member each from the factions of parties represented in Parliament and shall be elected by a two-thirds majority of all Members of Parliament. Hungarian law provides that only [[jurists]] of outstanding theoretical knowledge or having at least twenty years of [[legal]] practice may be elected members of the Constitutional Court. Membership is for a term of nine years and members may be re-elected once. The office of judges of the Constitutional Court comes to an end when they reach the age of 70 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">'''Disciplinary institutions''' ([[French language|French]]: ''institution disciplinaire'') is a [[concept]] proposed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975).  [[School]], [[prison]], [[barracks]], or the [[hospital]] are examples of historical disciplinary [[institution]]s, all created in their modern form in the 19th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4780">The situation of additional [[tax]]es or tax savings resulting from selling the last item of its class in an [[inventory]] due to difference between its [[depreciation|undepreciated]] [[capital cost]] (UCC) and its [[salvage value]] (SV).&lt;ref&gt;Chan S. Park et al., ''Contemporary Engineering Economics (Second Canadian Edition)'', Addison Wesley Longman, 2001. {{ISBN|0-201-61390-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

"Disposal tax effect" is a [[finance]] term originating from [[Engineering Economics]]. 

In the case of &lt;math&gt;SV &gt; UCC&lt;/math&gt;, then there has been a relative gain in the sale of the item, which gets taxed. These gains are known as "recaptured [[depreciation]]" or "recaptured CCA". 

When &lt;math&gt;SV &lt; UCC&lt;/math&gt;, then there has been a loss, which results in tax savings.

The Central collection agency (CCA) which uses a method of depreciation and the undepreciated value which is the undepreciated capital cost. As CCA uses a declining balance it makes the disposal of assets complicated. The disposal tax effect (DTE) takes into account that the salvage value can cause a gain or a loss.

The disposal tax effect formula: DTE = (BookValue – SalvageValue)xTR.

The relevant book value in this case is determining the tax gain or loss of the asset. The tax basis then is the difference between the original cost and any accumulated depreciation.

The disposal tax effect (DTE) is also calculated by getting the difference between the UCC cost and the salvage value then multiplying the it by the tax rate (TR).[1]

For businesses the capital gain is from the appreciation value of the asset depending at which tax rate (TR) or tax law that will be applied at the time of the sale. The recapture of depreciation is calculated by how much the company has over-depreciated the asset in its life. The recapture allocation is taxed at ordinary rates as excess depreciation over the years essentially reduced taxable income. The basis value is the price of the fixed asset.

Tax on recapture is calculated by = (BookValue – BasisValue) x TR Capital gains tax = (BasisValue – Salvage Value) x TR/2 Disposal tax effect (DTE) = (tax on recapture + Capital gains tax)

If a company sells an asset for less than the tax basis this causes a loss in capital. This means that the assets value has decreased more than its depreciation value for tax. When capital loss occurs then a special tax rate is given. The benefit of this is that the sale of an asset is the amount by which the taxes are reduced (tax shield).

When there are capital gains and losses in the same year, the two values are then combined so that capital loss reduces and the taxes are paid on the capital gains.

In the case of an excess in capital losses the remaining capital loss is used to reduce the ordinary capital income. The disposal tax effect (DTE) can be negative (when our salvage value is greater than our book value) which means that the tax effect increases taxes. Disposal tax effect (DTE) can also be negative if our asset is sold for a price greater than its purchase price but it is also equal to sum of the two tax effects.

If an asset has been fully depreciated (when the aggregate tax deductions are equal to the original cost of the asset) there are no additional tax implications placed on the asset.

Advantages An advantage of having a loss from sale on an asset is the amount of the reduction on taxes after. The reduction in taxable income is known as a tax shield. [2]

In Ireland at least 50% of the revenue which disposal tax brings in to the government it is poured back into biological treatment of bio-waste and mechanical-biological treatment of waste. This reduces organic content of waste which goes into landfills or for incineration. This is highly beneficial for the environment.

While in Catalan it discourages landfills and incineration in accordance and reinforcement of the European waste management it penalizes them economically.

Essentially the making of disposal can be more expensive but on the other hand it creates revenue for local authorities by diversified refunds for separate collection.

Disposal of new asset If a company sells an asset for more than what it is worth then the gain is broken into two parts. Capital gain (sales price – original price) and recapture depreciation which is (original cost – tax basis). the benefit is the increased capital from appreciation of the asset and will be taxed at a new special rate depending on the tax law at the time of sale.

An '''"elective dictatorship"''' (also called '''executive dominance''' in [[political science]]) is a phrase popularised by the former [[Lord Chancellor]] of the United Kingdom, [[Quintin Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]], in a Richard Dimbleby Lecture at the BBC in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elective dictatorship|journal=The Listener|date=21 October 1976|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=496–500|id= |url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is found a century earlier, in describing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s doctrines,&lt;ref&gt;"The Rule of the Monk", ''The Times'', 5 March 1570, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was used by Hailsham (then known as Quintin Hogg) in lectures in 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Hogg's way to end the tyranny of Whitehall", ''The Times'', 12 October 1968, p. 10; and "Hogg fears for British constitution", ''The Times'', 16 April 1969, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the state in which [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is dominated by the government of the day. It refers to the fact that the legislative programme of Parliament is determined by the government, and government bills virtually always pass the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] because of the nature of the majoritarian [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system, which almost always produces strong government, in combination with the imposition of [[Whip (politics)|party discipline]] on the governing party's majority, which almost always ensures loyalty. In the absence of a codified constitution, this tendency toward executive dominance is compounded by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts]] and [[Salisbury Convention]] which circumscribe the [[House of Lords]] and their ability to block government initiatives.

==Constitutional background==
In the United Kingdom, ultimate legislative sovereignty resides in Parliament ([[Parliamentary sovereignty]]).  Parliament may pass any legislation on any subject it wishes.  Parliament operates without restraints such as, for instance, an obligation to legislate in accordance with fundamental constitutional rights.  The apparent exceptions to this rule are situations in which Parliament has chosen to limit itself as with the case of implementation of [[European Union]] law, where British courts can "[[Primacy of European Union law|disapply]]" UK legislation that is in conflict with EU law, but could withdraw such authority.

Parliament consists of the [[House of Lords]], the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Monarch]].  The customary common law rule is that in order for a bill to become an act of Parliament, it is necessary for it to be passed in both the Commons and the Lords. The bill will then go before the Monarch who has formal discretion whether to assent to the bill.  On receiving [[Royal Assent]], it will become an Act of Parliament and will be applied by the courts.

Such is the theory; in practice Royal Assent has become a formality, the monarch has not refused (or threatened to refuse) assent to a bill for some 300 years ([[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in [[Scottish Militia Bill 1708|1708]]).  Further, since 1911, the House of Lords has lost its position of equality with the Commons.  The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 reduced the power of the Lords from an absolute veto to a suspensive veto.  Once the same bill has been passed by the Commons and rejected by the Lords in two different sessions of Parliament, a third introduction of the bill will require only the consent of the Commons.  Such a bill will then go for Royal Assent and will become law, irrespective of the view of the Lords.  The Commons have, therefore, become the dominant component of Parliament - whoever controls the Commons controls Parliament, the primary legislative body of the land.

==Operation==
The party which commands a majority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] forms the government.  The governing party should consequently be able to pass any bill they wish through the Commons, provided that voting discipline is enforced amongst their [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs).  This is accomplished largely through the [[whip (politics)|whip system]].  The dominance of Parliament's legislative programme by the majority party is such that 95 per cent of bills are initiated by the government.  Rebellions, though not unknown, are rare.

The government, so long as they can keep their MPs on-side, stand an excellent chance of getting their legislation through the Commons.  The Lords may or may not also approve the legislation, however a combination of judicious compromise from the government, combined with the [[Salisbury Convention]] and the overarching threat of the Parliament Act means that most legislation also manages to get through the Lords.  Royal Assent then invariably follows.

Hailsham borrowed the expression "elective dictatorship" to describe this situation in which control of the Commons (and thus of Parliament) by the government is actually weak. His paper was published as a criticism of the Labour government of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. He saw these weak{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} governments as undemocratic, as despite their slim hold on the Commons they were able to pass a large number of their bills.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} He saw this as undemocratic as they did not reflect, as Hailsham saw it, wide enough support in the country. Many have interpreted Hailsham's criticism as being one against large majorities. In fact, he actually saw these as more democratic, as they had commanded more support at elections.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Proposals for reform==
A common proposal from reformers to reduce this executive dominance is to reduce the power of the majority party by adopting an electoral system based on [[proportional representation]] for the Commons.  The [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and [[Scottish National Party]] have consistently supported PR for the Commons, although without noticeable support from larger parties.

Some groups, such as [[Charter 88]], have argued that a codified, written constitution with appropriate checks and balances is also essential to solving the problem of executive dominance, although again without popular success.

The [[Power Inquiry]] in its 2006 report ''Power to the People'' made recommendations on how to deal with the [[democratic deficit]] inherent in the UK system of governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powerinquiry.org/ The Power Report: Power to the People]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front of the Supreme Court Building, including the West Pediment.]]
'''Equal justice under law''' is a phrase engraved on the front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington D.C.]]  It is also a societal ideal that has influenced [[Law of the United States|the American legal system]].

The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932.  It is based upon [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to [[ancient Greece]].

==Proposed by architects and approved by justices==
[[File:Van Devanter and Hughes.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Van Devanter (left) and Chief Justice Hughes]]This phrase was suggested in 1932 by the architectural firm that designed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Merlo.  ''Charles Evans Hughes'', Volume 2,  p. 689 (Columbia University Press 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] subsequently approved this inscription, as did the United States Supreme Court Building Commission which Hughes chaired (and on which Van Devanter served).&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|about/westpediment.pdf}}  West Pediment Information Sheet] via U.S. Supreme Court web site.  At that time, the other members of the Commission were Senator [[Henry W. Keyes]], Senator [[James A. Reed]], Representative [[Richard N. Elliott]], Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]], and Architect of the Capitol [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]].  See Liu, Honxia.  "[http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr40_3and4/CR40-3Liu.pdf Court Gazing: Features of Diversity in the Supreme Court Building]", ''Court Review'' (Winter 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by [[Cass Gilbert]], though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Priscilla.  "A Closer Look at the Bronze Courtroom Gates", ''Supreme Court Quarterly'', Vol. 9, p. 8 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]] who at that time held the position of [[Architect of the Capitol]], the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan "equal justice under law" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;McGurn, Barrett.  "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226111758/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/wp-content/themes/supremecourthistory/inc/schs_publications-1982.pdf Slogans to Fit the Occasion]", pp. 170-174, ''United States Supreme Court Yearbook'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]] objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word "equal" be removed because such a "qualification" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said.  Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to "place a strong emphasis upon impartiality".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous.&lt;ref name=Chen /&gt; According to law professor [[Jim Chen]], it is common for people to "suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico."&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, Jim.  "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=773025 Come Back to the Nickel and Five: Tracing the Warren Court's Pursuit of Equal Justice Under Law]", ''Washington and Lee Law Review'', Vol. 59, pp. 1305-1306 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say "equal law under justice", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Milner. ''Lying Down Together: Law, Metaphor and Theology'', p. 23 (Univ. of Wisconsin Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence==
The words "equal justice under law" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Cabraser&gt;Cabraser, Elizabeth.  "The Essentials of Democratic Mass Litigation", ''Columbia Journal of Law &amp; Social Problems'', Vol. 45, p. 499, 500 (Summer 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peccarelli, Anthony.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203153539/http://www.dcba.org/brief/marissue/2000/art10300.htm "The Meaning of Justice"], ''DuPage County Bar Association Brief'' (March 2000), via Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of ''Caldwell v. Texas'', Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]: "the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Caldwell v. Texas'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/137/692/case.html 137 U.S. 692] (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;  The last seven words are summarized by the inscription on the U.S. Supreme Court building.&lt;ref name=Cabraser /&gt;

[[File:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Chief Justice Fuller (front center) wrote for a unanimous Court in ''Caldwell''.  In this 1899 photo, Justice Harlan is seated to his right, and Justice Peckham is standing to Harlan's right.]]Later in 1891, Fuller's opinion for the Court in ''Leeper v. Texas'' again referred to "equal...justice under...law".&lt;ref name=Leeper&gt;''Leeper v. Texas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9HoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;ots=bAWQjPsX_q&amp;dq=%22borders+are+not+limited,+except+that+no+State+can+deprive+particular+%22&amp;output=html 139 U.S. 462] (1891).  Fuller's opinion in ''Leeper'' stated: "It must be regarded as settled that....by the Fourteenth Amendment the powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, except that no State can deprive particular persons, or classes of persons, of equal and impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied; and that due process is so secured by laws operating on all alike, and not subjecting the individual to the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice."&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Caldwell'', the ''Leeper'' opinion was unanimous, in contrast to the Fuller Court's major disagreements about equality issues in other cases such as ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aside from Fuller, the members of the Court in 1891 were as follows: [[Joseph P. Bradley]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], [[John Marshall Harlan]], [[Horace Gray]], [[Samuel Blatchford]], [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar]], [[David Josiah Brewer]], and [[Henry Billings Brown]].   The Fuller Court most famously disagreed about equality issues in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', 163 U.S. 537 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In both ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', murder [[indictment]]s were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged.  The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law.&lt;Ref&gt;Stuntz, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEHgwemq0nYC&amp;pg=PA124 The Collapse of American Criminal Justice]'', p. 124 (Harvard U. Press 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In a case nine years later (''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]''), the Court quoted the "equal...justice under...law" phrase that it had used in ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are "proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/176/581/case.html 176 U.S. 581] (1900); Justice Peckham wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Harlan was the sole dissenter.  Harlan argued that a person cannot be tried for an infamous crime by a jury of less than twelve persons, instead of the eight jurors allowed in Utah.  Many years later, in ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court held that six jurors are enough.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1908 case of ''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments:  "The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/208/481/case.html 208 U.S. 481] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Ughbanks''  was a [[burglary]] case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham|Rufus Peckham]], while Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] was the sole dissenter.  The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of ''[[Robinson v. California]]'').  

In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words "equal justice under law" with the Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, in the 1958 case of ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'', the Court said: "The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal."&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper v. Aaron'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/358/1/case.html 358 U.S. 1] (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Raneta and Kelly, Michael.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vsTP_KhsulsC&amp;pg=PT36 Equal Justice in the Balance: America's Legal Responses to the Emerging Terrorist Threat]'', p. 16 (U. Mich. Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The words "equal justice under law" are not in [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]], which instead says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq-pOED4TSUC&amp;pg=PT145 Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices]'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital  2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  From an architectural perspective, the main advantage of the former over the latter was brevity — the [[Equal Protection Clause]] was not short enough to fit on the [[pediment]] given the size of the letters to be used.

==Following ancient tradition==
[[Image:Pericles3.JPG|thumb|right|Pericles, Greek statesman and general]]In [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|the funeral oration]] that he delivered in 431 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] leader [[Pericles]] encouraged belief in what we now call equal justice under law.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cC06AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 Law for the Public Speaker: Legal Aspects of Public Address]'', p. 171 (Christopher Pub. House, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when  Chief Justice Fuller wrote his opinion in ''Caldwell v. Texas'', he was by no means the first to discuss this concept.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html 118 U.S. 356] (1886):  "Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several different English translations of the relevant passage in Pericles' funeral oration.  

Here is Pericles discussing "equal justice" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by Richard Crawley (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: "the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Benjamin. ''[http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk2rv2.htm Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides,]'' Second edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press (1900): "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbours, but are an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognised; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  And, the English translation by [[Rex Warner]] in 1954 had Pericles saying: "there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Pericles's Funeral Oration|Pericles's Funeral Oration]]'', translated by Rex Warner (1954), via wikisource: "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;  The funeral oration by Pericles was published in [[Thucydides]]’ ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', of which there are [[History of the Peloponnesian War#Translations|several other English translations]].  

As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives.  Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription "equal justice under law" by referring to the judicial [[oath of office]], which requires judges to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt; Decades later, Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] made a similar point: "The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law."&lt;ref&gt;''Pennzoil v. Texaco'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/1/case.html 481 U.S. 1] (1987)(Thurgood Marshall, concurring in the judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-11/news/8701270894_1_texas-courts-texaco-federal-court How To Handle A Texas-sized Lawsuit]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (April 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
The [[law]] of '''evidence''', also known as the '''rules of evidence''', encompasses the rules and legal principles that govern the proof of facts in a legal proceeding.  These rules determine what evidence must or must not be considered by the [[trier of fact]] in reaching its decision. The trier of fact is a judge in bench trials, or the jury in any cases involving a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trier of Fact|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/legal/trier%20of%20fact|website=Merriam Webster Legal Dictionary|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law of evidence is also concerned with the quantum (amount), quality, and type of proof needed to prevail in litigation. The rules vary depending upon whether the venue is a criminal court, civil court, or family court, and they vary by jurisdiction.

The [[Quantum meruit|quantum]] of evidence is the amount of evidence needed; the quality of proof is how reliable such evidence should be considered.  Important rules  that govern [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] concern [[hearsay]], [[authentication]], [[Relevance (law)|relevance]], [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]], [[witness]]es, [[opinion]]s, [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Identification (information)|identification]] and rules of [[physical evidence]].  There are various '''standards of evidence''' or standards showing how strong the evidence must be to meet the [[legal burden of proof]] in a given situation, ranging from [[reasonable suspicion]] to [[preponderance of the evidence]], [[clear and convincing evidence]], or [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].

There are several types of evidence, depending on the form or source.  Evidence governs the use of [[testimony]] (e.g., oral or written statements, such as an [[affidavit]]), [[exhibit (legal)|exhibit]]s (e.g., physical objects), [[Documentary evidence|documentary material]], or [[demonstrative evidence]], which are admissible (i.e., allowed to be considered by the [[trier of fact]], such as [[jury]]) in a [[dispute resolution|judicial or administrative proceeding]] (e.g., a [[court]] of law).

When a dispute, whether relating to a civil or criminal matter, reaches the court there will always be a number of issues which one party will have to prove in order to persuade the court to find in his or her favour. The law must ensure certain guidelines are set out in order to ensure that evidence presented to the court can be regarded as trustworthy.

==History==
The rules of evidence were developed over several centuries and are based upon the rules from [[Anglo-America]]n [[common law]] brought to the [[New World]] by early settlers. Their purpose is to be fair to both parties, disallowing the raising of allegations without a basis in provable fact. They are sometimes criticized as a [[legal technicality]], but are an important part of the system for achieving a just result.

Perhaps the most important of the rules of evidence is that, in general, [[hearsay]] testimony is inadmissible (although there are many exceptions to this rule). In [[England and Wales]], the Civil Evidence Act 1995, section 1, specifically allows for admission of 'hearsay' evidence; legislation also allows for 'hearsay' evidence to be used in criminal proceedings, which makes it possible for the accuser to induce friends or family to give false evidence in support of their accusations because, normally, it would be rejected by the presiding authority or judge. There are several examples where presiding authorities are not bound by the rules of evidence. These include the [[military tribunals in the United States]] and tribunals used in [[Australia]] to try health professionals.

==Relevance and social policy==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
{{main article|Relevance (law)}}

In every jurisdiction based on the English common law tradition, evidence must conform to a number of rules and restrictions to be admissible. Evidence must be [[relevance (law)|relevant]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, it must be directed at proving or disproving a legal element.

However, the relevance of evidence is ordinarily a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for the admissibility of evidence. For example, relevant evidence may be excluded if it is unfairly prejudicial, confusing, or  the relevance or irrelevance of evidence cannot be determined by logical analysis. There is also general agreement that assessment of relevance or irrelevance involves or requires judgements about probabilities or uncertainties. Beyond that, there is little agreement. Many legal scholars and judges agree that ordinary reasoning, or common sense reasoning, plays an important role. There is less agreement about whether or not judgements of relevance or irrelevance are defensible only if the reasoning that supports such judgements is made fully explicit. However, most trial judges would reject any such requirement and would say that some judgements can and must rest partly on unarticulated and unarticulable hunches and intuitions. However, there is general (though implicit) agreement that the relevance of at least some types of expert evidence{{spaced ndash}}particularly evidence from the hard sciences{{spaced ndash}}requires particularly rigorous, or in any event more arcane reasoning than is usually needed or expected. There is a general agreement that judgments of relevance are largely within the discretion of the trial court{{spaced ndash}}although relevance rulings that lead to the exclusion of evidence are more likely to be reversed on appeal than are relevance rulings that lead to the admission of evidence.

According to Rule 401 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (FRE), evidence is relevant if it has the "tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~kayed/class/evidence/rules/fre.htm#401|title=Federal Rules of Evidence|website=homepages.law.asu.edu|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Rule 403 allows relevant evidence to be excluded "if its [[probative]] value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice", if it leads to confusion of the issues, if it is misleading or if it is a waste of time. California Evidence Code section 352 also allows for exclusion to avoid "substantial danger of undue prejudice."  For example, evidence that the victim of a car accident was apparently a "liar, cheater, womanizer, and a man of low morals" was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant to whether he had a valid [[product liability]] claim against the manufacturer of the tires on his van (which had rolled over resulting in severe brain damage).&lt;ref&gt;''Winfred D. v. Michelin North America, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/165CA4t1011.htm 165 Cal. App. 4th 1011] (2008) (reversing jury verdict for defendant).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presence or absence of a jury==
The United States has a very complicated system of evidentiary rules; for example, [[John Wigmore]]'s celebrated treatise on it filled ten volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'', 3rd ed. (New York: Touchstone, 2005), 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Bradley Thayer]] reported in 1898 that even English lawyers were surprised by the complexity of American evidence law, such as its reliance on exceptions to preserve evidentiary objections for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legal experts, notably Stanford legal historian [[Lawrence Friedman]], have argued that the complexity of American evidence law arises from two factors: (1) the right of American defendants to have findings of fact made by a jury in practically all criminal cases as well as many civil cases; and (2) the widespread consensus that tight limitations on the admissibility of evidence are necessary to prevent a jury of untrained laypersons from being swayed by irrelevant distractions.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; In Professor Friedman's words: "A trained judge would not need all these rules; and indeed, the law of evidence in systems that lack a jury is short, sweet, and clear."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the Twentieth Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 266.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Friedman's views are characteristic of an earlier generation of legal scholars. The majority of people now reject the formerly-popular proposition that the institution of trial by jury is the main reason for the existence of rules of evidence even in countries such as the United States and Australia; they argue that {{clarify|text=other variables|reason=Please list the 'other variables'.|date=April 2015}} are at work.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Frederick Schauer, "On the Supposed Jury-Dependence of Evidence Law," vol. 155 University of Pennsylvania Law Review pp. 165-202 (November 2006). See also 1 [[John Henry Wigmore]], Evidence in Trials at Common Law Section 4d.1 (P. Tillers. rev. 1983) and P. Tillers, "Rules of Evidence in Nonjury Trials" (Nov. 7 2006) at http://tillerstillers.blogspot.com/search?q=rules+jury&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion of evidence==
{{See also|Public policy doctrines for the exclusion of relevant evidence|Exclusionary rule}}

===Unfairness===
Under [[English law]], evidence that would otherwise be admissible at trial may be excluded at the discretion of the trial judge if it would be unfair to the defendant to admit it.

Evidence of a confession may be excluded because it was obtained by oppression or because the confession was made in consequence of anything said or done to the defendant that would be likely to make the confession unreliable.  In these circumstances, it would be open to the trial judge to exclude the evidence of the confession under Section 78(1) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] (PACE), or under Section 73 PACE, or under common law, although in practice the confession would be excluded under section 76 PACE.&lt;ref name="CPPACE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Confessions, Unfairly Obtained Evidence and Breaches of PACE|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/confession_and_breaches_of_police_and_criminal_evidence_act/|website=CPS|publisher=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other admissible evidence may be excluded, at the discretion of the trial judge under 78 PACE, or at common law, if the judge can be persuaded that having regard to all the circumstances including how the evidence was obtained "admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it."&lt;ref name="CPPACE" /&gt;

In the United States and other countries, evidence may be excluded from a trial if it is the result of illegal activity by law enforcement, such as a search conducted without a warrant. Such illegal evidence is known as the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] and is normally not permitted at trial.

==Authentication==
Certain kinds of evidence, such as documentary evidence, are subject to the requirement that the offeror provide the trial judge with a certain amount of evidence (which need not be much and it need not be very strong) suggesting that the offered item of tangible evidence (e.g., a document, a gun) is what the offeror claims it is. This [[authentication]] requirement has import primarily in jury trials. If evidence of authenticity is lacking in a bench trial, the trial judge will simply dismiss the evidence as unpersuasive or irrelevant. Other kinds of evidence can be [[Self-authenticating document|self-authenticating]] and require nothing to prove that the item is tangible evidence.  Examples of self-authenticating evidence includes signed and certified public documents, newspapers, and acknowledged documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902|title=Rule 902. Evidence That Is Self-Authenticating|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2011-11-30|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witnesses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
In systems of proof based on the English common law tradition, almost all evidence must be sponsored by a [[witness]], who has sworn or solemnly affirmed to tell the truth. The bulk of the law of evidence regulates the types of evidence that may be sought from witnesses and the manner in which the interrogation of witnesses is conducted such as during [[direct examination]] and [[cross-examination]] of witnesses. Other types of evidentiary rules specify the standards of persuasion (e.g., proof beyond a reasonable doubt) that a trier of fact—whether judge or jury—must apply when it assesses evidence.

Today all persons are presumed to be qualified to serve as witnesses in trials and other legal proceedings, and all persons are also presumed to have a legal obligation to serve as witnesses if their testimony is sought. However, legal rules sometimes exempt people from the obligation to give evidence and legal rules disqualify people from serving as witnesses under some circumstances.

[[Privilege (evidence)|Privilege]] rules give the holder of the privilege a right to prevent a witness from giving testimony. These privileges are ordinarily (but not always) designed to protect socially valued types of confidential communications. Some of the privileges that are often recognized in various U.S. jurisdictions are [[spousal privilege]], [[attorney–client privilege]], [[doctor–patient privilege]], [[state secrets privilege]], and [[clergy–penitent privilege]]. A variety of additional privileges are recognized in different jurisdictions, but the list of recognized privileges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; for example, some jurisdictions recognize a social worker–client privilege and other jurisdictions do not.

Witness [[competence (law)|competence]] rules are legal rules that specify circumstances under which persons are ineligible to serve as witnesses. For example, neither a judge nor a juror is competent to testify in a trial in which the judge or the juror serves in that capacity; and in jurisdictions with a [[dead man statute]], a person is deemed not competent to testify as to statements of or transactions with a deceased opposing party.

Often, a Government or Parliamentary Act will govern the rules affecting the giving of evidence by witnesses in court. An example is the ''Evidence Act(NSW)''1995 which sets out the procedures for witnesses to follow in New South Wales, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;''Evidence Act(NSW)'' 1995 http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ea199580/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearsay==
{{main article|Hearsay}}
[[Hearsay]] is one of the largest and most complex areas of the law of evidence in common-law jurisdictions. The default rule is that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Hearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  A party is offering a statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted if the party is trying to prove that the assertion made by the declarant (the maker of the out-of-trial statement) is true.  For example, prior to trial Bob says, "Jane went to the store." If the party offering this statement as evidence at trial is trying to prove that Jane actually went to the store, the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  However, at both common law and under evidence codifications such as the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], there are dozens of exemptions from and exceptions to the hearsay rule.

==Direct vs. Circumstantial evidence==
[[Direct evidence]] is any evidence that directly proves or disproves a fact.  The most well-known type of direct evidence is a testimony from an eye witness.  In eye-witness testimonies the witness states exactly what they experienced, saw, or heard.  Direct evidence may also be found in the form of documents.  In cases that involve a breach of contract, the contract itself would be considered direct evidence as it can directly prove or disprove that there was breach of contract.  [[Circumstantial evidence]], however, is evidence that does not point directly to a fact and requires an inference in order to prove that fact.

A common example of the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence involves a person who comes into a building, when it may be raining. If the person declares, "It's raining outside," that statement is direct evidence that it is raining. If the person is carrying a wet umbrella, and he's wearing a wet rain coat, those observations are circumstantial evidence that it is raining outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heeter|first1=Eugenée M.|title=Chance of Rain: Rethinking Circumstantial Evidence Jury Instructions|journal=Hastings Law Journal|date=2013|volume=64|page=527|url=http://www.hastingslawjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/heeter-64.2.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burdens of proof==
{{main article|Legal burden of proof}}
Different types of proceedings require parties to meet different [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], the typical examples being beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing evidence, and preponderance of the evidence. Many jurisdictions have burden-shifting provisions, which require that if one party produces evidence tending to prove a certain point, the burden shifts to the other party to produce superior evidence tending to disprove it.

One special category of information in this area includes things of which the court may take [[judicial notice]]. This category covers matters that are so well known that the court may deem them proved without the introduction of ''any'' evidence. For example, if a defendant is alleged to have illegally transported goods across a state line by driving them from [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles]], the court may take judicial notice of the fact that it is impossible to drive from Boston to Los Angeles without crossing a number of state lines. In a civil case, where the court takes judicial notice of the fact, that fact is deemed conclusively proved. In a criminal case, however, the defense may always submit evidence to rebut a point for which judicial notice has been taken.

==Evidentiary rules stemming from other areas of law==
Some rules that affect the admissibility of evidence are nonetheless considered to belong to other areas of law. These include the [[exclusionary rule]] of [[criminal procedure]], which prohibits the admission in a criminal trial of evidence gained by unconstitutional means, and the [[parol evidence rule]] of [[contract law]], which prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence of the contents of a written contract.This practice is very common in today's complicated world.

==Evidence as an area of study==

In countries that follow the [[civil law system]], evidence is normally studied as a branch of [[procedural law]].

All American [[law school]]s offer a course in evidence, and most require the subject either as a first year class, or as an upper-level class, or as a prerequisite to later courses. Furthermore, evidence is heavily tested on the [[Multistate Bar Examination]] (MBE) - approximately one-sixth of the questions asked in that test will be in the area of evidence. The MBE predominantly tests evidence under the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], giving little attention to matters on which the law of different states is likely to be inconsistent.

==Tampering, falsification, and spoliation==
{{main article|spoliation of evidence|tampering with evidence|falsification of evidence}}
Acts that conceal, corrupt, or destroy evidence can be considered '''[[spoliation of evidence]]''' and/or '''[[tampering with evidence]]'''.  Spoliation is usually the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]]/[[due process|due-process]] variant, may involve [[intent (law)|intent]] or [[negligence (law)|negligence]], may affect the outcome of a case in which the evidence is material, and may or may not result in [[criminal law|criminal]] [[prosecution]].  Tampering is usually the [[criminal law]] variant in which a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys evidence to interfere with a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory investigation, and is usually defined as a [[crime]].  [[Parallel construction]] is the creation of an untruthful, but plausible, explanation for how the evidence came to be held, which hides its true origins, either to protect sources and methods used, or to avoid the evidence being [[fruit of the poisonous tree|excluded as unlawfully obtained]]. Depending on the circumstances, acts to conceal or destroy evidence or misrepresent its true origins  might be considered both tampering and spoliation.

{{Property law}}

In English law, a '''fee simple''' or '''fee simple absolute''' is an [[estate in land]], a form of [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] ownership. It is a way that [[real estate]] and land may be owned in [[common law]] countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in [[real property]]. [[Allodial title]] is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the fee simple owner are limited by government powers of [[taxation]], [[compulsory purchase]], [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom#Powers of officers|police power]], and [[escheat]], and it could also be limited further by certain [[encumbrance]]s or conditions in the [[deed]], such as, for example, a condition that required the land to be used as a public park, with a [[reverter|reversion]] interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a '''fee simple conditional'''.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite book | title=''Jensen v. City of New Albany'' | author=Indiana Court of Appeals | year=2007 | location=868 N.E.2d 525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word "fee" is derived from [[fief]], meaning a [[feudalism|feudal]] landholding. [[Feudal land tenure]]s existed in several varieties, most of which involved the [[tenant farmer|tenant]] having to supply some service to his overlord, such as [[knight-service]] (military service). If the tenant's overlord was the king, [[Serjeanty|Grand Serjeanty]], then this might require providing many different services, such as providing horses in time of war or acting as the king's ceremonial butler. These fiefs gave rise to a complex relationship between landlord and tenant, involving duties on both sides. For example, in return for receiving his tenant's [[fealty]] or [[homage (feudal)|homage]], the overlord had a duty to protect his tenant. When feudal land tenure was abolished all fiefs became "simple", without conditions attached to the tenancy.

==Common law==
In English common law, the [[The Crown|Crown]] had [[radical title]] or the [[allodium]] of all land in England, meaning that it was the ultimate "owner" of all land in the past feudal era. However, the Crown can grant ownership in an [[abstract entity]]—called an [[estate (law)|estate]] in land—which is what is owned rather than the land it represents. The fee simple estate is also called "estate in fee simple" or "fee-simple title", sometimes simply "freehold" in England and Wales. From the start of the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] period, when [[feudalism]] was introduced to England, the [[Tenement (law)|tenant]] or "holder" of a [[fief]] could not alienate (sell) it from the possession of his overlord. However, a tenant could separate a parcel of the land and grant it as a subordinate fief to his own sub-tenant, a process known as sub-enfeoffing or "[[subinfeudation]]". The 1290 [[Statute]] of [[Quia Emptores]] abolished subinfeudation and instead allowed the sale of fee simple estates.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Ernest F. ''Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages'', (London: George Bell and Sons, 1910), 149–150. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ed1-quia.html Excerpt] retrieved 2007-10-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a "fee" has its origins in [[feudalism]]. [[William Blackstone]] defined fee simple as the estate in land that a person has when the lands are given to him and his heirs absolutely, without any end or limit put to his estate. Land held in fee simple can be conveyed to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be [[mortgage law|mortgaged]] or put up as security.&lt;ref&gt;Property: Examples and Explanations, B. Barlow Burke&lt;/ref&gt;
Owners of [[real property]] in fee simple have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.

Historically, estates could be limited in time. Common temporal limitations include [[life estate]], a land ownership that terminates upon the grantee's (or another person's) death even if the land had been granted to a third party, or a term of years, a lease for a specified term, such as in an [[estate for years]]. A fee also could be limited through the method of its inheritance, such as by an "entailment", which created a [[fee tail]]. Traditionally, fee tail was created by words of grant such as "to N. and the male heirs of his body", which would restrict those who could inherit the property. If no heirs could be found, then the property would revert to the original grantor's heirs. Most common law countries have abolished entailment by statute.

==Duration==
An estate in fee simple denotes the maximum ownership in land that can be legally granted; it is the greatest possible aggregate of rights, powers, privileges and immunities available in land. The three hallmarks of the fee simple estate are that it is [[alienable]], [[Will (law)|devisable]] and [[Inheritance|descendible]].

==Creation and characteristic of fee simple==
Rules requiring words of general inheritance to create fee simple by conveyance have been abolished by statute in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan's Introduction to the Law of Real Property, Sheldon F. Kurtz&lt;/ref&gt; To convey an estate in fee simple at common law, the deed or will must state "to B and his heirs." Anything short of those words transferred a smaller estate.

Modern deeds usually follow a standardized form. There is a presumption that the testator intends to convey his or her property in fee simple unless the will indicates an intention to transfer a smaller estate, such as a life estate.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life estate==
Many jurisdictions retain the possibility of creating a [[life estate]], although this is uncommon. In the United States, life estates are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property for the remainder of that person's life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property for the remainder of the grantor's life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the life estate owner is called the ''remainder estate''. In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a life estate can only be created in [[Equity (law)|equity]] and is not a right in property.

==Types of fee simple==
If previous grantors of a fee simple estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called '''fee simple absolute'''. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations now and in the future.  Other fee simple estates in real property include '''fee simple defeasible''' (or '''fee simple determinable''') estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the [[deed]]). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: fee simple determinable and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a fee simple determinable. If the grantor uses language such as "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. Fee simple determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.

==Rent==
The claim that no [[renting|rent]] or similar obligations are due from the owner of property in fee simple is only partially true. For example, a [[rentcharge]] may exist requiring a freeholder to pay a fixed sum of money closely resembling rent, and many jurisdictions have created financial obligations that may be imposed on a freehold estate. England and Wales impose an [[estate charge]]. In the [[United States]], fee simple owners are usually subject to [[property tax]] and the revenue generated is directed to the municipality's general fund. Other local tax assessments called "special purpose taxes" may be assessed in addition to the property taxes for specific purposes such as infrastructure improvements. Real estate owned as a [[condominium]] is usually similarly owned in fee simple, but typically subject to rules in the declaration of condominium or created by the condominium association, such as paying required monthly fees for maintaining the property's common areas; however, these are generally treated legally as [[covenant (law)|covenants running with the land]] (contracts binding on the possessors of real property) imposing an affirmative duty to pay money rather than as rent for property held in fee simple.

== Etymology ==
'''Fee''' – A right in law to the use of land; i.e. a [[fief]]. '''Simple''' – in the unconstrained sense:
# without limit to the inheritance of heirs;
# unrestricted as to transfer of ownership.
The English word ''fee'' ultimately goes back to the Indo-European root ''*peku'', which refers to moveable wealth, that is, cattle. The Latin word ''pecunia'', money, also comes from this root and becomes ''pecuniary'' in English. The root appears in Modern German as ''Vieh'', cattle, beast.
&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English language, editions with the Index of Indo-European Roots, under peku&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10561">'''Fundamental breach''' of [[contract]]&lt;ref&gt;sometimes known as a '''repudiatory breach'''&lt;/ref&gt; is a controversial concept within the [[common law]] of [[Law of contract|contract]].  

Although the concept caused some excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, the concept has been regarded as flawed and wrongheaded{{by who|date=November 2018}} and has been effectively "laid to rest" in [[English Law|England]] and Canada.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Background – the law of deviation==
{{Contract law}}
The origins of the idea of fundamental [[breach of contract|breach]]  may be traced to early cases on the  doctrine of [[Deviation (law)|deviation]]. In ''Davis v. Garrett'' &lt;ref&gt; Case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/D/Davis_v_Garrett_1830_6_Bing_716.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tindal C.J. stated that a carrier's deviation from the agreed voyage route amounted also to a deviation from the terms of the contract, including its exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This view was adopted in the leading cases of ''[[Deviation (law)|Glynn v Margetson]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''Glynn v Margetson''[1893] AC 351 [1907] 1 KB 660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/G/Glynn_v_Margetson_1893_AC_351.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deviation (law)|Leduc v Ward]]''.&lt;ref&gt; ''Leduc v Ward'' (1888) 20 QBD 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/L/Leduc_v_Ward_1888_20_QBD475.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Glynn v Margetson'' (1893) &lt;ref&gt;[1893] AC 351 [1907] 1 KB 660&lt;/ref&gt;  a vessel carrying Seville oranges from Malaga to Liverpool deviated from the agreed route, by heading first to Burriana (near Valencia). This deviation caused delay and deterioration of the perishable cargo. The carrier relied on a 'liberty clause' in the [[bill of lading]] which purported to allow the vessel 'liberty to visit any port in any order'. In the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], Lord Herschell LC declared the liberty clause to be an [[exemption clause]] in disguise, adding "The main object of this bill of lading is the carriage of oranges from Malaga to Liverpool". He thus established the '''"main purpose rule"''', holding that no exclusion clause would be allowed to cut into the main purpose of any contract. 

Similarly, in ''Leduc v Ward'' (1888) a vessel bound from Fiume&lt;ref&gt; Fiume is modern day Rijeka&lt;/ref&gt; to Dunkirk headed instead towards Glasgow, sinking in a storm in the Clyde estuary. The court held that even though the shipper may have known of the planned deviation, the [[parol evidence rule]] meant that the route described in the bill of lading was conclusive, and that the deviation was actionable, preventing the carrier from invoking the protection of the "[[perils of the sea]]" exemption.

''[[Tate &amp; Lyle v Hain Steamship Company]]''&lt;ref&gt;iLaw[https://i-law.com/ilaw/doc/view.htm?id=142321]&lt;/ref&gt; was a further deviation case following this approach.

==Adoption of fundamental breach within contract law==
Although the 19th century cases were maritime cases, the idea of the "main purpose" caught on in the general [[English contract law|law of contract]] after Lord Greene [[Master of the Rolls|MR]], in ''[[Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd.]]''(1945) &lt;ref&gt;[1945] KB, 189 at p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;, labelled the fundamental term as ‘the hard core of the contract'. 

In ''[[Karsales (Harrow) Ltd. v. Wallis|Karsales  v Wallis]]'' [1956] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1956/4.html EWCA Civ 4] a buyer inspected a car dealer's used Buick car and agreed to buy it. The car was later delivered at night, and had been towed. When the buyer inspected the car in the morning, it would not work and it was clear it had been involved in an accident, and there were other changes: its tyres had been replaced by old ones, body parts were missing, and the engine's cylinder head was detached, revealing burnt valves. This was a serious breach, but the dealer sought to rely on a clause in the contract: "No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein."

Although the clause was clear and well drafted, the [[English Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] declared that a "car" was a "vehicle capable of self-propulsion", and accordingly this Buick was not a proper car. Following ''Glynn v Margetson'' and using its "main purpose" concept, the court held that the dealer was "in breach of a fundamental obligation" and so could not rely on any exclusion clause.

This decision was clearly fair to the buyer, and ''Karsales v Wallis'' soon became the leading case on "fundamental breach". As a matter of law, under the doctrine of fundamental breach of contract, exclusion clauses were deemed not to be available to a party in fundamental breach of the contract. However, all was not well, as business people felt alarmed that an agreed contract term could be set aside by a court; there seemed to be no "certainty".{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Also, there arose some confusion as to what "fundamental breach" actually was. Some alleged it was a breach that went to "the root of the contract", a breach so fundamental it would permit the distressed party to [[anticipatory repudiation|repudiate]] the contract and claim damages. However, since both common law&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876)&lt;/ref&gt; and statute&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[The Sale of Goods Act 1893]]&lt;/ref&gt; already recognised that while that breach of warranty entitled a claimant only to damages, any breach of condition would entitle a claimant both repudiation and damages, it seemed that fundamental breach offered nothing new.&lt;ref&gt;In other words, fundamental breach was not some kind of "super breach of condition".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution – the ''Suisse Atlantique''==
The matter came to a head in 1966 in the House of Lords decision ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armement Maritime S.A. v. N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1966] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 529&lt;/ref&gt;. The case involved a two-year [[time charter]] to export coal, the shipowners to be paid [[freight rate|freight]] dependant on tonnage of cargo carried. If [[laytime]]{{efn|"Laytime" is the allowable period for the charterer to arrange loading and unloading}} were exceeded, the charterers were to pay [[demurrage]] of $1,000 per day. The charterers caused huge delays and few round trips were made. Demurrage totalled only $150,000, so the owners claimed damages for their full losses, saying they should not be limited to the demurrage terms because the charterer's gross delays amounted to fundamental breach.

The House of Lords boldly held that ''Karsales v Wallis'' had overstated the law, and that whether or not a fundamental breach extinguishes any protection that the defendant might rely on was a "question of construction" and not a "question of law".{{efn|i.e not automatic}} Although the demurrage clause was so absurdly low that it amounted to an exemption clause, nevertheless its existence plainly showed that the parties had contemplated the possibility of delay, so delays would not amount to fundamental breach.

After the ''Suisse Atlantique'' decision, there was a series of cases where the [[Court of Appeal]] patently ignored the House of Lords' findings. One such case was ''[[Harbutt's "Plasticine" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1970] 1 QB 447&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords was less than amused, and in the 1980  ''[[Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd|Photo Productions]]'' case they emphatically reaffirmed their decision in the ''Suisse Atlantique''.  [[Lord Wilberforce]] effectively overturned the "rule of law" doctrine of ''Karsales v Wallis'' and instead maintained a strict "[[rule of construction]]" approach whereby a fundamental breach is determined by examining the full circumstances, such as the parties' intentions at the time of the contract.

These two cases (the ''Suisse Atlantique'' and ''Photo Productions'') thus form the definitive statement of the law up to the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]].{{efn|as amended by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]}}

More recently, this law was successfully applied in two cases related to carriage of goods by sea and application of limitation clauses under the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]: ''[[Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. Klipriver Shipping Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also, ''The Kapitan Petko Voivoda'' [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Happy Ranger''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Suisse Atlantique'' case has taken the sting out of the fundamental breach idea, in deviation itself little has changed. ''Glynn v Margetson'' still holds, so that not only may deviating carriers be denied the protection of exemption clauses expressly in the contract, they will also be denied the protection of implicit exemptions such as Article IV of the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]. However, given the general move in the [[common law]] away from [[strict liability]] to a standard of "[[reasonable care]]" (or "[[due diligence]]"),&lt;ref&gt;''viz'' ''[[Re Polemis]]'' &amp; ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''viz'' ''[[The Glenfruin]]'' (1885) 10 PD 103 &amp; ''[[McFadden v Blue Star Line]]'' [1905] 1 KB 697&lt;/ref&gt; this may change in due course.

{{notelist}}

==Canada==
The doctrine of fundamental breach has been “laid to rest”&lt;ref&gt;2010 SCC 4, para. 81&lt;/ref&gt; by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways)]].''&lt;ref&gt;2010 SCC 4&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, the court has created a three-step test to evaluate the application of exclusion clauses. The first step is to evaluate the exclusion clause in the factual context of each case to determine if it applies to the material circumstances. The second step is to evaluate if the exclusion clause was unconscionable at the time of incorporation. The final step is to evaluate whether the exclusion clause should not be enforced on public policy grounds.

'''Garden State Equality''' is a statewide advocacy and education organization in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]] that advocates for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) rights, including [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="njtv913"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.njtvonline.org/news/video/garden-state-equality-director-happy-with-marriage-ruling-will-continue-fight/ | title=Garden State Equality Director Happy With Marriage Ruling, Will Continue Fight | work=NJTV News | date=2013-09-27 | accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Garden State Equality was founded in 2004 by [[Steven Goldstein (activist)|Steven Goldstein]]; he left the organization in 2013 and Troy Stevenson was promoted to take his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N.J.'s most visible gay rights activist steps down, takes Rutgers-Newark job |url=https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/01/njs_most_visible_gay_rights_ac.html |work=NJ.com |date=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/garden_state_equality_pledges.html |title= Garden State Equality pledges to withhold donations after gay marriage vote |date= January 9, 2010 |publisher= New Jersey On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Garden State Equality v. Paula Dow ===
{{main|Garden State Equality v. Dow}}
In 2011, [[Lambda Legal]] filed a lawsuit on behalf of Garden State Equality and six same-sex families against New Jersey, arguing that the state's civil union system failed to provide those same benefits and violated New Jersey's guarantee of equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/samesex/Notice%20of%20appeal-CIS%2010-02-13.pdf |title=Notice of Appeal |publisher=''Garden State Equity v.

App. Div., Docket A-0521-13 (Sep. 30, 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2013, Judge Mary Jacobson ruled that same-sex marriage should be legal and ordered the state to begin allowing same-sex marriages on October 21, 2013.&lt;ref name="bloom913"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-27/new-jersey-same-sex-couples-must-be-allowed-to-marry-judge-says.html | title=New Jersey Same-Sex Weddings Must Be Allowed, Judge Rules | work=Bloomberg | date=September 27, 2013 | accessdate=January 20, 2014 | author=David Voreacos and Terrence Dopp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state quickly appealed the decision and asked for a stay to delay the implementation of the court order. On October 18, 2013, the Supreme Court of New Jersey unanimously affirmed Judge Jacobson's denial of the stay and ruled that state should begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as ordered. Hours after the first marriages were officiated on October 21, 2013, the state dropped its legal challenge and New Jersey became the 14th state with the freedom to marry for all couples, barring age restrictions.&lt;ref name="aclunj-dow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu-nj.org/legaldocket/garden-state-equality-v-paula-dow/ | title=Garden State Equality v.

== Programs ==
Garden State Equality programming focuses primarily on public policy advocacy and grassroots organizing.&lt;ref name="gse-programs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/about/programs/ | title=Our Grassroots Programs | work=Garden State Equality | accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grassroots programs ===
The organization's grassroots programs include volunteer work, training, town meetings, and action nights, where participants can provide input on or participate In the organization's work.&lt;ref name="About Garden State Equality"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/our_grassroots_programs|title=About Garden State Equality|work=Garden State Equality|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Garden State Equality"/&gt;

Garden State Equality stresses the importance of volunteer work for the organization. There are many difference branches of service available within the organization, such as a campaign for the homeless and those in poverty, which helps to gather more information about these miniority groups and hopefully take action to improve their living standards. This specific campaign not only aids the LGBT community but also often caters to the impoverished, homeless, and incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/volunteer|title=Become a volunteer|work=Garden State Equality|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-bullying hotline collects reports from parents, students and others about incidents of bullying against students. The organization visits schools to conduct trainings for administrators, teachers and other staff on New Jersey's anti-[[school bullying|bullying]] law, and how to comply with it. The organization also conducts a different age-appropriate anti-bullying training for students.

At the annual Equality Walk, volunteers get sponsored by friends to do a two to three mile walk on a Sunday. The walk ends at a pub, where a celebration of the walk's completion is held.

Garden State Equality has held numerous town meetings on LGBT issues, such as [[same-sex marriage in New Jersey|same-sex marriage]], across the state. The organization also holds telephone town meetings with public officials on conference calls with as many as 200 people.&lt;ref name="gse-programs" /&gt; The organization has also held lobby days where volunteers meet with legislators and their staff on LGBT issues.&lt;ref name="hrc613"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/hrc-joins-garden-state-equality-to-lobby-nj-legislators | title=HRC Joins Garden State Equality to Lobby NJ Legislators | work=Human Rights Campaign | date=June 25, 2013 | accessdate=January 20, 2014 | author=Bach, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former programs ===
Garden State Equality's former grassroots programs include Activist Institutes that trained volunteers in organizing skills, and the "Equality Express", a motor home that traveled to large events in New Jersey to educate people on LGBT issues. The organization also held "Helping You Personally" seminars, where experts in legal and finance spoke on issues of interest to LGBT people in New Jersey.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Prior to legal recognition of same-sex marriages in New Jersey, the organization volunteered to collect letters and postcards in support of marriage equality. The organization developed thirteen caucuses to help to diversify New Jersey's LGBT rights movement. Each caucus serves a different demographic community such as African-Americans, clergy, labor, women, and youth.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

As a part of legislative dinners, Assembly Members and State Senators met Garden State Equality members at the members' homes. Many [[New Jersey Legislature|New Jersey legislators]] have attended at least one town meeting or legislative dinner.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Legends Dinner ==
[[File:Cynthia Nixon jgl.jpg|thumb|[[Cynthia Nixon]] at the 2008 Legends Dinner in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]]]]
Garden State Equality's Legends Dinner is the organization's annual gala attended by 700 to 1,000 guests. Speakers and entertainers have included Governor [[Mario Cuomo]], Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Cynthia Nixon]], [[Judy Gold]], [[Anthony Rapp]], and [[Jennifer Holliday]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24193">A '''high-capacity magazine ban''' is a law which bans or otherwise restricts [[high-capacity magazine]]s, detachable [[firearm magazine]]s that can hold more than a certain number of [[cartridge (firearms)|rounds]] of [[ammunition]]. For example, in the United States, the now-expired [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994]] included limits regarding magazines that could hold more than ten rounds. Eight U.S. states, and a number of local governments, ban or regulate magazines that they have legally defined as high-capacity.  The majority of states (42) do not ban or regulate any magazines on the basis of capacity.  States that do have large capacity magazine bans or restrictions typically do not apply to firearms with [[fixed magazine]]s whose capacity would otherwise exceed the large capacity threshold.

The federal ban of 1994 (expired no longer in effect) defined a magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition as a ''large capacity ammunition feeding device.'' Likewise, the state of California defines a ''large capacity magazine'' as "any ammunition feeding device with a capacity to accept more than 10 rounds."&lt;ref name=AWGuide2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/firearms/forms/awguide.pdf |title=Assault Weapons Identification Guide 2000 |author=Office of the Attorney General |date=November 2001  |website=oag.ca.gov |publisher=California Department of Justice |accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are commonly called high-capacity magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polisar |first=Joseph M. |date=September 2004  |title=President's Message: Reauthorization of the Assault Weapons Ban |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=384&amp;issue_id=92004 |journal=Police Chief Magazine |publisher=International Association of Chiefs of Police |volume= |issue= |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |quote=The ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines has been a crucial component of our national crime-fighting strategy. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kerlikowske |first=R.

==Magazine bans by country==
===Canada===
With the passage of Bill C-17 in 1993 under Prime Minister Kim Campbell (in response to the 1989 [[Ecole Polytechnique Massacre]]), magazines designed for use in semi-automatic centrefire rifles and semi-automatic shotguns became limited to five rounds, and magazines designed for use in handguns are limited to 10 rounds. Magazines designed for use in semi-automatic rimfire rifles, as well as manually operated long guns, are exempt from the magazine capacity restrictions.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of ways to legally work around the magazine capacity restrictions. Numerous semi-automatic centrefire rifles also happen to accept handgun magazines, thereby legally increasing magazine capacity. Numerous rifle and handgun magazines designed for a particular caliber also happen to fit an over-the-limit number of smaller caliber rounds, also legally increasing magazine capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/bulletins/bus-ent/20110323-72-eng.htm | title=Maximum Permitted Magazine Capacity | publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police | work=Special Bulletin for Businesses No. 72 | date=2014-12-08 | accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994====
{{Main|Federal Assault Weapons Ban}}
[[William B. Ruger]], a founder of [[Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.]], is often ascribed with providing the impetus for high capacity magazine restrictions.  Ruger proposed that instead of banning firearms, Congress should outlaw magazines holding more than 15 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gun Digest Book of Ruger Pistols and Revolvers |author= Patrick Sweeney |publisher=Gun Digest Books|year= 2007|page=7|ISBN = 978-0-89689-472-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; “No honest man needs more than 10 rounds in any gun,” Ruger told [[Tom Brokaw]] of [[NBC News]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=mj20160614&gt;{{cite news |title=Fully Loaded: Inside the Shadowy World of America’s 10 Biggest Gunmakers |first=Josh |last=Harkinson |date=June 14, 2016 |accessdate=May 31, 2018 |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/fully-loaded-ten-biggest-gun-manufacturers-america/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Magazine limits were first proposed by Connecticut gun maker |work=[[Connecticut Magazine]] |publisher=[[New Haven Register]] |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 6, 2018 |url=https://www.nhregister.com/connecticut/article/Magazine-limits-were-first-proposed-by-11435654.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, 1989, Ruger sent a letter to every member of the US Congress stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The best way to address the firepower concern is therefore not to try to outlaw or license many millions of older and perfectly legitimate firearms (which would be a licensing effort of staggering proportions) but to prohibit the possession of high capacity magazines. By a simple, complete and unequivocal ban on large capacity magazines, all the difficulty of defining 'assault rifle' and 'semi-automatic rifles' is eliminated. The large capacity magazine itself, separate or attached to the firearm, becomes the prohibited item. A single amendment to Federal firearms laws could effectively implement these objectives."

William B. Ruger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An Open Letter|author= William B. Ruger|page=18|journal=American Handgunner|issue=5|volume=12|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1993 included a ban on magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name="Roth-Koper ImpactsBrief1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Jeffrey A. |author2=Christopher S. Koper |title=Impacts of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/173405.pdf |journal=National Institute of Justice Research in Brief |issue=NCJ 173405 |date=March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}} The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly called the assault weapons ban (AWB), was enacted in September 1994. The ban, including its ban on magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition, became defunct (expired) in September 2004 per a [[sunset provision]]. Attempts to renew the ban have failed on the federal level.

====State high-capacity magazine bans====
{{See also|Gun laws in the United States by state}}
As of March 2014, [[Washington, D.C.]] and nine U.S. states have high-capacity magazine restrictions or bans.&lt;ref name=LCPGV-LCMPolSum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-policy-summary/ |title=Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines Policy Summary |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 31, 2013 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Maryland]] (on in-state sales of magazines with a capacity of 11 rounds or greater)

In [[Virginia]], high-capacity magazines, which are defined as being over 20 rounds for a [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], [[centerfire]] [[rifle]] or [[pistol]], and 7 shells for a shotgun, are not in and of themselves banned, but using one in combination with a firearm changes its status to an "assault firearm" which is prohibited for foreign nationals without permanent resident to possess,&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1802000/18.2-308.2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roanoke.com/news/crime/montgomery_county/former-virginia-tech-student-was-allowed-to-have-gun-but/article_47983e3e-6501-56aa-b328-b61f7e4989df.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as requiring a license to carry in certain counties and cities.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1802000/18.2-287.4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
In 2013, a federal judge in [[New York (state)|New York]] struck down the state's prohibition against gun owners loading more than seven rounds into a magazine, calling the limit “an arbitrary restriction” that violated the Second Amendment, but upheld the state's ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/nyregion/federal-judge-upholds-majority-of-new-york-gun-law.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] upheld this decision on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''New York State Rifle and Pistol Ass'n, Inc. v. Cuomo'', 804 F.3d 242 (2d Cir. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), representing five residents of Sunnyvale, California, filed a lawsuit to stop enforcement of the city's ban on possession of magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds,&lt;ref name=Richman131217&gt;{{cite news |last=Richman |first=Josh |date=December 17, 2013 |title=NRA sues Sunnyvale over ammo magazine ban |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_24741834/nra-sues-sunnyvale-over-ammo-magazine-ban |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |location=San Jose, California |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2014|quote=in fact, most pistols sold in the U.S. are made and sold with magazines holding between 10 and 17 rounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case known as ''Fyock v. Sunnyvale''.  In March 2014, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] rejected a request to block enforcement of the law pending appeals.&lt;ref name=Richman140312&gt;{{cite news |last=Richman |first=Josh |date=March 12, 2014 |title=Sunnyvale gun law: Supreme Court justice refuses to stay ban on large-capacity magazines |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_25330161 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |location=San Jose, California |publisher= |accessdate=March 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2015 the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the magazine capacity restriction, ruling that it does not violate the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Howard (March 4, 2015).

Retrieved March 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Volokh]], constitutional scholar, says that a Federal District Court judge was correct to decide that a local high-capacity magazine ban was constitutional, comparing limits on magazine capacity to limits on [[free speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/07/court-bans-on-high-capacity-magazines-ar |title=Court: Bans on High-Capacity Magazines Are 'Only the Most Minor Burden on the Second Amendment' |last=Root |first=Damon |date=March 7, 2014 |website=reason.com |publisher=Reason Foundation |accessdate=April 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Law criticism ====

Forty-one states presently in the United States allow citizens to keep and purchase magazines over ten rounds for privately owned firearms.  Tens of millions of these magazines presently are in privately owned United States citizen hands.

Many critics of laws restricting firearm magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on committing acts of violence and murder.

Such laws requiring registration or bans of magazines would be nearly impossible to enforce as there are likely over 50 million firearm magazines privately owned in the United States that hold eleven or more rounds of ammunition.

====Hunting====
Some jurisdictions apply magazine limits to hunters. For example, [[Maine]] and [[Oregon]] have a 5-cartridge limit on auto-loading firearms for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statedocs.maine.gov/warden_docs/1/ |title=Maine Hunting &amp; Trapping: The Official 2013–14 State of Maine Hunting &amp; Trapping Laws and Rules |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2014 |website=statedocs.maine.gov |publisher=Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife |format=PDF |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/hunting/big_game/regulations/weapons.asp|title=ODFW Weapons Restrictions|website=www.dfw.state.or.us|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4508">'''Infiltration''' is the unintentional or accidental introduction of outside air into a building, typically through cracks in the building envelope and through use of doors for passage.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals volume of the [[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', Ch. 27, [[ASHRAE]], Inc., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   Infiltration is sometimes called '''air leakage'''.  The leakage of room air out of a building, intentionally or not, is called '''exfiltration'''.  Infiltration is caused by [[wind]], negative pressurization of the building, and by [[air]] [[buoyancy force]]s known commonly as the [[stack effect]].

==Infiltration measures==
The '''infiltration rate''' is the volumetric flow rate of outside air into a building, typically in cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liters per second (LPS).  The '''[[air changes per hour|air exchange rate]]''', (''I''), is the number of interior volume air changes that occur per hour, and has units of 1/h.  The air exchange rate is also known as '''[[air changes per hour]]''' (''ACH'').

ACH is the hourly ventilation rate, divided by the building volume. It can be calculated by multiplying the building's CFM by 60, and then dividing by the building volume.  (CFM x 60)/volume

Infiltration in finished structures can often be measured directly by using [[tracer-gas leak testing]].

==Infiltration as ventilation air==
In many smaller buildings, 'forced' or 'mechanical' [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] is not used to introduce ventilation air.  Instead, [[natural ventilation]], via openable windows and other openings, exhaust fans, and infiltration are used to provide ventilation air.  Typically, at least one-third air change per hour is considered the minimum. [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.2 was adopted in 2004; it clarifies the ventilation air requirements for low-rise residences.  The Standard specifies that forced ventilation is required in houses with infiltration less than 0.35 ACH.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation for Indoor Air Quality, ASHRAE Standard 62-89, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically accomplished with [[heat recovery ventilation]] or exhaust fans running constantly or periodically.

==Controlling infiltration==
Because infiltration is uncontrolled, and admits unconditioned air, it is generally considered undesirable except for ventilation air purposes.  Typically, infiltration is minimized to reduce dust, to increase [[thermal comfort]], and to decrease energy consumption.  For all buildings, infiltration can be reduced via sealing cracks in a building's envelope, and for new construction or major renovations, by installing continuous [[Vapor barrier|air retarders]].  In buildings where forced ventilation is provided, their HVAC designers typically choose to slightly pressurize the buildings by admitting more outside air than exhausting so that infiltration is dramatically reduced.

==Energy saving==
In typical modern U.S. residences, about one-third of the [[HVAC]] energy consumption is due to infiltration.  Another third is to ground-contact, and the remainder is to heat losses and gains through windows, walls, and other thermal ''loads''.  As such, reducing infiltration can yield significant energy savings, with rapid payback.  In cold climates, with a 15 MPH wind, residences often have air exchange rates of 1.0 to 1.5 ACHs, far in excess of the ventilation air needs and are thus called ''loose construction''.  It is very easy to reduce infiltration rates to less than 1.0 ACH.  Smoke candles and blower-door tests can help identify less-than-obvious leaks.  The [[Weatherization]] article describes methods for energy savings further.  If infiltration is reduced below 0.35 ACH, it is recommended that mechanical ventilation (typically an exhaust fan or [[heat recovery ventilation]]) be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Ventilation for Indoor Air Quality, ASHRAE Standard 62-89, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interim trustee''' is a term of art in section 701 of the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]], Title 11 of the [[United States Code]].  

When a case under Chapter 7 of the Code is commenced, the [[United States Trustee]] immediately appoints an interim trustee for that case. The most important immediate duty of the interim trustee is to conduct the first meeting of creditors (sometimes called the "341 meeting"), at which the bankrupt person is required to appear and respond to questions under oath concerning the person's assets and debts (see generally {{Usc|11|341}}).

If the creditors do not elect some other person qualified to serve as trustee for the case, then the interim trustee becomes the "permanent" trustee. He or she serves as trustee for the duration of the case, but is subject to removal for good cause. In the overwhelming majority of bankruptcy cases, the interim trustee is not replaced, and serves for the entire case.

Chapter 7 trustees are selected by the U.S. Trustee from a "panel" of individuals residing or having offices in the judicial district where the bankruptcy case is filed. Federal law &lt;u&gt;prohibits&lt;/u&gt; the U.S. Trustee from requiring the trustee to be licensed as an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]]. Because trustees must be knowledgeable about bankruptcy law and procedure in order to administer their cases, most panel trustees are, however, attorneys who handle their court responsibilities as a complement to their law practices. 

The only other legal pre-requisite for the qualification of the interim trustee is the giving of a [[surety bond]] to secure compliance with the trustee's responsibilities in the case. Generally, panel trustees will file a "blanket bond" with the U.S. Trustee's office which covers all cases in which a particular trustee is serving.

The '''International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency''' ({{lang-fr|Convention internationale pour la répression du faux monnayage}}) is a 1929 [[League of Nations]] [[Multilateral treaty|treaty]] whereby states agree to criminalise acts of [[Counterfeit money|currency counterfeiting]]. It remains the principal international agreement on currency counterfeiting.

States that ratify the Convention agree to criminalise the creation, use, and exportation or importation of counterfeit currency. Under the agreement, no distinction is to be made as to what currency is the subject of the crime. Under the treaty, currency counterfeiting is an [[extradition|extraditable]] offence. States also agree to establish a central office that will forward to all other state parties cancelled specimens of their state's currency and notify the other states when changes to their currency are implemented.

The Convention was concluded in [[Geneva]] on 20 April 1929 and entered into force on 22 February 1931. As of March 2016, it has 83 state parties and remains the primary international agreement on currency counterfeiting. It was most recently ratified by [[Serbia]] in March 2016. [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]] are among the states that have signed the treaty but have not ratified it.

'''John Butrovich Jr.''' (March 22, 1910 — June 3, 1997) was an American businessman and politician.

Born in a mining camp near [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] to a [[Montenegrin American]] family, Butrovich graduated from Fairbanks High School in 1929. He then went to [[Washington State University]]. He returned to Fairbanks and was in the insurance business. From 1944 to 1958, Butrovich served in the Alaska Territorial Senate and was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In 1958, Butrovich ran in the [[Alaska gubernatorial election, 1958|election]] for [[Governor of Alaska]] and lost the election. From 1963 to 1979, Butrovich served in the [[Alaska State Senate]]. Butrovich died at his home in Fairbanks, Alaska from a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=53701 OurCampaigns.com.-John Butrovich, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Alaska Statehood Leader John Butrovich Dies at 87,' '''Sikta Daily Sentinel,''' June 4, 1997, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">'''''Jus inter gentes''''', is the body of [[treaty|treaties]], U.N. conventions, and other [[international agreements]].  Originally a [[Roman law]] concept, it later became a major part of [[public international law]]. The other major part is ''[[jus gentium]]'',  the [[Law of Nations]] (municipal law).&lt;ref&gt;Also referred to in the [[United States]] [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], Article I, Section 8, Clause 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Jus inter gentes'', literally, means "law between the peoples".&lt;ref&gt;These are [[cognate]], in the [[English language]] to justice, international, and gentiles, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is ''not'' the same as ''jus gentium'', argues Francisco Martin and his co-authors in "International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law" (2006),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521858861&amp;ss=exc Treaties, Cases, and Analysis], Francisco Martin, et al. 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-521-85886-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; because ''jus inter gentes'' includes internationally recognized [[human rights]].

[[Image:Legal Dictionaries.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Several English and Russian legal dictionaries]]
A '''law dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] that is designed and compiled to give [[information]] about terms used in the field of [[law]]. 

==Types of law dictionaries==
Distinctions are made among various types of law dictionaries.&lt;ref name=B1994&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sandro Nielsen|title= The Bilingual LSP Dictionary: Principles and Practice for Legal Language|publisher= Gunter Narr Verlag|year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differentiating factors include: 
* Number of languages covered: a [[monolingual]] law dictionary covers one [[language]], a [[bilingual]] covers two.
* Number of fields covered: a [[single-field]] dictionary covers an entire field of law, whereas a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a part of a field of law, e.g. a dictionary of [[contract]] law. 

==Quality of law dictionaries==
A good bilingual law dictionary needs to take the users' expected language and professional competences into account. The [[lexicography|lexicographers]] therefore must consider the following aspects: dictionary user research, dictionary [[wikt:typology|typology]], structure, and presentation of the relevant information. When making a law dictionary, the lexicographers attempt to present the information in such a way that the user is not burdened with excessive [[lexicographic information costs]].&lt;ref name=B1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=N2008&gt;{{cite news|author= Sandro Nielsen|title=The Effect of Lexicographical Information Costs on Dictionary Making and Use|journal=Lexikos|volume= 18|year=2008|pages= 170–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of law dictionaries==
As pointed out in Nielsen 1994, law dictionaries can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about ''legal matters independent of any te''xt (a cognitive function) – such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have entry words in one language and definitions in another language – these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with entry words in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language.&lt;ref name=B1994/&gt;

==Formats==
With the advance of technology, the legal dictionary has made its way onto the Internet and [[smartphone]]s. Law students and litigants can now look up the meaning of legal terms in a split second.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/TermsGlossary.html Glossary of legal terms] at the New York Courts website. Accessed March 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal terminology textbook==
Unlike a law dictionary, which arranges and defines legal words and phrases individually and in alphabetical order, a [[legal terminology textbook]] arranges and defines legal words and phrases in groups and by topic. As a result, a student or other person interested in understanding an array of related legal words and phrases may prefer to use a legal terminology textbook instead&lt;ref name=N2008/&gt;

The '''Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency''' ('''MHRA''') is an [[executive agency]] of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health and Social Care]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which is responsible for ensuring that [[medicine]]s and [[medical device]]s work and are acceptably safe.

MHRA was formed in 2003 with the merger of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA). In April 2013, it merged with the [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]] (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with MHRA identity being used solely for the regulatory centre within the group. The Agency employs more than 1,300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency/about | title = About us |publisher=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency |website=www.gov.uk | accessdate = 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
MHRA is divided into three main centres:
* MHRA Regulatory (the regulator for the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries)
* [[Clinical Practice Research Datalink]]
* [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]]

==History==
In 1999, the [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA) took over control of the [[General Practice Research Database]] (GPRD) from [[Office for National Statistics]]. Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) merged in 2003 to form MHRA.  In April 2012, the GPRD was expanded and relaunched as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). In April 2013, MHRA merged with the [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]] (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group.  At the same time CPRD was formally declared a separate centre of MHRA, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/CON254872|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=4 April 2013|title=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Expands|publisher=MHRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==

#Operate [[Postmarketing surveillance|post-marketing surveillance]] for [[report]]ing, investigating and monitoring of adverse drug reactions to medicines and incidents with medical devices.
#Assessment and authorisation of medicinal products for sale and supply in [[United Kingdom|UK]].
#Oversee the Notified Bodies that ensure medical device manufacturers comply with regulatory requirements before putting devices on the market.
#Operate a quality surveillance system to sample and test medicines to address quality defects and to monitor the safety and quality of unlicensed products.
#Investigate internet sales and potential counterfeiting of medicines, and prosecute where necessary.
#Regulate clinical trials of medicines and medical devices.
#Monitor and ensure compliance with statutory obligations relating to medicines and medical devices.
#Promote safe use of [[medicines]] and [[medical device|device]]s.
#Manage the [[Clinical Practice Research Datalink]] and the [[British Pharmacopoeia]].

MHRA hosts and supports a number of expert advisory bodies, including the [[Commission on Human Medicine]] which replaced the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] in 2005, and the [[British Pharmacopoeia Commission]].

As part of the European system of approval, MHRA or other national bodies can be the rapporteur or co-rapporteur for any given pharmaceutical application, taking on the bulk of the verification work on behalf of all members, while the documents are still sent to other members as and where requested.

==Funding==
MHRA is funded by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health and Social Care]] for the regulation of [[medical device]]s, whilst the costs of [[medicines]] regulation is met through fees from the [[pharmaceutical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the MHRA funded?|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/SearchHelp/Frequentlyaskedquestions/#l6|publisher=MHRA|accessdate=18 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604072443/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/SearchHelp/Frequentlyaskedquestions/#l6|archivedate=4 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to suggestions by some MPs that MHRA is too reliant on industry, and so not fully independent.&lt;ref name=flynnMP&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn MP|first=Paul|title=Early Day Motion 1197: MHRA|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/business-papers/commons/early-day-motions/edm-detail1/?session=2012-13&amp;edmnumber=1197|work=Session 2012-13|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

MHRA has been criticised by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Health Committee for, among other things, lacking [[transparency (social)|transparency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry, Fourth Report of Session 2004–05, Volume I|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/42.pdf|work=Page 5: "Greater transparency is also fundamental to the medicines regulatory system. There has to be better public access to materials considered by the MHRA prior to licensing"|publisher=House of Commons Health Committee|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for inadequately checking drug licensing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry, Fourth Report of Session 2004–05, Volume I|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/42.pdf|work=Page 4: "the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has failed to adequately scrutinise licensing data and its post-marketing surveillance is inadequate. "|publisher=House of Commons Health Committee|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MHRA (and US [[Food and Drug Administration]]) have been criticised in the book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldacre|first=Ben|title=Bad pharma : how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients|year=2012|publisher=Fourth Estate|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-735074-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] in evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Committee: Evidence|year=2004|publisher=House of Commons Health Committee|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJWffo-8YWUC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;ots=vvBg9Npu1k&amp;dq=mhra%20%22regulatory%20capture%22&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=mhra%20%22regulatory%20capture%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; for having undergone [[regulatory capture]]; advancing the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public.

Donald Light at the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]] summarised as such:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Light|first=Donald|title=Rapid Response to Don't Blame it all on the Bogey|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/334/7606/1250?tab=responses|work=2007|publisher=British Medical Journal|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the industry has shaped the rules of the regulators, funded their operations, and lobbied them constantly in a classic pattern of regulatory capture....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Move Your Domain Day''' is a [[domain name]] transferring initiative, initially in response to [[GoDaddy]]'s support of the [[United States]] [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA).  It was first held on 29 December 2011, originating from a post on [[Reddit]] and spearheaded by [[domain registrar]] [[Namecheap]].&lt;ref name="SEJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/go-daddy-flip-flops-sopa-stance-before-boycotters-move-your-domain-day/38197/|title=GoDaddy Flip-Flops SOPA Stance Before Boycotters Move Your Domain Day|last=Bailey|first=Todd|date=28 December 2011|publisher=Search Engine Journal|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Namecheap began an initiative to make Move Your Domain Day an annual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namecheap.com/moveyourdomainday.aspx|title=MoveYourDomainDay|date=29 December 2011|publisher=Namecheap|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second event was held on 22 January 2013. The third time was held on 5 February 2014.  The fourth was held on 27 January 2015. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Reddit]], and domain registrars [[Name.com]] and [[Hover (domain registrar)|Hover]] have also participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57349256-501465/dumping-go-daddy-rivals-offer-domain-transfer-day-deals/|title=Dumping GoDaddy? Rivals offer domain transfer day deals|last=Ngak|first=Chenda|date=28 December 2011|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Namecheap has defined the initiative as "an annual protest and a commemoration of sorts that will continue to shine a light on the [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|issue of a free and open internet]]."&lt;ref name="Elliots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elliotsblog.com/namecheap-makes-move-your-domain-day-an-annual-protest-5198|title=NameCheap Makes "Move Your Domain Day" an Annual Protest|last=Silver|first=Elliot|date=14 January 2013|publisher=Elliot's Blog|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The movement likely originated from a post made on [[Reddit]] on 22 December 2011, when a user stated that he would be moving 51 domains away from GoDaddy, and recommended others to do the same.  The thread received significant attention from the [[Reddit]] community, gaining over 37,000 up votes from users (but also over 32,000 down votes) in favor of the initiative and many comments criticizing GoDaddy's support of the measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/|title=GoDaddy supports SOPA, I'm transferring 51 domains &amp; suggesting a move your domain day|publisher=Reddit|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/nn4j5/thanks_to_reddit_godaddy_faces_move_your_domain/|title=Thanks to Reddit, GoDaddy faces "Move Your Domain Day" boycott over SOPA support|date=22 December 2011|publisher=Reddit|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable examples of the backlash against GoDaddy include Ben Huh, CEO of the [[Cheezburger Network]], who threatened to transfer over one thousand domains away from GoDaddy, and [[Wikimedia Foundation]], the nonprofit company behind many websites including [[Wikipedia]], which decided to move all its domains away from GoDaddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/03/09/transfer-of-wikipedia-sites-from-godaddy-complete| title=Transfer of Wikipedia sites from GoDaddy complete |author=Michelle Paulson| publisher=Wikimedia Foundation| date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the backlash, numerous domain registrars offered coupons for discounted domain transfers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dotcomonly.com/godaddy-promo-code/|title=GoDaddy Promo Codes, GoDaddy Coupons: 90% off (2018)|date=2018-02-01|work=DotComOnly|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while also offering to donate a portion of profits to the EFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehostingnews.com/namecheap-announces-move-your-domain-day-22290.html|title=Namecheap Announces Move Your Domain Day|date=27 December 2011|publisher=The Hosting News|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GoDaddy itself changed its stance on SOPA in the days prior to 29 December in an attempt to minimize damage.&lt;ref name="SEJ" /&gt;

Reports up to 29 December described GoDaddy as "hemorrhaging" customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheredar|first=Tom|title=Not even a shift to full SOPA opposition can stop GoDaddy from hemorrhaging customers|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/29/not-even-a-shift-to-full-sopa-opposition-can-stop-go-daddy-from-hemorrhaging-customers/|accessdate=2012-01-22|newspaper=Venturebeat.com|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosker|first=Bianca|title=Wikipedia Ditching GoDaddy Over SOPA, Jimmy Wales Says|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/26/wikipedia-godaddy-sopa_n_1170034.html|accessdate=2012-01-22|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 2011 (Christmas Day), GoDaddy lost a net 16,191 domains, mostly as a result of the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2011-12-26c/Godaddy_Looses_Domains.._This_time_for_real..html|title=Godaddy Loses Domains..

== 2013 event ==
In 2012, Namecheap relaunched the initiative and set the date for the second Move Your Domain Day as 22 January 2013.  On that day, Namecheap has announced that domain transfers will be greatly discounted, and between $0.50 and $1.50 per domain transferred will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (depending on the total number of transfers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namecheap.com/2nd-moveyourdomainday.aspx|title=Move Your Domain Day 2013|publisher=Namecheap|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this announcement, Shari Steele, the Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, stated that "EFF is pleased to join Namecheap in celebrating digital rights within the greater the Internet community. The funds donated from the moveyourdomainday effort will ensure EFF can continue to fight for free expression for Internet users worldwide."&lt;ref name="Elliots" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/namecheap-launches-second-annual-moveyourdomainday-protect-online-freedom-142621953.html|title=Namecheap Launches Second Annual MoveYourDomainDay to Protect Online Freedom|publisher=Yahoo! News|date=14 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 event ==
On 5 February 2014, each  .com, .net, .org, .info and .biz domains is $3.98, up to 50 domain transfer per account, only domain that's not have been transferred out from Namecheap can qualify. Donation were also given to EFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.namecheap.com/campaigns/2014/mydd-folder/moveyourdomainday-feb-5-over.aspx|title=Namecheap 2014 Campaigns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mudbricks in Palestine 2011.jpg|thumb|New, unlaid mudbricks in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], [[West Bank]] (2011)]]
[[File:Choghazanbil2.jpg|right|thumb|Mudbrick was used for the construction of [[Elam|Elamite]] [[ziggurat]]s—some of the world's largest and oldest constructions. ''[[Choqa Zanbil]]'', a 13th-century BC [[ziggurat]] in [[Iran]], is similarly constructed from clay bricks combined with burnt bricks.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Ghirshman, La ziggourat de Tchoga-Zanbil (Susiane), Comptes-rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, vol. 98 lien Issue 2, pp. 233-238, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''mudbrick''' or mud-brick is a [[brick]], made of a mixture of [[loam]], [[mud]], [[sand]] and [[water]] mixed with a binding material such as [[rice]] husks or [[straw]].

In warm regions with very little [[timber]] available to fuel a [[kiln]], bricks were generally sun dried. In some cases brickmakers extended the life of mud bricks by putting fired bricks on top or covering them with [[stucco]].

==Ancient world==
[[File:Mud-brick stamped with seal impression of raised relief of the Treasury of the Vizier. From Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. 12th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Mud-brick stamped with seal impression of raised relief of the Treasury of the Vizier. From Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. 12th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
The [[South Asia]]n inhabitants of [[Mehrgarh]] constructed, and lived in, mud brick houses between 7000–3300 BC.&lt;ref name=Possehl&gt;Possehl, Gregory L. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Mud bricks used at more than 15 reported sites in 3rd millennium BC are attributed as major cultural trait in the ancient [[Indus valley civilization]].  In the [[Mature Harappan]] phase fired mudbricks were used.&lt;ref name="Bricks and Urbanism in Indus Valley"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1285495/Bricks_and_urbanism_in_the_Indus_Valley_rise_and_decline Bricks and urbanism in the Indus Valley rise and decline], bricks in antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mudbricks were adopted in the [[Middle East]] from Indus Valley Cities during the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] period.  The [[Mesopotam]]ians used sun-dried bricks in their city construction; &lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen, ''A Comparative Study of Six City-state Cultures'', Københavns universitet Polis centret (2002) Videnskabernes Selskab, 144 pages  {{ISBN|87-7876-316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically these bricks were flat on the bottom and curved on the top, called plano-convex mudbricks. Some bricks were formed in a square mould and rounded so that the middle was thicker than the ends. 
In Ancient Egypt, workers gathered mud from the Nile river, and then dug a pit and poured the mud into the pit. Workers then tramped on the mud while straw was added to solidify the mold.  

In [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] at the [[Knossos]] site there is [[archaeological]] evidence that sun-dried bricks were used in the [[Neolithic]] period (e.g. prior to 3400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudbricks were used to some extent in pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and mudbrick use increased at the time of Roman influence.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', 1999, Routledge, 938 pages  {{ISBN|0-415-18589-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adobe==
{{main article|Adobe}}
In areas of Spanish influence, mud-brick construction is called [[adobe]], and developed over time into a complete system of wall protection, flat roofing and finishes which in modern English usage is often referred to as ''adobe style'', regardless of the construction method.

{{Tort law}}
'''Negligence in employment''' encompasses several causes of action in [[tort law]] that arise where an [[employer]] is held liable for the [[tortious]] acts of an [[employee]] because that employer was [[Negligence|negligent]] in providing the employee with the ability to engage in a particular act. Four basic causes of action may arise from such a scenario: '''negligent hiring''', '''negligent retention''', '''negligent supervision''' and '''negligent training'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Kathryn|last2=Gardner|first2=Susan|title=Looking for Dr. Jekyll but hiring Mr. Hyde: Preventing negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and training|journal=Hospital Topics|date=2000|volume=78|pages=14-22|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00185860009596542?journalCode=vhos20|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=When is an Employer Liable for an Employee's Motor Vehicle Accident|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/employer-liability.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=21 September 2017|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While negligence in employment may overlap with [[negligent entrustment]] and [[vicarious liability]], the concepts are distinct grounds of liability.

==Negligence==
As with all [[negligence]] claims, the claimant must prove four elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|first1=Thomas C.|title=A Primer on the Patterns of Negligence|journal=Louisiana Law Review|date=1992|volume=53|page=1509|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/louilr53&amp;div=59&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the defendant (in this case, the employer) owed them a [[duty of care]];
*That this duty was breached;
*That the claimant was injured as a result of the breach;&lt;ref name=F&amp;J&gt;Feliu &amp; Johnson, ''Negligence in Employment Law'' {{ISBN|1-57018-263-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57018-263-1}} (2002) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Causation (law)]]; [[Causation in English law]]) and
*The injury to the plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach.&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt;

In order for such a duty to exist, the injury to the claimant must be "reasonably foreseeable",&lt;ref&gt;see [[Negligence]]; [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, for example, that the type of employment must be one in which an unfit employee could cause harm of the type which occurred,&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt; and the claimant is the type of person to whom such harm would be a "reasonably foreseeable consequence".&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[The Wagon Mound (No 2)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent hiring==
'''Negligent hiring''' may be found where the employee (the tortfeasor) had a reputation or record that showed his/her propensity to misuse the kind of authority given by the employer, and this record would have been easily discoverable by the employer, had the employer exercised 'due diligence'. For example, a victim of [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace may have a cause of action for negligent hiring on the part of her employer if she can show that the employer was aware of the harasser's termination from a previous position for the same behaviour.

===Negligent hiring preventive measures===
In the sexual harassment example described above, the employer may be held liable for negligent hiring if the harasser had a previous history of harassment. This is because an employer has an obligation to its employees and others who will come in contact with them to provide a safe and productive working environment.

One preventive measure for negligent hiring is to perform a reasonable investigation on potential employees. This may include conducting interviews, verifying work and educational histories, checking references and conducting a [[background check]] on all applicants who have accepted an offer of conditional hire, and if an adverse assessment is found, to deny employment to such an applicant.

Note that simply conducting a criminal background check on an applicant may not be a sufficient investigation. In [[Minnesota]], for example, such a check was determined to be insufficient by the court in ''Ponticas v. K.M.S. Investments,'' 331 N.W.2d 907 ([[Minnesota Supreme Court|Minn.]] 1983). This will not guarantee the employer will not be held liable, but it will show that the employer used a diligent search to screen potential harassers from the workplace, and will assist the employer in demonstrating that it took reasonable care in hiring.
It is important to also note that, in the [[United States]], background checks for job applicants are subject to the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Credit Reporting Act|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2b1fab8de5438fc52f2a326fc6592874&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title16/16CIsubchapF.tpl|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an adverse assessment is found in an employment screen, the applicant has the right to dispute the report.

==Negligent retention, supervision, and training==
'''Negligent retention''' occurs where a party failed to remove an employee from a position of authority or responsibility after it became apparent that the employee was in fact misusing that authority or responsibility in a way that posed a danger to others.

Negligent supervision is closely related, as it occurs where a party fails to reasonably monitor or control the actions of an employee. A variation of negligent retention or supervision is negligent training, which arises where the employer's training of the employee fails to prevent the employee from engaging in the acts that injure the claimant, or fails to remediate a pattern of behaviour which leads to an injury. Suits for negligent retention often plead negligent supervision or training as an alternate theory, as the employer who knows of an employee's improper conduct should either terminate that employee, or take steps to penalise that conduct and/or train the employee not to engage in that conduct.

==Related doctrines==

===Negligent entrustment compared===
[[Negligent entrustment]] arises where the entrustor is held liable for [[negligence]] because they negligently provided the entrustee with a dangerous instrument, and the entrusted party caused injury to a third party with that instrument. 
Where such a claim is brought against an [[employer]], the employer will be held liable if the entrustee's record was known, or would have been easily discoverable, to the employer. For example, if a [[bus]] company hires a driver who has a record of reckless driving, of which the company could have learned through a search of publicly available records, the company would be liable for the negligent entrustment of the bus to that driver, should the driver cause an accident.

Negligent entrustment differs from negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training in two key respects. 
* First, negligent hiring and the related torts require the employment itself of the tortfeasor causing the injury, whereas a party can be held liable for negligent entrustment to any person.
* Second, an employer can be found liable for negligent hiring even without provision of any dangerous instrument to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for '''both''' negligent entrustment and hiring.

===Vicarious liability compared===
[[Vicarious liability]] is a separate theory of liability, which provides that an employer is liable for the torts of an employee under an [[agency (law)|agency]] theory, even if the employer did nothing wrong. The principle is that the acts of an agent of the company are assumed, by law, to be the acts of the company itself, provided the tortfeasor was acting within the course of his employment.

By contrast, each of the above negligence theories requires proof of actual negligence on part of the employer ''before'' the injury occurred, for example when the employee was first hired.

The '''Pakistani nationality law''' governs [[citizenship]] of the Islamic Republic of [[Pakistan]]. The principal legislation determining nationality, the Pakistan Citizenship Act, was passed by the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] on 13 April 1951. Since [[Cambodia]] changed its laws, Pakistan is the only country in Asia with unconditional ''[[jus soli]]'' citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite act |title= Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951|number= II|date= 1951|url= http://www.punjabcode.punjab.gov.pk/public/dr/THE%20PAKISTAN%20CITIZENSHIP%20ACT,%201951.doc.pdf|accessdate= 2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship==
Before the creation of Pakistan, its territories were part of the [[British Indian Empire]] (which included modern-day India, Bangladesh and itself) and its people were [[British subjects]]. Pakistan was founded on 14 August 1947 as a state for Muslims and held the status of a [[Dominion]] in the [[British Commonwealth]]; it included modern-day [[Bangladesh]], which was known as [[East Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] and became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Upon independence from [[United Kingdom|British colonial rule]], several millions of Muslims emigrated to Pakistan from India, and several millions of Hindus and Sikhs who had been residing in what became Pakistan emigrated to India, raising a number of citizenship issues.

===Pakistani Citizenship Act 1951===

The Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 was enacted on 13 April 1951; stating the purpose of it is "to make provision for citizenship of Pakistan".&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; The Act has been amended several times, the last occurring in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/262270/ch14annexj.pdf|title=Chapter 14: registration and naturalisation under legislation other than the British Nationality Act 1981 (Annex J: Pakistani Citizenship Law)|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 29 November 2013|website= gov.uk|publisher= UK Visas and Immigration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is divided into 23 sections, each one outlining a different provision of citizenship, of which the most significant are:

|}

==Dual nationality==
Since independence, the growth of [[expatriate]] Pakistani communities in the Middle East, Europe and North America has led to several changes in Pakistani nationality law. [[Dual citizenship]] is allowed in certain specified circumstances:&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

:* where the citizen who is acquiring the second nationality is under the age of 21

===Controversial issues===
Both Pakistan and India law claim to the [[Kashmir conflict|disputed region of Kashmir]], which has been the subject of [[Indo-Pakistani Wars|numerous wars]] between the two countries. The Pakistani Citizenship Act of 1951 allowed persons who were subjects of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to travel under a [[Pakistani passport]] and be considered a citizen of Pakistan without prejudice.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;

The independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 led to the abandonment in the [[Bengali people|Bengali]]-majority state of around half a million "[[stranded Pakistanis]]", who traced their ethnolinguistic heritage to the [[Bihar]] region. Despite official promises, Bangladesh refuses to accept them or to recognise them as citizens. Conversely, a continuous migration of Bangladeshis between 1971 and 1995 led their population to cross the 1.6 million mark, which was only 10,000 at the time of separation. The migrants are mostly illegal and are not given the citizenship, as they migrated after the separation.

For political and other reasons, the 1.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e487016|title=UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=www.unhcr.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; registered [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan refugees in Pakistan]] are not given Pakistani nationality, most of whom were born in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=94962|title=PAKISTAN: Tolerance wanes as perceptions of Afghan refugees change|date=February 27, 2012|publisher=[[Irin]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts''''', 472 U.S. 797 (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts|472|797|1985}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Conflict of laws in the United States|conflict of laws]] case decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]].

==Facts==
[[Phillips Petroleum Company]] was sued in a [[class action]] lawsuit in [[Kansas]] for overdue interest payments. The lawsuit was joined by plaintiffs from all fifty U.S. states. The Kansas courts applied Kansas law to determine the [[legal liability]] of the defendant and remedies as to all plaintiffs, including the 97% who had no contacts with Kansas. Phillips appealed, arguing that the trial court had to look to the laws of different states for different plaintiffs. The [[Kansas Supreme Court]] upheld the decision, finding that it is permissible for the absent plaintiffs to have less contact with Kansas than the defendants, and that these plaintiffs have chosen Kansas law. The Kansas Supreme Court found that forum law controlled absent 'compelling reasons' for another law to control, comparing the suit to one against a 'common fund' in Kansas.

Phillips also noted that many of the absent plaintiffs were absent because they were deemed to have 'consented' to be represented by the class representative by not returning a form to opt-out of the litigation. Phillips contended that failure of the absent plaintiffs to request exclusion can not equal consent, and therefore that the Kansas court has no jurisdiction over the claims of absent plaintiffs. Phillips asserted that adverse decisions of Kansas court may bind absent plaintiffs by ''[[res judicata]]''.

==Issues==
The Supreme Court addressed two questions. The first was whether the use of Kansas law for all plaintiffs violated [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process]], or the [[Full Faith and Credit clause]]. The second was whether it was sufficient to distribute a form and then deem the recipients to be a party to the litigation if they did not opt out of the litigation.

==Result==
The Supreme Court held that the defendant's desire is irrelevant, otherwise forum shopping would rule. However, it also found that the state can not use assumption of jurisdiction as weight towards applying its own law. The use of Kansas law for all plaintiffs was held to be arbitrary and unfair; Kansas must consider the law of each state from which parties have come.

As for the opt-out issue, fewer burdens on plaintiffs means less Due Process required, so opt-out was permissible.

Court notes that individual stakes are too small for the case to be brought as anything but a class action – no one would go to the expense of suing for $100, so plaintiffs get no day in court other than this action. Opt-out is enough, so long as state provides a process where absent plaintiffs get notice and opportunity to be heard.

As for minimum contacts, class action plaintiffs need no contacts if they consent to jurisdiction.

===Concurring opinion===
Justice Stevens wrote that Kansas actually did examine laws of other states and found no direct or substantive conflict; ergo, no problem with Kansas applying Kansas law.

The '''right to sexuality''' incorporates the right to express one's sexuality and to be free from discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]]. In specific, it relates to the [[human rights]] of people of diverse sexual orientation, including [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people, and the protection of those rights, although it is equally applicable to [[heterosexuality]]. The right to sexuality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is based on the universality of human rights and the inalienable nature of rights belonging to every person by virtue of being human.

No right to sexuality exists explicitly in [[international human rights law]]; rather, it is found in a number of [[international human rights instruments]] including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

==Definition==
The concept of the right to sexuality is difficult to define, as it comprises various rights from within the framework of international human rights law.

Sexual orientation is defined in the Preamble to the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] as "each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}, Preamble.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

The UDHR provides for non-discrimination in Article 2, which states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sexual orientation can be read into Article 2 as "other status" or alternatively as falling under "sex".

In the ICCPR, Article 2 sets out a similar provision for non-discrimination:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Toonen v Australia]] the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] (UNHRC) found that the reference to "sex" in Article 2 of the ICCPR included sexual orientation, thereby making sexual orientation prohibited grounds of distinction in respect of the enjoyment of rights under the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;(488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be free from discrimination is the basis of the right to sexuality, but it is closely related to the exercise and protection of other fundamental human rights.

==Background==
Individuals of diverse sexual orientation have been discriminated against historically and continue to be a "vulnerable" group in society today. Forms of discrimination experienced by people of diverse sexual orientation include the denial of the [[right to life]], the [[right to work]] and the [[right to privacy]], non-recognition of personal and family relationships, interference with human [[dignity]], interference with [[security of the person]], violations of the right to be free from [[torture]], discrimination in access to economic, social and cultural rights, including housing, health and education, and pressure to remain silent and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy-eight countries maintain laws that make same-sex consensual sex between adults a criminal offence, and seven countries (or parts thereof) impose the death penalty for same-sex consensual sex. They are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Mauritania, Sudan, the twelve northern states of Nigeria, and the southern parts of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf ''State Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws criminalising same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults'', The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, edited by Lucas Paoli Itaborahy, May 2012, pages 4 and 13] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611181908/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to sexuality has only relatively recently become the subject of international concern, with the regulation of sexuality traditionally falling within the jurisdiction of the [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichrp.org/files/reports/47/137_web.pdf International Council on Human Rights] ''Sexuality and Human Rights'' (2009) at 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Today numerous international [[non-governmental organisations]] and [[intergovernmental organisations]] are engaged in the protection of the rights of people of diverse sexual orientation as it is increasingly recognised that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is widespread and an unacceptable violation of human rights.

==Acts of Violence==
Acts of violence against LGBT people are often especially vicious compared to other [[hate crime|bias-motivated crime]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [22].&lt;/ref&gt; and include killings, kidnappings, beatings, rape, and psychological violence, including threats, coercion and arbitrary depravations of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of violent acts against people of diverse sexual orientation are too numerous to account here, and they occur in all parts of the world. A particularly distressing example is the sexual assault and murder of fifteen lesbians in [[Thailand]] in March 2012. In that example, two lesbian couples were killed by men who objected to their relationship and who were embarrassed when they were unable to convince the women into heterosexual relationships with themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/1506.html Thai police ignore fifteen killings of lesbians and toms] (27 March 2012) International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often acts of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation are perpetrated by the victim's own family. In a case in [[Zimbabwe]], the multiple rape of a lesbian was organised by her own family in an attempt to "cure" her of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G02/104/28/PDF/G0210428.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences] Commission on Human Rights, 31 January 2002, E/CN.4/2002/83 at [102].&lt;/ref&gt;

In those cases, as in many other cases of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation, State law enforcement authorities are complicit in human rights abuses for failing to persecute violators of rights.

==Breach of the Right to Privacy==
{{Main| Right to Privacy}}
The [[right to privacy]] is a protected freedom under the UDHR,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICCPR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}, Article 17.&lt;/ref&gt; which reflects the "widespread, if not universal, human need to pursue certain activities within an intimate sphere, free of outside interference. The possibility to do so is fundamental to personhood."&lt;ref&gt;E Heinze ''Sexual Orientation: A Human Right'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht, 1995) at 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Intimate relationships, whether between two people of the same sex or of different sexes, are among those activities that are subject to a right of privacy.

It has been successfully argued in a number of cases that criminalization of homosexual relationships is an interference with the right to privacy, including decisions in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the UNHRC.&lt;ref&gt;''Dudgeon v UK'' A 45 (1981); (1982) 4 EHRR 149; ''Norris v Ireland'' A 142 (1988); (1988) 13 EHRR 186; ''Toonen v Australia'' (488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedom to decide on one's own consensual adult relationships, including the gender of that person, without the interference of the State is a fundamental human right. To prohibit the relationships of people of diverse sexual orientation is a breach of the right to sexuality and the right to privacy.

==Freedom of Expression, Assembly and Association==
{{Main| Freedom of Speech| Freedom of Assembly}}
Every person, by virtue of their [[individual autonomy]], is free to express themselves, assemble and join in association with others. [[Freedom of expression]] is a protected human right under Article 19 of the UDHR and  Article 19 of the ICCPR, as is the right to [[freedom of assembly]] under Article 20 of the UDHR and Article 21 of the ICCPR.

LGBT people are discriminated against in respect of their ability to defend and promote their rights. Gay pride marches, peaceful demonstrations and other events promoting LGBT rights are often banned by State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/121/89/PDF/G0612189.pdf?OpenElement Report by the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance] (2006) Commission of Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.1 at [72].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 gay pride marches were banned in Serbia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15134182 Serbia bans gay pride march citing violence fears], (2011) BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; and another march in Moscow was broken up by police, who arrested thirty leading gay rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/05/27/moscow-police-will-break-up-illegal-gay-pride-march/ Moscow police will break up banned gay pride march], (2011) Pink News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogyakarta Principles==
In 2005, twenty-nine experts undertook the drafting of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was intended to set out experiences of human rights violations against people of diverse sexual orientation and transgender people, the application of international human rights law to those experiences and the nature of obligations on States in respect of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles can be broadly categorised into the following:
* Principles 1 to 3 set out the universality of human rights and their application to all persons.
* Principles 4 to 11 address fundamental rights to life, freedom from violence and torture, privacy, access to justice and freedom from arbitrary detention.
* Principles 12 to 18 set out non-discrimination in relation of economic, social and cultural rights, including employment, accommodation, social security, education and health.
* Principles 19 to 21 emphasise the importance of freedom of expression, identity and sexuality, without State interference, including peaceful assembly.
* Principles 22 and 23 set out the right to seek asylum from persecution of based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 24 to 26 set out the right to participate in family and cultural life and public affairs.
* Principle 27 sets out the right to promote and defend human rights without discrimination based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 28 and 29 emphasise the importance of holding those who violate human rights accountable, and ensuring redress for those who face rights violations.

The Yogyakarta Principles is an instrument of [[soft law]] and is therefore not binding. But it does provide an important standard for States in their obligation to protect the rights of individuals of diverse sexual orientation.

==The Right to Sexuality and the United Nations==
{{Main| Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the United Nations}}

On June 17, 2011 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in a Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, adopted by a vote of 23 in favour, 19 against, and 3 abstentions, requested the commission of a study to document discriminatory laws and acts of violence against people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E UN Human Rights Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624081557/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E |date=2011-06-24 }}, June 17, 2011; see also [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38762 UN rights body hits out against violence based on sexual orientation], (2011) UN News Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Resolution was intended to shed light on how international human rights could be used to prevent acts of violence and discrimination against people of diverse sexual orientation.

On 15 December 2011 the first Report on human rights of LGBT people was released by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report made the following recommendations. In order to prevent such acts of violence occurring, [[United Nations Member States]] are recommended to:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [84].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promptly investigate all reported killings and serious incidents of violence against LGBT people, regardless of whether carried out privately or publicly, by State or non-State actors, ensuring accountability for such violations and the establishment of reporting mechanisms for such incidents.
* Take measures to prevent torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensure accountability for such violations and establish reporting mechanisms.
* Repeal laws that criminalize homosexuality, same-sex sexual conduct, other criminal laws that detain people based on their sexuality and abolish the death penalty for offences involving consensual sexual relations within same-sex relationships.
* Enact comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, ensuring that combating discrimination based on sexual orientation is in the mandates of national human rights bodies.
* Ensure that freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly can be exercised safely without discrimination on sexual orientation or gender identity.
* Implement appropriate training programmes for law enforcement personnel, and support public information campaigns to counter homophobia and transphobia amongst the general public and in schools.
* Facilitate legal recognition of preferred gender of transgender persons.

Further action is yet to be taken by the United Nations, although a proposed declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was brought before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2008. However, that declaration has not been officially adopted by the General Assembly and remains open for signatories.

==Passage of Amendment 2==

In 1992, Colorado voters approved by [[initiative]] an amendment to the [[Colorado]] state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize homosexuals or bisexuals as a [[protected class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1986&amp;context=bclr | title =Colorado's Amendment 2 and Homosexuals' Right to Equal Protection of the Law |last1= Zamansky |first= Stephen |journal= [[Boston College Law Review]] |volume= 35 |issue= 1 |pages= 221–258 |date= December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; The amendment stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This Section of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That amendment was approved by a vote of 53% to 47%.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news |last= Gascoyne |first= Stephen |url= http://m.csmonitor.com/1992/1203/03031.html |title= Anti-Gay-Rights Law Leads To Colorado Boycott Calls |work= [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date= December 3, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to public opinion surveys, Coloradans strongly opposed discrimination based upon sexual orientation, but at the same time they opposed [[affirmative action]] based upon sexual orientation, and the latter concern is what led to the adoption of Amendment 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Turner |first= William |url= http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wjlgs/issues/2007-spring/turnernobanner.pdf |title= The Gay Rights State: Wisconsin's Pioneering Legislation to Prohibit Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation |format= PDF |journal= Wisconsin Women's Law Journal |volume= 22 |pages= 91, 104 |date= 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611165520/http://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wjlgs/issues/2007-spring/turnernobanner.pdf |archivedate= June 11, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerstmann&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerstmann |first=Evan |title=The Constitutional Underclass: Gays, Lesbians, and the Failure of Class-Based Equal Protection |pages=100–102, 135–138 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1999 |isbn=0226288595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The governor of Colorado, [[Roy Romer]], opposed the measure, but also opposed retaliatory boycotts against his state.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt;

A former [[Colorado Supreme Court]] justice, [[Jean Dubofsky]], was the lead attorney. A state trial court issued a permanent injunction against the amendment, and upon appeal, the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] ruled that the amendment was subject to "[[strict scrutiny]]" under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|federal Constitution]].&lt;ref name=Evans1&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Evans v.

The state supreme court held that Amendment 2 infringed on the fundamental right of gays to participate equally in the political process.  Regarding the trial court's finding that homosexuals were not a [[suspect class]], the Colorado Supreme Court said: "This ruling has not been appealed and thus, we do not address it."

The majority of the Colorado Supreme Court acknowledged that Amendment 2 would not affect Colorado law that generally protects people from discrimination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Colorado law currently proscribes discrimination against persons who are not suspect classes....Of course Amendment 2 is not intended to have any effect on this legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adoption of anti-discrimination laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.&lt;ref name=Evans2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Walsh |first= Kevin |title= Throwing Stones: Rational Basis Review Triumphs over Homophobia |journal= Seton Hall Law Review |volume= 27 |page= 1064 |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dissenting justice on the Colorado Supreme Court argued that neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right was involved in the case, and thus he would have applied a rational basis test instead of strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=Evans2 /&gt;

==U.S. Supreme Court ruling==
The case was argued on October 10, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nO093wNz1PoC&amp;pg=PT286&amp;lpg=PT286 |title= The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions |last= Hall |first= Kermit |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |page= 286 |isbn= 978-0195379396 |year= 2009 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 1996, the court ruled 6–3 that Colorado's Amendment 2 was unconstitutional, though on different reasoning from the Colorado courts. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion, and was joined by [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]]. The Court majority held that the Colorado constitutional amendment targeting homosexuals based upon animosity lacked a rational relation to any legitimate governmental purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Romer v. Evans  |vol= 517 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= 620 |pinpoint= |court= |date= 1996 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the state's argument that Amendment 2 blocked homosexuals merely from receiving "special rights", Kennedy wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amendment 2's reach may not be limited to specific laws passed for the benefit of gays and lesbians. It is a fair, if not necessary, inference from the broad language of the amendment that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings....The state court did not decide whether the amendment has this effect, however, and neither need we.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While leaving that question unresolved by his opinion, Kennedy concluded that the amendment imposed a special disability upon homosexuals by forbidding them to seek safeguards "without constraint".&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; Instead of applying "[[strict scrutiny]]" to Amendment 2 (as the Colorado Supreme Court had done), Kennedy wrote that it did not even meet the much lower requirement of having a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose:&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class that it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/PX0619.pdf |format= PDF |title= Chapter 14: Other Indicia of Animus Against LGBT People by State and Local Officials, 1980–Present |publisher= United States District Court for the Northern District of California |date= June 30, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120305041055/https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/PX0619.pdf |archivedate= March 5, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Amendment 2] is at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kennedy did not go into depth in rejecting the claims put forward in support of the law (e.g. protecting the rights of landlords to evict gay tenants if they found homosexuality morally offensive), instead holding that the law was so unique as to "confound this normal process of judicial review" and "defies...conventional inquiry."&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;  He elaborated:  "It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort."&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;

Finding that "laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected," the Court inferred that the passage of Amendment 2 was born of a "bare...desire to harm a politically unpopular group".&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;  The Court added: "[I]f the constitutional conception of 'equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a ''legitimate'' governmental interest."(emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Romer v.

==Dissenting opinion==
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the dissent, joined by Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] and Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]. Scalia asserted that Amendment 2 did not deprive anyone of the "protection [afforded by] general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings", which he said was confirmed by the Colorado Supreme Court and not disputed by Justice Kennedy's opinion.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;  Scalia's dissent said Amendment 2 merely provided that homosexuals "cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws".  His objections also included these:

* Regarding the Court's earlier decision in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'',&lt;ref name=Bowers/&gt; Scalia wrote:  "If it is rational to criminalize the conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those with a self-avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct."
* ''[[Davis v. Beason]]'' (1890)&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Davis v. Beason|volume=133|page=333|pin=|year=1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had held that laws against polygamy were not an "impermissible targeting" of polygamists, and Scalia asked: "Has the Court concluded that the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality is not?"
* The Court, Scalia said, was engaged in [[judicial activism]]; as the Constitution says nothing on the topic, it should be decided by democratic processes.  The dissent added: "it [is] no business of the courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war. But the Court today has done so, not only by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the victory away from traditional forces, but even by verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes."&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;

The dissent concluded as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scalia took the rare step of omitting the word "respectfully" when he wrote "I dissent" at the end of his opinion.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://harvardlawreview.org/2011/03/from-consensus-to-collegiality-the-origins-of-the-respectful-dissent/ |title= From Consensus to Collegiality: The Origins of the 'Respectful" Dissent' |work= [[Harvard Law Review]] |date= March 2011 |volume= 124 |number= 5 |page= 1306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly commentary==
The Court's opinion in ''Romer'' did not closely follow established equal protection doctrine (Amendment 2 "defied...conventional inquiry" wrote Justice Kennedy), and the opinion led to much discussion by scholars and lawyers.&lt;ref name=Wexler&gt;{{cite book |last= Wexler |first= Jay |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=G9A9bTAuFFkC&amp;pg=PT116 |title= The Odd Clauses: Understanding the Constitution Through Ten of Its Most Curious Provisions |page= 116 |publisher= Beacon Press |year= 2011 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One particular scholarly article that received widespread attention was by [[Akhil Amar]], a prominent law professor at [[Yale Law School|Yale]].&lt;ref name=Wexler /&gt; Amar wrote:&lt;ref name=Amar&gt;{{cite journal |last= Amar |first= Akhil |url= http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/936 |title= Attainder and Amendment 2: Romer's Rightness |journal= Michigan Law Review |volume= 95 |page= 203 |year= 1996 |doi=10.2307/1290134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Constitution does not require that "special" antidiscrimination rights, once extended, irrevocably vest via some magic and antidemocratic one-way ratchet.  And if Denver, Aspen, and Boulder can repeal these ordinances, presumably the Colorado legislature can repeal them by statute; and so too the people of Colorado can repeal them by state constitutional amendment (via initiative or referendum). To think otherwise is terminally silly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Still, Amar asserted that Amendment 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause (although he preferred an alternative argument based on the [[Bill of attainder|Attainder Clause]]).  Regarding the Equal Protection Clause, Amar wrote:&lt;ref name=Amar /&gt;

&lt;Blockquote&gt;Under Amendment 2, heterosexuals could win local ordinances and state laws protecting themselves from being discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation, but nonheteros could not win symmetric ordinances and laws.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Putting aside the odds of discrimination against heterosexuals, Amar suggested that even if Amendment 2 had barred special protection for both heterosexuals and homosexuals, that still would have been unconstitutional because it would single out groups by name for harm, just like a law that says "Akhil Reed Amar shall be ineligible for a private immigration bill or a suspension of deportation".&lt;ref name=Amar /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Misleading.&lt;/sup&gt;

The "one-way ratchet" mentioned by Amar has been discussed by other authors as well.&lt;ref name=Jeffries /&gt;  For example, law professor [[John Calvin Jeffries]] has argued that the Court in ''Romer'' was actually relying upon a principle of non-retrogression, whereby "The Constitution becomes a ratchet, allowing change in one direction only."&lt;ref name=Jeffries&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jeffries |first1= John |last2= Levinson |first2= Daryl |last-author-amp= yes |url= http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1572&amp;context=californialawreview |title= The Non-Retrogression Principle in Constitutional Law |journal= California Law Review |volume= 86 |page= 1211 |year=1998 |doi=10.2307/3481106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffries and his co-author, Daryl Levinson, conclude: "the revival of non-retrogression as a constitutional principle is symptomatic of a Supreme Court adrift in an age of judicial activism."&lt;ref name=Jeffries /&gt;

Supporters of the decision, such as law professor [[Louis Michael Seidman]], celebrated its "radical" nature, and hailed it as a revival of the [[Warren Court]]'s activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Seidman |first= Louis |title= Romer's Radicalism: The Unexpected Revival of Warren Court Activism |volume= 1996 |journal= Supreme Court Review |pages= 67–121 |year= 1996 |doi=10.1086/scr.1996.3109727}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to law professor Evan Gerstmann, the Court in ''Romer'' left unmentioned and unconsidered many purposes of Amendment 2 that the Colorado courts had acknowledged as legitimate.&lt;ref name=Gerstmann /&gt; The case, says Gerstmann, "has left the law of equal protection even murkier than before."&lt;ref name=Gerstmann /&gt;

==Related cases and events==
In 1993, [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], passed Ballot Issue 3, an amendment to the city charter, which forbade the city from adopting or enforcing civil rights ordinances based on sexual orientation, the only municipality in the United States to pass such a restriction. The wording of Cincinnati's amendment was almost identical to that of Colorado's. The amendment was upheld by the [[Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=vacated&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v.

Since ''Romer'' stood in obvious tension with the Court's earlier decision in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'',&lt;ref name=Bowers/&gt; it laid the groundwork for 2003's ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'',&lt;ref name=Lawrence/&gt; which overturned ''Bowers''; like the ''Romer'' case, Justices Kennedy and Scalia would author the majority and dissenting opinions in ''Lawrence'' with all nine justices voting almost the same way as in ''Romer'' (Justice O'Connor concurred, but with a different rationale). ''Romer'' has been narrowly cited but influential within its niche, being cited in the cases of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' and ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', but the case has not had a much broader impact given the Court's assertion that it was conducting neither a "normal process of judicial review" nor a "conventional inquiry."&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt;  In the same niche, ''Romer'' was cited in the decision of [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'', wherein the Department's desire to deny marriage licences to same-sex couples was explicitly likened to Amendment 2's attempt to broadly restrict from seeking benefits a narrowly defined class of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hillary Goodridge &amp; others vs. Department of Public Health &amp; another. |date= November 18, 2003 |url= http://www.boston.com/news/daily/18/sjc_gaymarriage_decision.pdf |format= PDF |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20031123132706/http://www.boston.com/news/daily/18/sjc_gaymarriage_decision.pdf |archive-date= November 23, 2003 |via= [[The Boston Globe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, fifteen years after the referendum on Amendment 2, the Colorado legislature amended its anti-discrimination law by forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, in employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://votesmart.org/bill/4143/12872/sexual-orientation-workplace-discrimination |title= SB 25: Sexual Orientation Workplace Discrimination |publisher= Project Vote Smart |access-date= August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Colorado further expanded its LGBT protections to include housing, public accommodation, and advertising.

Future Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] donated time [[pro bono]] to prepare oral arguments for the plaintiffs. Speaking during his nomination process, a case leader, Walter A.

{{Swedish National Parks}}
'''Sarek National Park''' ({{lang-sv|Sareks nationalpark}}) is a [[national park]] in [[Jokkmokk Municipality]], [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]] in northern Sweden. Established in 1909–1910, the park is one of the oldest national parks in Europe. It is adjacent to two other national parks, namely [[Stora Sjöfallet National Park|Stora Sjöfallet]] and [[Padjelanta National Park|Padjelanta]]. The shape of Sarek National Park is roughly circular with an average diameter of about {{convert|50|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.

The most noted features of the national park are six of Sweden's thirteen peaks over {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} located within the park's boundaries. Among these is the second highest mountain in Sweden, [[Sarektjåkkå]], whilst the massif [[Áhkká]] is located just outside the park. The park has about 200 peaks over {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}, 82 of which have names. Sarek is also the name of a geographical area which the national park is part of. The Sarek mountain district includes a total of eight peaks over {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to the long trek, the mountains in the district are seldom climbed. There are approximately 100 glaciers in Sarek National Park.

Sarek is a popular area for hikers and mountaineers. Beginners in these disciplines are advised to accompany a guide since there are no marked trails or accommodations and only two bridges aside from those in the vicinity of its borders. The area is among those that receives the heaviest rainfall in Sweden, making hiking dependent on weather conditions. It is also intersected by [[Turbulence|turbulent]] streams that are hazardous to cross without proper training.

The [[river delta|delta]] of the [[Rapa River]] is considered one of Europe's most noted views and the summit of mount [[Skierfe]] offers an overlook of that ice-covered, [[Glacier|glacial]], trough valley.

The Pårte [[Research station|Scientific Station]] in Sarek (also known as the ''Pårte observatory'') was built in the early 1900s by Swedish [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] and [[Geography|geographer]] [[Axel Hamberg]]. All the building material for the huts had to be carried to the site by [[Porter (carrier)|porters]].

== Names of locations ==
In Sarek National Park, as in the most of Sápmi, a large number of the locations have names originating from the [[Sami languages]].&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl8"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These languages have several variations and their written forms have changed over time, which explains why some placenames do not always correspond with each other in different sources.&lt;ref name=ortnamn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakradet.se/1717|publisher=Institut for språk och folkminnen|title=Samiska ortnamn|accessdate=27 October 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015025601/http://www.sprakradet.se/1717|archivedate=15 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common Sami names for locations or features in the park are ''tjåkkå'' or ''tjåkko'' (mountain), ''vagge'' (valley), ''jåkkå'' or ''jåkko'' (stream), ''lako'' (plateau) and ''ätno'' (river).&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl131-133"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is ''Rapaätno'', meaning [[Rapa River]]. These names are also the official Swedish names of the locations.

== Geography ==

Sarek National Park is the most mountainous region in Sweden and it is the part of the country that mostly resembles an alpine countryside.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl10"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the park are 19 summits higher than {{convert|1900|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl11"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most noted being the second highest summit in Sweden after the [[Kebnekaise]] – the [[Sarektjåkkå]] with a height of {{convert|2089|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/524215/Sarek-National-Park|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=Sarek National Park|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest altitude in the park is found in the southwest, near Lake Rittakjaure, at {{convert|477|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl11" /&gt;

The park is made up of three types of landscape, sometimes difficult to differentiate between: large valleys, massive mountains, and high plateaux.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl97"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest valley of the park, which is also the most noted, is the [[Rapa Valley]].&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl102"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This valley occupies {{convert|40|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl99"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the park, including several branches, the most important of which are the Sarvesvagge, which climbs as far as Padjelanta,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl106"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kuopervagge&amp;nbsp;— with an area of nearly {{convert|20|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;— and the Ruotesvagge, surrounded by numerous glaciers, including those of Mount Sarektjåkkå.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl110"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the other notable valleys, outside the Rapadalen network, are the Kukkesvagge that makes up the north-eastern border of the park,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl110" /&gt; and the Njåtsosvagge near the southern border.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl97" /&gt; The largest plateau is the Ivarlako, east of the Pårte [[massif]], with an altitude starting at {{convert|660|-|850|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl112"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; West of Pårte, the Luottolako plateau covers an area of {{convert|45|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has an even higher altitude at {{convert|1200|-|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl112" /&gt;

[[File:Sarek National Park Worldwind-2.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Relief image of the park from the southeast, with Pårte and its glaciers in the front of the picture.]]
Interspersed between the valleys and the plateaux, are massive mountains, often with several summits. The main ones are:
*Sarektjåkkå, highest point: Stortoppen, {{convert|2089|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*Pårte, Pårtetjåkkå, {{convert|2005|m|ft|abbr=on}}

=== Hydrography ===
The park's main river is the Rapa River (''Rapaätno''). It originates from the [[glacier]]s of Sarektjåkkå and runs down the Rapa Valley as far as [[Laitaure|Lake Laitaure]], and continues outside the park,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl99" /&gt; where it joins with the [[Lesser Lule River]] which becomes a tributary of the [[Lule River]] at its confluence.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl99" /&gt; This river is fed by thirty glaciers, contributing to a significant flow. The specific flow, the ratio between the average flow and the [[drainage basin]], from these waters, is the most significant in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl30"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow fluctuates strongly with the seasons, having an average of 100 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in July and about 4 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in winter, resulting in an average annual flow of approximately 30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=rapahydro&gt;{{citation|title=The Laitaure Delta: A Study of Deltaic Morphology and Processes|first1=Valter|last1=Axelsson|author-link=Valter Axelsson|journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]] |series=Series A, Physical Geography |volume=49|issue=1|year=1967|pages=1–127|doi=10.2307/520865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river also transports a significant quantity of [[sediment]]. In summer, it can carry up to {{convert|5000|-|10000|MT|lb}} of sediment daily. In winter it only carries a few tons every day, resulting in an annual total of {{convert|180000|MT|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl31"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment gives the river a grey-green colour and forms large [[River delta|deltas]].&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl30" /&gt; The main delta is formed at the confluence of the Rapaätno with its principal tributary, the river Sarvesjokk.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl99" /&gt;

Just before the confluence, the river [[Braided river|braids]] for nearly {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, forming a zone called Rapaselet.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl100"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noted of the deltas&amp;nbsp;– and an emblem of the park&amp;nbsp;– is the Laitaure delta (''Laitauredeltat''), which the river forms as it connects with Lake Laitaure.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl99" /&gt; The other significant rivers correspond to the principal valleys listed above. Most of them make up the drainage basin of Lesser Lule River. The rivers in the north part of the park flow into Lake [[Akkajaure]], in the Stora Sjöfallet National Park, forming part of the hydrographic network of Lule älv.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl30" /&gt;

The park also contains several lakes.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl21"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest are the Alkajaure (altitude {{convert|751|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), on the border between the Sarek and the Padjelanta park, and the Pierikjaure (altitude {{convert|820|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) near the Stora Sjöfallet National Park.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl29"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Alkavagge-Kuoper.jpg|thumb|Alggavagge, in Sarek National Park. The Scandinavian Mountains were made by an ancient plateau being strongly eroded.]]

The Sarek National Park lies within the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], a mountain chain whose origin is still a matter debate.&lt;ref name=MedHar2015&gt;{{cite journal |last=Medvedev |first=Sergei |last2=Hartz |first2=Ebbe H. |date=2015 |title=Evolution of topography of post-Devonian Scandinavia: Effects and rates of erosion |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=231 |issue= |pages= 229–245 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.12.010|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks of the Scandinavian Mountains were put in place by the [[Caledonian orogeny]],&lt;ref name=Lundqvistetal2011/&gt; forming a belt of deformed and displaced rocks now known as the [[Scandinavian Caledonides]]. Caledonian rocks overlie rocks of the much older [[Svecofennian orogeny|Svecokarelian]] and [[Sveconorwegian orogeny|Sveconorwegian]] [[province (geology)|provinces]]. The Caledonian rocks actually form large [[nappe]]s ({{lang-sv|skollor}}) that have been [[thrust fault|thrusted over]] the older rocks. Much of the Caledonian rocks have been eroded since they were put in place meaning that they were once thicker and more contiguous. It is also implyed from the erosion that the nappes of Caledonian rock reached once further east than they do today.

Starting about 60 million years ago, both the Scandinavian and the North-American sections suffered a [[tectonic uplift]].&lt;ref name=uplift&gt;{{citation|title=Neogene uplift and tectonics around the North Atlantic: overview|first1=Peter|last1=Japsen|first2=James A.|last2=Chalmers|journal=Global and Planetary Change|volume=24|year=2000|pages=165–173|doi=10.1016/s0921-8181(00)00006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what causes this and several hypotheses have been presented.&lt;ref name=uplift /&gt; One of the theories is the influence of the [[Iceland hotspot]] which could have raised the crust.&lt;ref name=uplift /&gt; Another hypothesis is the [[isostasy]] related to [[Glacial period|glaciations]] caused the uplift.&lt;ref name=uplift /&gt; In any of those cases, the uplift allowed the ancient mountain chain to rise several thousand metres.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl12" /&gt;

=== Erosion ===
[[File:Mikkaglaciären-övre-del-25.jpg|thumb|The glacier Mikka on Sarektjåkkå]]
The mountain chain was renewed and after that it was subjected to a new period of glacial erosion.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl12" /&gt; In the beginning of the [[Quaternary]] period, 15 million years ago, a significant [[Glacial motion|glacial advance]] occurred.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl13" /&gt; The glaciers began to grow and move into the valleys where they gradually merged to form an [[ice sheet]] that covered the entire region.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl13"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several further glaciations followed, forming the current landscape, with glacial valleys, [[cirque]]s, [[nunatak]]s etc.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson57" /&gt;
The degree to which the chain was affected by the erosion depended mainly on the structure of the terrain, which explains the diversity in the topography of the area. The topography of Sarek, similar to that of Kebnekaise, is divided into sharply defined zones, particularly in respect to the two neighbouring national parks. This is mainly due to the existence of [[diabase]] and [[diorite]] [[dike (geology)|dikes]] which are more resistant to erosion.&lt;ref name=kebnekaise_geol&gt;{{citation|title=Bedrock Geology and Morphology of the Tarfala Area, Kebnekaise Mts., Swedish Caledonides|journal=Geografiska Annaler.

=== Glaciers ===
[[File:Pårte ASTER 2008-09-02.jpg|thumb|Pårte with its characteristic glaciers]]
The park has over 100 glaciers, making it one of the most glacier-rich areas in Sweden. The glaciers are relatively small, the largest being Pårtejekna in Pårte at {{convert|11|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. However, some of the others are relatively large for Sweden, since the largest Swedish glacier, [[Stuorrajekna]] in [[Sulitjelma (mountain)|Sulitelma]] (south of Padjelanta), measures {{convert|13|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson57"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of the glaciers, particularly that of the Mikka ({{convert|8|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}})&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson56"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been studied since the end of the 19th century, especially by mineralogist and geographer [[Axel Hamberg]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson29"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other glaciers in the park have an evolution similar to that of the Mikka: in 1883 to 1895 they were mostly receding, then advanced a little in 1900 to 1916, after which they started to recede again.&lt;ref name=glacier&gt;{{citation|title=Holocene glacial variations in Sarek National Park, northern Sweden|first1=Wibjörn|last1=Karlén|first2=George H.|last2=Denton|journal=Boreas|volume=5|pages=25–56|year=1975|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3885.1976.tb00329.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they stabilised or grew, which was interpreted as being caused by the increase in winter precipitation related to [[global warming]]. The effect of the raised summer temperatures has been taken into account when assessing the data.&lt;ref name=kebneglacier&gt;{{citation|title=Fifty Years of Mass Balance and Glacier Front Observations at the Tarfala Research Station|journal=Geografiska Annaler. Series A, Physical Geography|first1=Per|last1=Holmlund|first2=Wibjörn|last2=Karlén|first3=Håkan|last3=Grudd|volume=78|year=1996|page=105|doi=10.2307/520972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The receding of the glaciers has resumed at a particularly rapid pace during the first years of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=forsvinner&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sareks-glaciarer-forsvinner-fort_1641495.svd|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|title=Sareks glaciärer försvinner fort|date=30 August 2008|first1=Susanna|last1=Baltscheffsky|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
According to its [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] classification, Sarek National Park is situated in the [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]] [[ecoregion]], with a minor section in the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalspecies.org/protectareas/display/23067 |title=Protected Area : Sarek |publisher=Global Species |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the flora and fauna, Sarek does not have a wide variety of species.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl53"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly explained by the fact that most of the park, except the south and south-east part,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl11" /&gt; is above the growth-limit of conifers,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl53" /&gt; which is at an altitude of about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} in this region.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl20"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to this, unlike most of the region, Sarek National Park has few vast lakes or [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl53" /&gt; A total of approximately 380 species of [[vascular plant]]s have been found in the park,&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl33"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 182 species of [[vertebrate]]s, 24 [[mammal]]s, 142 [[bird]]s, 2 [[reptile]]s, 2 [[amphibian]]s and 12 [[fish]].&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl53" /&gt; Many of these species are on the Swedish [[IUCN Red List|red list]] of [[endangered species]], notably the large carnivores.

The vegetation follows a fairly strict [[altitudinal zonation]], as a result of the climate, and implying a similar zonation of [[fauna]], although this is often less strict.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl53" /&gt;

=== Montane zone ===
The [[Montane ecology#Montane forests|montane zones]] are relatively rare in the park, as its upper limit is about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} below most altitudes in these northern [[latitude]]s. The flora of this zone is constituted by [[old-growth forest]]s of conifers, with mainly [[Scots pine]]s and including [[Picea abies|Norway spruces]]. The pines can become very tall, particularly those around Lake Rittak, in the south part of the park. The undergrowth is mostly covered with [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, in particular [[Cladonia rangiferina|reindeer lichen]], and also with ''[[Vaccinium myrtillus]]'', ''[[Empetrum nigrum]]'' and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Sarek forests are a preferred habitat for numerous species of animals. Among the large carnivores, the [[brown bear]] is particularly frequent in the park and in the neighbouring Stora Sjöfallet. The bear fairly often also ventures into the subalpine region. The [[Eurasian lynx]], classed as an endangered species in Sweden, is also found around the lakes of Rittak and Laitaure, and is also found in the subalpine forests of Rapa Valley. The [[red fox]] is relatively frequent, and is gradually extending its territory into the higher zones, where it competes with the [[arctic fox]]. Some small mammals that are frequent in the park are the [[European pine marten]], the [[least weasel]] and the [[stoat]]. The ermine is also found in the higher regions. The herbivores include a very large number of [[moose]] as the forests and humid zones provide them with lots of food.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl64&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often grow to an impressive size in the park, with enormous [[antler]]s.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl65&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birds in Sarek include a number of [[owl]]s, such as the [[Ural owl]], and [[woodpecker]]s, particularly the [[Eurasian three-toed woodpecker]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl67&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[grey-headed chickadee]] is also very common, as are the [[fieldfare]], the [[song thrush]] and the [[redwing]]. Reptiles and amphibians, such as the [[viviparous lizard]], the [[common frog]] and the [[Vipera berus|common European viper]], are mostly found in the forests.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl68&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vipers of the Rittak region frequently reach remarkable sizes.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl68 /&gt;

=== Subalpine zone ===
[[File:Piellorieppe-äng-25.jpg|thumb|left|Prairie and forest in the [[Rapa Valley]]]]
The [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|subalpine zone]] mostly consists of old-growth [[birch]] forests.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl36&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These forests are exceptional in terms of density and richness, making it possible for significant quantities of sediment material to be carried from the mountainside by the runoff and deposited in the watercourses.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of transfer is particularly noted in the Rapa Valley.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37 /&gt; In general, the transition between the conifer forests and the ones consisting of birch is more or less gradual, with the number of birches present in the coniferous forests increasing along with the altitude until the conifers have completely disappeared.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl34&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the trees also diminishes with increasing altitude.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl41&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper altitude limit for the forests&amp;nbsp;— which is also the [[tree line]] varies greatly throughout the park, from {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Tjoulta valley to over {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Rapa Valley.&lt;ref name="Curry-Lindahl21" /&gt;

The birch forests also contain other species of trees. The number of [[rowan]], [[Alnus incana|grey alder]], [[Populus tremula|trembling poplar]] and [[Prunus padus|hackberry]] is relatively high.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37 /&gt;  The [[Cicerbita alpina|alpine blue-sow-thistle]] is very widespread in this zone and is the food the bears prefer.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37 /&gt; [[Angelica archangelica|Garden angelica]] also grows in the forests, reaching a height of {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37 /&gt; Many other plants in this zone can also attain exceptional size.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl38&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarek delta.jpg|thumb|A reindeer in a valley in Sarek]]
The division between the birch and coniferous forests is relatively blurred, with many of the animal species listed above also present in the subalpine zone.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl69&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some small mammals are found more frequently here than in the coniferous forests, particularly several rodents such as the [[common shrew]] and the [[field vole]]. This is also the [[reindeer]]s' habitat.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl70&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sami people]] living within the borders of the park, have domesticated the reindeer that stay in this zone during spring and move up to the alpine zone in summer.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl70 /&gt; Brown bears are common in the valleys of Tjoulta and Rapadalen.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl71&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is the quantity and variety of birds is that enriches this zone.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl72&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[willow warbler]], the [[common redpoll]], the [[brambling]], the [[Western yellow wagtail|yellow wagtail]], the [[northern wheatear]] and the [[bluethroat]] are characteristic of the birch forests.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl72 /&gt;  The [[willow ptarmigan]] is also more common in this area.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl73&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bird of prey|raptors]] present in the zone are the [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]] and the [[rough-legged buzzard]], which often nests on the cliffs.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl72 /&gt; The [[gyrfalcon]] and the [[golden eagle]] usually prefer lower altitudes, but are nevertheless also found in the park.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl77&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpine zone ===
[[File:Sarek Flower path.jpg|thumb|A flowery prairie of alpine [[Cicerbita alpina|blue-sow-thistle]] on the slopes of the park]]

The [[Alpine tundra|alpine zone]] is divided into several narrower zones.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl42&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first subzone is mostly characterized by [[heath]]land, with many [[alder]] [[shrub]]s, mosses and lichens, and frequently dense mats of [[Empetrum nigrum|crowberries]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl42 /&gt; Different types of heaths can be distinguished. One type is mostly composed of a mix of [[Diphasiastrum alpinum|alpine clubmoss]] and [[Arctostaphylos alpina|alpine bearberry]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl43&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silene acaulis|Cushion pink]] and [[Pedicularis|Lapland lousewort]] bring autumn colour to the heaths, which are otherwise fairly monocrome.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl43 /&gt; In the chalky soils of this subzone, the vegetation is very rich and forms [[prairie]]s with [[Dryas octopetala|mountain avens]] as the most characteristic species. [[Saxifraga oppositifolia|purple saxifrage]], [[Bartsia alpina|velvetbells]], [[Antennaria alpina|alpine pussytoes]] and [[alpine veronica]] are also present.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl43 /&gt; With increasing altitude, the [[Salix herbacea|dwarf willow]] and [[lichen]]s become more prominent, forming a second zone.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl46&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the plants become more scarce, and above {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} there are only 18 types of plants present.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl47&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three rare mammals who live in this zone. The [[wolverine]] inhabits a vast territory, roaming as far as the coniferous forests in winter, but the alpine zone is their main territory.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl87&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mostly eat [[carrion]], but they do also hunt living animals such as small rodents, birds and insects.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl87 /&gt; The wolverine is labelled as an endangered species in Sweden with an estimate of 360 individuals in the country in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcie.org/Docs/Action%20Plans/Swedish%20Wolverine%20Action%20Plan.pdf|title=Åtgärdsprogram för bevarande av Järv|author=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)|Swedish Environmental Protection Agency]]|year=2000|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arctic fox is a [[critically endangered]] species in Sweden, with only 50 individuals in the whole country.&lt;ref name=renard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978-91-620-5927-9.pdf|title=Åtgärdsprogram för fjällräv 2008–2012|author=Naturvårdsverket|year=2008|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They dig extensive networks of tunnels in areas above the tree-line, with several families inhabiting the same [[sett]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl87 /&gt; The park is one of the last sanctuaries for the [[gray wolf]],&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl87 /&gt; a species also critically endangered in Sweden.&lt;ref name=varg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcie.org/Docs/Action%20Plans/Swedish%20Wolf%20Action%20Plan.pdf|title=Åtgärdsprogram för bevarande av Varg|author=Naturvårdsverket|year=2003|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974–1975, the park was home to the only remaining wild wolf living in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovdyr.org/arkiv/toverud_bok.pdf|work=Rovdur|title=Utsettning av ulv i Norge og Sverige|accessdate=29 October 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the wolf population is now growing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Attitudes of hunters, locals, and the general public in Sweden now that the wolves are back|publisher=Biological Conservation|volume=111|year=2003|pages=149–159|first1=Göran|last1=Ericsson|first2=Thomas A.|last2=Heberlein}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have not yet achieved a stable number in the park.&lt;ref name=laponia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laponia.info/media/620.pdf|title=Strategiska frågor för utveckling av Världsarvet Laponia|work=Laponia|accessdate=29 October 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050106045109/http://www.laponia.info/media/620.pdf|archivedate=6 January 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these three mammals, [[Norway lemming]]s are also found in the park.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl88&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of lemmings varies extremely, with massive spikes in the population during some years, immediately followed by a very rapid decline. This phenomenon is not completely understood; it appears that favourable weather, and therefore a surplus of food, results in sudden population growths, but the reason for the decline is less obvious, although it is certain that contagious diseases play some role.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl88 /&gt; These cycles are also reflected in the populations of animals who prey on the lemmings.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl88 /&gt;

Many birds living at this altitude are associated with the humid zones. However, the alpine zone has its own characteristic species, such as the [[rock ptarmigan]],&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl88 /&gt; the [[snowy owl]], the [[horned lark]], the [[meadow pipit]], the [[snow bunting]]&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl95&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lapland longspur]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl85&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humid zone ===
[[File:Sarek cotton grass.jpg|thumb|[[Eriophorum|Cotton grass]] in the national park]]
Although the park does not have the vast marshes and lakes characteristic of the rest of the region, water is nevertheless present everywhere. The humid zones are rich with a great diversity of flora and fauna. The stratification of vegetation is just as valid in the humid zones. In the montane region, the humid soils are covered with flowers such as the [[Rhododendron tomentosum|northern Labrador tea]], [[Eriophorum|cottonsedge]], the [[Ranunculus auricomus|Goldilocks buttercup]], [[Moneses|St Olaf's candlestick]], [[Prunella vulgaris|common selfheal]] and [[Galium palustre|common marsh-bedstraw]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl35&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subalpine zone, the humid prairies mainly have mats of [[Trollius europaeus|Globe-flower]], [[Caltha palustris|kingcup]] and [[Viola biflora|twoflower violet]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl37 /&gt; In the alpine region there are many subalpine plants as well as the ''[[Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum]]'',&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl43 /&gt; and the vegetation decreases as the altitude increases.

The humid zones of the park are well known for their rich diversity of birds. The [[common crane]], the [[wood sandpiper]] and the [[short-eared owl]] are found at the lower altitudes,&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl67 /&gt; while the [[Eurasian teal]], the [[Eurasian wigeon]], the [[greater scaup]], the [[red-breasted merganser]], the [[sedge warbler]] and the [[common reed bunting]] are common in the Laitaure delta and around Pårekjaure Lake.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl73 /&gt;

At higher altitudes, Vardojaure Lake is rich with birds, mostly ducks and also the [[European golden plover]], characteristic of the alpine zone and sometimes found in the humid zones.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl78&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Låotakjaure Lake, on the border of Padjelanta, is interesting from an ornithological point of view.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl79&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rare species are also present, such as the [[lesser white-fronted goose]], the [[great snipe]], the [[red-throated pipit]], the [[long-tailed duck]] and the [[bar-tailed godwit]].&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl79 /&gt; The Luottolako Plateau is also considered to be interesting, with the most significant concentration of [[purple sandpiper]]s in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl93&gt;{{harvnb|Curry-Lindahl|1968|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arctic char]]s, trouts and [[common minnow]]s are found in the park's lakes, rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Curry-Lindahl77 /&gt;

== Tourism ==
Sarek National Park is mainly a high-alpine area with almost no accommodation for tourists.&lt;ref name="naturvardsverket.se"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarek|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)]]|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Start/Friluftsliv/Skyddade-omraden/Nationalparker/Sarek/|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hiking trails ===
The [[Kungsleden]] hiking trail passes through the eastern part of the park, from [[Saltoluokta]] to [[Kvikkjokk]]. There are no cabins within the park, the Pårte, Aktse and Sitojaure cabins are just outside the park and they are accessible from both Saltoluokta and Kvikkjokk.

The Padjelanta Trail (''Padjelantaleden''), running from Kvikkjokk to Akkajaure, skirts the park along its western rim at Tarraluoppal, where the Tarraluoppal cabin is just on the border of the park.

=== Hazards ===
Due to the lack of [[Shelter (building)|shelters]] combined with rapidly shifting weather and rough terrain, it is recommended that hikers are well prepared and experienced before setting out on the trails of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kläder och utrustning|trans-title=Clothes and equipment|url=http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/park/sarek-nationalpark/besoksinformation/klader-och-utrustning/#.VcxzHmzovIV|website=www.sverigesnationalparker.se|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)]]|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fording streams ====
There are few bridges in the park, and crossing streams (Sami: ''jokk'') and rivers (Sami: ''ätno'') can be dangerous for ill-equipped or inexperienced hikers. Warm weather increases the melting of the glaciers causing water levels to rise, therefore wading is often easier and safer early in the morning.&lt;ref name="naturvardsverket.se" /&gt;

The only [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] across the Rapa River south of the Smaila Moot, is at Tielmaskaite. The ford is long and can only be used when waterlevels are low. Inexperienced hikers are recommended not to cross without a guide.

The glacier ''jokk'' from Pårtejekna, Kåtokjåhkå, has no fords. There is a bridge at the southernmost part of the stream ({{coord|67|09|25.9|N|17|51|20.9|E|region:SE_type:landmark|display=inline}}). Hikers can also follow the streams up to the glacier and cross there, although this requires knowledge about glacier crossing.

==== Sarek in the winter ====
The lack of marked trails and accommodations makes it very difficult for visitors to hike in the park in winter, unless they are experienced and properly equipped. The steep slopes of the valleys also contributes to the risk for [[avalanche]]s.&lt;ref name="naturvardsverket.se" /&gt;

=== Places of interest ===

==== Aktse ====
Aktse is an old farm settlement on the Kungsleden trail, approximately {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside the boundaries of the park.

==== Alkavare ====
In 1788 a chapel was built at Alkavare ({{coord|67|20|32.7|N|17|12|55.3|E|region:SE_type:landmark|display=inline}}) for the Sami that were herding reindeer in the area during summer. The walls of the building were dry set from local stone and the roof was made of timber, transported from Kvikkjokk, {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. Originally, service was held every summer on June{{nbsp}}25. It took the minister from Kvikkjokk three days to reach the chapel, and three days to get back. It was abandoned in the mid-19th century and renovated in 1961, and is still in use. {{As of|2015}}, it belongs to the [[Jokkmokk]] parish of the [[Church of Sweden]], and church service is held throughout July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alkavare kapell|url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=660695|website=www.svenskakyrkan.se|publisher=[[Church of Sweden]]|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamberg|first1=Axel|title=Alkavare lappkapell: en kulturbild|journal=Svenska turistföreningens årsskrift|volume=1926|date=1926|publisher=[[Svenska Turistföreningen]]|pages=263–272|url=http://www.axelhamberg.se/pdf/Hamberg_AlkavareLappkapell.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Smaila Moot ====
Just above the canyon, formed by Smailajåkk as it descends toward Rapaätno, there is a cabin for the National Park Service ({{coord|67|22|38|N|17|38|42|E|region:SE_type:landmark|display=inline}}). There is also a bridge over the Smailajåkk canyon which allows hikers to cross the stream safely. The bridge is removed every winter and put back in the spring, after the spring flood. The cabin is not open to hikers, but there is an emergency shelter as well as an emergency telephone and an outhouse there. The presence of the bridge and the fact that three of the major valleys in the park (''Routesvagge'', Rapa Valley and ''Koupervagge'') converge there, has resulted in the name 'Smaila Moot' for the location which has become a meeting place for hikers in the park. It is also a preferred location to start a climb to the top of the Sarektjåkkå ({{convert|2089|m|ft|abbr=on}}), via the Mikkajekna glacier.

==== Pastavagge ====
Pastavagge (in [[Lule Sami language|Lule Sami]] [[Orthography]] called ''Basstavágge'') is a narrow valley, forming a pass, running from Pielavalta (''Bielavallda'') towards the east, ending north of Rinim on the shores of Lake Sitojaure (''Sijddojávrre''). The trekking distance from Pielvalta to Rinim is about {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://kso2.lantmateriet.se/#|title = Topografisk karta|date = 2015-03-16|accessdate = 2015-03-16|website =www.lantmateriet.se |publisher =[[Lantmäteriet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As there is a boat connection between Rinim and the Sitojaure cabins on the Kungsleden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/sv/upptack/Omraden/Lappland/Fjallstugor/STF-Fjallstuga-ritsem/Hitta-hit/Battrafik-langs-lederna/|title = Båttrafik längs lederna |date = 2015-03-16|accessdate = 2015-03-16|website = www.svenskaturistforeningen.se|publisher = [[Svenska Turistföreningen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastavagge is a preferred route to and from central Sarek. The difference in altitude between the eastern entrance of the valley and the highest level of the pass is about {{convert|750|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Because of the steep climb, multiple fords and the high-alpine terrain, it usually takes at least a full day for hikers to traverse the pass.

== History ==

=== The Sami people ===
{{related articles|Sami people|Sami shamanism}}
[[File:Skierffe and Nammasj.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Skierfe (right) is a sacred Sami site]]

The region's first inhabitants arrived with the retreat of the inland seas 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg30&gt;{{harvnb|Kihlberg|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[nomad]]s who lived in Northern [[Scandinavia]], and probably ancestors of the Samis.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg30 /&gt; Initially they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, living off reindeer.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/774|work=Patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO|title=Région de Laponie|accessdate=30 October 2011|language=French, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those people, the mountains often had religious connotations, and several were ''Sieidi'' (places of worship).&lt;ref name=Kihlberg31&gt;{{harvnb|Kihlberg|1997|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sacrifice|Offerings]], such as [[antler]]s from reindeer, were often made in those places.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg31 /&gt; One of the most significant ''Sieidi'' was situated at the foot of Mount Skierfe ({{convert|1179|m|ft|abbr=on}} high), at the entrance to the Rapa Valley.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg31 /&gt; Samis from the entire region gathered in this place for ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg31 /&gt; Mount Apär itself, was believed to be the home of demons and legend tells of an illegitimate child's ghost inside it.&lt;ref name=Kihlberg34&gt;{{harvnb|Kihlberg|1997|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their hunter-gatherer way of life, the Samis kept some domesticated reindeer. They were milked and used for transport as well as other things.&lt;ref name=laponia /&gt; Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of domesticated reindeer increased, and the Samis began to harmonize their travelling with the reindeer's search for pasture. Eventually, hunting the reindeer gave way to [[Animal husbandry|farming]] them.&lt;ref name=laponia /&gt; The Samis in the mountains gradually developed a system of [[transhumance]] (movement between fixed summer and winter pastures).&lt;ref name=laponia /&gt;  They spent the winters on the park's plains and moved up into the mountains in summer, mainly to Padjelanta.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson14"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarek was mostly used as a corridor for travels, although certain prairies (Skarja and Peilavalta in particular) were used for pasture.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson14" /&gt; For shelter during their long journeys, which could last for several weeks, the inhabitants built huts (''kåta'') at selected places in the park.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson23"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little by little, they left the reindeer to graze as they pleased, and stopped moving with the herds in the old way.&lt;ref name=laponia /&gt;

=== Sarek and the Swedes ===
[[File:Kote-Parek.jpg|thumb|A [[Sami people|Sami]] home near Pårek]]

When the Swedish government took control over the Sami territory, the Sami had to pay the same taxes as other Swedes.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laponia.info/media/727.pdf|work=Laponia|title=Historia i Laponia|accessdate=30 October 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040729110724/http://www.laponia.info/media/727.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century the Sami were [[Evangelism|evangelized]] by the Swedes, who often built churches and markets in locations where the Sami traditionally stayed during winter.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;

The Swedes considered the mountains to be frightening and dangerous so they did not explore them.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson26"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the first [[ore]] deposits were discovered in the region, the Swedes attempted to persuade the Sami to prospect for other ores in the mountains, in particular [[silver]].&lt;ref name=alkavare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laplandica.com/2008/02/01/the-alkavare-silver-mine…/|work=Laplandica|title=The Alkavare Silver Mine…|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in general, the Sami did not dare to reveal such information to the Swedes because they did not want to incur the disapproval of their fellow Sami.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt; An ore discovery was likely to result in the Sami being forced into near-slavery, working the mines and transporting the minerals.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt; The Alkavare deposit was an exception. Its existence was revealed to the Swedes by an extremely poor Sami, who became held in disdain by his tribe due to this.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt; The exploitation of the mine began in 1672, but it never rendered any profit and was abandoned in 1702.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt; A few attempts to reopen the mine has been made, but they have not been successful.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt; The ruins of two buildings and a little chapel are visible nearby the site.&lt;ref name=alkavare /&gt;

The first Swede to scientifically explore the mountains was [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]] in his [[expedition to Lapland]] in 1732.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson26" /&gt; Later, in 1870, Gustaf Wilhelm Bucht [[Cartography|mapped]] the region.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson27"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in 1881, the Frenchman [[Charles Rabot]] became the first man to reach the summit of Sarektjåkkå.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson27" /&gt; The 1890s marked the start of systematic scientific expeditions.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson28"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most noted is the work of Axel Hamberg, who had participated in an expedition to Greenland led by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]]. Hamberg began his study of the region in 1895.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson28" /&gt; He studied the park, chiefly the glaciers, until his death in 1931.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson28" /&gt; He created a high quality map and constructed five cabins in the park, known as the Pårte station, where he conducted his studies of Sarek.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson28" /&gt; Axel Hamburg's work was particularly significant for widespread public recognition of the park.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson28" /&gt;

=== Protection ===
The 1872 creation of the world's first [[national park]] in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]&lt;ref name=svnatpark&gt;{{cite book|title=National parks of Sweden|first1=Claes|last1=Grundsten|isbn=978-91-7126-160-1|editor=Max Ström|place=Stockholm|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; started a universal momentum for the protection of nature. In Sweden, the [[List of polar explorers|polar explorer]] Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld became the first to propose using the new concept to protect areas of the Swedish landscape.&lt;ref name=creation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turism.jokkmokk.se/media/21054/allting%20om%20jokkmokk%20nr%208.pdf|work=Jokkmokks kommun|title=Allting om Jokkmokk|accessdate=31 October 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axel Hamburg, Nordenskiöld and other scientists organized a plea for establishing Sweden's first national parks, Sarek in particular.&lt;ref name=creation /&gt; They convinced the Swedish botanist and member of the [[Riksdag]] Karl Starbäck from [[Uppsala University]] to raise the question in the Riksdag.&lt;ref name=creation /&gt; The proposition was accepted in May 1909, and the first nine national parks were established.&lt;ref name=creation /&gt; These were also the first in Europe. Among them were Sarek and its neighbour the Stora Sjöfallet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parcsnationaux.fr/Decouvrir-Visiter-Partager/Les-parcs-nationaux-dans-le-monde|work=Parcs nationaux|title=Les parcs nationaux dans le monde|accessdate=31 October 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given for establishing the park was, as stated in official protocols, to "preserve a high mountain landscape in its natural state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagboken.se/files/SFS/2011/110841.PDF|work=Lagbocken|title=Förordning om ändring i nationalparksförordningen (1987:938)|accessdate=25 January 2012|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 20th century, with developments in [[hydroelectricity]] in Sweden, [[dam]]s were frequently built across the northern rivers of Sweden.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson39"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; These barrages were also constructed in the national parks; the Stora Sjöfallet National Park lost nearly a third of its land area with the creation of a dam in 1919.&lt;ref name="svnatpark" /&gt; In 1961, an accord called the "Sarek peace" (''Freden i Sarek'') was forged, preventing hydroelectric developments in Sarek as well as in certain rivers, designated "national rivers".&lt;ref name=energifragan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/energifrågan|work=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|title=Energifrågan|accessdate=7 November 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the establishing of Padjelanta National Park.&lt;ref name=energifragan /&gt;

[[File:Sarek National Park Landsat image.jpg|thumb|The borders of the park]]
In 1982, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) mentioned a vast zone including Sarek National Park in its tentative list of natural sites to be classified as [[World Heritage Site]]s by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=IUCN_laponia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/774.pdf|work=Patrimoine mondial|title=World heritage nomination&amp;nbsp;— IUCN summary, the lapponian area (Sweden)|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden proposed that part of this zone, the Sjaunja nature reserve, should be included in the list, and in 1990 the IUCN recommended an extension to the proposed area.&lt;ref name=IUCN_laponia /&gt; In 1996, Sarek Park was classed as a World Heritage Site including the adjoining areas of Padjelanta, Stora Sjöfallet, Sjaunja and Stubba nature reserves, [[Muddus National Park]] and three adjacent areas, making a total of {{convert|9400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The whole area was added to the World Heritage as a mixed site ("of cultural and natural value") called the [[Laponian area]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO /&gt; The park also became part of the [[Natura 2000]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/norrbotten/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/Nationalparker/Bevarandeplan_SarekNP.pdf|work=Länsstyrelsen i Norrbotten|title=Bevarandeplan Natura 2000 Sarek SE0820185|accessdate=1 November 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being on the World Heritage list allowed the park to have its first protection plan. The plan was written with thorough consultation of the Sami, who had not been consulted when the park was established.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Start/Naturvard/Nyheter/Samverkan-om-Laponia-far-WWF-pris/|work=Naturvårdsverket|title=Samverkan om Laponia får WWF-pris|accessdate=1 November 2011|language=Swedish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108061337/http://www.naturvardsverket.se/sv/Start/Naturvard/Nyheter/Samverkan-om-Laponia-far-WWF-pris/|archivedate=8 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] paid for this process.&lt;ref name=award /&gt;

The 2007 [[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)|Environmental Protection Agency]] plan for the national parks includes a plan to expand Sarek to incorporate the area of the Laitaure Delta and the Tjuoltadalen Valley to the south part of the park.&lt;ref name=plan&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/30_global_meny/02_aktuellt/Remisser/Nationalparksplan/N_remiss_nationalparksplan.pdf|author=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Sweden)]]|title=Nationalparksplan för Sverige – Utkast och remissversion|year=2007|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension had already been proposed in the 1989 plan, but the situation changed with the World Heritage designation as the proposed extension would make up a sizable part of the Laponian Region.&lt;ref name=plan /&gt;

=== History of tourism ===
Sarek National Park is viewed by many Swedes as one of the most beautiful landscapes of their country. The enthusiasm for it was started by Axel Hamberg's book on the park, presenting Sarek as the joy of the Swedish Lapland.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson37"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svenska Turistföreningen|Swedish Tourist Association]] (STF) was created in 1885. In 1886, they mentioned Sarek as a potential tourist site for the first time.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson35"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of tourists was not more than a few dozen.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson35" /&gt; In 1900, the association studied the possibility of creating a long [[hiking]] trail crossing the Lapland mountains, between [[Abisko]] and Kvikkjokk.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson36"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial proposal was for a marked trail that passed through the park, a boat crossing of the Rapaselet and a [[mountain hut]] beside the river.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson36" /&gt; The project was abandoned and the STF concentrated mostly on Kebnekaise and [[Sylan]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson37" /&gt; The trail (Kungsleden) was built, but only coming close to the park in the southeast corner of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vandringleder|url=http://kvikkjokkfjallstation.se/Kvikkjokk_Fjallstation/Vandringstips|website=www.kvikkjokkfjallstation.se|publisher=Kvikkjokks fjällstation|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] popularised the expression "''vår sista stora vildmark''" ("our last great wilderness").&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson39" /&gt; Dag Hammarskjöld advocated a growing tourism in the park, that took care not to damage the environment.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson39" /&gt; Edvin Nilsson's 1970 book on the park strengthened its reputation, increasing the number of tourists from two or three hundred in the 1960s, to 2,000 in 1971.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson40" /&gt; This sudden success caused several problems such as the temporary overcrowding on certain trails in the Rapa Valley, which were not designed to accommodate so many visitors.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson40"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamsson|1993|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management and regulation ==

=== The general case ===
[[File:Sarek reindeers.jpg|thumb|A herd of reindeer grazing in the park.]]
As for the majority of the Swedish national parks, the management and administration of the park is divided between the Environmental Protection Agency of Sweden and the [[County administrative boards of Sweden|County administrative board]].&lt;ref name=loi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19870938.htm|work=Notisum|title=Nationalparksförordning (1987:938)|accessdate=17 September 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of proposing new national parks in consultation with the county and [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] council. The establishing of each new park requires a decision from the Riksdag.&lt;ref name=loi /&gt; After that, the land is bought by the government through the intermediary of the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref name=loi /&gt; The rest of the park's management is done by the county council. In Sarek's case, this is the [[Norrbotten County]] council.

The park rules are relatively strict, to preserve the park in its near-pristine condition. Fishing, hunting, picking flowers and any other activity that could damage the wildlife are all forbidden, except for picking berries and [[edible mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name=regles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/04_arbete_med_naturvard/världsarv/1/Forslag_nyaforeskrifter_sakagarremiss.pdf|work=Naturvårdsverket|title=Förslag till nya föreskrifter för nationalparkerna/suoddjimpárkajda Sarek Stora Sjöfallet/Stuor Muorkke Muddus/Muttos Padjelanta/ Badjelánnda och luonndoreserváhtajda/naturreservaten Sjávnja/Sjaunja Stubbá/Stubba|accessdate=2 November 2011|language=Swedish}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, no motorised vehicles are allowed in the park.&lt;ref name=regles /&gt;

=== The Sami exception ===
[[File:Padjelanta Sarek Stora Sjöfallet National Park reindeer herding map-fr.svg|thumb|Map of reindeer altitudes in the three neighbouring parks.]]
There are several exceptions in the laws about management and regulation of the national parks regarding the Sami. In 1977, the Sami people were recognised by Sweden as an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] and a [[minority group]], which implies that the people and their way of life are protected by law.&lt;ref name=samiloi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sametinget.se/4802|work=Sametinget|title=Diskriminering av samer – samers rättigheter ur ett diskrimineringsperspektiv|accessdate=2 November 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grants the Sami the right to farm reindeer in the park.&lt;ref name=regles /&gt; The park is situated on territory belonging to the [[Siida|Sami communities]] of Sirkas, Jåhkågaskka and Tuorpons, the Sami who are members of these communities are also allowed to pasture their reindeer in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/norrbotten/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/nationalparker/sarek/Pages/default.aspx|work=Länsstyrelsen i Norrbotten|title=Sarek|accessdate=2 October 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In carrying out these activities, the Sami have the right to use motorised vehicles such as snowmobiles or helicopters.&lt;ref name=regles /&gt;

These rights are sometimes conflicting with the protection of wildlife. An example of this is when carnivores attack the Sami reindeer. Such an incident occurred in 2007, when an unregistered wolf, a protected and endangered species in Sweden, wandered into an area in Tjåmotis ({{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the Rapa Valley) where reindeer were grazing. The wolf was captured, [[Telemetry|radio-collared]] and [[Genetic testing|DNA tested]]. It was kept under surveillance and attempts were made to scare it away, but after it had killed several reindeer and disrupted the herd, a decision was made to shoot it. The decision and the killing were made collectively by the Norrbotten County Administrative Board, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sami in accordance with the national [[nuisance wildlife management]] act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Varg skjuten i Jokkmokk|trans-title=Wolf shot in Jokkmokk|url=http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/varg-skjuten-i-jokkmokk-3536414.aspx|website=www.nsd.se|publisher=[[Norrländska Socialdemokraten]]|date=9 February 2007|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vargjakt i Norrbotten|trans-title=Wolf hunt in Norrbotten|url=http://www.jaktojagare.se/kategorier/notiser/vargjakt-i-norrbotten/|website=www.jaktojagare.se|publisher=Jägarnas Riksförbund|date=7 February 2007|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an ongoing debate about the damages caused by snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles in the parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edin|first=Ronny|title=Terrängkörning i svenska fjällvärlden|trans-title=Terrain vehicles in the Swedish mountain area|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/norrbotten/SiteCollectionDocuments/Sv/publikationer/djur%20och%20natur/Motortrafik%20i%20Naturen/13_2007_Terrangkorning_sv_fjallvarlden.pdf|website=www.lansstyrelsen.se|publisher=Norrbotten County Administrative Board|date=2007|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snowmobiles have become increasingly popular and numerous, while global warming has made the terrain more vulnerable to the vehicles. Joyrides by visitors outside the marked trails have become a problem, especially for the Sami, since they claim that the disruptions made by snowmobiles may cause the pregnant female reindeer to drop their calves prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skoterförbud i fjället|trans-title=Ban on snowmobiles in the mountains|url=http://www.vk.se/538067/skoterforbud-i-fjallet?mobil|website=www.vk.se|publisher=[[Västerbottens-Kuriren]]|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindgren|first1=Maria|last2=Callne|first2=Lena|title=Dålig respekt för skoterförbud i fjällen|trans-title=Prohibition for snowmobiles not respected|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=98&amp;artikel=5839433|website=www.sverigesradio.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=16 April 2014|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Snowmobile Regulations|url=http://www.snoskoterradet.se/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202210617/http://www.snoskoterradet.se/english/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 February 2009|website=www.snoskoterradet.se|publisher=National Council on Snowmobiles|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was the main setting of the 2017 film [[The Ritual (2017 film)|The Ritual]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7777">The '''Seneschal of Gascony''' was an officer carrying out and managing the domestic affairs of the lord of the [[Duchy of Gascony]].  During the course of the twelfth century, the [[seneschal|seneschalship]], also became an office of military command. After 1360, the officer was the '''Seneschal of Aquitaine'''.&lt;ref name=GRP&gt;[http://www.gasconrolls.org/en/research-tools/duchy-office-holders/ "Principal Office Holders in the Duchy"] and [http://www.gasconrolls.org/en/research-tools/duchy-office-holders/seneschals-of-gascony-of-aquitaine-after-1360-1273-1453/ "Seneschals of Gascony, of Aquitaine after 1360 (1273–1453)"], ''The Gascon  Rolls Project (1317–1468)''.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an office above the seneschalcy, the [[Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine|Lieutenancy of the Duchy of Aquitaine]], but it was filled only intermittently (in times of emergency).

The seneschal managed the household, coordinating between the receivers of various landholdings and the chamber, treasury, and the chancellory or chapel.  The seneschals of Gascony, like those appointed in [[Seneschal of Normandy|Normandy]], [[Seneschal of Poitou|Poitou]], and [[Seneschal of Anjou|Anjou]] had custody of demesne fortresses, the regional treasuries, and presidency of the highest court of regional custom. Detailed records of the Gascon Exchequers during the reign of [[Henry III of England]] indicate that there most likely was a functioning exchequer.

The '''Surface Transportation Assistance Act''' of 1982 was a comprehensive transportation funding and policy act of the [[United States Federal Government]], {{USStat|96|2097}}. The legislation was championed by the [[Reagan administration]] to address concerns about the surface transportation infrastructure (highways and bridges).  The Act contained Title V, known as the [[Highway Revenue Act of 1982]], which added five cents to the per gallon gas tax (the first such increase since 1961), of which four cents was dedicated to restore interstate highways and bridges, and one cent for public transit. The Act also set a goal of 10 percent for participation of disadvantaged business enterprises in federal-aid projects.

== Section 165: "Buy America" Act ==
{{main|Buy America Act}}

Section 165 ({{usc-clause|49|5323|j}}), called the "Buy America" provision or [[Buy America Act]]&amp;mdash;not to be confused with the 1933-enacted [[Buy American Act]]&amp;mdash;applies to [[public transport|mass-transit]]-related procurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buy American and Buy America Acts|date=May 22, 2009|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]], [[Canada]]|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/sell2usgov-vendreaugouvusa/procurement-marches/buyamerica.aspx?lang=eng|accessdate=2009-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230601/http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/sell2usgov-vendreaugouvusa/procurement-marches/buyamerica.aspx?lang=eng|archivedate=May 13, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established requirements intended to give preference to the use of domestically produced materials on any procurements funded at least in part by federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buy America Requirements (amendment of)|date=June 19, 1986|publisher=[[Federal Transit Administration]]|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/printer_friendly/leg_reg_564.html|accessdate=2009-11-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204025952/http://www.fta.dot.gov/printer_friendly/leg_reg_564.html|archivedate=December 4, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the requirements is regulated by the [[Federal Transit Administration]].

== Section 405 ==
Effective in 1983, Section 405 ({{USC|49|31105}}) was enacted to encourage employee reporting of noncompliance with safety regulations governing commercial motor vehicles. Congress recognized that employees in the transportation industry are often best able to detect safety violations and yet, because they may be threatened with discharge for cooperating with enforcement agencies, they need express protection against retaliation for reporting these violations. See, e. g., 128 Cong. Rec. 32698 (1982) (remarks of Sen. Percy); id., at 32509–32510 (remarks of Sen. Danforth). Section 405 protects employee "[[whistle-blowers]]" by forbidding discharge, discipline, or other forms of discrimination by the employer in response to an employee's complaining about or refusing to operate motor vehicles that do not meet the applicable safety standards.

Congress also recognized that the employee's protection against having to choose between operating an unsafe vehicle and losing his job would lack practical effectiveness if the [481 U.S. 252, 259]  employee could not be reinstated pending complete review. The longer a discharged employee remains unemployed, the more devastating are the consequences to his personal financial condition and prospects for reemployment. Ensuring the eventual recovery of backpay may not alone provide sufficient protection to encourage reports of safety violations. Accordingly, 405 incorporates additional protections, authorizing temporary reinstatement based on a preliminary finding of reasonable cause to believe that the employee has suffered a retaliatory discharge. The statute reflects a careful balancing of the relative interests of the Government, employee, and employer. It evidences a legislative determination that the preliminary investigation and finding of reasonable cause by the Secretary, if followed "expeditiously" by a hearing on the record at the employer's request, provide effective protection to the employee and ensure fair consideration of the employer's interest in making unimpaired hiring decisions.

Truck drivers who believe they have suffered retaliation for reporting violations, refusing to commit violations, or participating in proceedings, can seek relief from the U.S. Department of Labor.  Under STAA, truck drivers who believe they have suffered an adverse employment action (such as discharge, demotion, discipline, or denial of advancement), have 180 days to file a simple written complaint with [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).  The complaint can be postmarked or faxed to meet the deadline.  If OSHA determines that a violation did occur, it can issue a preliminary order requiring reinstatement during further proceedings.  Both sides will have an opportunity to present their evidence in a recorded hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).  The ALJ's decision is reviewed by the Administrative Review Board, and parties can appeal to federal courts of appeals.

In 1987, the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc.'', 481 U.S. 252, that due process requires that employers receive prereinstatement notice of the employee's allegations, notice of the substance of the relevant supporting evidence, an opportunity to submit a written response, and an opportunity to meet with the investigator and present statements from rebuttal witnesses. These procedures provide a reliable initial check against mistaken decisions

== Sections 411–412: National Truck Network ==
{{main|National Network}}

Sections 411 and 412 ({{USC|49|31111|31114}}) first authorized the establishment a national network of highways designated for use by large trucks. On these highways, federal width and length limits apply. The National Network includes almost all of the Interstate Highway System and other, specified non-Interstate highways. Section 412 also specifically prohibits any state from denying reasonable access to the National Network. Provisions in the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991]] further defined the National Network.

Trucks that are within the width and length limits specified in the Act are now referred to as "STAA trucks".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist1/d1projects/staa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[microbroadcast]] provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a [[drive-in theater]]). Sometimes the bootlegger will tape or conceal wireless microphones close to the speakers for better sound quality. A TS can be considered a higher quality type of [[Cam (bootleg)|cam]], that has the potential of better-quality audio and video.&lt;ref&gt;Craig2005

|quote=A telesync is a film recorded on a professional camera (often a digital beta-cam).The cameras are placed on steady tripods and the films are recorded in an empty cinema from the main projection booth. The sound is often recorded straight from the mixing board, giving the telesync a high quality of sound. Some releases even include surround sound in Audio Compression 3 ([[Dolby AC-3|AC3]]) format. Telesyncs are the most common of early releases, often being the first release [[Topsite (warez)|a movie site]] accepts. Telesync movies are easier to watch than their [[Cam (bootleg)|CAM]] counterparts, although the picture quality is usually slightly washed out and the contrast is often out of balance. Telesyncs are commonly traded on movie sites. They are the lowest quality allowed, but are still popular with many file traders.
|laysummary=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/705731/description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own [[frame rate]] and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal [[aliasing]].

As technology gets better, the quality of telesyncs also improves, although even the best telesyncs are [[lossy]] and will be inferior in quality to direct rips from [[Blu-ray]], [[DVD]] or digital transfers from the film itself (see [[telecine (piracy)|telecine]]). Some [[Warez group|release groups]] use [[high-definition video]] cameras to get the clearest picture possible.&lt;ref name="nocopy"&gt;{{cite book

In the German [[warez scene]] additional tags for the audio source can be added to a telesync release. These are '''LD''' (line dubbed) for when the audio track of an unlicensed copy has been ripped from the line out connection of a projector or '''MD''' (mic dubbed) when a microphone is used for the recording. These tags are not used exclusively on cam releases though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/what-does-ld-and-md-mean/ |title=What does "LD" and "MD" mean? |date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://forum.chip.de/webserver-webhosting-clouds/line-dubbed-eigentlich-genau-481475.html

'''''The Devil and Daniel Webster''''' is a 1941 [[fantasy film]], adapted by [[Stephen Vincent Benét]] and [[Dan Totheroh]] from Benét's short story, "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (short story)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]". The film's title was changed to '''''All That Money Can Buy''''' to avoid confusion with another film released by RKO that year, ''[[The Devil and Miss Jones]]'', but later had the title restored on some prints. It has also been released under the titles '''''Mr. Scratch''''', '''''Daniel and the Devil''''' and '''''Here Is a Man'''''. The film stars [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]].

A retelling of the [[Faust]] legend, set in 1840s rural [[New Hampshire]], it was directed by German-born actor-director [[William Dieterle]] who (under his original name, Wilhelm Dieterle) played a featured role in [[F. W. Murnau]]'s epic silent version of ''[[Faust (1926 film)|Faust]]'' in 1926.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=December 2017}}
In 1840 [[New Hampshire]], Jabez Stone ([[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]]), a poor kindhearted farmer, is broke and plagued by bad luck, and, with the local money-lender, Miser Stevens, about to foreclose on his farm, he has reached the limit of his endurance. After a series of mishaps, he impulsively declares that he would sell his soul to the [[Devil|devil]] for two cents, and moments later the devil appears, calling himself "[[Mr. Scratch]]" ([[Walter Huston]]). He appears to offer Jabez a bargain: sell his soul in return for seven years of good luck and prosperity. Scratch tempts Jabez by magically revealing a hoard of Hessian gold coins, which appears from under the barn floor, and, unable to resist the lure of the gold, Jabez signs the contract. He begins his new life with hope, paying off his debts, buying new tools and supplies, and new clothes for his wife and mother. While the women are shopping, Jabez meets and becomes friends with famous New Hampshire Congressman and orator [[Daniel Webster]] ([[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]]), a friend of his wife's family, and a widely loved figure who champions the cause of the poor farmers - although we learn that Webster himself is being tempted by Mr. Scratch to sell his soul, in return for fulfilling his ambition to become [[President of the United States]].

As time passes, Jabez's increasing wealth begins to change him. When only his crops are spared from a freak hailstorm, he ensnares his desperate neighbors with onerous financial contracts, and he slowly alienates his devoted wife Mary ([[Anne Shirley (actress)|Anne Shirley]]) and his pious mother ([[Jane Darwell]]). Later, as the townspeople celebrate the harvest in Jabez's barn, Mary gives birth to their first child, whom they name Daniel in honor of Mr. Webster, but minutes later, Jabez discovers that the local girl they had hired as a maid has vanished. In her place, he finds the beautiful and sinister Belle ([[Simone Simon]]) who has been sent by Mr. Scratch. She bewitches Jabez, driving a wedge between him and Mary. Soon, Jabez has stopped going to church and, after his family leaves, he secretly hosts gambling parties at his home. As Daniel grows, he too falls under Belle's malign influence, and she turns him into a spoiled, disobedient brat.

In a few more years, Jabez is one of the richest men in the country: he lives like a lord, and has built a lavish new mansion (which his mother refuses to live in). He throws a huge ball, but it ends in disaster: after a nightmarish dance between Belle and Miser Stephens, Jabez finds Stephens dead on the floor. He, too, had signed a pact with Mr. Scratch and his time was up. Realizing that all his guests have fled, Jabez turns on Mary, blaming her for all his troubles, and he throws her out. Now desperate and realizing that his ''own'' time is almost up, he tries to erase the deadline Mr. Scratch has burned into the tree outside the barn, but Scratch appears and again tempts Jabez, offering to extend his deal in return for the soul of his son. Horrified, Jabez flees and chases after Mary. He begs her forgiveness and pleads with Webster to help him find some way out of his bargain with the devil. Webster agrees to take his case. Mr. Scratch again offers an extension in exchange for Jabez's son, but Jabez turns him down. He then begs Webster to leave before it is too late, but Webster refuses to go, boasting that he has never left a jug or a case half-finished.

When Mr. Scratch shows up to claim his due, Webster has to wager his own soul before his fiendish opponent will agree to a trial by jury. Mr. Scratch chooses the jury members from among the most notorious personalities of American history (including [[Benedict Arnold]]) with [[John Hathorne]] (one of the magistrates of the [[Salem witch trials]]) as the judge. When Webster protests, Mr. Scratch points out that they were "Americans all". With his own soul now at risk, Webster proceeds to defend Jabez Stone, who is accused of breaching contract.

He begins by stating that he envies the jury because, as Americans, they were present at the birth of a nation, part of a heritage they were born to share. Unfortunately, they were fooled like Jabez Stone, trapped in their desire to rebel against their fate, but what would they give to be given another chance? Webster explains that it is the eternal right of everyone, including the jury, to raise their fists against their fates, but when that happens, one finds oneself at a crossroads. They took the wrong turn, just as Stone did, but he has found out in time, and this night he is there to save his soul. Daniel asks the jury to give Stone another chance to walk upon the earth, for what would they give to see those things they remember? They were all men once, breathing clean American air, which was free and blew across the earth they loved.

Webster starts to expound on the virtue of simple and good things – "... the freshness of a fine morning ... the taste of food when you're hungry ... the new day that's every day when you're a child ... " – and how, without the soul, those things are sickened. He reminds the jury that Mr. Scratch had told them that the soul meant nothing, and they believed him and lost their freedom. Next, Webster discourses on 'freedom' as not just a big word: "It is the morning, the bread, and the risen sun ... ", it was the reason for making the voyage to come to America. Mistakes were made, but out of things wrong and right a new thing has come: a free man with a freedom that includes his own soul. Yet how can the jury be on the side of the oppressor, when Stone is a brother, a fellow American? Webster then implores the jury to let Stone keep his soul, which, after all, does not belong to him alone, but to his family and country. "Don't let the country go to the devil", thunders Daniel Webster. "Free Stone."

After a few moments, Hathorne asks the jury for their verdict and, in response, the foreman, Arnold, tears up the contract, releasing Jabez from his deal. Webster then kicks Mr Scratch out, but, as he is ejected, the fiend promises that Webster will never fulfill his ambition to become President. Scratch sits alone in the final scene, resignedly thumbing through a notebook. He puts it away and then [[breaks the fourth wall]], moving his gaze until he stops and looks straight ahead, giving the effect of singling out the viewer; Scratch then points directly at the viewer and smiles evilly as the film fades out.

==Production==

After the success of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', [[William Dieterle]] founded his own production company and signed a contract with [[RKO Radio Pictures]], the studio that had produced the film. He decided to adapt [[Stephen Vincent Benet]]'s short story of the same name as the first film he would make under the contract with the studio.

The story had been adapted to the stage in 1939 at the [[Martin Beck Theater]] to great acclaim, but only ran for six performances because the production proved to be expensive. It was also later adapted as an opera that was done during [[World War II]] by USO troupes.

Benet was invited to write the script for the film adaptation, along with [[Dan Totheroh]], the younger brother of [[Roland Totheroh]], who worked as [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s top cinematographer from his silent short films to [[Monsieur Verdoux]]. There were some differences between the short story and the movie. In the original story, Webster regrets Benedict Arnold's absence; in the film, Arnold is present and Webster objects, citing him as a traitor and therefore not a true American, but his objection is dismissed by the judge, and Asa the Black Monk is made up for the film, along with John Smeet, who appears in a deleted scene. The writers also cut out Scratch's other predictions involving Webster's last speech and his sons' deaths in the [[American Civil War]]. [[Walter Huston]]'s character was more soft-spoken in the story and the character of Belle was an addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stephen Vincent Benet:Essays on His Life and Work|first=David Garrett|last=Izzo|author2=Lincoln Konkle|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0786413646|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] was the original choice for Daniel Webster, but he suffered a skull fracture while filming the carriage scene and was replaced by [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]]. 

[[Bernard Herrmann]] was chosen to compose the film, having composed music for [[Charles R. Jackson]]'s 1938 radio adaptation that aired on ''[[The Columbia Workshop]]''. Herrmann was introduced to the cast and crew by Dieterle, whom he found to be a very sophisticated director. In addition to his original music score, Herrmann also incorporated several traditional folk tunes, including [[The Devil's Dream|"Devil's Dream"]], [[On Springfield Mountain|"Springfield Mountain"]], and a diabolical version of [[Pop Goes the Weasel|"Pop Goes The Weasel"]] played on the fiddle by Mr. Scratch. Herrmann also collaborated with sound engineer [[James G. Stewart]] to make sure that the music and sound worked well together. To create the creepy sound when Mr. Scratch first appeared in the barn, Herrmann had a recording crew go to San Fernando to record the sound of telephone wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Heart At Heart's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann|first=Steven C|last=Smith|page=86|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-07123-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative versions==
The original release was 107 minutes long. It was a critical, but not a box-office, success, recording a loss of $53,000 on its initial run.&lt;ref name="rko"&gt;Richard Jewell &amp; Vernon Harbin, ''The RKO Story.'' New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p166&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently re-released under the title ''The Devil and Daniel Webster'' with nearly half an hour cut, reducing the film to 85 minutes. The cuts were crudely done. The film was restored to its full length in the 1990s and has been issued in that form on home video. However, the title has remained ''The Devil and Daniel Webster''. The restored portions on the video had been taken from inferior prints of the movie, but the quality has been notably improved on the DVD release. A preview print  titled ''Here Is a Man'' was found in the estate of the director and served as the basis for the film's restoration and [[DVD]] release.

==Awards and honors==
[[Bernard Herrmann]] won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture]]  and Walter Huston was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

{{Intellectual property}}
'''United Kingdom trade mark law''' provides protection for the use of [[trade mark]]s in the UK. A trade mark is a way for one party to distinguish themselves from another. In the business world, a trade mark provides a product or organisation with an identity which cannot be imitated by its competitors.

A trade mark can be a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, sound, shape, signature or any combination of these elements.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/how-to-register-a-trade-mark/what-you-can-and-cant-register&lt;/ref&gt; In UK law, as in most common law countries other than the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the term is written as "trade mark" (as in the [[Trade Marks Act 1994]]), not "trademark".

== Conferred rights ==
The owners of a trade mark can legally defend their mark against infringements. To do so, the trade mark must either be registered, or have been used for a period of time so that it has acquired local distinctiveness (Prior Rights).

The extent to which a trade mark is defendable depends upon the similarity of the trade marks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved and whether the trademark has acquired distinctiveness.

A registered trade mark is relatively simple to defend in a court of law. An unregistered trade mark relies on the law of [[passing off]] (where one party's goods or services are presented in a way that causes confusion between them and the goods or services of another party).

Rights have also been recently extended with regard to well-known trade marks.

The [[Trade Marks Act 1994]] states that "a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered".&lt;ref&gt;Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  A person may also infringe a registered trade mark where the sign is similar and the goods or services are similar to those for which the mark is registered and there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person also infringes a registered trade mark where a sign is identical but the goods are dissimilar if the trade mark has a reputation in the UK and its use takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the mark's distinctive character or reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registering trade marks ==
The registration of trade marks in the UK is achieved through the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]]. If registration is accepted by the UKIPO, a number of exclusive rights are bestowed upon the trade mark owner. These rights allow the owner to prevent unauthorised use of the mark on products that are identical or similar to the registered mark.

When a trade mark application is made to the UKIPO, it examines the application to decide whether the trade mark that is being applied for is distinctive enough to be a trade mark. Registration usually takes about three and a half to four months. However, this time span can be greatly increased if any objections are raised to the mark's registration by owners of similar registered trade marks or by the UKIPO themselves. Once a trademark is registered, it is kept on the register for ten years, after which it needs to be renewed to preserve the owner's rights over it. It can also be allowed to lapse.

Trade marks are registered in one or more of 45 classes. There are 34 classes of goods and 11 for services. These classes group products that are deemed to be similar in function, and are identified by their number. For example, the registration of a trade mark for a range of gymnastic and sporting articles is classified by the trademark registry in "class 28".

== Registrability of a trade mark ==
Some of the main objections that the UKIPO will make when trademarks are submitted for registration are usually related to the "distinctiveness" of the mark. An inherently distinctive mark is the easiest to register, as it has no prior meaning. These marks are not to be found in dictionaries. A good example of such a distinctive trademark is [[iPod]].

Words that appear in the dictionary can still be registered. These arbitrary trademarks are meaningless in the context of their use. For example, ''Apple Computer'', or ''Apple Corps''.

Suggestive trade marks do not describe a characteristic of the product, but with some imagination, are identifiable with their connected product. For example, ''ColdSeal windows''.

Descriptive trade marks use words that appear in the dictionary that describe the product to which they relate. They are usually difficult to register, and the registrar needs to prove that the mark has become distinctive through its long term use. Descriptive marks can be made distinctive by the addition of other elements to the name or logo.

== Acquired distinctiveness ==
{{main|Trademark distinctiveness}}
A descriptive trade mark can only be registered if it has "acquired distinctiveness". This is achievable through its use, although proving that "acquired distinctiveness" has been achieved usually relies on sales figures and advertising budgets.

== Registration exclusions ==
Most countries exclude certain terms and symbols from being registrable. These include emblems, flags, [[Regalia|royal insignia]], and the rings of the Olympic Games. In addition, marks that are deceptive as to the country of the product's origin and marks that are obscene are unregistrable.

== Historical legislation ==
In 1862 the Merchandise Marks Act made it a criminal offence to imitate another's trade mark "with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud". In 1875, the Trade Marks Registration Act was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise prima facie evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The first trade mark to be so registered was the red triangle of the [[Bass Brewery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennison|first=S.R. (Stanley Raymond)|title=Guinness 1886–1939: From Incorporation to the Second World War|year=1998|publisher=Cork University Press|isbn=9781859181751|pages=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7q6vPnWj2tkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1859181759&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4ybFUKSLOcmQhQewloHADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=were%20quick%20to%20follow&amp;f=false|author2=Oliver McDonagh }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as "a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket". However, any word or name that was in use as a trade mark before the passing of the Act (in August 1875) was entitled to registration, whether or not the mark fulfilled these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Bently, Lionel, "The Making of Modern Trade Marks Law: The Construction of the Legal Concept of Trade Mark (1860–80)" in Lionel Bently, Jane C. Ginsburg &amp; Jennifer Davis (eds), ''Trade Marks and Brands: An Interdisciplinary Critique'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 the Patents and Trade Marks Act substantially revised trade mark law, reducing the cost of application, and included the facility to register "fancy words not in common use" and "brands" as new marks for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, John, "A Mark of Distinction: Branding and Trade Mark Law in the UK from the 1860s", ''Business History'' (2010) {{doi|10.1080/00076790903281033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further major trademark acts were passed in 1888 and 1905 (which both further refined definitions of a trade mark), 1919 (which separated the trade mark register into Parts A and B, each of which had different registration criteria) and 1938, the last of which remained in force until it was superseded in 1994.

== Recent legislation ==
The current UK [[Trademark|Trade Mark]] legislation is the [[Trade Marks Act 1994]], which implements the [[European Trade Marks Directive]] into national law.

The [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] radically altered the way UK national trade mark applications were examined in October 2007. Previously, UK national trade mark applications underwent a full examination both on absolute (distinctiveness) and relative (prior rights) grounds. In October 2007, the search which formed a part of the examination of applications on prior rights grounds became an advisory search in a similar fashion to the Community Trade Mark system, bringing into force Section 8 of the [[Trade Marks Act 1994]].  No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a conflicting mark.  Instead, it will be up to the proprietor of that right to oppose the application when it advertised for opposition purposes, although the UKIPO will still advise owners of conflicting application where citations including their marks have been sent to the applicant to assist them in making an opposition.

A fast-track application process has also been available to applicants since 7 April 2008. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516080916/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-law/t-law-notice/t-law-notice-fasttrack/t-law-notice-fasttrack-guidance.htm]

Aspects of UK [[common law]] also relate to trade marks, most notably the common law [[tort]] of [[passing off]].

In the '''United States''', '''open container laws''' regulate or prohibit the existence of open containers of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in certain areas, as well as the active consumption of alcohol in those areas. "Public places" in this context refers to openly public places such as sidewalks, parks and vehicles. It does not include nominally private spaces which are open to the public, such as bars, restaurants and stadiums. The purpose of these laws is to restrict public intoxication, especially the dangerous act of operating a vehicle while intoxicated.  Open container laws are [[U.S. state|state laws]], rather than [[law of the United States|federal laws]]; thus they vary from state to state.

== Open containers in public ==

The majority of U.S. states and localities prohibit possessing and/or consuming an open container of alcohol in public places, such as on the street, while 24 states do not have statutes regarding public consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/open-container-and-consumption-statutes.aspx |title=OPEN CONTAINER AND OPEN CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL STATE STATUTES |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 13, 2013 |website=National Conference of State Legislatures |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the definition of "public place" is not always clear. [[California]] is unique in that it does have a state law on the books, but similar to states that have no law, the state law only applies to areas in which the "city, county, or city and county have enacted an ordinance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/business/25620.html |title=California Business and Professions Code Section 25620 – California Attorney Resources – California Laws |publisher=Law.onecle.com |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open container restrictions are not always rigorously enforced, and open containers may in fact be legally permitted in nominally private events which are open to the public. This is especially true in downtown districts and during holidays and sporting events; see [[tailgate party]].

=== Places where legal ===

There are public places in the United States where open containers are explicitly permitted:
* '''[[Hood River, Oregon]]'''. This port city that rests along the Columbia River has no open container laws, and ''allows'' drinking in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/83738-8-cities-where-you-can-drink-in-public-which-is-useful-information-to-have-when|title=8 Cities Where You Can Drink In Public — Which Is Useful Information To Have When You're Looking For A Good Time|last=Grasso|first=Chelsey|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The city of [[Butte, Montana]]''', prohibits open containers only between 2am and 8am. Drinking openly in the street is allowed throughout the city (and elsewhere in [[Montana]] where no local laws exist) during the other 18 hours of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kbzk.com/news/ordinance-banning-open-containers-of-alcohol-in-butte-now-a-reality/|title=Ordinance banning open containers of alcohol in Butte now a reality {{!}} KBZK.com {{!}} Z7 {{!}} Bozeman, Montana|last=|first=|date=|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306003252/http://www.kbzk.com/news/ordinance-banning-open-containers-of-alcohol-in-butte-now-a-reality/|archive-date=6 March 2014|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent attempt to pass a comprehensive open container prohibition in Butte met with widespread opposition and was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Post|first=Justin|title=Officials reconsider alcohol ordinance: Open container proposal may go different way|url=http://mtstandard.com/news/local/officials-reconsider-alcohol-ordinance-open-container-proposal-may-go-different/article_236b2f5b-71bc-5211-94ac-2cddbbe9d583.html|accessdate=March 14, 2014|newspaper=The Montana Standard|date=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Montana state law does prohibit open containers in vehicles on a highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/61/8/61-8-460.htm|title=61-8-460.

* In '''the [[Power &amp; Light District]] of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]''', a special Missouri state law&lt;ref&gt;Section 311.086, Revised Statutes of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt; preempts Kansas City's ordinary local law against open containers&lt;ref&gt;Sections 10-134 and 10-135, Kansas City Code of Ordinances&lt;/ref&gt; and allows the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the street in open [[plastic containers]].&lt;ref name="stararticle"&gt;Rick Alm, "Drinking to be allowed on street in Power &amp; Light District," ''The Kansas City Star'', July 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Missouri]] has no statewide open container law, the Power &amp; Light District remains the only part of Kansas City where open containers are allowed actually on the street, and throughout the rest of Kansas City, open containers remain expressly prohibited.
* In unincorporated '''[[Clark County, Nevada]] (including the [[Las Vegas Strip]])''' the laws allow the possession and consumption on the street of alcoholic beverages except within parking lots or, if the alcohol was purchased in a closed container, on the premises of or within 1000 feet of the store from which it was purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.municode.com/HTML/16214/level2/TIT12PUPESAMO_CH12.35PALIDR.html#TIT12PUPESAMO_CH12.35PALIDR_12.35.010UNHE|title=Municode Library|author=|date=|work=municode.com|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also illegal to possess a glass or aluminum beverage container on specially designated streets during special events, such as the Strip on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.municode.com/HTML/16214/level2/TIT12PUPESAMO_CH12.43BECOST.html#TIT12PUPESAMO_CH12.43BECOST_12.43.020PONLWHWH|title=Municode Library|author=|date=|work=municode.com|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The entertainment district along '''[[Beale Street]]''' in Downtown '''[[Memphis, Tennessee]]''', is specially exempt from both [[Tennessee]]'s statewide open container ban and Memphis's local open container ban, thereby permitting the open consumption of alcoholic beverages on the street.
* '''The city of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]''' allows the possession and consumption on the street of any alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container (not in glass bottles or containers). Throughout the rest of Louisiana, however, open containers are still prohibited, despite the fact that drive-thru frozen [[daiquiri]] stands are legal.&lt;ref&gt;See Louisiana Revised Statutes 32:300(B)(3)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the '''[[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]] of Downtown [[Savannah, Georgia]]''', city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container of not more than 16 ounces.&lt;ref&gt;Savannah City Code Section 6-1215&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] has no state public open container law, the city law governs. Throughout the rest of Savannah, however, open containers remain prohibited.
* Within an approximately 80-acre area of '''Downtown''' '''[[Dalton, Georgia]]''', city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open paper or plastic cup of no more than 16 ounces between 12:30 p.m. and midnight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.municode.com/ga/dalton/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH6ALBE_ARTIINGE_S6-9POPUPL|title=Dalton, Ga Code of Ordinances, Sec. 6-9(c)|last=|first=|date=|website=Municode|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of the permitted area are Hawthorne Street, the western right-of-way of the L&amp;N Railway, Morris Street, and Thornton Avenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The beverage must be dispensed by a licensed establishment in the designated area in a cup that meets specifications issued by the Downtown Dalton Development Authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the rest of Dalton, however, open containers remain prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.municode.com/ga/dalton/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH6ALBE_ARTIINGE_S6-9POPUPL|title=Dalton, Ga Code of Ordinances, Sec. 6-9(a)|last=|first=|date=|website=Municode|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The town of [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], [[Texas]]''' allows open containers of beer or wine (no liquor) in its Main street shopping district.

== Open containers in vehicles ==

[[File:USA-open-container-law-path2006-2.svg|thumb|right|Prohibition of Open Containers of Alcohol in Motor Vehicles as of 2009]]

To comply with the [[TEA-21]] rules of the federal [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], a state's motor vehicle open container laws must:
* Prohibit both possession of any open alcoholic beverage container and consumption of any alcoholic beverage in a motor vehicle;&lt;ref name=transdept&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/OpenContainer/open_container.htm |title=U.S. Department of Transportation – NHTSA – Open Container Laws and Alcohol Involved Crashes: Some Preliminary Data – DOT HS 809 426 – April 2002 |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cover the passenger area of any motor vehicle, including unlocked glove compartments and any other areas of the vehicle that are readily accessible to the driver or passengers while in their seats;&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt;
* Apply to all open alcoholic beverage containers and all alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and spirits that contain one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume;&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt;
* Apply to all vehicle occupants except for passengers of vehicles designed, maintained or used primarily for the transportation of people for compensation (such as buses, taxi cabs, and limousines) or the living quarters of motor homes;&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt;
* Apply to all vehicles on a public highway or the right-of-way (i.e. on the shoulder) of a public highway;&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt;
* Require primary enforcement of the law, rather than requiring probable cause that another violation had been committed before allowing enforcement of the open container law.&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt;

Currently, 39 states and the [[District of Columbia]] are in compliance.&lt;ref name=transdept /&gt; [[Alaska]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Wyoming]] have similar limits on the possession of open containers in vehicles, but not to the level of TEA-21 compliance.

The '''use of force''', in the context of [[law enforcement]], may be defined as the "amount of effort required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Police Use of Force |url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/welcome.aspx |website=National Institute of Justice |publisher=Office of Justice Programs |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use of force doctrines''' can be employed by [[law enforcement officers]] and [[military personnel]] on guard duty. The aim of such doctrines is to balance the needs of security with [[Ethics|ethical]] concerns for the [[rights]] and well-being of intruders or suspects. Injuries to [[civilians]] tend to focus attention on [[Self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] as a [[Excuse (legal)|justification]] and, in the event of death, the notion of [[justifiable homicide]].

[[U.S. military|U.S. military personnel]] on guard duty are given a "use of force briefing" by the sergeant of the guard before being assigned to their post.

For the [[English law]] on the use of force in crime prevention, see [[Self-defence in English law]]. The [[Australia]]n position on the use of troops for civil policing is set out by [[Michael Hood]] in ''Calling Out the Troops: Disturbing Trends and Unanswered Questions'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2005/33.html&lt;/ref&gt; compare "Use of Deadly Force by the South African Police Services Re-visited"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218065028/http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Malebo Keebine-Sibanda]] and [[Omphemetse Sibanda]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
Use of force dates back to the beginning of established [[law enforcement]], with a fear that officers would abuse their power.  In today's society this fear still exists and one of the ways to fix this problem is to require police to wear body cameras and to have them turned on during all interactions with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alpert|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Dunham|first2=Roger G.|title=Understanding Police Use of Force: Officers, Suspects, and Reciprocity|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=17|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of force continuum==
{{main|Use of force continuum}}

The use of force may be standardized by a [[use of force continuum]], which presents guidelines as to the degree of force appropriate in a given situation. One source identifies five very generalized steps, increasing from least use of force to greatest. It is only one side of the model, as it does not give the levels of subject resistance that merit the corresponding increases in force.[http://www.policeone.com/writers/columnists/marksman/articles/123080/] Each successive level of force is meant to describe an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation, and the level of force used rises only when a lower level of force would be ineffective in dealing with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Use-of-Force Continuum | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/continuum.htm | date=August 4, 2009 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically any style of a use of force continuum will start with officer presence, and end with the use of deadly force.

#Presence (using the effect of the presence of an authority figure on a subject)
#Verbalization (commanding a subject)
#Empty hand control (using empty hands to search, relieve weapons, immobilize, or otherwise control a subject)
#Intermediate weapons (using non-lethal chemical, electronic or impact weapons on a subject)
#Deadly Force (using any force likely to cause permanent injury or death to a subject)

Use of force continuums can be further broken down.

===''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989)===
On November 12, 1984 Graham, who was a diabetic, felt an insulin reaction coming on and rushed to the store with a friend to get some orange juice. When the store was too crowded, he and his friend proceeded to go to another friend's house. In the midst of all this, he was being watched by Officer Connor, of the [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department|Charlotte City Police Department]] police department. While on their way to the friend's house, the officer stopped the two of them and called for backup. After several other officers arrived, one of them [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] Graham. Eventually, when Connor learned that nothing had happened in the convenience store, the officers drove Graham home and released him. Over the course of the encounter, Graham sustained a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, a bruised forehead and an injured shoulder. The Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Connor acted in good faith, because the use of force must be judged based on its objective reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham vs. Connor |url=http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021064117/http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985)===
On October 3, 1974, Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright of the [[Memphis Police Department]] were called to respond to a possible burglary. When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out "police, halt", and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being "reasonably sure" that Garner was unarmed. The Supreme Court held deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee v. Garner|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/471/1.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015|quote="[Deadly] force may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape [of a fleeing suspect] and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nelson v. City of Davis'' (2004)===
On April 16, 2004, what was supposed to be known as the "biggest party in history" took place at the annual [[UC Davis]] picnic. Due to the large number of participants at this party, people began to illegally park their cars. Sgt. John Wilson demanded that officers start to issue parking tickets to the illegally parked cars. Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non-residents to leave the complex. 30 to 40 officers were rounded up with riot gear - including pepper ball guns - to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions police were given by the police. Officers began to fire [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper-balls]], one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson. The Ninth Circuit held that the use of force was unreasonable and the officers were not entitled to [[qualified immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson v. City of Davis|url=http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/resources/journals/wlo/9thcir/2012/07/nelson-v-city-of-davis.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'' (2014) ===
On July 18, 2014, a West Memphis police officer stopped Donald Rickard for a broken headlight. As the officer talked with Rickard he noticed that there was an indentation in the [[windshield]] and that Rickard was acting very erratic. The officer asked Rickard to step out of the vehicle. Rickard at that point fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued, which involved several other officers. Rickard lost control of his vehicle in a parking lot, and officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard. Rickard again tried to flee, hitting several police cruisers and nearly hitting several officers. At this time officers opened fire on Rickard. The officers fired a total of 15 rounds which resulted in the death of both Rickard and his passenger. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of force was justified, because the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force must be based on the situation in which it was used, and not on hindsight.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', 134 S. Ct. 2012, 572 U.S., 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. statistics ==
Of the 40 million people in the [[United States]] who had face to face contact with the police 1.4%, or 574,000, reported use of force or the threat of use of force being directed at them. About a quarter of the 574,000 incidents involved the police officer pointing the gun at the subject of the incident and 53.5% of the incidents saw the officer using physical force such as kicking, grabbing, and pushing. In addition, 13.7% of those that had force used against them or were threatened with the use of force submitted complaints to the offending officer's department. Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. (2011). ''Contacts Between Police and the Public, 2008. ''(NCJ 234599). Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the ''Washington Post'' found that 385 Americans were fatally shot by law enforcement officers in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?hpid=z1| author=Kimberly Kindy| title=Fatal police shootings in 2015 approaching 400 nationwide| publisher=The Washington Post| date=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officer attributes==
===Education===

Studies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galvan|first1=Astrid|title=Study: Educated Cops Less Likely To Use Force|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/3023320metro11-30-10.htm|accessdate=October 10, 2014|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered "reasonable" force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden|first1=Robert E.|title=And Justice for All: Understanding and Controlling Police Abuse of Force|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=23–51|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these findings, very little - only 1% - of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rydberg|first1=Jason|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=The Effect of Higher Education on Police Behavior|journal=Police Quarterly|year=2010|volume=13|issue=1|pages=92–120|url=http://pqx.sagepub.com/content/13/1/92.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paoline III|first1=Eugene A.|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
It is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting. These skills tend to be better gained through repeated exposure to law enforcement situations while in the line of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terrill|first1=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results as to whether or not the amount of experience an officer has contributes to the likelihood that they will use force differ among studies.

=== Other characteristics ===
It has not been strongly found that the race, class, gender, age etc. of an officer affects the likelihood that they will use force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Chaiken|first2=Jan|last3=Kaminski|first3=Robert|title=Use of Force by Police|journal=National Institute of Justice|date=October 1999|page=9|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/176330-1.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situational factors may come into play.

==== Split-second syndrome====
Split-second syndrome is an example of how use of force can be situation-based. Well-meaning officers may resort to the use of force too quickly under situations where they must make a rapid decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=466|edition=6|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departmental attributes==
Policies on use of force can differ between departments. The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the [[Rodney King]] case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to use force, rather than how to use force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=513–527|edition=6|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers. In one study body cameras were shown to reduce the use of force by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effect of Police Body-Worn Cameras on Use of Force and Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police: A Randomized Controlled Trial|author1=Barak Ariel |author2=William A. Farrar |author3=Alex Sutherland |year = 2014|journal = Journal of Quantitative Criminology|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime levels ==
At the micro level, violent crime levels in the neighborhood increase the likelihood of law enforcement use of force. In contrast, at the meso level violent neighborhood crime does not have that much effect on use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H., Vaughn, M. S., &amp; Lim, H. (2014). The effect of neighborhood crime levels on police use of force: An examination at micro and meso levels. Journal of Criminal Justice, 42(6), 491-499&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to [[police]] and any other [[person]] from Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which states:

"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large".

Use of force may be considered lawful if it was, on the basis of the facts as the accused honestly believed them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Reasonable_Force CPS: Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime]&lt;/ref&gt; necessary and reasonable.

(Further provision about when force is "reasonable" was made by [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb5-l1g76 section 76] of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].)

'''Vilnius University Library''' or '''VU Library''' (also ''VUL'') is the oldest and one of the largest academic libraries of [[Lithuania]]. It was founded in 1570 by the [[Jesuits]] and as such is nine years older than [[Vilnius University]]. VU Library holds 5.4 million documents on shelves measuring {{convert|166|km}} in length. The holdings, accessible to members of the university and wider public, include some of the oldest manuscripts, [[incunabula]] and engravings in Lithuania and Eastern Europe. As of 2010, the library has 28,420 users.

VU Central Library is located in the [[Old Town of Vilnius]] near the [[Presidential Palace of Lithuania]]. The central library has 20 branch libraries that serve the needs of faculties and centers of Vilnius University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.vu.lt/fakultetu-centru-bibliotekos-placiau fakultetų ir centrų]&lt;/ref&gt; The central library has a lending room, 13 reading rooms, 3 halls for group work. Some of the rooms are located in historical halls with great artistic and architectural value. The architectural ensemble of Vilnius University attracts more than 10,000 tourists from Lithuania and other countries annually.

== History ==

=== Jesuit Order ===
Invited by [[Bishop of Vilnius]] [[Walerian Protasewicz]], the Jesuits came to Vilnius in 1569. On July 17, 1570, they established a college and a library. The core of the library consisted of the collections of the Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland [[Sigismund Augustus]] and [[suffragan bishop]] of Vilnius Georg Albinius. The library of Sigismund Augustus contained the best of classical works, travelogues, historical books, chronicles, and literature on natural science, law, military, and medicine published in the 16th century. It included the Bible translated by [[Martin Luther]], works by [[Euclid]] and [[Claudius Ptolemaeus]], the first edition of ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and many other works.

Privileges issued by King [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]] on April 1, 1579, converted the Vilnius Jesuit College into a university, and the library into a university library. In 1580 Bishop Protasewicz bequeathed several thousand books to the library upon his death. Many of Lithuania's clergy and the nobility also donated books to the library.

During the 200 years of Jesuit rule at the university, the library collection grew from 4,500 volumes (in 1570) to 11,000 volumes (in 1773). A series of wars, fires and plunders prevented the library from growing further and a great many of its books ended up in libraries in Russia, Poland, Sweden and elsewhere.

After the Jesuit Order was abolished in 1773, the [[Commission of National Education]] took on custody of the Vilnius University. In 1781 the University was renamed Head School of Lithuania. Its academic course altered, and the library fund was replenished with books on natural science and medicine.

=== Russian Empire ===
After the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, the greater portion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], including its capital Vilnius, became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1803 the Head School of Lithuania was renamed the Vilnius Imperial University. By the 1820s, Vilnius University ranked among the leading universities in the Russian Empire; the revival of academic research had a positive effect on the library as well. In 1804 professor Gottfried Ernest Groddeck was appointed the head of the library. He succeeded in making it accessible to the public. A Lending Department was opened in 1815, and university staff and students, officials of the educational districts, and gymnasium teachers were allowed to borrow books. The library was moved to the Small Aula, which had a ninety-seat reading room. Groddeck initiated the compilation of an alphabetic and later a systemic [[card catalog]]. Compared with other libraries in the Russian Empire, the Vilnius University Library had attained the most advanced European standards at that time.

After the [[November Uprising]], Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicolas I]] closed the university on May 1, 1832. A large part of library's collection was taken from Vilnius and distributed to various academic institutions in Russia. There were unsuccessful attempts 1834 to establish a public library with the remaining books from the university library. In 1856 the [[Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius|Antiquities Museum]] and a reading room began to function under the auspices of the Archaeological Commission. In 1865 they were converted into the Vilnius Public Library and Museum. The library was given nearly 200,000 volumes of valuable books and manuscripts from the collections of schools, cloisters, and private libraries that had been closed after uprisings in 1831 and 1863. By 1914 the Vilnius Public Library contained more than 300,000 books and ranked 4th among the libraries in the Russian Empire. It was devastated during World War I, and books were once again transported to Russia.

=== After World War I ===
Vilnius University was reopened by Poles on October 11, 1919, and renamed in honor of Stephen Báthory. Though it had been plundered, the library retained a fairly large collection. During World War II, the library suffered again from plunder and fire. The destroyed university and its library needed rapid restoration after the war. Reading rooms were installed and bibliographical activities soon organized. The library managed to retrieve approximately 13,000 of its valuable publications.

The Vilnius University Library witnessed the following significant events during the period of 1945–1990: the 400th anniversary of the library and the university (in 1970 and 1979 accordingly), the building of two new book depositories, and founding of new departments. The early book collections needed restoration, and Jurgis Tornau, then director of the library, undertook to establish the Department of Restoration in 1968. The library acquired the Department of Graphic Arts in 1969. At the end of the 1960s a decision was made to safeguard integral collections from various donors in the main library depository.

=== After regaining Lithuania independence ===

The library has been equipped with a computerized catalog since 1993, accessible via the Internet since 1994. In 1999, the library began a digital project to preserve its unique holdings – digitization of old books and manuscripts of the 16th–19th centuries (land and castle court books of various districts in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and release them on CDs. In 2000 VU Library together with other Lithuanian libraries started to subscribe to various databases, and [[EBSCO]], a universal database of full-text documents, came first. In 2005 for the first time in Lithuania academic libraries history, the information centre "Odysseus" for people with disabilities was opened.

A competition for a memorial site at the Vilnius University Library, which had been announced on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the first Lithuanian book, was won by artist Jonas Meškelevičius (1950–2005), who submitted a project for a commemorative doorway to the library. The official unveiling
of the memorial – double doors immortalizing images of major events in the history of Lithuanian culture and of the university – took place on May 21, 2001.

The '''Lithuanian Reading Room''' was opened in 2008 after reconstructing premises of the Vilnius University Library. There are two rooms – the Lithuanian Reading Room and Cabinet of Jurgis Lebedys. The Lithuanian Reading Room collects Lithuanian periodic from 1918 till 1939, research documents about Lithuanian history, geography, culture and art, etc. The Cabinet of Lebedys houses material for the studies of Lithuanian language and literature. The cabinet can be reserved for lectures or seminars.

The '''Rare Book Department''' has accumulated over 160,000 items from the 15th through 21st centuries. It is the largest depository of old books in Lithuania and rivals the most famous libraries of Eastern Europe by its significance. The collection contains: the largest collections of [[incunabula]] and post-incunabula in Lithuania; books from the 16th to 18th centuries; the richest in the world collection of old Lithuanian books (including the [[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas|first Lithuanian book]] by [[Martynas Mažvydas]], ''[[Catechism of Mikalojus Daukša|Katekizmas]]'' by [[Mikalojus Daukša]], works by [[Baltramiejus Vilentas]]); especially valuable old atlases and maps; book collection of the Old Vilnius University Library – Bibliotheca Academiae Vilnensis (it includes books from collections of [[Sigismund August]], [[Sapieha family]], Georg Albinius, [[Walerian Protasewicz]], M. Pacas, E. Valavičius and university professors).&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Vilniaus universiteto bibliotekos istoriniai rinkiniai|url=http://www.mb.vu.lt/unesco/ivadas.htm|accessdate=2009-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307103133/http://www.mb.vu.lt/unesco/ivadas.htm|archivedate=2009-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manuscript Department''' contains more than 265,000 documents, divided into 301 archival collections of smaller or larger scope: Vilnius University, [[Vytautas the Great University]] in Kaunas, editorial boards, societies and institutions, church institutions, collections compiled by the department and personal collections.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The earliest document – a land donation – is dated 1209. Documents were written in Lithuanian, Latin, Polish, [[Chancery Slavonic]], Russian, German, English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Swedish and other languages. Documents are important for research of Vilnius University, development of different fields of science, university's relations with other higher schools of Central and Eastern Europe, history of science and culture of the Lithuanian state and neighboring countries.

The '''Graphic Arts Cabinet''' compiles various graphic works since the beginning of the 19th century when in 1805 the Department of Engraving and the Study of Graphics were established at the university. Major part of the collection comprises old graphics (about 12,000 items) dating back to 16th–19th centuries – artworks of Lithuanian, Russian, Polish artists and other painters from European countries.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; As of 2009, the Department of Graphic Arts holds over 91,000 artworks.

The '''Museum of Sciences''', founded in 1973, compiles, processes and actualizes visual scientific material about historical Vilnius University. The Museum is housed in the premises of St. John's Church. Especially valuable is the collection of coins of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, including 12th–15th-century silver alloys – the so-called Lithuanian ilgieji (Lithuanian Long Bars) from Ribiškė hoard, roubles of [[Veliky Novgorod]], [[grivna]]s of [[Kievan Rus']]. Museum's holdings also include large collections of Polish, Russian old coins.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

The '''Museum of Adam Mickiewicz''' compiles, systematizes, stores, and investigates material related to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], his creative work and activities. Most valuable museum's exhibits are personal possessions of the poet: a small table, a chair and an arm-chair used by the poet when he lived in Kaunas and Paris. At present the museum displays more than 200 exhibits and has a small library.

'''The Philosophy Reading Room''' was opened in 2010 after reconstructing premises of the Vilnius University Library. The Philosophy Reading Room moved from the Faculty of Philosophy. It was the start of the integration of faculty libraries into the main buildings of Vilnius University library. The Philosophy Reading Room consists of 4 rooms, equipped with 40 individual and 11 computerized workstations. In open stacks - Educology, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Social work and Medicine studies literature.

== Architecture of historical halls ==

=== Hall of Pranciškus Smuglevičius ===
[[File:VU bibliotekos Smuglevičiaus salė.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Hall of Pranciškus Smuglevičius]]
The Hall of Pranciškus Smuglevičius is the oldest part of the original library complex, named after [[Franciszek Smuglewicz]] (1745–1807), celebrated painter and professor of the university. Until the end of the 18th century, the hall was used as a [[refectory]]. In 1803 it was assigned to the library and artist Smuglewicz was hired to decorate it. The painter adhered to the spirit of [[Classicism]]; between the windows and on the walls he painted the portraits of the 12 most prominent figures in antique art and science: [[Socrates]], [[Plutarch]], [[Pindar]], [[Anacreon]], [[Hesiod]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Euripides]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], [[Homer]], [[Archimedes]] and [[Plato]]. From then on the hall was used for various ceremonies and celebrations.&lt;ref name=rumai&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Vilniaus universiteto rūmai. Teksto autorė: Audronė Mačiulytė-Kasperavičienė ; sudarytojai: M. Sakalauskas, A. Stravinskas ; redakcinė komisija: J. Kubilius (pirmininkas) ... [et al.]. Vilnius : Vaga, 1979. 112 p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Mickiewicz]] was granted his diploma here in 1819. Prominent guests including [[Napoleon]], Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], and others have visited this hall.

In 1855 the hall was assigned to the Antiquities Museum of the Vilnius Provisional Archaeology Commission and, when the commission was closed in 1865, to the Public Library of Vilnius.&lt;ref name=infolt&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Vilniaus universiteto architektūrinis ansamblis |url=http://www1008.vu.lt/kiemeliai/vu/biblioteka/infolt.html |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time hall's functions changed and in 1867 painter Vasilii Griaznov replaced its classical tones with pseudo-[[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] ornamentation. The hall was refurbished in 1929 and restored to the version by Smuglewicz. During the works, a 16th– or 17th-century fresco of Mary enveloping the founders of the old university was uncovered on the ceiling. Since then the Hall of Smuglevičius has retained its appearance with furniture from the time of the Public Library of Vilnius. At present the hall is used by the Department of Rare Publications.

=== Hall of Joachim Lelewel ===
[[File:VU bibliotekos J.Lelevelio salė.JPG|left|thumb|Hall of Joachim Lelewel]]
At first the hall was an almost square chapel with a vaulted ceiling, rising upwards through the second and third floors. The centre of the vaults was taken up by a panel with a painted portrait of St. [[Stanislaus Kostka]], the guardian of students. The chapel was built in the middle of the 18th century according to designs of [[Tomas Žebrauskas]]. After the dissolution of the Jesuit Order the hall was used by the Department of Paintings. The hall was divided into two floors during the first quarter of the 19th century. For a long time the third floor was home to the Art Department, and the workplace of famous artist [[Jan Rustem]]. In 1929, professor [[Joachim Lelewel]] bequeathed a valuable collection of books and atlases to the library; they were transferred from Kurniki to this hall, which was then named in his honour and commemorative exhibition was arranged.&lt;ref name=bulo&gt;{{Citation |last=Bulotaitė |first=Nijolė |title=Vilnius university |location=Vilnius |publisher=Baltos lankos |year=2007 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White Hall (old observatory) ===
[[File:VU bibliotekos baltoji salė.JPG|right|thumb|The White Hall]]
The history of the White Hall is part of the history of the old observatory (founded in 1753) of the Vilnius University. The observatory was designed and built by Lithuanian architect and astronomer, VU professor, Tomas Žebrauskas. Funds for the building were donated by [[Ignacy Ogiński]] and his daughter Elżbieta Ogińska-Puzynina, whose particularly generous contribution of 200,000 [[Polish złoty]] gained her the title of the observatory patron.&lt;ref name=infolt/&gt;

The observatory was composed of the White Hall, the Small Hall, two slender three-storey square towers, and two small single-storey towers. Six massive [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] pillars, girded with ornamental [[cornice]]s divide the White Hall into three parts. An oval opening in ceiling appears to connect the White Hall with the Small Hall above it, and thereby conveys the Baroque concept of infinite space. A remarkable portrait of King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] is positioned in the centre of the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]. The portrait is surmounted by allegorical figures of the sitting women representing [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Urania]]. Diana holds a portrait of benefactress Elżbieta Ogińska-Puzynina, while Uriana has a wreath of stars in her hands.&lt;ref name=rumai/&gt;

At the end of the 18th century, [[Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt]] built an extension to the observatory, designed by architect [[Marcin Knackfus]] in the [[Classical architecture|Classical style]]. The extension housed a large [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and other instruments. The White Hall contained not only astronomical equipment but also a valuable library with works on astronomy, mathematics, physics, geography, architecture, and other subjects taught at the university. The books were kept in 12 cupboards in niches between the windows. The hall was decorated with approximately 30 oil paintings of prominent individuals and university scholars. The observatory was seriously damaged by fire in 1876 and closed in 1883. During the time of the Public Library of Vilnius, the White Hall was used as a book depository. It was reopened in 1997 after 10-year renovation. A unique collection of ancient astronomical instruments, including globes made in Amsterdam in 1622 as well as globes made in 1750 and dedicated to King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], is displayed in the White Hall. Now it houses the Professor's Reading Room and plans are made to arrange a museum of the university's history.

=== Philology Reading Room ===
[[File:Skaityklos filologijos.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Philology reading room]]
The Philology Room occupies the second floor above the Hall of Smuglevičius. At first the room was the assembly hall of the Jesuit Academy, later it was converted into a library. When the library was transferred to the present Small Aula in 1819, the room housed a museum of [[mineralogy]]. After the university was closed, the hall belonged to the Museum of Antiquities from 1855 to 1865. In 1945, the hall was converted into the General Reading Room for the Vilnius University Library.&lt;ref name=infolt/&gt; The hall has once again been newly restored, according to a project by architect Aldona Švabauskienė. The [[parquet floor]] was restored according to thesurviving samples from the mid-19th century. The 17th-century vaults have been preserved, but their decorations of plaster-work were painted over at the beginning of the 20th century, and now the room is devoid of embellishments. In the end of 2010 the hall was converted into the Philology Reading Room.

=== Professors' Reading Room ===
[[File:VU bibliotekos profesorių skaitykla.jpg|right|thumb|The Professors' Reading Room]]
The hall used to serve as the Jesuits' summer residence. In the 18th century it was decided to adapt the hall to the needs of the library. A [[frieze]] with floral ornaments was discovered under a layer of plaster during a restoration in 1919. The design of its wooden [[coffer]]ed ceiling by architect [[Karol Podczaszyński]] was discovered after a fire in 1969.&lt;ref name=bulo/&gt; It was renovated by [[Ferdynand Ruszczyc]], a professor of the university. The hall's Classical decor and its original grey colour was restored in 1970.

[[File:New Vilnius University library.jpg|left|thumb|National Open Access Scientific Communication and Information Center]]

Two book depositories were built in 1970–1982, but space had once again become a problem in the late 1980s. In 1989, a project for a new library building in the [[Saulėtekis Valley]] was announced. However, no funds had been allocated for the construction. In 2004 the university revisited the project of the library building and a new, modern vision was prepared by 2006. The construction started in 2010.

The new center is planned in the academic cluster in the Saulėtekis Valley. At present, the valley houses four faculties of Vilnius University, several departments of [[Vilnius Gediminas Technical University]], and residential dormitories of both universities. It is planned to move several other faculties of Vilnius University and other scientific institutes of Lithuania to the valley. Hopes are that the new academic cluster will also attract business enterprises. The center will be the first construction in the valley, kicking off its further development.
