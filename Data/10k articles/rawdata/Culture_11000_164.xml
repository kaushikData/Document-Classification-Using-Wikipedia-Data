The '''''arbelas''''' (plural ''arbelai'') was a [[List of Roman gladiator types|type]] of [[ancient Roman]] [[gladiator]]. The word is a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'', occurring only in the ''[[Oneirocritica]]'' of [[Artemidorus]], a Greek work on [[dream interpretation]] that discusses the symbolism of various [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]].&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Duncan|title=Performance and Identity in the Classical World|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be related to the Greek word ''arbelos'' (ἄρβηλος), a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]]'s semicircular blade used to cut leather&lt;ref name=Duncan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;{{cite book|first=Garret G.|last=Fagan|title=The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael|last=Carter|title=Artemidorus and the Arbelas Gladiator|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=134|year=2001|pages=109–115|jstor=20190801}} {{subscription required|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to an [[ulu]]. 

A few [[relief]]s show gladiators armed with a curved blade fighting each other; it has been argued that these (possibly also fighting ''[[retiarius|retiarii]]'', the net-fighters) are ''arbelai'';&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt; however, they have also been seen as the ''[[Scissor (gladiator type)|scissores]]'' who likewise may have been matched against ''retiarii''.&lt;ref name=Fagan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter2&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael|last=Carter|title=Gladiatorial Combat with 'Sharp' Weapons (τοι̑ϛ ὀξέσι σιδήροιϛ)|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=155|year=2006|pages=161–175|jstor=20191036}} {{subscription required|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''scissor'', with whom the ''arbelas'' may be synonymous, is referred to in a roll call from the gladiator training school ''([[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]])'' owned in the 1st century BC by the ''[[lanista]]'' C. Salvius Capito.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Artemidorus lists the ''arbelas'' among gladiators who might appear in dreams advising a man about what sort of woman he is to marry. Both the ''[[dimachaerus]]'', who fought with two curved blades, and the "so-called" ''arbelas'' signify that the woman will either be a [[Venefica sorceress|poisoner]], malicious, or ugly.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Carter|editor1-first=J.

'''''BioShock 2''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[2K Marin]] and published by [[2K Games]]. A part of the [[BioShock (series)|''Bioshock'' series]], it is the sequel to the 2007 video game ''[[BioShock]]'' and was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[PlayStation 3]], and the [[Xbox 360]] on February 9, 2010. [[Feral Interactive]] released an [[OS X]] version of the game on March 30, 2012. Set in the fictional underwater [[dystopia]]n city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], the game's story takes place eight years after ''BioShock''. Assuming control of Subject Delta, a hulking [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddy]], players are tasked with fighting through "splicers", the psychotic human population of the city, using weapons and an array of genetic modifications. The game also introduces a story-driven multiplayer mode called ''Fall of Rapture'', which takes place during Rapture's 1959 civil war, before the events of the first game.

''BioShock 2'' was mainly developed by [[2K Marin]], with [[2K Australia]], [[Arkane Studios]], and [[Digital Extremes]] providing additional support. [[2K Boston]], formerly [[Irrational Games]], also assisted the game's development, with series creator [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] providing input. The story received major changes over the course of development. [[Garry Schyman]], the composer of the first game, returned to create the score for ''BioShock 2''.

The game received critical acclaim upon release, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative, art-style, characters, ending and gameplay. However, the game attracted criticism for having a slow start and being too similar to its predecessor. The game was supported with [[downloadable content]] upon launch, and a new single-player campaign, titled ''[[Minerva's Den]]'', was released in August 2010. The game sold more than 3&amp;nbsp;million copies, but did not meet Take-Two Interactive's sales expectations. A remastered version of the game was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 13, 2016, as part of ''[[BioShock: The Collection]]''.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
''BioShock 2'' is set in the fictional city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], hidden from the rest of the world underwater. Rapture was the realized vision of Andrew Ryan, who built the city to escape the tyranny of governments. Despite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence of the lower class to plan a coup of Rapture. Fontaine created black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implanting of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed "Little Sisters".  Fontaine used his plasmid-enhanced army to attack Ryan, but reportedly was killed in the battle.

Ryan took the opportunity to seize his assets including the plasmid factories. In the months that followed, a second figure named Atlas rose to speak for the lower class, creating further strife. Atlas led attacks on the factories housing the Little Sisters, and Ryan countered by creating "Big Daddies", plasmid-enhanced humans surgically grafted into giant lumbering diving suits who were psychologically compelled to protect the Little Sisters at all costs.&lt;ref name="bit-tech-BS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/3 |title=''BioShock'' Gameplay Review (page 2) |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=August 21, 2007 |first=Joe |last=Martin |publisher=[[Bit-tech]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011130758/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2007/08/21/bioshock_gameplay_review/3 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also created his own army of plasmid-enhanced soldiers, named "Splicers," which he controlled using pheromones distributed through Rapture's air system. Tension came to a head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas ordered an all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane survivors barricaded themselves away. What once was a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling [[dystopia]].&lt;ref name="IGN-BS1 review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813214p1.html |title=''BioShock'' Review |publisher=IGN |last=Onyett |first=Charles |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817035302/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/813/813214p1.html |archivedate=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
{{see also|List of characters in the BioShock series#BioShock|List of characters in the BioShock series#BioShock 2|l1=List of characters in BioShock|l2=List of characters in BioShock 2}}
''BioShock 2'' opens on New Year's Eve, 1958 (2 years before the events of the first game), as Subject Delta patrols Rapture with his Little Sister, Eleanor. Eleanor is separated from Delta by her mother, Sofia Lamb, who uses a [[mind control]] plasmid on Delta to make him shoot himself. Ten years later, Delta awakens, revived by Little Sisters under the control of Eleanor. Delta is drawn towards Eleanor by their past Big Daddy-Little Sister connection. Brigid Tenenbaum encounters Delta, and explains that unless Delta reunites with Eleanor, he will fall into a [[coma]]. With the help of the Little Sisters under Eleanor's control and Tenenbaum's ally, former enterpreneur Augustus Sinclair, Delta makes his way towards Lamb's stronghold. Traveling through the city, Delta encounters members of the Rapture family such as Grace Holloway, a singer who had suffered under Ryan's unjust laws against revolt; Stanley Poole, a con artist whom had murdered many of the Family's members in Dionysus Square after foolishly trying to cover up his blunders from Lamb; and Gil Alexander, a respected scientist who worked at Fontaine Futuristics before Lamb transformed him into an encased monstrosity of flesh, who he can kill or spare, and learns Lamb's plan: she seeks to use ADAM to transform Eleanor into a perfect embodiment of her altruistic ideals. Lamb's ultimate goal is to have the collected minds and memories of everyone in Rapture become a part of Eleanor through the use of the genetic memory in ADAM, thus making her an "Embodiment of the Family" which Lamb believes will put an end to "The Self".

Delta arrives at a containment chamber where Eleanor is held, but Lamb captures him and severs his bond with Eleanor by temporarily stopping her heart. Though Eleanor survives, Delta begins to slowly die as the bond cannot be re-established. Using a Little Sister, Eleanor transforms herself into a Big Sister and breaks Delta from confinement. Together they head for an escape pod that Sinclair has arranged to leave Rapture. The two find that Lamb has converted Sinclair into Subject Omega, declaring that Delta should be what Sinclair is now, and Delta is forced to finish him off. After a final climactic showdown with the remnants of The Rapture Family in order to buy time for Eleanor to prepare the pod, Delta is forced to flood the area and escape in his suit. Eleanor and Delta make it to the escape pod but a bomb set by Lamb leaves Delta mortally wounded. Eleanor teleports and reaches the escape pod before the bomb blows, while Delta manages to grab onto the pod's side and climb aboard as it rises.

The game's ending depends on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or force her to drown, depending on whether the player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that one of the little sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and make her own way in life.&lt;!-- http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/bioshock-2/guide/page_91.html --&gt;

== Gameplay ==
{{See also|BioShock#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in BioShock}}
''BioShock 2'' is presented as a [[first-person shooter]], with the player taking on the role of Subject Delta, a prototype for the [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]] 8 years after the events of the first game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/29/big-boss-of-the-day-bioshocks-big-daddy |title=Big Boss Of the Day: BioShock's Big Daddy |first=Jesse |last=Schedeen |work=[[IGN]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803161903/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/29/big-boss-of-the-day-bioshocks-big-daddy |archivedate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''BioShock'', the player explores Rapture and fights off splicers, the remaining psychotic human population of the undersea city, using a combination of the environment, weapons, plasmids, and tonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/04/bioshock/ |title=First Look: BioShock 2 Takes Bold Trip Back To Rapture |first=Chris |last=Kohler |work=[[Wired.co.uk]] |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611140240/http://www.wired.com/2009/04/bioshock/ |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids and tonics are special genetic-reencoding liquids that grant the user active or passive abilities, respectively, and include many of those introduced in ''BioShock'' as well as new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5464260/the-plasmids-and-tonics-of-bioshock-2 |title=The Plasmids and Tonics Of BioShock 2 |first=Brian |last=Crecente |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610112807/http://kotaku.com/5464260/the-plasmids-and-tonics-of-bioshock-2 |archivedate=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, plasmids can give the player the ability to use [[telekinesis]] or to invoke fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/05/bioshock-2-plasmid-showcase?page=2 |title=BioShock 2 Plasmid Showcase |first=Charles |last=Onyett |work=[[IGN]] |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803184745/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/05/bioshock-2-plasmid-showcase?page=2 |archivedate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while tonics can improve the player's movement speed, attack damage, or damage resistance. Several of the weapons in ''BioShock 2'' were previously seen carried by Big Daddies in the first game, including a powerful drill and a rivet gun. The player can use each weapon in a close-range melee attack, unlike in the first game, and is able to equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time, which they can use in quick succession to destroy enemies. For example, the player might freeze a foe using a plasmid then shatter it using a spear gun. If the player is killed, they are revived in the most recently visited "vita-chamber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/04/23/joystiq-interview-bioshock-2/ |title=Joystiq interview: BioShock 2 |first=Randy |last=Nelson |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |date=April 23, 2009 |publisher=Joystiq |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424203424/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/04/23/joystiq-interview-bioshock-2/ |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Big Daddy, the player can defeat other Big Daddies to either adopt their Little Sisters—having them gather ADAM for the player—or harvest them for their ADAM outright. If the player adopts the Little Sister, they must escort their charge to corpses littered around Rapture and protect them while they harvest more ADAM.&lt;ref name="1up-pauperdroppreview"&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/bioshock-2-pauper-drop-preview|title=BioShock 2 Pauper's Drop Preview|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=|accessdate=|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120150808/http://www.1up.com/previews/bioshock-2-pauper-drop-preview|archivedate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Little Sister has collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the Little Sister. Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of beneficial gifts later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2009/12/21/hands-on-with-bioshock-2-in-london/ |title=Hands-on with BioShock 2 in London |first=Patrick |last=Garett |work=[[VG247]] |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919054749/https://www.vg247.com/2009/12/21/hands-on-with-bioshock-2-in-london/ |archivedate=September 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a Big Sister. The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.&lt;ref name="gi_reveal" /&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
''BioShock 2'' features a story-driven multiplayer mode called ''Fall of Rapture'' in which the player takes on the role of one of Rapture's citizens before the events of ''[[BioShock]]'', during Rapture's 1959 civil war. The player is sponsored by the plasmid manufacturer, Sinclair Solutions, to test out their weapons, plasmids, and Tonics in a consumer reward program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-2-multiplayer-goes-to-digital-extremes/1100-6209386/ |title=BioShock 2 multiplayer goes to Digital Extremes |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915072024/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-2-multiplayer-goes-to-digital-extremes/1100-6209386/ |archivedate=September 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the player progresses through the multiplayer experience, new weapons, tonics, and plasmids will be unlocked (provided by Sinclair) in addition to the story of the Rapture civil war being told through audio diaries available in the player's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bioshock-2-multiplayer-preview |title=BioShock 2 Multiplayer Preview |date=May 28, 2009 |publisher=Eurogamer |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129035834/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bioshock-2-multiplayer-preview |archivedate=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player can choose from among 6 characters to serve as an in-game avatar. The characters are: Jacob Norris the welder, Barbara Johnson the housewife, Danny Wilkins the football star, Buck Raleigh the businessman, Naledi Atkins the pilot, and Suresh Sheti the Indian mystic. Two additional characters were available as a pre-order bonus from 12game, [[GameStop]], [[EB Games]] or [[Game (retailer)|Game]], or through the purchase of a DLC pack: a fisherman named Zigo d'Acosta and an actress named Mille Blanche de Glace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endsights.com/news/6517/bioshock-2-pre-order-bonus-revealed |title=BioShock 2 Pre-Order Bonus Revealed |date=April 11, 2009 |publisher=Endsights |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222075136/http://www.endsights.com/news/6517/bioshock-2-pre-order-bonus-revealed/ |archivedate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two characters were made available by downloading the Sinclair Solutions Tester Pack: a criminal named Louie McGraff and a smooth-talking playboy named Oscar Calraca.

Multiplayer comes in 7 different modes, two of which have a single-player and team-based mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/mpmodes.html |title=The Many Modes of Multiplayer |date=November 10, 2009 |publisher=[[2K Games]] |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228211515/http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/mpmodes.html |archivedate=February 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modes include "Survival of the Fittest", a free-for-all deathmatch mode; "Civil War", a team deathmatch;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-2-impressions/1100-6211627/|title=BioShock 2 Impressions|first=Giancarlo |last=Varanini|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Capture the Sister", a capture-the-flag-style mode where one team defends a Little Sister while the other attempts to capture her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/bioshock-2-capture-the-sister-mode-unveiled-153422.phtml |title=BioShock 2 'Capture The Sister' mode unveiled |first=Jim |last=Sterling |work=[[Destructoid]] |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813234417/https://www.destructoid.com/bioshock-2-capture-the-sister-mode-unveiled-153422.phtml |archivedate=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Turf War", where teams compete to control specific areas of a map.

In the multiplayer modes 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Civil War', and 'Turf War', a Big Daddy suit will spawn at a random location in the level. The choice is given to the player who finds this suit to become the Big Daddy, which will give the player greater strength and endurance but prohibits the use of plasmids and hacking, as well as expelling any previously held damage bonuses against other players. The Big Daddy can stomp, shoot a rivet gun, melee attack, and throw proximity mines. All damage dealt to the Big Daddy is permanent, and cannot be replenished. Once the Big Daddy is defeated, the suit disappears and spawns in another location on the map two minutes later. In 'Capture the Sister' one member of the defending team is chosen at random to be the Big Daddy; after the player's death, the Big Daddy suit disappears for the rest of the round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/partying-like-it-s-1959-in-bioshock-2-s-multiplayer-153311.phtml |title=Partying Like It's 1959 in BioShock 2's Multiplayer |date=August 29, 2009 |publisher=Destructoid |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202153125/http://www.destructoid.com/partying-like-it-s-1959-in-bioshock-2-s-multiplayer-153311.phtml |archivedate=December 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan Thomas, ''BioShock 2''{{'}}s creative director, said that the first concern with a sequel to ''BioShock'' was "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock them in a way that they're not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they're projecting onto it?"&lt;ref name="cultofrapture-podcast_ep1"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Thomas, Jordan; Hogarth De La Plante|date=April 13, 2009|title=BioShock 2 Podcast Ep. 1: Welcome Back to Rapture|url=http://downloads.2kgames.com/bioshock2/BioShock_2_Episode_1_Welcome_Back_to_Rapture.mp3|accessdate=August 18, 2016|time=27:08|publisher=2K Games|format=mp3|medium=Podcast|quote=To be, or not to be.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409084827/http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/podcasts.html|archivedate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a ''BioShock'' game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting.&lt;ref name="gamestm-april2009-feature_pg65"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2009|title=Who's The Daddy Now?|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=82|issn=1478-5889|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played ''BioShock'' more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it's still an interesting place or not," La Plante recalled. "And if that doesn't bore us and we're the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is."&lt;ref name="cultofrapture-podcast_ep1"/&gt;

Each game level was devised by a team comprised on an environmental artist and level designer working collaboratively,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as opposed to a workflow where the level was designed and then handed over to art teams to be detailed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Level designer Steve Gaynor recalled that by involving the level designer, they could make sure that gameplay spaces still felt like functional, real spaces, making sure that the Rapture of ''BioShock 2'' still felt like a living, breathing world.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} &lt;!-- process of designing a level --&gt;

Among the goals of ''BioShock 2''{{'}}s developers was to capitalize or improve aspects of the first game that were received less positively. One such element was the ''[[Pipe Mania]]''-inspired hacking minigame. Thomas said that even players who enjoyed the minigames became "numb" to it after repetition; the replacement of the mini game with hacking that didn't allow you to pause the game added more urgency to the gameplay. Another aspect was the choice to harvest or save Little Sisters; by allowing players to adopt the Little Sisters before deciding their fate, Thomas hoped it would help players form a bond with the characters and think about their choice.&lt;ref name="gamestm-christmas2010-feature_pg82"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Christmas 2010|title=Intelligent Design|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=91|issn=1478-5889|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other goals the developers had for the sequel was adding more unspliced characters and give players a greater chance to make decisions that impacted the course of the game.&lt;ref name="gamestm-april2009-feature_pg67"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2009|title=Who's The Daddy Now?|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=82|issn=1478-5889|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You make decisions about their fate as well, all of which play into the way the story ends," Thomas said. "There's definitely more granularity and dynamism in the narrative of ''BioShock 2''."&lt;ref name="gamestm-christmas2010-feature_pg83"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Christmas 2010|title=Intelligent Design|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=91|issn=1478-5889|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses [[Unreal Engine 2.5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gaudiosi |first=John |url=http://www.unrealengine.com/showcase/bioshock_2/ |title=Unreal Engine 2.5 Still Brings Rapture Alive in Bioshock 2 |publisher=[[Unreal Engine]] |date=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725010852/http://www.unrealengine.com/showcase/bioshock_2/ |archivedate=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story received major changes over the course of development, with two of the most important relating to the player's character and the Big Sister. Initially there was only going to be one Big Sister who would continually hunt the player down throughout the course of the game and then retreat once she was defeated. This Big Sister was written as a Little Sister who, as she grew up on the surface, could not leave the memory of Rapture behind and eventually returned. The reason for the change, as explained by Zak McClendon, lead designer for 2K Marin, is "If you have a single character that the player knows they can't kill because they're so important to the story you're completely removing the triumph of overcoming that encounter with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/video/6242031/bioshock-2-interview-gameplay-and-story-exclusive-interview?hd=1&amp;tag=videos;hd;3 | title = BioShock 2 Interview: Gameplay and Story Exclusive Interview | publisher = GameSpot | accessdate = January 23, 2010 | date = December 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Thomas, the game's director,&lt;ref name="theindependent-jordanthomas_interview"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Plant |first=Michael |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/bioshock-2-the-interview-1885879.html |title=BioShock 2: The interview |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218104047/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/bioshock-2-the-interview-1885879.html |archivedate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains however, "The soul of the original Big Sister character still exists, but in the form of somebody you get to know over the course of the game."&lt;ref name="Tobey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/podcasts |title=BioShock 2 Podcast Episode Eight: Creating a Story |publisher=2K Games |accessdate=January 23, 2010 |date=January 12, 2010 |first=Elizabeth |last=Tobey |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202225744/http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/podcasts |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major change was that the player's character, Subject Delta, is no longer the first Big Daddy, but rather the fourth prototype. He is, however, the first to be successfully 'pair-bonded' to a single Little Sister.&lt;ref name="Tobey"/&gt;

Initially, media reports suggested that the subtitle, ''Sea Of Dreams'', would accompany the second entry in the series. However, this subtitle was supposedly dropped, before 2K withdrew the statement, stating that the "Sea Of Dreams" subtitle would still be part of the full title.&lt;ref name="subtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bioshock-2-doesnt-drop-subtitle |title=BioShock 2 doesn't drop subtitle |date=March 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Rob |last=Purchese |accessdate=March 23, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326011307/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/bioshock-2-doesnt-drop-subtitle |archivedate=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a later statement from  2K spokesman Charlie Sinhaseni clarified that the ''Sea Of Dreams'' title was for the trailer, and not for the game itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IGN Staff |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/969/969139p1.html |title=BioShock 2's Subtitle Saga |publisher=IGN |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404095138/http://ps3.ign.com/articles/969/969139p1.html |archivedate=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance for ''BioShock 2'' came in the form of a teaser trailer that was available in the PlayStation 3 version of the first game.

This site documents a man named Mark Meltzer's investigation into the disappearances of girls from coastline areas around the Atlantic, along with a mysterious red light that accompanies each kidnapping. On April 9, 2009, on the [[Spike TV]] show ''[[GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley]]'' the first ''BioShock 2'' gameplay video was shown featuring the Big Sister. This demo showed many features including the ability to walk under water.

=== Art ===
Assisting 2K Marin were artists from 2K Australia, 2K China, Digital Extremes, and Arkane Studios.&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-forward"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|section=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; Character modeler Brendan George recalled that the modelers would have to think about how the concept art would be animated, not directly copying from the concept art to avoid animation issues and the [[uncanny valley]].&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Character concept artist Colin Fix recalled that while the teams researched the time period for era-appropriate influences, costumes would need regular adjustment. "[The artists] had an earlier version of Stanley with a swanky Hawaiian shirt that was in the time period, but felt out of place in Rapture. It felt really modern even though it wasn't."&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-9"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fix described the splicers as originally perfect [[J. C. Leyendecker]] and [[Norman Rockwell]] figures, but "totally distorted."&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-14"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the recognizably human silhouettes of the splicers established in BioShock, the artists decided to push into more varied forms. Early concepts had parasite-covered splicers or air sacs, along with translucent, bioluminescent skin, but finding that these "human blobs" did not instill a sense of sadness in the player, the artists moved back to more conventional forms.&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-17"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|pages=17–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create the multiplayer characters of pre-fall Rapture, Digital Extremes developed more than 26 character concepts, which were then narrowed down to a few archetypes that would represent a cross-section of the Rapture population.&lt;ref name="deco-devolution-38"&gt;{{cite book|author=|year=2010|title=Deco Devolution: The Art of Bioshock 2|publisher=2K Games|pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Sister was, according to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, the first thing Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators when they arrived at 2K Marin.&lt;ref name="cultofrapture-podcast_ep3_"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Thomas, Jordan; Hogarth De La Plante|date=June 3, 2009|title=BioShock 2 Podcast Ep. 3: Big Sister Art Progression|url=http://downloads.2kgames.com/bioshock2/BioShock_2_Episode_3_Big_Sister_Progression.mp3|accessdate=August 19, 2016|time=1:35–2:10|publisher=2K Games|format=mp3|medium=Podcast|quote=JEFF WEIR: Actually, it was the first thing Jordan talked about when we got here, was the Big Sister idea. / COLIN FIX: Yeah, I think the Big Sister's very important to Jordan. My very first day, which a lot of companies usually consists of sit down, get familiar with your computer, maybe organize a couple files, see if your e-mail is checked up. No, he took me into a room, took Jeff and I into the room, was like, "Alright, this is the main character of the game, *babble*" He just started going, and we're like, "Oh my lord!" This is the first thing we're doing. We had just sat down, basically, and he was already getting us thinking about this Big Sister character.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409084827/http://www.2kgames.com/cultofrapture/podcasts.html|archivedate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive words on a page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. "[We thought] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that's really the hard challenge that we had with her. Actually in terms of design, there were lots of fun things, like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel to her, like broken wings," Weir recalled.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Motion capture]] sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal of the rest of the character.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Multiplayer ===
[[Digital Extremes]] produced the multiplayer component of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6209386.html |title=BioShock 2 multiplayer goes to Digital Extremes |last=Magrino |first=Tom |date=May 8, 2009 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512123315/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6209386.html |archivedate=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the multiplayer portion, players are put in a separate story where civil war has broken out in Rapture prior to the events of the first game.

=== Audio ===
Michael Kamper served as ''BioShock 2''{{'}}s Audio Lead; he joined 2K Marin to work on ''BioShock 2'' after the closure of [[Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts Chicago]]. Only a single sound designer had worked on the previous ''BioShock''{{'}}s lauded sound, which Kamper called "intimidating"; "we were all basically coming into the project as fans of the first game." While Kamper collaborated with the leads for other facets of the game, he was given wide latitude to develop the sonic style of the game. Kamper, in turn, gave his team freedom to use whatever software they wanted to create and manipulate sounds, not wanting to limit their creativity.&lt;ref name="designingsound-kemperinterview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Isaza, Michael|date=March 1, 2010|url=http://designingsound.org/2010/03/exclusive-interview-with-michael-kamper-audio-lead-of-bioshock-2/|title=Exclusive Interview with Michael Kamper, Audio Lead of BioShock 2|publisher=Designing Sound|accessdate=August 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201190432/http://designingsound.org/2010/03/exclusive-interview-with-michael-kamper-audio-lead-of-bioshock-2/|archivedate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Certainly, the fact that the game was going to be set ten years after the first ''BioShock'' established the atmosphere of ''BioShock 2''," he recalled. "I really wanted the ambience to sell the fact that Rapture was constantly falling apart around the player." In addition to lots of creaking and groaning sounds to accentuate the setting's disrepair, Kamper and the audio team added [[non-diegetic]] sounds that grow in frequency the closer the player gets to the end of the game to convey the mounting insanity of the Splicers. The Big Sister's sound effects were created by layering sounds from birds, hyenas, and Kamper's wife doing impressions of a dolphin. The audio team spent a great deal of time on immersing the player in their role of a Big Daddy through the audio—everything from the sound of the footsteps to the sounds for impacts and water drips on the player's armor was used to sell the player on who their character was. Audio programmer Guy Somberg created a background sound system that allowed the team to layer stereo sounds together depending on the player's location, combined with mono sound effects for certain areas. "This allowed us to quickly iterate on our ambiences and implement them into the levels with ease, and helped create the randomness I was looking for in the background effects," Kamper recalled. Multiplayer sounds were handled by Digital Extremes, who along with Kamper's team had to make sure their sounds cohered not only with each other's work, but with the sounds of the first game.&lt;ref name="designingsound-kemperinterview"/&gt;

[[Garry Schyman]] reprised his role as ''BioShock'''s composer to create the score for ''BioShock 2''. He wrote that "scoring a sequel to a major hit game is always a challenge," and the praise his BioShock score received made things even more difficult. He decided to retain some elements and motifs from the first game—use of the solo violin, and compositional techniques common in the mid-20th century setting—while creating something different.&lt;ref name="bs2ost-liner notes"&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Sounds From The Lighthouse: Official Bioshock 2 Score | |others= |year=2016 |url= |first=Garry |last=Schyman|page=1 |type=album back cover |publisher=2K Games|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "BioShock 2 was easier in the sense that the style had been established and I didn't have to reinvent the wheel," Schyman noted. "So it was just delightful work creating that score. Which in some respects surpasses my original in my opinion."&lt;ref name="schyman-gs_interveiw"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tong, Sophia|date=May 2, 2011|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6310990/index.html|title=Sound Byte: Meet the Composer Behind BioShock - Garry Schyman|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 30, 2018|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505084343/http://www.gamespot.com/features/6310990/index.html|archivedate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the elements the developers tried to improve on from the first game was adding more pieces of music for the combat sequences in each level.&lt;ref name="destructoid-audio_interview"/&gt;

Once the game's tone and style was established, Schyman worked off specific requests from the audio director for individual pieces of music.&lt;ref name="schyman-gs_interveiw"/&gt; Kamper recalled that "[Schyman] really, really did a wonderful job" with molding the music to fit Thomas' and his intended mood and tones. The results, such as the music for the Pauper's Drop level, were different from anything else in the first game.  To test how the music fit for each level, Kamper would send Schyman video footage of the game, which would then be appraised with the new score to see how well it meshed.&lt;ref name="destructoid-audio_interview"&gt;{{cite web|author=North, Dale|date=February 8, 2010|url=https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-the-music-of-bioshock-2-162931.phtml|title=Destructoid interview: The music of BioShock 2|work=[[Destructoid]]|accessdate=August 18, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727025444/http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-the-music-of-bioshock-2-162931.phtml|archivedate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamper split some of Schyman's tracks to use as [[leitmotiv]]s; the opening track of Eleanor and Delta together was divided in later renditions, using the deeper cello for Delta and the violin for Eleanor.&lt;ref name="designingsound-kemperinterview"/&gt; The score was recorded with a 60-piece ensemble of the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at [[Capitol Studios]].&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;{{cite news

In addition to the original music, ''BioShock 2'' makes extensive use of licensed music from the time period. "Similar to the first game, we tried really hard to instill a sense of thematic cogency with our picks that the message that is coming through the licensed tracks," Thomas said, adding that blues and religious music were important to the sequel's themes, and that while the first game had used more commercial pop music, they wanted a broader range. Music from ''BioShock'' was used in the multiplayer portion of ''BioShock 2'' to help connect it back to the time period of the first game.&lt;ref name="destructoid-audio_interview"/&gt;

In addition, ''[[Minerva's Den]]'' was released for free for players who owned ''BioShock 2'' before the patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/microsoft-closing-games-for-windows-live-marketplace |title=Microsoft Closing Games for Windows Live Marketplace |publisher=IGN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827002228/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/microsoft-closing-games-for-windows-live-marketplace |archivedate=August 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/bioshock-2-drops-gfwl-adds-minerva-s-den-on-steam-262928.phtml |title=BioShock 2 drops GFWL, adds Minerva's Den on Steam |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |first=Jordan |last=Devore |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004005251/http://www.destructoid.com/bioshock-2-drops-gfwl-adds-minerva-s-den-on-steam-262928.phtml |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BioShock 2'' received positive reviews. On Review aggregator [[Metacritic]], it has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 across its released platforms.&lt;ref name="MCX360"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS3"/&gt;

[[GamesRadar]]'s Charlie Barratt awarded the game with a perfect score stating that "The weapons are better. The plasmids are better. The enemies are better. At some points, even the storytelling is better. What's most amazing and surprising about ''BioShock 2'', however, is that by diving deeper into Rapture's tortured history and exploring more of Rapture's haunted world, it actually manages to make the original ''BioShock'' better, too."&lt;ref name="GRadar"/&gt;

''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Andrew Reiner scored the game an 8.25. He criticised the game for being too similar to its predecessor, saying that "For roughly 10 hours, ''BioShock 2'' follows directly in its forefather's footsteps, too fearful to inject anything new into this twisted world." However, he praised the game's ending, stating that "Eventually this disappointing adventure does turn a corner. It takes 10 hours to get there, but the final two acts (lasting approximatetely three hours) are brilliant." He concluded with "''BioShock 2'' eventually becomes the sequel I hoped for, but spends too much time getting there."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; In 2013, Liz Lanier of ''[[Game Informer]]'' included Dr. Sofia Lamb among top ten female villains in video games, stating that "an extremist obsessed with the "greater good," Lamb will sacrifice anything and anyone for her own agenda; whether that means brainwashing or murdering to create her utopia, she's down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Top Ten Female Villains | date = November 2013 | work = Game Informer | page=  24 | first = Lix | last = Lanier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] scored the game a 9.1/10 and said that "anyone looking for a first-person shooter that offers more than flat, stereotypical characters and copy-and-paste supersoldier plots, one that attempts to establish a sense of right and wrong and loops you into the decision making process, and one that's set in one of the most vividly realized settings around should pick up ''BioShock 2''. It's a game in which story, setting, and gameplay are expertly blended to create an experience that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have seen it before, and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, the twists and turns seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.&lt;ref name="IGNsecond"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/14240341/bioshock-2/videos/bioshock2_secondopinions_spc.html |title=BioShock 2 – IGN's Second Opinion Video&amp;nbsp;— Xbox 360 |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502060118/http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/14240341/bioshock-2/videos/bioshock2_secondopinions_spc.html |archivedate=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Price of [[TeamXbox]] gave the game an overall score of 9.2/10 saying that "''BioShock 2'' remains one of the most original, exciting, subversive and intriguing shooters out there for you to play, and you shouldn't miss the experience of doing that."&lt;ref name="TX"/&gt;

[[Eurogamer]]'s Tom Bramwell was more critical of ''BioShock 2''. Though he scored the game a very positive 8/10 overall, he noted that "The single-player campaign... will and should be damned for its long, slow start, during which the game struggles to make its intentions clear, but once past that the developers find a new tempo that wrings just enough extra quality out of the existing framework to justify your patience, even if the game still feels flat in the context of more daring and elaborate sequels like ''Mass Effect 2'' and last year's ''Assassin's Creed'' follow-up."&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt;

==Themes==
In contrast to the first ''BioShock''{{'}}s focus on libertarianism and Ayn Rand's philosophies, ''BioShock 2'' focuses on collectivist ideals.

Lamb's philosophy of altruism is based on that of [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. "Her motto is 'Make the world your family' meaning force your mind into becoming loyal to the world in a way usually reserved for your child, and that's intellectually daunting," said Thomas.&lt;ref name="theindependent-jordanthomas_interview"/&gt; In comparison to the first game's questions of free will and destiny, Thomas said that the player character is "almost the ultimate individual" whom Lamb goads to fulfill her goals.&lt;ref name="theindependent-jordanthomas_interview"/&gt;

Professor Ryan Lizardi draws parallels between ''BioShock 2''{{'}}s themes of community versus the individual and the issues of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[hippie]] movement that occurred around the time period of the game's setting. "As this sequel is an extension of the first game's storylines and characters, there are direct contrasts between the extreme politics of Andrew Ryan's objectivism and the extreme religion/politics of Lamb's collectivism," he writes. "''Bioshock 2'' specifically asks players to question all sides of debates when extreme stances are taken, and asks players to weigh their decisions in an alternate and complex history.

'''''Bitter Honey''''' is a 2014 [[documentary film]] directed by anthropologist and filmmaker [[Robert Lemelson]] that chronicles the lives of three polygamous families living in [[Bali|Bali, Indonesia]]. The film follows the wives from their introduction to the polygamous lifestyle to the emotional hardships and jealousies to their struggle for empowerment and equal rights.

==Production==
''Bitter Honey'' was directed by Robert Lemelson, an anthropologist and filmmaker with a doctorate from [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3199649/&lt;/ref&gt; Lemelson had originally been researching the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|1998 mass rapes]] perpetrated during the economic crisis and the fall of the [[Suharto]] regime. Realizing that these acts were only one piece of the larger puzzle of gender inequality in Indonesia, Lemelson shifted his focus to domestic violence and particularly how it coincided with polygamous kinship forms.&lt;ref name="The Blot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theblot.com/bitter-honey-shows-ugly-side-of-bali-where-polygamy-and-domestic-abuse-reign-7726463 | title= ‘Bitter Honey' shows ugly side of Bali, where polygamy and domestic abuse reign | work=[[The Blot]] | date=October 2, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Olds, Dorri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/anthropologist-s-film-exposes-plight-of-polygamy-in-indonesia | title= Anthropologist’s film exposes plight of polygamy in Indonesia | work=[[UCLA Newsroom]] | date=September 25, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Barrosse, Emilia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film’s title refers to a regional play on words, as the local term for co-wife (''madu'') also translates to “honey.”&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/movies/bitter-honey-looks-at-multiple-spouses-in-bali.html?_r=4 | title= The Pain of Polygamy | work=[[New York Times]] | date=October 30, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Webster, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot over a period of seven years.&lt;ref name="LVLD"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.leveledmag.com/2014/10/bitter-honey-documentary-polygamy-violence/ | title= Bitter Honey: A Documentary on Polygamy, Love and Violence | work=[[Leveled Magazine]] |date=October 1, 2014 | accessdate= January 14, 2015 | author=Maleszka, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemelson used this longitudinal approach to gain the trust of his subjects, saying, “We returned over and over so that people could see we weren’t just there to get data and never return.”&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;

The film is presented in thematic chapters, with each new section introduced by a traditional [[Wayang | Wayang Kulit]] shadow-puppet performance about the issues surrounding polygamous unions. The filmmakers commissioned this performance for use in the film.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-bitter-honey-1201321492/ | title=Film Review: ‘Bitter Honey’ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 4, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Harvey, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier cuts of “Bitter Honey”, the film had focused on the husbands in these polygamous arrangements, but Lemelson quickly realized that the more compelling story arose from examining how these marriages are experienced by the co-wives.&lt;ref name="UCLA" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film follows the lives of three polygamous families living in Bali, Indonesia, where [[polygyny|polygynous]] unions make up about 10% of households.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-bitter-honey-movie-review-20141003-story.html | title=‘Bitter Honey’ doesn’t sugarcoat polygamy | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=October 2, 2014 | accessdate=January 14, 2015 | author=Linden, Sheri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the family of Sadra, a fair trade craftsman with two wives and eight children living in separate compounds. Sadra’s main narrative thread concerns generational cycles of violence and his abusive relationship with his first wife and mother, and its effect on his children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8101">'''''Black Orpheus''''' was a [[Nigeria]]-based literary journal founded in 1957 by German expatriate editor and scholar [[Ulli Beier]] that has been described as "a powerful catalyst for artistic awakening throughout West Africa".&lt;ref name=Tuttle&gt;Kate Tuttle, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22a+powerful+catalyst+for+artistic+awakening+throughout+West+Africa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mg5Fr4wl0L&amp;sig=3YHGM5Crhja1JJ1OoeAmLfBI-mM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj984Wq9ejNAhWJIsAKHc34B6EQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20powerful%20catalyst%20for%20artistic%20awakening%20throughout%20West%20Africa%22&amp;f=false "Black Orpheus"], in [[Anthony Appiah]] and [[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Africa, Volume 1'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derived from a 1948 essay by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], "Orphée Noir", published as a preface to ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache'', edited by [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Benson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5gIQK1isP6cC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=black+orpheus+magazine+title+sartre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PPgtk5Wa0H&amp;sig=Jhzn6SKrNxrU9pdtPcUhues6o2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidpI23nenNAhULKMAKHVzxA4gQ6AEITDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20orpheus%20magazine%20title%20sartre&amp;f=false ''Black Orpheus, Transition, and Modern Cultural Awakening in Africa''], University of California Press, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Beier wrote in an editorial statement (''Black Orpheus'' 1) about the fact that "it is still possible for a Nigerian child to leave a secondary school with a thorough knowledge of English literature, but without even having heard of Léopold Sédar Senghor or [[Aimé Césaire]]", so ''Black Orpheus'' became a platform for Francophone as well as Anglophone writers.&lt;ref name=OHGM&gt;Quoted in Mark Wollaeger with Matt Eatough, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BJMBJWSEHyYC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=%22black+orpheus%22+magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hjuqHt-VGp&amp;sig=M2OlpzYILXwOWbjw5E20kJY0hDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCwK7CzbHOAhVqI8AKHSMEAI8Q6AEIjQEwGQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22black%20orpheus%22%20magazine&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Global Modernisms''], Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Beier also founded [[the Mbari Club]], a cultural centre for African writers, which was closely connected with ''Black Orpheus''. The magazine ceased publication in 1975.&lt;ref name=RAS&gt;Dele Meiji Fatunla, [http://whatsonafrica.org/three-african-and-african-diasporan-literary-magazines-that-everyone-should-know/ "Three African and African Diasporan Literary Magazines the Everyone Should Know"], What's On Africa, Royal African Society, 30 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Black Orpheus'' was "a journal of African and Afro-American literature" established in 1957 by university professor Ulli Beier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/black-orpheus/oclc/1536537 "Black Orpheus"] at WorldCat.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in [[Ibadan, Nigeria]], and was groundbreaking as the first African literary periodical in English, publishing poetry, art, fiction, literary criticism and commentary.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/cover-of-black-orpheus-literary-magazine "Cover of Black Orpheus"]. Collection items from ''[[West Africa: Word, Symbol, Song]]'', British Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Its editors included [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Es'kia Mphahlele]] (1960–64).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eskia-Mphahlele#ref1046334 "Es'kia Mphahlele"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characterised by its [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] reach, ''Black Orpheus'' also published in English translation the work of Francophone writers, among them [[Léopold Senghor]], [[Camara Laye]], [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Hampâté Bâ]], as well as playing a significant role in the careers of such notable authors and artists as [[Wole Soyinka]], [[John Pepper Clark]], [[Gabriel Okara]], [[Dennis Brutus]], [[Kofi Awoonor]], [[Andrew Salkey]], [[Léon Damas]], [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], [[Cyprian Ekwensi]], [[Alex La Guma]], [[Bloke Modisane]], [[Birago Diop]], [[D. O. Fagunwa]], [[Wilson Harris]], [[Malangatana Ngwenya|Valente Malangatana]] and [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]].&lt;ref name=Tuttle /&gt;&lt;ref name=BL /&gt; Many of them featured in a 1964 anthology edited by Beier, ''Black Orpheus: An Anthology of New African and Afro-American Stories'', which was published in Lagos, London, Toronto and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ulli Beier (ed.), [https://www.amazon.com/Black-Orpheus-Anthology-African-Afro-American/dp/B000H3GOS2 ''Black Orpheus: An Anthology of New African and Afro-American Stories''], McGraw Hill, 1965 ([https://www.amazon.com/Black-Orpheus-Ulli-Ed-Beier/dp/B0014E8OZ4/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr= Longmans of Nigeria], 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Orpheus'' is considered to have been one of the world's most influential literary magazines during its existence, with [[Abiola Irele]] – the magazine's editor from 1968 – writing in the ''[[Journal of Modern African Studies]]'': "The steady development of ''Black Orpheus'' over the last seven years amounts to a remarkable achievement. It has succeeded in breaking the vicious circle that seems to inhibit the development of a proper reading public by its continued existence, by its very availability; more than that, it has also gone on to establish itself as one of the most important formative influences in modern African literature.…It can be said, without much exaggeration, that the founding of ''Black Orpheus'', if it did not directly inspire new writing in English-speaking Africa, at least coincided with the first promptings of a new, modern, literary expression and re-inforced it by keeping before the potential writer the example of the achievements of the French-speaking and Negro American writers."&lt;ref name=RAS /&gt;

Beier also founded [[the Mbari Club]], in 1961, a cultural hub for African writers that was closely connected with ''Black Orpheus'', and during the 1960s also acted as a publisher — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers.&lt;ref&gt;James Currey, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.44.2.8?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Literary Publishing After Nigerian Independence: Mbari as Celebration"], ''Research in African Literatures'', Vol. 44, No. 2, (In)Visibility in African Cultures / Zoe Norridge, Charlotte Baker, and Elleke Boehmer, Guest Editors (Summer 2013), pp. 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having earned a reputation as "the doyen of African literary magazines",&lt;ref&gt;Wollaeger and Eatough, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BJMBJWSEHyYC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=%22black+orpheus%22+magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hjuqHt-VGp&amp;sig=M2OlpzYILXwOWbjw5E20kJY0hDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCwK7CzbHOAhVqI8AKHSMEAI8Q6AEIjQEwGQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22black%20orpheus%22%20magazine&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Handbook of Global Modernisms''], 2012, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Orpheus'' eventually ceased publication in 1975.&lt;ref name=Tuttle/&gt;

'''''Capricorn One''''' is a 1978 government conspiracy [[thriller film]] about a [[Mars]] landing [[hoax]]. It was written and directed by [[Peter Hyams]] and produced by [[Lew Grade]]'s [[ITC Entertainment]]. It stars [[Elliott Gould]] with [[James Brolin]], [[Sam Waterston]] and [[O. J. Simpson]] as the [[astronaut]]s.

==Plot==
Capricorn One—the first manned mission to [[Mars]]—is on the launch pad. The bewildered crew of Brubaker, Willis, and Walker are removed from Capricorn One and flown to an abandoned desert base. The launch proceeds on schedule, and the public is unaware that the spacecraft is empty. At the base, the astronauts are informed by [[NASA]] official Kelloway that a faulty life-support system would have killed the astronauts during the flight, and they must help counterfeit the television footage during the flight to and from Mars. Initially they refuse, but Kelloway threatens their families if they do not cooperate.

The astronauts remain in captivity during the flight and are filmed landing on Mars within a studio located at the base. The conspiracy is known to only a few officials, until alert technician Elliot Whitter notices that ground control receives the crew's television transmissions before the spacecraft [[telemetry]] arrives. Whitter reports his concerns to his supervisors, including Kelloway, but is told that it is due to a faulty workstation. He disappears before he can finish sharing his concerns with journalist friend Robert Caulfield. Caulfield discovers that all evidence of his friend's life has been erased and he begins investigating the mission, surviving several attempts on his life in the process.

Upon returning to Earth, the empty spacecraft burns up due to a faulty [[heat shield]] during [[atmospheric reentry]]. The astronauts are said to have died due to the malfunction. The captive astronauts board a plane to be placed in the spacecraft, but the plane unexpectedly turns around and returns to the airfield. They realize that something has gone wrong with the re-entry process and that officials can never release them. They break out of confinement and escape in a plane, which runs out of fuel soon after take-off. Forced to crash-land and stranded in the desert, they attempt to return to civilization while being pursued by helicopters. Realizing that the chances of exposing the truth are increased if they split up, they start walking in three directions. Kelloway sends the helicopters after them; Willis and Walker are found, while Brubaker is the only one to avoid capture and hides in a deserted gas station.

Caulfield's investigation leads him to question Brubaker's "widow" after reviewing a conversation between the astronauts and their spouses aired on live television where Brubaker mentioned a previous family vacation that seems to confuse Mrs. Brubaker. She says that the vacation Brubaker mentioned never took place, and that the family had gone to another location where a movie was being filmed, and that Brubaker had told his wife that with enough special effects and movie magic, anything could be made to look real. As he investigates further, he is arrested by federal agents when cocaine is planted in his home, and later fired from his job.

Another reporter tells Caulfield about the military base and he goes there, finding it abandoned. Looking around, he finds a necklace given to Brubaker by his wife and concludes that the astronauts were in the hangar. With the help of crop-dusting pilot Albain, he searches the desert and rescues Brubaker from the men in the helicopters. The helicopters chase their plane through a canyon but are destroyed after being blinded with crop spray.

Ultimately, Caulfield and Brubaker arrive at the astronauts' memorial service, exposing the conspiracy.

==Production==
===Development===
Peter Hyams began thinking about a film of a space hoax while working on broadcasts of the Apollo missions for CBS. He later reflected regarding the Apollo 11 moon landing, “There was one event of really enormous importance that had almost no witnesses. And the only verification we have . . . came from a TV camera.”&lt;ref name=Nicholas-de-Monchaux&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IT-chpAkCZ0C&amp;pg=PA259 Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo], Nicholas de Monchaux, MIT Press, 2011.  This book sites the ''New York Times'' as stating “Watergate may not have inspired ‘Capricorn One,’ but it made its thesis more acceptable, its plot more credible and some of its content strangely prophetic.”&lt;/ref&gt;

He later elaborated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever there was something on the news about a space shuttle, they would cut to a studio in St. Louis where there was a simulation of what was going on. I grew up in the generation where my parents basically believed if it was in the newspaper it was true. That turned out to be bullshit. My generation was brought up to believe television was true, and that was bullshit too. So I was watching these simulations and I wondered what would happen if someone faked a whole story.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/features/peter-hyams-film-by-film/p2 "Peter Hyams Film by Film" ''Empire''] accessed 30 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hyams wrote the script in 1972 but no one wanted to make it. He says interest in the script was re-activated by the [[Watergate Scandal]]. He attached producer Paul Lazarus. Hyams and Lazarus had a meeting with [[Lew Grade]], head of production company [[ITC Entertainment]] who had recently moved into film production with ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]''. Grade agreed to make the film after only five minutes.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; The budget was $4.8 million.&lt;ref name="Szebin"&gt;Szebin, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grade"&gt;Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins &amp; Sons 1987 p 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholas-de-Monchaux/&gt;

Grade announced the film in October 1975 as a part of a slate of ten films he intended to make over the next 12 months including ''The Domino Principle'', Action - Clear the Fast Lanes'' and ''Juarez''.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Lew's massive film deal
Barker, Dennis. The Guardian 22 Oct 1975: 7. &lt;/ref&gt;

To stay within the budget, NASA's co-operation was needed. Lazarus had a good relationship with the space agency from ''[[Futureworld]]''. The filmmakers were thus able to obtain government equipment as props despite the negative portrayal of the space agency, including a prototype [[lunar module]].&lt;ref&gt;The Space Shot as a Sham
Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 13 Oct 1976: f9. &lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1976 it was announced the cast would include [[Elliott Gould]], O.J. Simpson, James Brolin and [[Candice Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pepitone will run disco in Las Vegas
Daly, Maggie. Chicago Tribune 14 Sep 1976: b12. &lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Brolin and Simpson in the cast helped secure a presale to NBC.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;
===Shooting===
Filming started in January 1977. Filming took place at Cinema Center Films in Studio City and in Red Rock Canyon.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;The Film That Watergate Got Off the Ground
Warga, Wayne. Los Angeles Times 30 Jan 1977: s36. &lt;/ref&gt;

Hyams later joked, "[[O. J. Simpson]] was in it, and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] was in (Hyams' first feature) ''[[Busting]]''. I’ve said many times: some people have AFI Lifetime Achievement awards; some people have multiple Oscars; my bit of trivia is that I’ve made films with two leading men who were subsequently tried for the first degree murder of their wives."&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

==Release==
The film was originally scheduled to debut in the United States in February 1978, but good [[preview screening]]s and delays in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' caused it to move to June. ''Capricorn One'' became the year's most-successful [[independent film]].&lt;ref name="Szebin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What If a Mars Landing Were Faked? Asks Peter Hyams: A Fake Landing On Mars?
By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE. New York Times 28 May 1978: D10. &lt;/ref&gt;

Hyams later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Audiences just stood up and cheered at one point in the film. It wasn't because it was such a great movie, it's just that certain movies strike certain chords with people. In a successful movie, the audience, almost before they see it, know they're going to like it. I remember standing in the back of the theater and crying because I knew that something had changed in my life. Sitting on the film cans outside the screening room, I felt my cheeks were wet with tears. A bright man, [studio executive] [[David Picker]] came over to me and said, 'You're going to have a lot of new best friends tomorrow. You better know how to handle it.'&lt;ref name="luke"&gt;[http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/peter_hyams.htm Interview with Peter Hyams by Luke Ford] accessed 27 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
[[AllMovie]] critic Donald Guarisco wrote: "This agreeable high-concept effort is one of Peter Hyams' most accomplished films. The script's conspiracy-theory premise requires a major suspension of disbelief, but Hyams makes it worthwhile for those willing to make that leap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/capricorn-one-v8071/review|title=Capricorn One: Review|last=Guarisco|first=Donald|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "an expensive stylistically bankrupt suspense melodrama" while describing much of its screenplay as "humorless comic-strip stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Film: 'Capricorn One' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 2, 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06EEDD1331E632A25751C0A9609C946990D6CF |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a 61% positive "Fresh" rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Capricorn One (1978) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/capricorn_one/ |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Follett novel is notable for giving Robert Caulfield more development than the movie does, including giving him something of a relationship with CBS reporter Judy Drinkwater (who has more time in the book than in the movie) and ending the book with him and Judy. The story saves his career and results in his being employed by CBS.

Clips from the faked Mars landing scenes have been used for illustration purposes in various moon landing hoax conspiracy documentaries, notably the Fox TV show ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land On The Moon'' and [[Bart Sibrel]]'s film ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon]]'' (2001). The latter also features a still shot from the hoax scene on the DVD's front cover.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">The '''Center for Appropriate Transport''' (CAT) is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Community centre|community center]] dedicated to [[bicycle]]s and [[Sustainable transport|alternative transport]] located in [[Eugene, Oregon]], United States.&lt;ref name=Cargo&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-and-gear-features/reviews/coolest-bike-ever-made |title= Why Cargo Bikes Are Cycling's Coolest Inventions |first=Tom |last= Clynes |date= September 7, 2011 |journal= [[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]] |accessdate= January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAT holds publicly funded educational workshops for teaching youth from ages 12 to 21.  Within the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility there is a public bicycle repair workspace and a bike machine-shop for the design and manufacture of special-purpose bikes, particularly cargo bikes and [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbents]]. There is also a bike museum on site, a bike rack-building workshop, and a sewing facility. CAT formerly held the offices of ''Oregon Cycling'' magazine, which ceased publishing in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bikeportland.org/2009/08/07/oregon-cycling-magazine-shuts-down-new-owners-look-to-bring-it-back-22060 |publisher= Bike Portland |title= Oregon Cycling Magazine Shuts Down; New Owners Look to Bring it Back |first= Jonathan |last= Maus |date= August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAT is also home to Pedaler's Express, a pioneering [[workbike]]-based delivery service.&lt;ref name=Yoshiyuki&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_nrD0LlcIUEC&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;ots=f1FqPfGU5H&amp;dq=%22center+for+appropriate+transport%22&amp;pg=PA78 |last= Nagata |first= Yoshiyuki |title= Center for Appropriate Transport |work=Alternative Education: Global Perspectives Relevant to the Asia-Pacific Region |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer Verlag |page= 78 |isbn= 978-1-4020-4985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CAT was founded in 1992.&lt;ref name=Yoshiyuki/&gt;

To create the center, [[Jan VanderTuin]] gathered the founding core group, which included bicycle retailer and activist Kurt Jensen, writer and racer Jason Moore, Bowerman, and ''Rain Magazine'' editors [[Greg Bryant (computer scientist)|Greg Bryant]] and Danielle Janes. Bryant was instrumental in bringing ''Oregon Cycling'' into CAT, and obtaining non-profit status. CAT opened on November 20, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.rainmagazine.com/archive/1993/cat01292014 |title= CAT |journal= Rain |first= Jason |last= Moore |year= 1993 |accessdate= January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years CAT and ''Rain Magazine'' were no longer partners, and by 1995 the emphasis turned to youth education when CAT began contracting with local school districts to work with youth in need of a hands-on education. CAT is an [[alternative education]] program registered with the [[Oregon Department of Education]] and as such is one of the few publicly funded bicycle schools in the United States.

Whereas the dish is not cooked with heat, it must be prepared and consumed fresh to minimize the risk of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]].&lt;ref name="Benson p. 78"&gt;[[#LP peru|Benson et al.

Though archeological records suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been consumed in Peru nearly two thousand years ago,&lt;ref name="EPI " /&gt; some historians believe the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from [[Granada]], who accompanied the Spanish [[conquistador|conquistadors]] and colonizers, and this dish eventually evolved into what is now considered ceviche.&lt;ref name="Peschiera, p. 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="historiacocina.com"&gt;{{cite web | last =Ariansen Cespedes | first =Jaime | title =La facinante historia del Cebiche | work = Mito, Leyenda y Folklore en la Gastronomia Peruana VI | publisher =Instituto de los Andes | language =Spanish | url =http://www.historiacocina.com/paises/articulos/peru/cebiche.html | accessdate = August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian chef [[Gastón Acurio]] further explains that the dominant position [[Lima]] held through four centuries as the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles.&lt;ref name="Revolución"&gt;[[#Revolución|Revolución de los gustos en el Perú]] pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceviche is now a popular international dish prepared in a variety of ways throughout the Americas, reaching the United States in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p. 3" /&gt; The greatest variety of ceviches are found in Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and [[Perú]]; but other distinctly unique styles can also be found in coastal Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, the United States, Mexico, Panama, and several other nations.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p. 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EPI " /&gt;

== Etymology ==

The origin of the name of the dish is also disputed. One hypothesis suggests the common Spanish word for the dish, ''cebiche'', has its origin in the Latin word ''cibus'',&lt;ref name="Ross, p. 171" /&gt; which translates to English as "food"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Cibus | work =Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher =University of Notre Dame | url =http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookit.pl?latin=cibus | accessdate = August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis, supported by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], is that "ceviche" has the same etymology as "escabeche", which derives from [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ''izkebêch'', in turn descending from [[Andalusian Arabic]] ''assukkabáǧ'', which also derives from [[Classical Arabic]] ''sakbāj'' ({{lang|ar|سكباج}}), meaning meat cooked in vinegar).&lt;ref name="RAE-cebiche4"&gt;{{cite web | title = sebiche | work = Diccionario de la Lengua Española | publisher = Real Academia Española | url = http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=cebiche | accessdate = 2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Wehr, ''Arabic-English Dictionary.'' Otto Harrassowitz KG: 1994. Page 486&lt;/ref&gt; It is ultimately from the unattested [[Middle Persian]] *''sikbāg'', from ''sik'' ("vinegar")&lt;ref&gt;"sik" in [[David Neil MacKenzie]] (1986), ''A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary'', London: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-713559-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and *''bāg'' ("soup"), which also yielded the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''sekbā'' ({{lang|fa|سکبا}}, a soup made with meat and vinegar).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fa|سکبا}} in ''[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Further hypotheses base the origin of the term on ''escabeche'', Spanish for pickle, or it is simply a variation of the word ''siwichi'', the traditional [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] name for the dish.&lt;ref name="Benson p. 78" /&gt;

The name of the dish may be spelled variously as ''cebiche'', ''ceviche'', ''seviche'' or ''sebiche'', but the more common spelling in Peru is ceviche with "v” which is an alternative spelling accepted by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]],&lt;ref name="RAE-cebiche1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RAE-cebiche3" /&gt; the official institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language. Despite this, other local terms, such as ''cerbiche'' and ''serviche'', are still used as variations to name the dish.&lt;ref name="Harrison, p. 85" /&gt;

}}
In regard to its origin, various explanations are given. According to some historic sources from Peru, ceviche would have originated among the [[Moche culture|Moche]], a coastal civilization that began to flourish in the area of current-day northern Peru nearly 2000 years ago.&lt;ref name="EPI " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dicc1"&gt;{{cite book| last = Zapata Acha| first = Sergio| publisher = Universidad San Martín de Porres| title = Diccionario de gastronomía peruana tradicional| edition = 1st|date=November 2006| location = Lima, Perú| isbn = 9972-54-155-X|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moche apparently used the fermented juice from the local [[banana passionfruit]].&lt;ref name="EPI " /&gt; Recent investigations further show, during the [[Inca Empire]], fish were marinated with the use of ''[[chicha]]'', an Andean [[fermented beverage]]. Different chronicles also report, along the Peruvian coast prior to the arrival of Europeans, fish was consumed with salt and ''[[Aji (food)|ají]]''.&lt;ref name="Dicc1" /&gt; Furthermore, this theory proposes the natives simply switched to the citrus fruits brought by the Spanish colonists, but the main concepts of the plate remain essentially the same.&lt;ref name="weblogtheworld"&gt;{{cite web | last =Prieto | first =Mariuxi | title =Ecuadorian Ceviche | work =We Blog the World | publisher = We Blog the World | date =September 15, 2010 | url =http://www.weblogtheworld.com/countries/southern-america/ecuadorian-ceviche/ | accessdate =August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the dish is also attributed to places ranging from Central America to the Polynesian islands in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Ross, p. 171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler, p. 150" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whatscookingamerica.net"&gt;{{cite web | title =History of Ceviche, Seviche, or Cebiche | work =What's Cooking America | publisher =Linda Stradley | year =2004 | url =http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CevicheNotes.htm | accessdate = August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vann, p. 140"&gt;[[#AAtlas|Meyer and Vann, ''The Appetizer Atlas: A World of Small Bites'']], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In Ecuador, it could have also had its origins with its coastal civilizations, as both Peru and Ecuador have shared cultural heritages (such as the Inca empire) and a large variety of fish and shellfish.&lt;ref name=" weblogtheworld " /&gt; Ceviche is not native to Mexico, despite the fact that the dish has been a part of traditional Mexican coastal cuisine for centuries.&lt;ref name="Bayless, p. 11"&gt;[[#bayless one|Bayless, ''Mexico One Plate At A Time'']] p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish, who brought from Europe citrus fruits such as lime,&lt;ref name="Bayless, p. 11" /&gt; could have originated the dish in Spain with roots in [[Moors|Moorish]] cuisine.&lt;ref name="Harrison, p. 85" /&gt;

Nevertheless, most historians agree ceviche originated during [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial times]] in the area of present-day Peru.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p. 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peschiera, p. 35" /&gt; They propose the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from [[Granada]] who accompanied the Spaniards, and this dish eventually evolved into what nowadays is considered ceviche.&lt;ref name="Peschiera, p. 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="historiacocina.com" /&gt; Peruvian chef [[Gastón Acurio]] further explains the dominant position that [[Lima]] held through four centuries as the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles.&lt;ref name="Revolución" /&gt; Other notable chefs who support the Peruvian origin of the plate include Chilean Christopher Carpentier and Spaniard [[Ferran Adrià]], who in an interview stated, "Cebiche was born in Peru, and so the authentic and genuine [cebiche] is Peruvian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Los cocineros peruanos realizan un magnífico trabajo | newspaper = LaRepublica.pe | location =Perú | language =Spanish | publisher = LaRepublica.pe | date = August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year = 2011 |url = http://elcomercio.pe/gastronomia/878146/noticia-chef-chileno-reconocio-que-cebiche-pisco-sour-son-peruanos |title = Chef chileno reconoció que causa, cebiche y pisco sour son peruanos |publisher = elcomercio.pe|accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation and variants ==

Ceviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes being the most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]], appearing to be cooked. (However, acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking.) Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s, usually has a very short marinating period. With the appropriate fish, it can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Peruvian cuisine. What food do they eat in Peru? | publisher= Travel Food Atlas | url = https://travelfoodatlas.com/what-food-do-they-eat-in-peru }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Latin American countries have given ceviche its own touch of individuality by adding their own particular garnishes.

=== South America ===
In Chile, ceviche is often made with fillets of [[halibut]] or [[Patagonian toothfish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gourmetmexicanrecipes.com/MexicanRecipes/ChileanCeviche.htm | title = Chilean Ceviche | accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marinated in lime and grapefruit juices, as well as finely minced garlic and red chili peppers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Chilean Ceviche' | publisher =The Gutsy Gourmet | url =http://www.thegutsygourmet.net/ceviche.html | accessdate = August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often fresh mint and cilantro are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Chilean Ceviche | publisher = www.foodofsouthamerica.com | url = http://www.foodofsouthamerica.com/chilean-ceviche.htm | accessdate = August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ecuador, the shrimp ceviche is sometimes made with [[tomato sauce]] for a tangy taste. The Manabí style, made with lime juice, salt and the juice provided by the cooked shrimp itself is very popular. Occasionally, ceviche is made with various types of local shellfish, such as black [[clam]] (cooked or raw), [[oyster]]s (cooked or raw), [[spondylus]] (raw), [[barnacle]]s (cooked percebes), among others mostly cooked. It is served in a bowl with toasted corn kernels as a side dish (fried green plantain chunks called "patacones", thinly sliced [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] chips called ''[[chifle]]'', and popcorn are also typical ceviche side dishes). In some regions, ceviche is served with rice on the side. Well cooked Sea bass (corvina), octopus, and crab ceviches are also common in Ecuador. In all ceviches, lime juice and salt are ubiquitous ingredients.

In Peru, ceviche has been declared to be part of the country's "national heritage" and has even had a holiday declared in its honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.livinginperu.com/news/12547 |title=Peru this Week |publisher=Livinginperu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[Marination|marinated]] in freshly squeezed [[key lime]] or [[bitter orange]] (''naranja agria'') juice, with sliced onions, [[chili pepper]]s, salt and pepper. [[Cilus gilberti|Corvina]] or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn-on-the-cob, and slices of cooked [[sweet potato]]. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian ''ají limo'', or the Andean chili ''[[rocoto]]'', toasted corn or ''cancha'' and ''yuyo'' ([[Edible seaweed|seaweed]]).  A specialty of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] is ceviche prepared from shark (''tollo'' or ''tojo''). ''Lenguado'' ([[Sole (fish)|sole]]) is often used in [[Lima]]. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese [[sashimi]], consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solari|first=Carola|title=Peruano + japonés|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.paula.cl/reportaje/nikkei-peruano-japones/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhumberto%2Bsato%2Bdario%2Bmatsufuji%26num%3D30%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1C1CHKZ_enUS434US434&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fT5DUcWqK7HK4AOm9oGYBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ7gEwAQ|work=Paula.cl|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Peruvian ''cevicherías'' serve a small glass of the marinade (as an appetizer) along with the fish, which is called ''leche de tigre'' or ''leche de pantera.''

[[File:Alaskan ceviche.jpg|thumb|"Alaskan" Ceviche made with Pacific [[Halibut]], serrano peppers, cilantro and tomato]]
In Mexico and some parts Central America, it is served either in cocktail cups with [[tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]], salted crackers, or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when served in a cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. Although this cocktail is made from the "dry" ceviche recipe, this presentation is rather unusual outside of some specific areas, and in most areas of Mexico the ceviche cocktail is very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hidalgocarrion.com/menu/|title=MENU|work=Restaurante: Hidalgo Carrion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shrimp]], octopus, [[squid (food)|squid]], [[tuna]], and [[mackerel]] are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche. The marinade ingredients include salt, [[lime (fruit)|lime]], onion, [[chili pepper]]s, [[avocado]], and [[cilantro]] (known as [[coriander]] leaves outside of the Americas). Cut [[olive]]s and a bit of tomatoes are often added to the preparation (ketchup is not used because it adds sugar and is not fresh).

In El Salvador and Nicaragua one popular ceviche recipe is ''ceviche de concha negra'' ("black conch ceviche"), known in Mexico as ''pata de mula'' ("mule's foot"). It is dark, nearly black, with a distinct look and flavor. It is prepared with lime juice, onion, [[yerba buena]], salt, pepper, tomato, Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes [[picante]] (any kind of hot sauce or any kind of hot pepper) as desired.

In Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the dish includes marinated fish, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper, finely minced onions, coriander (cilantro) and finely minced peppers. It is usually served in a cocktail glass with a lettuce leaf and soda crackers on the side, as in Mexico. Popular condiments are tomato [[ketchup]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[tabasco sauce]]. The fish is typically tilapia or corvina, although [[mahi-mahi]], [[shark]] and [[marlin]] are also popular.

In Panama, ceviche is prepared with lemon juice, chopped onion, celery, cilantro, assorted peppers, and sea salt.  Ceviche de corvina (white sea bass) is very popular and is served as an appetizer in most local restaurants. It is also commonly prepared with octopus, shrimp, and [[squid (food)|squid]], or served with little pastry shells called "canastitas."

In Cuba, ceviche is often made using mahi-mahi prepared with lime juice, salt, onion, green pepper, [[habanero]], and a touch of [[allspice]]. Squid and [[tuna]] are also popular. In Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, the dish is prepared with coconut milk. In The Bahamas and south Florida, a [[conch]] ceviche known as 'conch salad' is very popular. It is prepared by marinating diced fresh conch in lime with chopped onions, [[celery]], and [[bell pepper]]. Diced [[pequin pepper]] and/or [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet pepper]] is often added for spice. In south Florida, it is common to encounter a variation to which tomato juice has been added.

=== Asia-Pacific ===
In the [[Philippines]], ''[[kinilaw]]'' (or ''kilawin'') which use raw fish are usually referred to in English as "Filipino ceviche". However, this is inaccurate as ''kinilaw'' technically refers to an indigenous cooking process and thus not restricted to fish. Unlike Latin American ceviches, which primarily use citrus juices, ''kilawin'' instead primarily uses [[vinegar]] (usually [[coconut vinegar]]) and other acidic fruit juices.&lt;ref name="pinoywit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoywit.com/kinilaw-history-origin-evolution/#region|title=Kinilaw History, Origin and Evolution – Into the Heart of Freshness|author=Ninah Villa|date=27 June 2015|publisher=Pinoy Wit|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is native to the Philippines, with archeological evidence dating back to the [[10th century AD|10th]] to [[13th century AD]].&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the ''[[Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala]]'' (1613) as ''cqinicqilao'' and ''cquilao''.&lt;ref name="cqilao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eatyourworld.com/destinations/asia/philippines/cebu/what_to_eat/kinilaw|title=Kinilaw|publisher=Eat Your World|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinilawmix.com/history_of_kinilaw.php|title=History of Kinilaw|publisher=KinilawMix.com|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish ''kinilaw'' typically use ''tanigue'' ([[Spanish mackerel]]s), ''malasugi'' ([[marlin]]s or [[swordfish]]), and [[anchovies]].&lt;ref name="cqilao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketmanila.com/archives/kinilaw-na-malasugi-swordfish-seviche|title=Kinilaw na Malasugi / Swordfish Seviche|date=23 April 2006|publisher=Market Manila|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raw fish are cubed and then marinated in vinegar, souring agents (usually [[calamansi]], but can also be other sour fruits), and salt and spices like [[black pepper]], [[ginger]], [[onion]]s, and [[chili pepper]]s (commonly ''[[siling labuyo]]'' or [[bird's eye chili]]). Variants can also use other ingredients, like shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin [[roe]], [[seaweed]], [[shipworms]] (''tamilok''), vegetables, and cooked meat (usually goat meat, pork, beef, or chicken).&lt;ref name="pena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/2016/06/24/1596168/wow-kinilaw|title=Wow!

In the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], ''[[kelaguen]]'', is another ceviche-type dish among the [[Chamorro people]]. It is derived from and closely resembles the Filipino ''kilawin''. It is believed to have originated from Filipino settlers during the [[Manila galleon]] trade in the Spanish period. Like the Filipino ''kilawin'', the Chamorro dish is also not restricted to fish or seafood, and can use cooked meat (commonly chicken or beef), but it is influenced by the Latin American version in that they exclusively use citrus juices.&lt;ref name="kelaguen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleric.blogspot.com/2015/03/kelaguenkilawin.html|title=Kelaguen/Kilawin|author=|date=9 March 2015|publisher=Saint Fidelis Friary |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually served with ''titiya'' (Chamorro [[tortilla]]s) during [[Festival|fiestas]].&lt;ref name="annie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annieschamorrokitchen.com/chicken-kelaguen-flour-titiyas/|title=Chicken Kelaguen &amp; Flour Titiyas|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Annie's Chamorro Kitchen|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwandering.org/2011/destination/guam/exploring-chamorro-cuisine/|title=Exploring Chamorro Cuisine|date=20 June 2011|publisher=Just Wandering|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health risks ==

Ceviche is ideally very healthy. However, bad sanitary conditions during its preparation may lead to illness. Aside from contaminants, raw seafood can also be the vector for various pathogens, viral and bacterial, as well as larger parasitic creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Parasites in Marine Fishes | work =Seafood Network Information Center – Sea Grant Extension Program | publisher =National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | url =http://seafood.ucdavis.edu/pubs/parasite.htm | accessdate =August 28, 2013 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110927063512/http://seafood.ucdavis.edu/Pubs/parasite.htm | archivedate =September 27, 2011 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Doctor's Responses | work =parasites from sushi – abdominal pain &amp; dairrrhea article | publisher =MedicineNet, Inc. | url =http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19929 | accessdate = August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the 2009 Food Code published by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more recent studies, specific microbial hazards in ceviche include ''[[Anisakis simplex]]'', ''[[Diphyllobothrium]]'' spp., ''Pseudoterranova decipiens'' and ''Pseudoterranova cattani'', and ''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/RetailFoodProtection/ManagingFoodSafetyHACCPPrinciples/Regulators/ucm078283.htm FDA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227120632/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/RetailFoodProtection/ManagingFoodSafetyHACCPPrinciples/Regulators/ucm078283.htm |date=February 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EID"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3201/eid2110.141848|pmid=26402377|title=Human Infections with ''Pseudoterranova'' cattani ''Nematodes'', Chile|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=21|issue=10|pages=1874–5|year=2015|last1=Weitzel|first1=Thomas|last2=Sugiyama|first2=Hiromu|last3=Yamasaki|first3=Hiroshi|last4=Ramirez|first4=Cristian|last5=Rosas|first5=Reinaldo|last6=Mercado|first6=Rubén|pmc=4593429}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anisakiasis]] is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes in raw seafood dishes such as ceviche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sakanari | first =J.

==Overview==

=== Origin ===
Coakes and Smith (2007) define '''Communities of Innovation''' ('''CoI''') as a form of [[Communities of Practice]] that are dedicated to the support of [[innovation]]. They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their [[social network]] and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas.&lt;ref name="Coakes and Smith (2007)"/&gt; COI  are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal, not because of orders from their superiors, but because they are convinced of their common cause.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi and Rogo (2009)"/&gt;

=== Development ===

==== Communities of Creation ====
Sawhney and Prandelli (2000) proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation. Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation. This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.&lt;ref name="Sawhney and Prandelli (2000)"/&gt;

== Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice ==
These are Communities that take total financial, administrative and operational control over the development of their communities. Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community. It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have  existed for centuries. The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available. It provides employment, improves the future prospects for all participants and their children, and injects a sense of pride and achievement. Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing, schools and roads.

== Examples of Communities of Innovation ==

=== The COI that developed Linux ===
Traditionally, the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms’ boundaries.&lt;ref name="Lee and Cole (2003)"&gt;Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how “thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]],” the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is value system, recognition and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, “the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,” even across firms’ boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.

== Benefits of Community of Innovation ==

=== Organizational Ambidexterity ===

Successful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They therefore have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization’s dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.&lt;ref name="Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw (2008)"&gt;Raisch, S. and J. Birkinshaw. 2008. Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. Journal of Management 34 (3) 375-409&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' is the fruit of the Coptic emigrant community in the West and the crown of the work of [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]], who did not live to see his work carried into print.&lt;ref name=hulsman1992/&gt;

Atiya developed the vision to publish an encyclopedia during the years he taught at the [[Middle East Center]] of the [[University of Utah]]. He formed an editorial committee and scholars from all over the world were asked to contribute. Suggestions for entries were given. The work started in 1980.&lt;ref name=hulsman1992/&gt; Contributors included many non-Orthodox scholars, including such Muslims as  [[Mustafa el-Fiqi]] and [[Ali el-Hillal Dessouki]].

The Coptic community in the West played a role in increasing Western interest in Egyptian church life. If the interest in a ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' in English had not existed and if the project of the ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' had not received support in the Coptic migrant community in North America, the idea of producing an English ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' would have never materialized. The production of this ''Encyclopedia'' is therefore strongly linked to the growth of the Coptic migrant community in the West.&lt;ref name=hulsman1992/&gt;

Coptic Orthodox Church leader Pope Shenouda III himself contributed to the entry about emigration. In no period of Coptic history have as many Copts migrated to the west as during the Papacy of Pope Shenouda.&lt;ref name=hulsman1992/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Claremont Graduate University]] (CGU) School of Religion acquired the right to develop an updated and continuously expanding and evolving web-based version of the ''Coptic Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia|url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cce|website=Claremont Colleges Digital Library|publisher=[[Claremont Colleges]]|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disaster area''' is a region or a locale, heavily damaged by either natural, technological or social hazards. Disaster areas affect the population living in the community by dramatic increase in expense, loss of energy, food and services; and finally increase the risk of disease for citizens. An area that has been struck with a natural, technological or sociological hazard that opens the affected area for national or international aid.

==Natural hazard==
A natural hazard is a negative process of phenomena created naturally (tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes) that will affect people or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/GeographyVocabularyGCSEFarming.htm |title=Geography vocabulary: Gcse farming|year=February 2012|website=www.geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornadoes===
'''[[Tornado]]es''' are narrow aggressively rotating mixtures of air that come from the base of a thunderstorm, being the most violent of storms. Tornadoes are usually hard to see unless they form a condensations funnel made from:- dust, water droplets and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSL: Severe Weather 101: Tornadoes. NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes take place in several parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Africa but mostly occur in the United States, Argentina, and Bangladesh.

===Hurricanes===
[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumbnail| New York City after the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]]]]

'''[[Hurricane]]s''', [[cyclones]], [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] can be referred to as the same. They combine low pressure and strong winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones have a low pressure center, rain and strong winds. They usually initiate over tropical or subtropical waters. Hurricanes can be predicted several days before they hit and can be very destructive and destroy homes and some other buildings. Cyclones, although they are the same type of storm, are harder to predict before a few days like hurricanes thus giving people only a few hours of notice to evacuate their homes. In this case there are far more deaths from flooding and high tides. A recent (2012) example of a hurricane is [[Hurricane Sandy]], which was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States, leaving millions without power and a few homeless.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 30, 2012|title= Sandy death toll rises, millions without power in u.s|via= CBC News|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/10/30/us-hurricane-sandy-superstorm-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
'''Floods''' take place when water overflows or submerges land that is usually parched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floods |work=[[IFRC]] |date=November 5, 2012|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/floods/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. A floodplain is produced when water from a rivers spreads through the land from excessive rain, rapid ice melting, unfortunately placed beaver dam, and ruptured dam. There are two types of floods: general and flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Information, Flooding Facts, Flash Floods, Photos -- National Geographic. Environment Facts, Environment Science, Global Warming, Natural Disasters, Ecosystems, Green Living |website= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date= November 5, 2012|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/floods-profile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; General floods are predicted well in advance and usually cause the destruction of housing, people and crops. Flash floods come without warning and are sudden and extreme: A large volume of water flows rapidly and people have to make quick movements if they do not want to be caught in the flood. They have to find high safe ground where the water will not reach them.

===Earthquakes===
When two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past each other in the fault of the earth, it is called an earthquake. Energy released in many forms moves in all directions and causes the ground to shake.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title= Seismic Sources – Earthquakes, Nuclear Blasts, Mining Events|work= Canada's Natural Resources|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/info-gen/faq-eng.php#where}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes earthquakes may have foreshocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region which is followed by a larger earthquake. The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the Earth. 90% of the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.

==Technological hazards==
===Technical hazards===

[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Fukushima I [[Nuclear Power Plant]] after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Reactor 1 to 4 from left to right.]]
There are several technical hazards one should be aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are measured in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. Technical hazards are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these technical hazards.

===Nuclear and radiation (accidents/incidents)===
There are several thoughts that come to mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”,&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}	&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials."&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt; To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt;

===Nuclear accident===
'''Nuclear accidents''' are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. There are several examples of these nuclear accidents taken place around the world. To start off, a prime example of a [[nuclear accident]] would be [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|Palo mares B-52 Accident]]. On January 17, 1966, a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52]] [[bomber]] collided with a mid-tanker airplane that was being refueled at 31000 feet. When the two airplanes collided, the tanker airplane exploded completely killing all crew members, while the B-52 bomber split in half killing a small proportion of the crew. When the airplane split in half, four bombs dropped from the sky. Two of them detonated, causing 2 kilometers of land to be contaminated by radioactive plutonium. The fourth explosive was recovered when it was discovered that it landed on the sea. The soil on the contaminated area had to be removed and placed in barrels, to reduce the amount of pollution having been caused by the nuclear explosive.

===Nuclear incident===
'''Nuclear incidents''' are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url= http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set off 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated, the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from [[radioactive contamination]] that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present at the site of the explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.

==Sociological hazards==
Sociological hazards that create a disaster area are [[riots]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].

===Riot===
A riot is defined as a noisy, violent public disturbance caused by  a group or a crowd (three or more people) usually protesting against another group or government policy in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riot -  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK London riot in August 2011, for example, was started due to the shooting of [[Mark Duggan]] by the London police.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuchs|first= C. |year=2012|title= Behind the News: Social Media, Riots and Revolution. Capital and Class, 36(3), 383-391|accessdate=November 1, 2012 |url=http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/383.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters came together destroying neighborhoods and streets violently damaging property to protest the police's actions that happened a few days prior.&lt;ref name="Fuchs" /&gt; Riots increase expenses to repair costly damages putting the city in distress.

===Terrorism===
[[File:North face south tower after plane strike 9-11.jpg|thumb|[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] burning down during the [[9/11 attacks]].]]

Terrorism is defined as acts of violence and threats by a group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism|title=terrorism|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism occurs with an unexpected attack on [[non-combatants]] to create fear and panic having a detrimental consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism. The American Heritage: New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition|date= November 5, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist attacks]] create a massive, costly impact on the society. Not only is there large amount of property damage that may not be able to be repaired, there is also a large impact on citizens. People lose loved ones and suffer from their own health being impacted. The [[9/11|9/11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in [[New York City]] marks one of the largest attacks on the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1= H.|last2= Keenan|first2= K. |year=2012|title= The Impact of 9/11 on the Geography of Financial Services in New York. The Professional Geographer, 64(3), 370-388|accessdate=November 4, 2012|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twin Towers were completely destroyed, damaging the surrounding buildings as well as causing the loss of many lives. People suffered from health problems from inhaling the sediments from the crumbling towers. The financial and social impact is still present thirteen years later in today's society.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; It is concluded that New York City still suffers from a post-disaster decline in financial services.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; New York City is a Disaster area due to the sociological hazard of terrorism.

===War===
War defined as a period where conflict is carried out as an act of hostility by [[armed forces]] between two or more nations or [[Civil war|within a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/war war]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, for example would be a sociological hazard causing disaster areas because it is considered a war zone. There has been an ongoing battle between United States and the Taliban in Afghanistan resulting in a war zone.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first= M. |year=2011|title=They were Hunting and Killing Us: Abc News' Mike Boettcher Caught in Taliban Firefight with U.S. Troops in Afghanistan|work= ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-mike-boettcher-caught-taliban-firefight-us/story?id=13702376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant bombing and shooting marks up Afghanistan destructing property, land and causing threats to the civilians living in the area.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Thousands have died and international aid for the cost of the war is implemented through tax payers.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; There is lack of resources due to the war area cutting off access to areas because of violence and danger.

==Examples of modern disaster areas==
An example of a '''technological disaster''' was the Fukushima disaster which was caused by a “massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake [that] hit northeast Japan”.&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst Nuclear Accidents / Disasters in History|year=2011| accessdate=November 5, 2012|url= http://www.smashinglists.com/worst-nuclear-accidents-disasters-in-history/|website=www.smashinglists.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earthquake caused a [[nuclear explosion]] at a power plant; five reactors were damaged, causing the plant to go into an emergency state. All this occurred because there was a technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power, causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health, as the area suffered nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt; and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone. Luckily, the “Japanese government [handled] the situation in the most efficient and amazing way that anyone can imagine.”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt;

A recent example of a disaster area caused by a '''natural hazard''' is [[Hurricane Sandy]] which hit October 27, 2012. It was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States. The storm killed about 50 people and many were also hit by falling trees. The hardest-hit state was New York, leaving millions without power and a few homeless. 

A disaster area caused by a '''sociological hazard''' would be the terrorist attack on [[September 11th, 2001]], in New York City. Two airplanes struck the Twin Towers, causing them to crumble, killing many people in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masud|first= E. |year=2006|title= What Really Happened on September 11 Remains a Mystery |work=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate= November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y2002/0427-Mystery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected attack harmed many people and had a detrimental impact on New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

There are many methods for teaching [[Drama]].  Each strategy involves varying levels of student participation.

==Drama games==
Drama games, activities and exercises are often used to introduce students to drama.  These activities tend to be less intrusive and are highly participatory (e.g. [[Bang (Drama Game)|Bang]]).

There are several books that have been written on using drama games that can serve as excellent resources for anyone wanting to incorporate drama games into their work. [[Augusto Boal|Games for Actors and Non-Actors]] by [[Augusto Boal]] is perhaps the best known internationally and includes writings on his life work as well as hundreds of games. There are also smaller books however, which serve as excellent practical guides. For example, Drama Games by [[Bernie Warren]] is an excellent pocket book for someone looking to try drama games for the first time.

==Choral speaking==
Choral dramatization involves students reading aloud by assigning parts to each group member.  Choral dramatization can use texts such as [[rhymes]], [[poetry]], and [[picture books]].  Students can experiment with voice, sound gesture and movement (Swartz, 1995).

==Tableaux==
[[Tableau vivant|Tableaux]] involve students creating visual pictures with their bodies, emphasizing key details and relationships (Wilheim, 2002). Tableaux are frozen scenes and usually involve at least three levels.  Students focus on a focal point, facial expressions, and body language.  This technique is useful for maturing participants' presentational skills as well as audience skills.

==Improvisation==
[[Improvisation]] is the practice of acting and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one’s immediate environment; see [[Improvisation|Wikipedia: Improvisation]]. Improvisation can be a great introduction to role playing.  Students focus on position, expression and creativity in their impromptu skits.

==Role playing==
Role playing allows students to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a real or imaginary situation.  One of the simplest forms is where “the student plays himself faced with an imaginary situation.” (Wilheim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;62) Other strategies have students playing real-life or imaginary characters in a variety of contexts.  Role play can be used throughout many areas of the curriculum, especially [[history]] and [[language arts]] to support and strengthen understanding of content.  Below is a list of some common role-play strategies.

* [[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]]: Students perform scenes from a historical time period or a scene in a story.  “An enactment may be cast in the past, the present, or the future, but always happens in the ‘now of time’” (Wilheim, 2002, p.8).  This strategy encourages students to interact with a text and challenges them to take on the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of a character.
* Extended role play: Students may create the scene that takes place before or after a story or scene.  This strategy helps students to predict and theorize about cause and effect.
* Hotseat: Student is interviewed in character.  By putting the character from a scene, event or story on the “stand” students can further explore their understanding of the content.  Other students in the class prepare questions that explore the character and their conflicts.  Students are encouraged to write open-ended questions.  Teachers may wish to model hotseating first by acting as the character in the role.  Also, the person in the hotseat may have a couple of students who act as their “brain.”  They are there to help answer questions if the person on the hotseat needs them.  There are many variations available for this strategy.
* Teacher In Role: This strategy is key to involving teacher participation.  This strategy can take on many forms.  The teacher may take on the role of a character or figure from the event, scene or story.  The primary objective of this strategy is to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues.  The teacher may also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters.  The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama.
* Expert panel: Students themselves become an [[expert]].  In order to prepare for this role students must determine what an expert in the area might know.  This works well in history or when focusing on broader issues/topics in literature.  This strategy can unfold by having students meet as a group of experts or by having students meet in pairs in an [[interview]] situation.
* Writing in role: A variation on the above strategies, students may also write in character.  Often they are asked to imagine themselves as a real or fictitious character in a particular state or situation.  Writing in role can take on many forms including a journal, letter, monologue, or newspaper article.  This is not meant to be a summary of the story, but instead a further exploration of the character and their interaction with events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">'''Eva Unander,''' née Hjelmér (12 March 1774 - 1836) was a Swedish librarian. She was the second woman in Sweden to run a library, preceded by [[Cecilia Cleve]], and the first to found and run a commercial lending library.  

Born in [[Arboga]], she was the daughter of tailor Johan Hjelmér and his wife Brita. Her father died in 1777 at the age of 44, and her mother died six years later at age 43. Little is known about her childhood. In 1801, she married the bookbinder Abraham Fredric Unander in Stockholm. They had one son, Conrad Fredric. Abraham died in 1816, leaving Eva as a widow and single mother, with debts twice as much as the value of her estate. In 1818, she opened a lending library in Södermalmstorg. Initially, she ran advertisements in the daily newspaper Daglig Allehanda to attract patrons. She eventually stopped these advertisements, possibly because the library had become well-established. 

The patron could set the amount of time for the loan. The cost varied based on the number of books and the amount of time that they were borrowed, starting with four skillings to borrow a book for a day. Other books were also accepted as a form of collateral. The [[National Library of Sweden]] retains nine printed directories from Unander's library; a tenth directory may have existed and been lost. Eva Greek and Heléne Rova analyzed the languages and subject areas available in Unander's library catalogue, in order to analyze the reading tastes of the contemporary public. The library contained mostly fictional works, with many translated from other languages such as German.

The '''flag of [[Bermuda]]''' was adopted on 4 October 1910.  It is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Red Ensign]] with the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] in the upper left corner, and the [[coat of arms of Bermuda]] in the lower right. In 1999, the flag was changed to its current form, with an enlarged coat of arms.

==Description==
The flag is unusual for a [[British overseas territory]] in that it is used on land in a red ensign form; most other British overseas territories use a version of the [[blue ensign]] for general use ashore. Bermuda's use of a red ensign on land is in keeping with [[Canada]] (pre-1965) and the [[Union of South Africa]] (pre 1928), both of which used red ensigns ashore as local flags in the early part of the 20th century.  Bermuda's flag is an appropriate civil ensign for vessels registered on the Bermuda portion of the British Register, by virtue of the Bermuda Merchant Shipping Act of 2002.  The [[Governor of Bermuda]] uses a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms, a design traditional for Governors of the [[British overseas territories]]. For the [[state ensign]], a blue ensign is used.

==Coat of arms==
The [[Latin]] inscription on the coat of arms reads ''Quo Fata Farunt'' ("Wither the Fates Carry"). The coat of arms shows a lion holding a shield which bears a picture of a shipwreck on a rock.

'''Forum of Nerva''' ({{lang-it|Foro di Nerva}}; {{lang-la|Forum Nervae}}) is an ancient structure in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], chronologically the next to the last of the [[Imperial fora]] built.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning | edition=First | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | isbn=0-06-430158-3 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Forum of Nerva (Forum Transitorium) ==

	The imperial fora within the city of Rome have, in recent decades, become again a focus of attention for archaeologists within the city. The east section of the Forum Transitorium was uncovered during large-scale excavations undertaken by the Fascist regime during the construction of the road which was originally called the ''Via dell’Impero'', now called the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]] &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. Rodolfo Lanciani was the first to gather historical sources regarding the Forum Transitorium in 1883. Initial excavations in 1913, 1926-28 and 1932-1941 helped to measure extant columns as well as uncovered the foundations of the Temple of Minerva and the perimeter wall &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. This temple also gave the forum another name which is used by Martial: the Forum Palladium. This derives from an epithet of the Greek Minerva, Pallas Athena. Although there was relatively little known regarding the forum outside of literary texts before the 20th century, new excavations and insights are leading historians and archaeologists to new and exciting theories about what this forum was used for and its importance as a thoroughfare through an increasingly important part of the Roman urban landscape. 

==History==
[[File:Colonnacce del Foro di Nerva.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Colonnacce'', Forum of Nerva]]
The Forum of Nerva was the fourth and smallest of the imperial fora. Its construction was started by Emperor [[Domitian]] before the year 85 AD, but officially completed and opened by his successor, [[Nerva]], in 97 AD, hence its official name.. This street had long served as a market area, especially for booksellers and cobblers; the new forum continued to serve as both a thoroughfare and as a monumental entrance to the larger Roman Fora.

The plan of the Forum of Nerva is long and narrow, with protruding columns decorating the walls instead of arcades. A [[Temple of Minerva (Forum of Nerva)|temple dedicated to Minerva]] dominated the western end, behind which was a monumental entrance.

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the area reverted to [[marshland]]. In the 9th century, a number of houses were built on the site, with materials salvaged from the ruins. The temple of Minerva remained relatively intact until its demolition by [[Pope Paul V]] in 1606 to provide materials for the [[Acqua Paola]] fountain in the [[Janiculum]], and the [[House of Borghese|Borghese]] chapel in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]].

The eastern end of the complex was excavated from 1926-1940, with portions of the excavations subsequently destroyed by the creation of the [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]. Further archaeological work was undertaken in the late 1990s.

===Domitianic Period===

[[File:Foros imperiales-colores.png|thumb|Layout of Imperial Fora.]] 

The Forum Transitorium was originally a Domitianic reorganization and monumentalization of the ''Argiletum'', an ancient road connecting the ''Forum Romanum'' to the ''Subura'' district &lt;ref&gt;(Wightman, Greg. “The Imperial Fora of Rome: Some Design Considerations.” In Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. Vol. 56. No. 1. (1997): 64-88)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. The name ''Forum Transitorium'' took hold mostly due to the enclosure including a part of this ancient route &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. This road ran a good distance throughout Rome, connecting the Tiber to the Esquiline. There is a good chance that the plan of its construction was created by Rabirius, the same architect who designed the Domus Augustana of Domitian . This is evidenced by the use of certain decorative details within the forum which include "spectacles" which were inserted between dentils in the "Colonnacce" &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. The forum is long and thin (around 160 by 46m) and conforms to the basic layout of the fora before it, with a temple dominating one end and high walls surrounding an open courtyard with a colonnade which supplied shelter and passageways &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. It had not yet dedicated in AD 96 when [[Domitian]] was assassinated, however it was likely close to being completed &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. It was dedicated by [[Nerva]] the year after the death of his predecessor in AD 97 and renamed ''Forum Nervae'' &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, the forum Transitorium was the only large-scale construction initiated by Domitian which was finished during the short fifteen-month reign of Nerva &lt;ref&gt;(Grainger, John D. Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96-99. New York: Routledge, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;. 


==Structure==
The layout of the Forum of Nerva was dictated by the existing space between pre-existing structures. The available space was long and narrow (131 x 45 meters), and had outer walls made from blocks of lava stone [[peperino]], covered with marble slabs, and decorated with projecting paired columns. The frieze in the entablature depicted the myth of [[Arachne]] and other reliefs depicting representations of the personifications of Roman provinces.

Access to the forum was from the sides, with three openings on the Roman Forum side and a monumental entrance on the opposing side with an [[exedra]] porticata in the shape of a horseshoe. This entrance was called ''Porticus Absidata''.

The northern and southern ends of the forum were shaped as crescents, with a temple to Minerva (the patron deity of Domitian) at the western end, embedded into the northern crescent adjacent to the Porticus Absidata. The temple was built on a high podium, and had six [[Corinthian column]]s in front and three on the side. The back of the temple was hidden from the Forum by a wall. 
Near the opposite end, there may have been a temple dedicated to [[Janus]]. The underground [[Cloaca Maxima]] ran the length of the forum.

== Archaeology ==

Although the archaeological evidence of the Forum Transitorium is not extensive by any means, the evidence we do have when included with the Forma Urbis Romae (the Marble Plan) and the series of renaissance drawings which used the forum as its subject allow for a fairly accurate reproduction &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984 )&lt;/ref&gt;. The archaeological evidence includes the core of the podium of the [[Temple of Minerva]] as well as some of the temple’s pavement and orthostats, foundations of the ''Porticus Absidata'', as well as the “[[Colonnacce]]” &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of the evidence lies at the north end of the enclosure, with the remaining southern reaches lying underneath the paved surface of the Via dei Fori Imperiali &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

	On the south side of the enclosure wall of the forum is the only surviving evidence of the ''columns en ressaut'', known as the [[Colonnacce]], which surrounded the interior of the space &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. These columns were a substitution for the normal colonnades which adorned the previous Imperial Fora. The reason for this substitution was purely practical due to the very limited amount of space between the [[Forum of Augustus]] and the [[Templum Pacis]] (Temple of Peace) &lt;ref&gt;(Wightman, Greg. “The Imperial Fora of Rome: Some Design Considerations.” In Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. Vol. 56. No. 1. (1997): 64-88)&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, the constraint of space and the adjacent fora walls not being parallel meant that the forum’s width changes depending on where it is measured (from around 135 to 160 feet) &lt;ref&gt;(Wightman, Greg. “The Imperial Fora of Rome: Some Design Considerations.” In Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. Vol. 56. No. 1. (1997): 64-88)&lt;/ref&gt;. Placing the columns at around 1.75 metres from the enclosure walls served to increase the space within the forum. With fluted pavonazzetto shafts, these columns support a richly decorated entablature with a figured frieze. Of the several preserved scenes, the best known depicts the myth of Arachne. The attic also had figures, but only a central panel with a representation of Minerva has survived in situ &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. The columns allowed the frieze to be broken away from the entablature and out over top of the columns and back again, an arrangement that likely ran down both long sides of the forum &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. This may have been responding to an original monumental colonnade placed along the Argiletum by Vespasian &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ancient evidence also suggests that Domitian may have wanted to perpetuate the memory of the Argiletum by placing the shrine of ''Janus Quadrifons'' into the Forum Transitorium &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. There is no archaeological evidence for the shrine's existence. However, Martial and Statius indicate that Janus was incorporated into the plan of the new forum, the god having heralded the "Golden Age" of Domitian &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Temple of Minerva ==

	[[Minerva]] was the patron deity of Domitian, who initiated the construction of the Forum Transitorium. The rise of Minerva during this period has been attributed to the origin of her cult being in the Sabine region, which was considered the ancestral home of the Flavians &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the research completed by H. Bauer, the travertine and peperino foundations represent two different stages of construction &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. The earlier temple was narrower, although it went further into the open space of the forum than did the later shrine &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. The earlier temple displayed equality within its intercolumnations, while the later temple varied the distances between columns depending on where they were &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. While the porch of the Minerva temple projected into the open space of the forum, the cella was narrowed on the northwest end in order to accommodate one of the hemicycles which protruded outwards from the Forum of Augustus &lt;ref&gt;(Wightman, Greg. “The Imperial Fora of Rome: Some Design Considerations.” In Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. Vol. 56. No. 1. (1997): 64-88)&lt;/ref&gt;.

The temple was a frontal Italic temple with marble facing which was set on a high podium which stood over the large forecourt which made up the open space of the Forum Transitorium &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. As with some other temples of the time, the cella ended in an apse which contained the cult statue. This apse is detailed in the Forma Urbis Romae &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. The façade was hexastyle (six columns on the front) with the pronaos (front room) containing two or three columns and ''antae'' on each end (architecturally representing wooden supports, holding up the roof of ancient wood-built temples). These columns were Corinthian in order and made from Phrygian marble &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. However, due to its extremely poor state of preservation, the front of the temple cannot be accurately measured &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Le Colonnacce == 

Le Colonnacce is the only surviving portion of the columns ''en ressaut'' which ran down the lengths of the Forum Transitorium and stands along the flank of the Temple of Minerva &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. The wall is built with blocks of peperino which would have originally been faced with marble. The Corinthian columns stand only 1.75 m from the wall &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. The columns support an entablature that was richly decorated with a figured frieze, 21 m of which are ''in situ'' out of an original 160 m on each long flank, depicting scenes from myth, the best known being that of Arachne &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Above the cornice originally ran a continuous attic which displayed figures carved in high relief, of which one survives depicting Minerva &lt;ref&gt;(Packer, James E. “Report From Rome: The Imperial Fora, a Retrospective.” In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 101. No. 2. (1997): 307-330&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Anderson (1984), this type of architectural decoration appears to be a Domitianic innovation which had been adapted from triumphal arches, seen when compared to the Arch of Augustus at Susa along with the Arch of Trajan at Benevento &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the use of columns in this way was Hellenistic in origin and seemingly arrived in Italy in a courtyard Façade at Praeneste and at the Porta Marzia at Perugia &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;.


=== Arachne ===

[[File:Forum of Nerva (II) (7556333616).jpg|thumb|Arachne myth from the ''Colonnacce''. In the middle Arachne can be seen being cowering as Minerva smites her. ]]

The Arachne myth describes a young woman who had great skill on the loom, so great in fact that she thought she could challenge Minerva. The goddess, disguising herself as an old woman, warns Arachne not to enter the contest but she is ignored. When the contest is complete, Minerva is enraged at Arachne's cloth's excellent quality and design of sexual acts of the gods, so she destroys it. After stopping Arachne from committing suicide, she doles out a suitable punishment, turning the young girl into a spider, doomed to spin webs in dark places &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the only depiction of this myth in the state sponsored art of ancient Rome &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. The rest of the frieze depicts women weaving and spinning under the tutelage of Minerva, the opposite to the defant Arachne &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;. Blanckenhagen offers one of the more detailed analyses of the frieze, viewing it as "depicting the local craftsmen's celebration of Minerva's festival, the Quinquatrus" &lt;ref&gt;(D’Ambra, Eve. Private Lives, Imperial Virtues: The Frieze of the Forum Transitorium in Rome. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;.


== Later history == 

What is known of the later history of the Forum Transitorium is only fragmentary. The first changes made to the forum appear to have been made by Alexander Severus (reigned 222-235 AD) who set up a gallery of statues of deified emperors &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. Contracts for the removal of stone for construction throughout the city of Rome appear in 1425, 1504, 1522, and 1527, with an attempt to preserve a small section of the forum rejected within the Roman courts in 1520 &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora. Brussels: Latomus, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;. A church, perhaps that of S. Maria in Macello, appearing within a contract of 1517, tells us of its location within the forum and statuary which was removed from the space between 1550 and 1555 on the orders of Pope Julius III &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, James C., Jr. The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora.

A '''halting site''' (or '''caravan site''') is a facility constructed for the accommodation of [[Irish Travellers]] and other nomadic groups. They are common in [[Ireland]], mainly on the periphery of towns, where they are maintained by [[local authorities]], and include spaces to park [[travel trailer|caravan]]s and vehicles, electricity and sanitary services, and space to graze horses. Halting sites are often controversial due to opposition from local residents and a belief that such settlements harbour anti-social activity such as inter-[[clan]] violence, [[illegal dumping]] and other crime.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Health communication''' is the study and practice of communicating [[Health promotion|promotional health information]], such as in [[public health]] campaigns, [[health education]], and between doctor and patient.&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Communication? |url=http://www.natcom.org/Tertiary.aspx?id=236&amp;terms=health%20communication |publisher=[[National Communication Association]] |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of disseminating health information is to influence personal health choices by improving [[health literacy]].

Because effective health communication must be tailored for the audience and the situation,&lt;ref name=EHS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beato |first=Ricardo R. |author2=Jana Telfer |title=Communication as an Essential Component of Environmental Health Science |journal=Journal of Environmental Health |date=July–August 2010 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/JEH/2010/July-Aug_Beato_Telfer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into health communication seeks to refine communication strategies to inform people about ways to enhance health or to avoid specific health risks.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Health Communication Basics|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/healthbasics/whatishc.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, health communication is a discipline within [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"/&gt;

Health communication may variously seek to:
* increase audience knowledge and awareness of a health issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyn|first1=Richard|title=Communicating health and illness|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=0761964754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* influence behaviors and attitudes towards a health issue
* demonstrate healthy practices
* demonstrate the benefits of behavior changes to [[public health]] outcomes
* advocate a position on a health issue or policy
* increase demand or support for health services
* argue against misconceptions about health&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freimuth|first=Vicki S.|author2=Sandra Crouse Quinn|title=The Contributions of Health Communication to Eliminating Health Disparities|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2004|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2053–2055|doi=10.2105/ajph.94.12.2053|pmc=1448587}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The term was generated when members of an ICA, [[International Communication Association]], interest group adopted the term. Interdisciplinary marriage between health and communication was certainly a common-law relationship long before the term "health communication" was introduced. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)
The research of health communication surrounds the development of effective messages about health, the dissemination of health-related information through broadcast, print, and electronic media, and the role of inter personal relationships in health communities. At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)

==Research==
There are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 495) Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes. According to Stacks and Salween on page 496 some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.
Over the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 497)
Impact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.

When assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Stacks &amp; Salween page 498)

The efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.

==Training==
Health communication professionals are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N. Hyde|title=An Alumni-Based Evaluation of Graduate Training in Health Communication: Results of a Survey on Careers, Salaries, Competencies, and Emerging Trends|journal=Journal of Health Communication|date=November 2004|pages=5–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for Health Communication maintains a list of such programs.&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Programs in Health Communication|url=http://www.healthcommunication.net/CHC/gradprograms/grad%20programs.htm|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and practitioners in health communication are often trained in disciplines such as [[communication studies]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], or [[medicine]] and then focus within their field on either health or communication. Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt; Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.

==Overview==
[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

Careers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

Clear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=HTB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul–Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.

The social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor’s offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

=== Critical Health Communication ===
Critical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates "how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines links with culture, resources, and other social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from mainstream Health Communication in its emphasis on qualitative and interpretive methods, and its attention to the ideological processes that underpin shared understandings of health. Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89–135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.

==Strategies and methods==
Tailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N. Benac |author3=Melissa S. Harris|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=4|pages=673–693|pmid=17592961|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.4.673|title=Does tailoring matter? Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.

Communication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient’s communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.

Communicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Campaigns===
Health Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).&lt;ref name="HTB"/&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;
* By catering to the common denominator within the audience
* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message
* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments
Both the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;
* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem
* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome
* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers
* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences
* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message
* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message
* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made

====Historical campaigns====

=====American smallpox epidemic=====
In 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardiovascular disease=====
Three-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three "communities" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].

===Communication channels===

====Entertainment media====
Using the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive "tip sheets" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]]&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757913915619120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/1/169/3089818&lt;/ref&gt;.

Writers and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.

====Direct marketing====
{{Main|Social marketing}}
[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]
Media advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.

====Interpersonal communication====
Health communication relies on strong interpersonal communications in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard.

==Applications==
Health communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.

Another increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in "good, very good, or excellent health", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427–435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.

==Challenges==
There are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.

===Literacy-communication gap===
{{Further|Health literacy}}

One problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187–227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity. Specifically, studies have been done amongst elderly populations in America to illustrate a common audience who is left at a disadvantage due to this issue.&lt;ref name=LCG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hester|first=Eva Jackson|title=An Investigation of the Relationship Between Health Literacy and Social Communication Skills in Older Adults|journal=Communication Disorders Quarterly|date=February 2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=112–119|doi=10.1177/1525740108324040}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older adults comprise an age group that generally suffers from the most chronic health conditions in comparison to other age groups, however studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} that even this group have difficulty understanding written health materials, understanding health care and policies, and generally do not comprehend medical jargon. Such shortcomings of health communication may lead to increased hospitalizations, the inability to respond to and manage a disease or medical condition, and a generally declining health status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In some populations, health-related websites (e.g., [[WebMD]]) and online support groups (e.g., Association for Cancer Online Resources) have increased access to health information.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Mass media===
Mass communication is used to promote beneficial changes in behavior among members of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abroms|first=LC|author2=Maibach, EW|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=219–34|pmid=18173391|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824|title=The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major criticism of the use of mass media as a method of health communication is the unfortunate ability for false and misinformed messages to spread quickly through the mass media, before they have the chance to be disputed by professionals. This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine. Although this panic has been ferociously labeled as fictitious, many still harbor a lingering suspicion towards vaccinations and refuse them, which has caused an immediate [[public health]] concern.

'''Helen Stuart Campbell''' ([[pen name]]s, '''Helen Weeks''', '''Helen Campbell''', '''Helen Wheaton''';{{efn|She was born "Helen Campbell Stuart". Her married name, which she also used for some of her writing, was "Helen Campbell Weeks". She used the [[pen name]]s of "Helen Campbell" (1860s) and "Helen Wheaton". In 1877, she changed her legal name to "Helen Stuart Campbell".{{sfn|Room|2012|p=89}}{{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=281}} }} July 5, 1839 – July 22, 1918)&lt;ref name="AWW"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Helen Stuart Campbell profile|encyclopedia=American Women Writers: A Critical Reference Guide from Colonial Times to the Present|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Co.|author=Moe, Phyllis|editor=Mainiero, Lina|year=1979|volume=1|location=New York, New York|pages=287–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an author, editor, social and industrial reformer, as well as a pioneer in the field of [[home economics]].{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}} Her ''Household Economics'' (1897) was an early textbook in the field of domestic science.{{sfn|Katzman|1981|p=363}}

Her first literary work was a series of stories for children, which appeared between 1864 and 1870 in ''Our Young Folks'' and ''The Riverside Magazine'', and in book form as the ''Ainslee Series''; then, in rapid succession, she published: ''His Grandmothers'' (1877); ''Six Sinners'' (1878); ''Unto the Third and Fourth Generation'' (1880); ''Four, and What They Did'' (1880); ''The Easiest Way in Housekeeping and Cooking; Adapted to Domestic Use or Study in Classes'' (1881); ''Patty Pearson's Boy: A Tale of Two Generations'' (1881); ''The Problem of the Poor: A Record of Quiet Work in Unquiet Places'' (1882); ''Under Green Apple Boughs'' (1882); ''The American Girl's Home-Book of Work and Play'' (1883); ''The Housekeeper's Year-Book'' (1888); ''Mrs. Herndon's Income'' (1883); ''The What-to-Do Club: A Story for Girls'' (1885); ''Miss Melinda's Opportunity'' (1886); ''Prisoners of Poverty: Women Wage-workers, their Trades and their Lives'' (1887 and 1893); ''Roger Berkeley's Probation'' (1888); ''Prisoners of Poverty Abroad'' (1888); ''Darkness and Daylight'' (1891); ''In Foreign Kitchens'' (1894); ''Some Passages in the Practice of Dr. Martha Scarborough'' (1895); and ''Household Economics'' (1897).{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}} At the turn of the century, she published, ''Ballantyne: a Novel'' (1901).{{sfn|Rines|Beach|1905|p=590}}

From 1881 until 1884, Campbell was literary editor of the ''Continent'', published in [[Philadelphia]], and in 1889, she assumed charge of a department in the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], ''Good Housekeeping'', entitled "Woman's Work and Wages." In 1894, she was appointed professor of household economics in the school of sociology at the [[University of Wisconsin]], and this chair she continued to fill until 1897, when she accepted a call to the [[Kansas State Agricultural College|State Agricultural College of Kansas]].{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}}

==Early years and education==
Helen Campbell Stuart was born in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]] to Jane E. (née Campbell) and Homer H. Stuart (died 1890).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}  Both parents were [[Vermont]]ers,{{sfn|Radcliffe College|1971|p=281}} of Scotch ancestry. The Stuart family, after settling in the United States, was prominent in early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] affairs, three generations fighting and dying in Indian, French and [[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary]] wars. Homer removed, in 1839, to [[New York City]], where he practiced law for over 50 years, being also for some years president of the [[American Bank Note Company|Continental Bank Note Company]], of New York.{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}}

She was educated in a school at [[Warren, Rhode Island]], and at Mrs. Cook's seminary, [[Bloomington, New Jersey]] (1850–58).{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888|p=513}}{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}}

==Career==
===Children's writer===
About 1859 or 1860, she married an army surgeon, Dr. Grenville Mellen Weeks.{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}} She thereafter lived in various portions of the U.S., during which time she gained that broad experience which has reappeared in her literary work. Endowed with abundant vitality, great imagination, power of dramatic expression and a profoundly sympathetic nature, it was impossible for the young woman to live an idle life.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}

At the age of 23, under her married name, Helen C. Weeks, she began work for children, writing steadily for ''Our Young Folks'', the ''Riverside Magazine'' and other juvenile periodicals. Like all her subsequent work, these articles were vital, magnetic and infused with humor and pathos. Soon her stories grew in length, and the ''Ainslee Series'' was issued in book form. This comprised "Ainslee," "Grandpa's House," "Four and What They Did" and " White and Red." They were popular, and all of them were reprinted in England. Her next works were ''Six Sinners'', ''His Grandmothers'' and ''The American Girl's Hand-book of Work and Play''.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}

===Social and industrial reformer===
In 1878, Campbell was a teacher in [[North Carolina]] at the [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] Cooking School.&lt;ref name="ocp.hul.harvard.edu" /&gt; About 1882, she became literary and household editor of ''Our Continent'', and wrote for its pages the popular novel entitled ''Under Green Apple Boughs,'' followed by the ''What-to-do-Club''. These latter books were preceded by several others, entitled ''Unto the Third and Fourth Generation'', and ''The Easiest Way in Housekeeping and Cooking''.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}    
[[File:Helen Campbell.png|thumb|left|Helen Campbell]]
''Problem of the Poor'', which gave an impetus to much work along the same lines by other writers, began Campbell's special interest in the poor. This appeared in 1880 and drew great attention toward plans for alleviating the miseries of the ignorant and impoverished in New York City. Some of the conclusions reached by Campbell appeared in her novel, ''Mrs. Herndon's Income'', which was printed first as a serial in the ''Christian Union'', and was afterward issued in book form. This powerful book at once lifted Campbell to an important place as a novelist, while her thrilling story won the attention of philanthropists and reformers the world over. Attracted by this volume, in 1886, the New York ''Tribune'' appointed her its commissioner to investigate the condition of women wage-earners in New York, and that work resulted in a series of papers under the title of "Prisoners of Poverty," which caused a profound and widespread sensation respecting the life of wage-women in the metropolis. It may be regarded as the seed from which followed a vast amount of literature upon the topic, resulting in great amelioration in the condition of a large, and at that time nearly helpless, body of workers.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}  Her 1897 work, ''Household Economics'' was compiled from a course of lectures which she delivered at the university.{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}}

Soon afterwards, Campbell went abroad to investigate the lives of wage-earners in [[London]], [[Paris]], Italy and Germany. There, she remained 18 months or more, the fruits of her work appearing, upon her return to the United States, in ''Prisoners of Poverty Abroad''. Following that came ''Miss Melinda's Opportunity'' and ''Roger Berkley's Probation'', two short novels, and, later, ''Anne Bradstreet and Her Time'', a historical study of early colonial life, ''A Sylvan City'', having already done the same thing for Philadelphia. A later published work of Campbell's, ''Darkness and Daylight in New York'', was a series of graphic [[portraiture]]s of the salient features of the city. In 1890, Campbell received a prize from the [[American Economic Association]] for a [[monograph]] upon "Women Wage-Earners."{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=147}}

She was the author of a biography of 17th century colonial American poet, [[Anne Bradstreet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Anne_Bradstreet_and_her_time ''Anne Bradstreet and her time''] at [[Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked as a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin (1893–96), professor of domestic science at Kansas State Agricultural College (1896–97),&lt;ref name=Willard&gt;{{cite book|last=Willard|first=Julius|title=History of Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science|page=133|publisher=Kansas State College Press|year=1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6goAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the head resident in [[Chicago]]'s Unity Settlement.&lt;ref name="ocp.hul.harvard.edu" /&gt;

==Influence and reception==
From the first, Campbell's writings were of a philanthropic and domestic character. She becoming an earnest student of economic and social problems, especially in connection with the conditions of laboring women. She wrote several important studies about women trapped in poverty, and the role that effective home economics could play in lifting women and families out of poverty. Her writings had a recognized position among economic works. They demonstrated a thorough study of her subjects, and were thoughtful and sympathetic, though generally more of a popular than a scientific or thoroughly exhaustive character.{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}} Campbell contributed many articles on economic subjects to reviews and magazines. She wrote novels and nonfiction works dealing with home economics and relationships between the individual, the home, the workplace, physical well-being, and childhood. She was active in many organizations that advocated female empowerment and associated with many intellectuals and original thinkers, including writer [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]. Much of her writing was engaging and vigorous. Her pieces exposed [[Gilded Age]] social inequities and public health failures.

The "Critic" said, in 1887, of Campbell's ''Prisoners of Poverty'': "Her book is devoted chiefly to statement and fact; not to the suggestion of remedies. She reinforces our consciousness that the final remedy lies farther back than in mere increase of wages or division of profits." In 1897, "The Bookman" of New York, said of ''Household Economics'': "It is fascinating in style, teems with epigrams, and abounds in truths which it behooves women to consider. The spirit of the lectures is one of delightful idealism."{{sfn|White|1899|p=126}}

Kazuhisa Arakawa, creative chief promotional director of Japanese PR firm [[Hakuhodo]] that has published '''Men Who Won’t Marry''', said that companies should watch the [[purchasing power]] of solo men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/asiatoday/japan-evolving-into-ohito_b_13144474.html|title=Japan Evolving into “Ohitorisama” Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys of single Japanese men conducted in 2010 found that 61% of men in their 20s and 70% of men in their 30s considered themselves to be herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harney|first=Alexandra|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2009/06/the_herbivores_dilemma.html|title=Japan panics about the rise of "herbivores"—young men who shun sex, don't spend money, and like taking walks. - Slate Magazine|publisher=Slate.com|date=|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's government views the phenomenon as one possible cause of the [[Aging of Japan#Low_fertility_rate|nation's declining birth rate]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-16500768/young-japanese-decline-to-fall-in-love|work=BBC News|title=Young Japanese 'decline to fall in love'|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fukasawa, herbivore men are "not without romantic relationships, but have a non-assertive, indifferent attitude toward desires of flesh". The philosopher [[Masahiro Morioka]] defines ''herbivore men'' as "kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others."&lt;ref name="Morioka"/&gt;

== Potential causes ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Indifference of men to marriage and committed relationships is an observable trend in many advanced societies. Various social and economic factors are cited as playing a role in this trend. In Japan, the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|decline]] of the [[economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] is often said to contribute to the rise of herbivore men, the theory being that economic disillusionment from the bubble burst of the early 1990s, has caused Japanese men to turn their backs on typical "masculine" and corporate roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/27/us-japan-herbivores-idUSTRE56Q0C220090727|work=Reuters|title=Japan's "herbivore" men shun corporate life, sex|date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nicolae |first=Raluca |year=2014 |title=Sōshoku(kei) Danshi: The (Un)gendered Questions on Contemporary Japan |journal=Romanian Economic and Business Review |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=66–81 |issn=1842-2497 |id=[[Research Papers in Economics|RePEc]]:[http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:rau:journl:v:9:y:2014:i:3:p:66-81 rau:journl:v:9:y:2014:i:3:p:66-81]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic downturn showed the fragility of [[salaryman|salarymen]], permanent employment became less appealing, with over 2,500,000 [[freeter]]s—young people working only part-time—and between 650,000 and 850,000 [[NEET]]s—young people who are "not in education, employment, or training"—between the ages of 19 and 35, living in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Kosugi-Reiko/2022|title=Youth Employment in Japan's Economic Recovery: 'Freeters' and 'NEETs'|publisher=JapanFocus|date=|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response might be deeply ingrained in [[culture of Japan|Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teo|first=Alan|title=Modern-Day Hermits: The Story Hikkomori in Japan and Beyond|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70bv5gaN4LI|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Women in Japan|Japanese women]] might be further discouraging men from entering into romantic relationships. The decision that many herbivore men make to stop working, because work and [[marriage in Japan]] are so inter-related, may have made it more difficult for these Japanese men to find marriage. Many women refuse men who do not have steady jobs (such as freeters and NEETs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14756847?story_id=14756847|work=The Economist|title=They need another hero|date=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other women feel that self-proclaimed s''ōshoku-kei danshi'' (herbivore men) are weak and not masculine, while some men apparently are not attracted to "independent" women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/world/japan.herbivore.men_1_japanese-men-men-and-women-girlfriend?_s=PM:WORLD|work=CNN|title=The last person out of the closet?

Since the end of [[World War II]], Japan has not directly participated in any war or conflict, either within its own borders or outside of them. Prior to this time of peace, many Japanese felt that becoming a soldier was the only approach to becoming manly. This social norm has slowly disappeared during the following period of post-war peace. Due to this, Japanese men are less aggressive and this could bleed over into their romantic lives.&lt;ref name="Morioka"/&gt;

== In media ==
From 2008 to 2009 the term ''herbivore men'' became a widely used and trendy term in Japan. It even was voted into the top ten of Buzzwords of the Year in December 2009 by U-CAN.&lt;ref name="Morioka"/&gt; This term has become increasingly more popular as of late as herbivore men in Japan have become commonplace. ''Sōshoku-kei danshi'' (''Herbivore Men'') was a movie released in 2010 in which one of the main characters displays herbivore tendencies. Throughout the movie, he struggles to understand sexual situations, such as a woman inviting him to sleep with her.&lt;ref name="Morioka"/&gt; In the same year singer-songwriter [[Gackt]] held a male-only rock [[Are You "Fried Chickenz"??#The band|concert]] in an attempt to bolster "men's spirit ... and sexuality" against the ''herbivore men'' masculinity in Japan's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Chen|chapter=The Rise of 草食系男子 (Soushokukei Danshi) Masculinity and Consumption in Contemporary Japan: A Historic and Discursive Analysis|title=Gender, Culture, and Consumer Behavior|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307108482_The_Rise_of_caoshixinanzi_Soushokukei_Danshi_Masculinity_and_Consumption_in_Contemporary_Japan_A_Historic_and_Discursive_Analysis|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|editor=Cele Otnes, Linda Zayer|page=283–308|isbn=9781138110441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbivore men have become more prominent in Japanese culture recently and this phenomenon has been represented in their presence in media in Japan.

== Potential effects ==
Japan recorded only a 1.42 birth rate in 2014, down from a high of 1.84 in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=JP|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many blame this drastic fall on the rise of herbivore men in Japan. The decline in birth rate has been attributed to the herbivore men’s reluctance to marry.&lt;ref name="tomikawa1" /&gt;

The '''history of [[school counseling]]''' around the world varies greatly based on how different countries and local communities have chosen to provide academic, career, college readiness, and personal/social skills and competencies to [[K-12]] children and their families based on economic and [[social capital]] resources and public versus private educational settings in what is now called a school counseling program.&lt;ref name=ASCA&gt;{{cite book|author = American School Counselor Association|date = 2005|title = The ASCA National Model: A framework for school counseling programs|location = Alexandria, USA|publisher = Author}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

===Early years===
The first school counselors in the United States emerged in the late 1800s, the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wvde.state.wv.us/counselors/history.html|title=School Counseling: A Brief Historical Overview|last=Schimmel|first=Christine|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States may not be the first place that school counseling was recognized. There have been traces of school counselors dating back to the late 16th century. An argument has been made that says that counseling and guidance principles began in ancient Greece and Rome with the philosophical teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Evidence suggests that techniques of modern-day counseling was practiced by Catholic priests in the Middle Ages. [https://www.academia.edu/22638618/Origin_And_Development_Of_Guidance_And_Counseling_Practice_In_Tanzanian_Schools_1.0._Overview_Track_record_and_Background_of_Advice_and_Counseling_in_general_in_school_Practice_and_other_setting Tomaso Garzoni] wrote a book called “[https://www.academia.edu/22638618/Origin_And_Development_Of_Guidance_And_Counseling_Practice_In_Tanzanian_Schools_1.0._Overview_Track_record_and_Background_of_Advice_and_Counseling_in_general_in_school_Practice_and_other_setting Universal Plaza of all the Professions in the World” (1626)], which was a text about career options. This relates to what a school counselor in high school and college would talk to students about today.

In the United States, the school counseling profession began as a vocational guidance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wvde.state.wv.us/counselors/history.html|title=School Counseling|website=wvde.state.wv.us|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ863872 Jesse B. Davis] is considered the first school counselor in the United States because he was the first to implement systematic guidance programs in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pope|first=Mark|title=Jesse Buttrick Davis (1871-1955): Pioneer of Vocational Guidance in the Schools|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ863872|journal=Career Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=248–258|issn=0889-4019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he became the principal of a high school and encouraged the school English teachers to use compositions and lessons to relate career interests, develop character, and avoid behavioral problems. Many others during this time did the same. For example, in 1908, [[Frank Parsons (school counselor)|Frank Parsons]], "Father of Vocational Guidance" established the Bureau of Vocational Guidance to assist young people in making the transition from school to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.careers.govt.nz/practitioners/career-practice/career-theory-models/parsons-theory/|title=Parsons' theory|website=www.careers.govt.nz|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s to the 1930s, school counseling and guidance grew because of the rise of progressive education in schools. [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] is founded in 1937. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]], led to a decline in school counseling and guidance.

In the 1940s, the U.S. used [[psychologist]]s and counselors to select, recruit, and train military personnel. This propelled the counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships during this time influenced the profession of school counseling.

===1950s and 60s===

In the 1950s the government established the Guidance and Personnel Services Section in the Division of State and Local School Systems. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I. Out of concern that the Russians were beating the U.S. in the space race, which had military implications, and that there were not enough scientists and mathematicians, the American government passed the [[National Defense Education Act]], which spurred a huge growth in vocational guidance through large amounts of funding. Since the 1960s, the profession of school counseling has continued to grow as new legislation and new professional developments were established to refine and further the profession and improve education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Schmidt|first1 = J.J.|date = 2003|title = Counseling in schools: essential services and comprehensive programs|edition = 4th|location = Boston, USA|publisher = Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2006, congress officially declared February 6–10 as [[National School Counseling Week]].

The 1960s was also a time of great federal funding in the United States for land grant colleges and universities interested in establishing and growing what are now known as Counselor Education programs. School counseling began to shift from a focus exclusively on career development to a focus on student personal and social issues paralleling the rise of social justice and civil rights movements in the United States. It was also in the late 60s and early 1970s that [[Norm Gysbers]] began the work to shift from seeing school counselors as solitary professionals into a more strategic and systemic goal of having a comprehensive developmental school counseling program for all students K-12.&lt;ref name=ASCA/&gt; His and his colleagues' work and research evidence showing strong correlations between fully implemented school counseling programs and student academic success was critical to beginning to show an evidence base for the profession especially at the high school level based on their work in the state of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lapan|first1 = R. T.|last2 = Gysbers|first2 = N. C.|last3 = Sun|first3 = Y|date = 1997|title = The impact of more fully implemented guidance programs on the school experiences of high school students: A statewide evaluation study|journal = Journal of Counseling and Development|volume = 75|pages = 292–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
But school counseling in the 1980s and early 1990s in the United States was not seen as a player in educational reform efforts buffeting the  educational community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stone|first1 = C. B.|last2 = Dahir|first2 = C. A.|date = 2006|title = The transformed school counselor|location = Boston, USA|publisher = Lahaska Press/Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger was the profession becoming irrelevant as the standards-based educational movement gained strength in the 1990s with little evidence of systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response, Campbell &amp; Dahir (1997) consulted widely with school counselors at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and created the [[ASCA National Standards for School Counseling]] with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.&lt;ref name=ASCA/&gt;

The publication of the ASCA standards in 1997 ushered in a unique period of professionalization and strengthening of school counseling identity, roles, and programs.  A year later, the first systemic [[meta-analysis]] of school counseling was published and gave the profession a wake-up call in terms of the need to focus on outcome research and the small set of methodologically accurate school counseling outcome research studies in academic, career, and personal/social domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Whiston|first1 = S. C.|last2 = Sexton|first2 = T. L.|date = 1998|title = A review of school counseling outcome research: Implications for practice|journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|volume = 76|pages = 412–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Center for Transforming School Counseling===

The National Center for Transforming School Counseling (NCTSC) at The Education Trust was founded in 2003. Its foci included (1) changing how school counseling was taught at the graduate level in Counselor Education programs and (2) changing the practices of K-12 school counselors in districts throughout the USA to teach school counselors prevention and intervention skills to help close achievement and opportunity gaps for all students. By 2008, NCTSC consultants had worked in over 100 districts including most major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 2008, Rowman Littlefield Education published The New School Counselor: Strategies for Universal Academic Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|date = 2008|title = The New School Counselor: Strategies for Universal Academic Achievement|location = Lanham, USA |publisher = Rowman Littlefield Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, written by Rita Schellenberg, a practicing school counselor and counselor educator, describes the new vision for school counseling and guides school counselors and pre-service school counselors through accountable, data-driven programming. Schellenberg introduces Standards Blending, a crosswalking strategy that hold the potential to be culturally sensitive and effective in enhancing academic achievement and closing the achievement gap.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, R. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|last2 =  Grothaus|first2 = T|date = 2009|title = Promoting cultural responsiveness and closing the achievement gap with standards blending|journal = Professional School Counseling|volume = 12|pages = 440–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|date = 2007|title = Standards blending: Aligning school counseling programs with school academic achievement missions|journal = Virginia Counselors Journal|volume = 29|pages = 13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===

In 2002, the [[American School Counselor Association]] released the ASCA National Model framework for school counseling programs, written by Dr. Trish Hatch and Dr. Judy Bowers, comprising some of the top school counseling components in the field into one model—the work of Norm Gysbers, Curly &amp; Sharon Johnson, Robert Myrick, Dahir &amp; Campbell's ASCA National Standards, and the skill-based focus for closing gaps from the Education Trust's Pat Martin and Reese House into one document. ASCA also developed the RAMP (Recognized ASCA Model Programs) Awards to honor school counseling programs that have fully implemented the ASCA National Model with demonstrable evidence of success for K-12 students (www.schoolcounselor.org).

In 2003, the Center for School Counseling Outcome Research &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CSCORE|url = http://www.umass.edu/schoolcounseling/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dimmitt|first1 = C.|last2 = Carey|first2 = J. C.|last3 = Hatch|first3 = T|date = 2007|title = Evidence-based school counseling: Making a difference with data-driven practices|location = Thousand Oaks, USA|publisher = Corwin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed as a clearinghouse for [[evidence-based practice]] with regular research briefs disseminated and original research projects developed and implemented with founding director Jay Carey. One of the research fellows, Tim Poynton, developed the EZAnalyze software program for all school counselors to use as free-ware to assist in using data-based interventions.

In 2004, the ASCA Code of Ethics was substantially revised to focus on issues of equity, closing gaps, and ensuring all students received access to a K-12 school counseling program.&lt;ref name = schoolcounselor&gt;{{cite web|title = American School Counselor Association|url = http://www.schoolcounselor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Office for School Counselor Advocacy]] (NOSCA) developed scholarships for research on college counseling by K-12 school counselors and how it is taught in School Counselor Education programs. They also created Advocacy Awards to focus on best practices in college counseling programs in K-12 schools that show effective school counseling practices in creating college-going cultures with demonstrated results in ensuring high rates of college admissions for large percentages of students of nondominant backgrounds.

In 2008, The first NOSCA study was released by Jay Carey and colleagues focusing on innovations in selected College Board "Inspiration Award" schools where school counselors collaborated inside and outside their schools for high college-going rates and strong college-going cultures in schools with large numbers of students of nondominant backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = The College Board|date = 2008|title =  Inspiration &amp; innovation: Ten effective counseling practices from the College Board's Inspiration Award schools|location = Washington, D.C., USA|publisher = Author}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, the American School Counselor Association released School Counseling Competencies focused on assisting school counseling programs to effectively implement school counseling programs based on the ASCA Model.&lt;ref name = schoolcounselor/&gt;

The ASCA Model encourages professional school counselors to use crosswalking strategies and to create action plans and results reports that demonstrate "how" school counselors are making a difference in the lives of students.  The most recent version of the ASCA National Model was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = American School Counselor Association|url = http://www.ascanationalmodel.org/content.asp?contentid=54|title = The ASCA National Model—New Edition Released|accessdate =  August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Image Universe''' is a [[fictional universe|fictional]] [[shared universe]] wherein many of the [[comic book]]s published by [[Image Comics]] take place.

== Publication history ==
The Image Universe began with the founding of Image Comics in 1992, launching with series such as ''[[The Savage Dragon]]'', ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]''.

Image Comics' nature of allowing comic creators to retain the rights to the characters they publish with Image had led to many characters entering or exiting the Image Universe as the creators move from or to other publishers. Image co-founder and ''Savage Dragon'' creator Erik Larsen generally treats the Image Universe continuity as though each title exists in its own universe, and any crossovers between different creators' characters are events that occur simultaneously in each respective characters' universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=15081 |title=One Fan's Opinion: Issue #14 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jim Lee was an Image partner, his [[WildStorm]] properties such as ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]]'', ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Gen¹³]]'', ''[[Union (comics)|Union]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'', ''[[Wetworks]]'', and ''[[Backlash (comics)|Backlash]]'' regularly crossed over with other Image characters, but when he sold his studio to [[DC Comics]], this ceased, and the WildStorm characters have since been incorporated into the post-"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" [[DC Universe]]. Most of the comic characters in the Image Universe however are originally individually creator-owned from when the company was established.

There were several Image crossover mini-series in the 1990s, such as ''Shattered Image'', ''Altered Image'' and ''Splitting Image'', along with the Eclipse Comics satire ''Spittin' Image'', but only ''[[Mars Attacks]] Image'' had any direct impact on the titles represented, as the Martians' attack was also shown and referenced many times in the ''Savage Dragon'' series.

In 2009, the Image Universe had its first major crossover in several years with ''[[Image United]]''.

'''Intelligence amplification''' ('''IA''') (also referred to as '''cognitive augmentation''' and '''machine augmented intelligence''') refers to the effective use of [[information technology]] in augmenting [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]]. The idea was first proposed in the 1950s and 1960s by [[cybernetics]] and early [[computer pioneer]]s.

IA is sometimes contrasted with AI ([[artificial intelligence]]), that is, the project of building a human-like intelligence in the form of an autonomous technological system such as a computer or robot. AI has encountered many fundamental obstacles, practical as well as theoretical, which for IA seem moot, as it needs technology merely as an extra support for an autonomous intelligence that has already proven to function. Moreover, IA has a long history of success, since all forms of information technology, from the abacus to writing to the Internet, have been developed basically to extend the [[information processing]] capabilities of the human mind (see [[extended mind]] and [[distributed cognition]]).

==Major contributions==

===William Ross Ashby: ''Intelligence Amplification''===

The term ''intelligence amplification'' (IA) has enjoyed a wide currency since [[William Ross Ashby]] wrote of "amplifying intelligence" in his ''Introduction to Cybernetics'' (1956).  Related ideas were explicitly proposed as an alternative to [[Artificial Intelligence]] by [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] from the early days of [[automated theorem proving|automatic theorem prover]]s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
.."[[problem solving]]" is
largely, perhaps entirely, a matter of appropriate [[wikt:selection|selection]]. 
Take, for instance, any popular book of problems and [[puzzles]].
Almost every one can be reduced to the form: out of a certain set,
indicate one element.... It is, in fact, difficult to think of a
problem, either playful or serious, that does not ultimately require an
appropriate selection as necessary and sufficient for its solution.

It is also clear that many of the [[intelligence tests|tests
used for measuring "intelligence"]] are scored essentially according to
the candidate's power of appropriate selection. ... Thus it is not
impossible that what is commonly referred to as "intellectual power"
may be equivalent to "power of appropriate selection".  Indeed, if a
talking [[Black box|Black Box]] were to show high power of appropriate selection
in such matters—so that, when given difficult problems it
persistently gave correct answers—we could hardly deny that it was
showing the '[[behavioral]]' equivalent of "high intelligence".

If this is so, and as we know that power of selection can be
amplified, it seems to follow that intellectual power, like physical
power, can be amplified.  Let no one say that it cannot be done, for
the gene-patterns do it every time they form a brain that grows up to
be something better than the gene-pattern could have specified in
detail. What is new is that we can now do it synthetically,
consciously, deliberately.

::[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby, W.R.]], ''[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf An Introduction to Cybernetics]'', Chapman and Hall, London, UK, 1956.  Reprinted, Methuen and Company, London, UK, 1964.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===J. C. R. Licklider: ''Man-Computer Symbiosis''&lt;!--linked from 'J. C. R. Licklider'--&gt;===
"Man-Computer Symbiosis" is a key speculative paper published in 1960 by [[psychologist]]/[[computer scientist]] [[J.C.R. Licklider]], which envisions that mutually-interdependent, "living together", tightly-coupled human brains and computing machines would prove to complement each other's strengths to a high degree:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man-computer [[symbiosis]] is a subclass of man-machine systems. There are many man-machine systems. At present, however, there are no man-computer symbioses. The purposes of this paper are to present the concept and, hopefully, to foster the development of man-computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines, calling attention to applicable principles of man-machine engineering, and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed. The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today.
::[[J.C.R. Licklider|Licklider, J.C.R.]], [http://medg.lcs.mit.edu/people/psz/Licklider.html "Man-Computer Symbiosis"], ''IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics'', vol. HFE-1, 4-11, Mar 1960.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Licklider's vision, many of the pure artificial intelligence systems envisioned at the time by over-optimistic researchers would prove unnecessary.  (This paper is also seen by some historians as marking the genesis of ideas about [[computer networks]] which later blossomed into the [[Internet]]).

===Douglas Engelbart: ''Augmenting Human Intellect''===

Licklider's research was similar in spirit to his [[DARPA]] contemporary and [[protégé]] [[Douglas Engelbart]]. Both had a view of how computers could be used that was both at odds with the then-prevalent views (which saw them as devices principally useful for [[computation]]s), and key proponents of the way in which computers are now used (as generic adjuncts to humans).

Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for [[knowledge-work]]. Engelbart's philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly expressed in the 1962 research report: ''Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework''&lt;ref name="E3906"&gt;
   [http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"]
   (October 1962), DougEngelbart.org.
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of network augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart based on this pioneering work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.

Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insolvable. And by complex situations we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years.

We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human feel for a situation usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids."
::[[Douglas Engelbart|Engelbart, D.C.]], ''Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework'', Summary Report AFOSR-3233, [[Stanford Research Institute]], Menlo Park, CA, October 1962.&lt;ref name=E3906/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Engelbart subsequently implemented these concepts in his [[Augmentation Research Center|Augmented Human Intellect Research Center]] at [[SRI International]], developing essentially an intelligence amplifying system of tools ([[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]) and co-evolving organizational methods, in full operational use by the mid-1960s within the lab. As intended,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#4d "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"], Section D: Regenerative Feature, in D. C. Engelbart Summary Report AFOSR-3233, [[Stanford Research Institute]], Menlo Park, CA, October 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; his R&amp;D team  experienced increasing degrees of intelligence amplification, as both rigorous users and rapid-prototype developers of the system. For a sampling of research results, see their 1968 [[The Mother of All Demos|Mother of All Demos]].

==Later contributions==
[[Howard Rheingold]] worked at [[Xerox PARC]] in the 1980s and was introduced to both Bob Taylor and Douglas Engelbart; Rheingold wrote about "mind amplifiers" in his 1985 book, ''Tools for Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rheingold |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Rheingold |date=2000 |origyear=1985 |title=Tools for thought: the history and future of mind-expanding technology |edition=Reprint |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0262681153 |oclc=43076809}} See also Rheingold's site: {{cite web|url=http://rheingold.com/about/ |title=About Howard Rheingold |website=rheingold.com |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli salad''' ({{lang-he|סָלָט יְרָקוֹת יִשְׂרְאֵלִי|salat yerakot yisra'eli}}, "Israeli vegetable salad", also known as '''Arab salad''') is a chopped [[salad]] of finely diced [[tomato]], [[onion]], [[cucumber]], and [[Bell pepper|bell]] or [[Chili pepper|chili]] peppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York|author=Claudia Roden|publisher=Knopf|year=1996|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks 2010"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gil|last1=Marks|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&amp;pg=PT870|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=2010|isbn=9780544186316|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the "most well-known national dish of [[Israel]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Israel,'' Jill DuBois and Mair Rosh, Marshall Cavendish  Pub., 2003 . p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jerusalem Diaries II: What's Really Happening in Israel, Judy Lash Balint.

==Description==
Israeli salad is made of chopped raw tomato, onion and cucumber, and can also include [[bell pepper|pepper]], [[carrot]], [[scallion]], [[leaf vegetable|leafy greens]] and [[parsley]]. The salad is dressed with either fresh [[lemon juice]] or [[olive oil]], or both. [[Za'atar]] and [[yogurt]] are very common dressings at breakfast while [[sumac]] and [[tahini]] are common the rest of the day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The ability to chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into the "finest, most perfect dice" is considered a mark of status among many [[kibbutz]] cooks.&lt;ref&gt;Mouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetite, John Thorne, Tor/Forge, 2007, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional recipes do not include lettuce.&lt;ref name="Marks 2010"/&gt;

In Israeli restaurants and cafes, Israeli salad is served as an independent side dish, as an accompaniment to main dishes, or stuffed in a pita with [[falafel]] or [[shawarma]]. It was part of the traditional [[Israeli breakfast]] at home before Western-style breakfast cereals became popular, and remains a standard feature at buffet breakfasts at Israeli hotels, as well as in many homes.

==History==
Although cucumbers have an ancient history in the Middle East, tomatoes, native to South America, were not cultivated in the [[Syria region]] until possibly as late as the 19th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=British_Consuls_in_Aleppo | title = British Consuls in Aleppo – Your Archives | publisher = Yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk | date = 26 January 2009 | accessdate = 2 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the Israeli salad are traced by Gil Hovav, Israeli food editor and chef, to a Palestinian Arab salad. He states that, "this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it’s an Arab salad, Palestinian salad….”&lt;ref&gt;"This salad that we call an Israeli salad, actually it's an Arab salad, Palestinian salad." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_03_08_cooking_in_the_danger_zone_srs_3_israel_palestine_territories.pdf BBC Cooking in the Danger Zone: Israel and Palestinian Territories, Page 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that what is known in New York delis as "Israeli salad" stems from a Palestinian rural salad is also agreed on by [[Joseph Massad]], a Palestinian professor of Arab Politics at [[Columbia University]], as an example of the appropriation of Palestinian and pan-Syrian foods such as [[hummus]], [[falafel]], and [[tabbouleh]] by Israel as "national dishes".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Massad, "The Persistence of the Palestinian Question," in ''Empire &amp; Terror: Nationalism/postnationalism in the New Millennium,'' Begoña Aretxaga, University of Nevada, Reno Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada Press, 2005 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Food historian [[Gil Marks]] describes how Jewish immigrants in the late 19th century first encountered the cucumber and tomato salad in then-Ottoman Palestine, and traces its presence there back to the Turkish ''[[çoban salatası]]'' (shepherd's salad).&lt;ref name="Marks 2010"/&gt; Adopted and popularized in Israel by the [[kibbutz]]im, variations on the basic recipe have been made by the different Jewish communities that immigrated to the country. For example, [[Indian Jews|Jews from India]] prepare it with the addition of finely chopped [[ginger]] and green [[chili pepper]]s, [[Mizrahi Jews|North African Jews]] may add [[preserved lemon]] peel and [[cayenne pepper]], and [[Bukharan Jews]] chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York'', New York, Knopf (1997) {{ISBN|0-394-53258-9}}, pg. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Majena''', also known as '''Majiena''' or '''Maxiena''', is an [[unclassified language|unclassified]], now-extinct language, originally spoken by the alleged Ticomeri people of the [[Llanos de Mojos]] plains in northwestern [[Bolivia]]. Nothing is known about the language itself, but sources state that it was unintelligible to speakers of the nearby [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] languages [[Moxo languages|Moxo]] and [[Baure language|Baure]] (the term "Ticomeri" is a Moxo exonym meaning "other-language"&lt;ref&gt;Hervás y Panduro 1805, pp. 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;) and possibly unrelated to any languages of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Métraux 1942, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; It may therefore have been a [[language isolate]].

Speakers of the language were identified in the mission settlement of [[San Borja, Bolivia|San Borja]] in the eighteenth century. There is some confusion between the Majena-speaking Ticomeri and another group, also known as "Ticomeri", who spoke a divergent dialect of Moxo. Whether the two groups were related (i.e. whether the Ticomeri had abandoned Majena and acquired Moxo) is unknowable, since both were apparently extinct by 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Hervás y Panduro 1805&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Mallon''' (September 23, 1869&amp;nbsp;– November 11, 1938), also known as '''Typhoid Mary''', was an [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] cook. She was the first person in the United States identified as an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of the pathogen associated with [[typhoid fever]]. She was presumed to have infected 51 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title='Typhoid Mary' Dies Of A Stroke At 68.

==Early life==
Mary Mallon was born in 1869 in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], in what is now [[Northern Ireland]]. She migrated to the United States in 1883 or 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=Andrew|last2=Smallman-Raynor|first2=Matthew|title=Oxford Textbook of Infectious Disease Control: A Geographical Analysis from Medieval Quarantine to Global Eradication|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-199-59661-4|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|left|Typhoid Mary in a 1909 newspaper illustration. Note the skulls she casts into the frying pan.]]
From 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked as a cook in the [[New York City]] area for seven families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Job Readiness for Health Professionals: Soft Skills Strategies for Success|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-455-73771-0|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, she worked in [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]], where, within two weeks of her employment, residents developed typhoid fever. In 1901, she moved to [[Manhattan]], where members of the family for whom she worked developed fevers and [[diarrhea]], and the laundress died. Mallon then went to work for a lawyer and left after seven of the eight people in that household became ill.&lt;ref name="TheStraightDope"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Dex and McCaff|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1816/who-was-typhoid-mary |title=Who was Typhoid Mary?|website=The Straight Dope|date= August 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Mary took a position in [[Oyster Bay, Long Island]], and within two weeks 10 of the 11 family members were hospitalized with typhoid. She changed jobs again, and similar occurrences happened in three more households.&lt;ref name="TheStraightDope" /&gt; She worked as a cook for the family of a wealthy New York [[bank]]er, Charles Henry Warren. When the Warrens rented a house in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] for the summer of 1906, Mallon went along, too. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family came down with typhoid fever. The disease at that time was "unusual" in Oyster Bay, according to three medical doctors who practiced there.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Mallon was subsequently hired by other families, and outbreaks followed her.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;

=== Investigation ===
In late 1906, one family hired a typhoid researcher named [[George Soper]] to investigate. Soper published the results on June 15, 1907, in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''. He believed Mallon might be the source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news|author=Ochs, Ridgely|date=2007|title=Dinner with Typhoid Mary|newspaper=[[Newsday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was found that the family changed cooks in August 4. This was about three weeks before the typhoid epidemic broke out. The new cook, Mallon, remained in the family only a short time, and left about three weeks after the outbreak occurred. Mallon was described as an Irish woman about 40 years of age, tall, heavy, single. She seemed to be in perfect health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orauportal.fda.gov/courseware/FD202W100/SCORM_FD202_Module_3_Microbiology/Module_3_Dinner_With_Typhoid_Mary.pdf|title=Dinner With Typhoid Mary|last=|first=|date=|website=FDA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soper discovered that a female Irish cook, who fit the physical description he was given, was involved in all of the outbreaks. He was unable to locate her because she generally left after an outbreak began, without giving a forwarding address. Soper learned of an active outbreak in a penthouse on Park Avenue and discovered Mallon was the cook. Two of the household's servants were hospitalized, and the daughter of the family died of typhoid.&lt;ref name="TheStraightDope" /&gt;

When Soper approached Mallon about her possible role in spreading typhoid, she adamantly rejected his request for urine and stool samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Soper|first = George A.|title = The work of a chronic typhoid germ distributor|journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]]|volume = 48|issue = 24|pages = 2019–22|date = June 15, 1907|doi=10.1001/jama.1907.25220500025002d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Mallon refused to give samples, he decided to compile a five-year history of Mallon's employment. Soper found that of the eight families that hired Mallon as a cook, members of seven claimed to have contracted typhoid fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Satin|first=Morton|title=Death in the Pot|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=New York|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his next visit, he brought another doctor with him but again was turned away. During a later encounter when Mallon was herself hospitalized, he told her he would write a book and give her all the royalties. She angrily rejected his proposal and locked herself in the bathroom until he left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Most Dangerous Woman In America|episodelink= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JPCZOb7z2w|accessdate=August 31, 2014|series=Nova|serieslink=Nova (TV series)|first= |last= |network=[[PBS]]|station= |city= |date=October 12, 2004|began=|ended=|season= |seriesno= |number=597 |minutes=|time=28:42-29:52|transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First quarantine (1907–1910) ===
[[Image:Mary Mallon in hospital.jpg|thumb|Mary Mallon (foreground) in a hospital bed during her first quarantine]]
The [[New York City Health Department]] finally sent physician [[Sara Josephine Baker]] to talk to Mallon. Baker stated "by that time she was convinced that the law was only persecuting her when she had done nothing wrong." A few days later, Baker arrived at Mallon's workplace with several police officers, who took her into custody.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Mallon attracted so much media attention that she was called "Typhoid Mary" in a 1908 issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''. Later, in a textbook that defined typhoid fever, she was again called "Typhoid Mary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Satin|first=Morton|title=Death in the Pot|year=2007|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=New York|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mallon admitted she did not understand the purpose of hand-washing because she did not pose a risk.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In prison, she was forced to give stool and urine samples.

She was also unwilling to cease working as a cook.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;

The New York City Health Inspector determined she was a carrier. Under sections 1169 and 1170 of the Greater New York Charter, Mallon was held in isolation for three years at a clinic located on [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]].&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;

Eventually, Eugene H. Porter, the [[New York State Commissioner of Health]], decided that disease carriers should no longer be kept in isolation and that Mallon could be freed if she agreed to stop working as a cook and take reasonable steps to prevent transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon agreed that she was "prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by affidavit that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection." She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.&lt;ref name="isbe"/&gt;

===Release and second quarantine (1915–1938)===
Upon her release, Mallon was given a job as a [[laundress]], which paid less than cooking. After several unsuccessful years of working as a laundress, she changed her name to Mary Brown and returned to her former occupation despite having been explicitly instructed not to. For the next five years, she worked in a number of kitchens; wherever she worked, there were outbreaks of typhoid. However, she changed jobs frequently, and Soper was unable to find her.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;

In 1915, Mallon started another major outbreak, this time at [[Sloane Hospital for Women]] in New York City. 25 people were infected, and two died. She again left, but the police were able to find and arrest her when she brought food to a friend on Long Island.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isbe.net/career/pdf/fcs_guide.pdf | title=Food Science Curriculum | format=PDF | website=Illinois State Board of Education | page=118 | accessdate=February 9, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218233409/http://isbe.net/career/pdf/fcs_guide.pdf | archivedate=December 18, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After arresting her, [[public health]] authorities returned her to [[quarantine]] on [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] on March 27, 1915. She was still unwilling to have her gallbladder removed.&lt;ref name="isbe"/&gt; 

Mallon remained confined for the remainder of her life. She became a minor celebrity and was occasionally interviewed by the media. They were told not to accept even water from her.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt; Later, she was allowed to work as a technician in the island's laboratory, washing bottles.&lt;ref name=Newsday/&gt;

Mallon spent the rest of her life in quarantine at the Riverside Hospital. Six years before her death, she was paralyzed by a stroke. On November 11, 1938, she died of [[pneumonia]] at age 69.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; A post-mortem found evidence of live typhoid bacteria in her [[gallbladder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Legacy ==
Among the infections Mallon caused, at least three deaths were attributed to her; however, because of her use of aliases and refusal to cooperate, the exact number is not known. Some have estimated that she may have caused 50 fatalities.&lt;ref name=TheStraightDope/&gt;

Mallon was the first asymptomatic typhoid carrier to be identified by medical science, and there was no policy providing guidelines for handling the situation. Some difficulties surrounding her case stemmed from Mallon's vehement denial of her possible role, as she refused to acknowledge any connection between her working as a cook and the typhoid cases. Mallon maintained that she was perfectly healthy, had never had typhoid fever, and could not be the source. Public-health authorities determined that permanent quarantine was the only way to prevent Mallon from causing significant future typhoid outbreaks.

Other healthy typhoid carriers identified in the first quarter of the 20th century include Tony Labella, an Italian immigrant, presumed to have caused over 100 cases (with five deaths); an Adirondack guide dubbed "Typhoid John", presumed to have infected 36 people (with two deaths); and Alphonse Cotils, a restaurateur and bakery owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/bugl/epidemiology.htm Epidemiology (March 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230003/http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/bugl/epidemiology.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, "Typhoid Mary" is a colloquial term for anyone who, knowingly or not, spreads disease or some other undesirable thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typhoid+mary?s=t |title=Dictionary Reference Website: Typhoid Mary |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Elisabeth Moss]] is reported to be developing a TV miniseries in which "Typhoid Mary" is a central character, based on the 2013 novel ''Fever'' by [[Mary Beth Keane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/elisabeth-moss-developing-fever-miniseries-1006696 "Elisabeth Moss Developing 'Fever' Miniseries for BBC America"].

==Modern medical understanding of Mallon's case==

In August 2013, researchers at the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] announced they were making breakthroughs in understanding the exact science behind asymptomatic carriers such as Mallon. The bacteria that cause typhoid may hide in [[macrophages]], a type of immune cell.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Bruce (August 14, 2013). [http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2013/august/typhoid.html "Scientists get a handle on what made Typhoid Mary’s infectious microbes tick"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818111217/http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2013/august/typhoid.html |date=August 18, 2013 }}. [[Stanford School of Medicine]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/17/typhoid-mary-mystery-solved_n_3762822.html "'Typhoid Mary' Mystery May Have Been Solved At Last, Scientists Say"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. August 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can develop typhoid fever after ingesting food or water contaminated during handling by a human carrier. The human carrier may be a healthy person who has survived a previous episode of typhoid fever yet continues to shed the associated bacteria, ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'', in [[feces]] and [[urine]]. Washing hands with soap before touching or preparing food, washing dishes and utensils with soap and water, and only eating cooked food are all ways to reduce the risk of typhoid infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kznhealth.gov.za/typhoid1.htm |title=Hygiene helps you prevent Typhoid fever |publisher=[[KwaZulu-Natal]] Department of Health, [[Government of South Africa]]|date=2001|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mock-heroic''', '''mock-epic''' or '''heroi-comic''' works are typically [[satire]]s or [[parodies]] that mock common Classical stereotypes of [[hero]]es and heroic literature.  Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ascribed to [[Homer]] by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmentablog.com/2016/12/27/batrachomyomachia-classical-parody/|title=Batrachomyomachia: A Classical Parody - Carmenta Language School Blog|date=2016-12-27|work=Carmenta Language School Blog|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the [[pastoral]] genres had become used up and exhausted,&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p135"&gt;Griffin,Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt; and so they got parodically [[reprise]]d. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.
Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish [[picaresque novel]]s and the French [[burlesque]] novel, in Italy flourished the ''poema eroicomico''. &lt;br&gt;
In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by [[Torquato Tasso]] in his work ''Discorsi del poema eroico'' (''Discussions about the Epic Poems'') and realized in his masterwork, the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', were felt as antiquated.&lt;br&gt;
The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

''Lo scherno degli dèi'' (''The Mockery of Gods'') by [[Francesco Bracciolini]], printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian ''poema eroicomico''.

[[File:Houghton MS Typ 619 - Amelonghi.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Amelonghi, 1547]]
However, the best known of the form is ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The rape of the Bucket'') by [[Alessandro Tassoni]] (1622). &lt;br&gt;Other Italian mock-heroic poems were ''La Gigantea'' by [[Girolamo Amelonghi]] (1566), the ''Viaggio di Colonia'' (''Travel to Cologne'') by [[Antonio Abbondanti]] (1625), ''L'asino'' (''The donkey'') by [[Carlo de' Dottori]] (1652), ''La Troja rapita'' by [[Loreto Vittori]] (1662), ''Il malmantile racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]] (1688), ''La presa di San Miniato'' by [[Ippolito Neri]] (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in [[Neapolitan dialect]] the best known work of the form was ''La Vaiasseide'' by [[Giulio Cesare Cortese]] (1612).&lt;br&gt; While in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] [[Giovanni Camillo Peresio]] wrote ''Il maggio romanesco'' (1688), [[Giuseppe Berneri]] published ''[[Meo Patacca]]'' in 1695, and, finally, [[Benedetto Micheli]] printed ''La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa'' in 1765.

After the translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], English authors began to imitate the inflated language of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters.  The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the [[picaresque novel|picaresque]], [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]], and [[satire|satirical]] poem is the comic poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' (1662–1674), by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]].  Butler's poem describes a "trew blew" Puritan knight during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], in language that imitates Romance and [[epic poetry]].  After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.  

''Hudibras'' gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the "[[Hudibrastic]]."  The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often [[feminine rhyme]]s or unexpected conjunctions.  For example, Butler describes the [[English Civil War]] as a time which "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore" ("punk" meaning a prostitute).  The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody.  This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others.  After Butler, [[Jonathan Swift]] is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

[[Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]] is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era.  While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' is satirized in the mock-heroic ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''), Dryden's ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' is perhaps the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come.  In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares [[Thomas Shadwell]] with [[Aeneas]] by using the language of ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe.  The [[parody]] of Virgil satirizes Shadwell.  Dryden's prosody is identical to regular [[heroic verse]]:  iambic pentameter closed couplets.  The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see "the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) 

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780.  Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel.  The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by [[Alexander Pope]].  Pope’s ''The Rape of the Lock'' is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking [[epic poetry]] such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' .   The overall form of the poem, written in [[canto]]s, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the [[Muse]]”; in this case, Pope's [[Muse]] is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3).  Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure{{fact|date=November 2013 }}, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda.  These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the ''Iliad'') that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle.  All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory.  Pope’s [http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/rapeofthelock/analysis.html mastery of the Mock-Heroic] is clear in every instance.  Even the typical [[apotheosis]] found in the epics is mimicked in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in ''[[The Dunciad]]'' which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects.    In this mock-epic the progress of [[Dulness]] over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see also the metaphor of ''[[translatio studii]]'').  [[John Gay]]'s ''[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]'' and ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'' were mock-heroic (the latter in [[opera]]), and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|London]]'' is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative [[parody]], and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody.  The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel.  After [[Romanticism]]'s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in [[France]], in [[Scotland]], in [[Poland]], in [[Bohemia]], in [[Russia]]. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were ''Le Vergile Travesti'' (''The disguised Vergil'') by [[Paul Scarron]] (1648–52) and ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1730). In [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] wrote ''Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was [[Ignacy Krasicki]], who wrote ''Myszeida'' (''Mouseiad'') in 1775 and ''Monacomachia'' (''The War of the Monks'') in 1778. In the same language [[Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski]] published ''Organy'' in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet [[Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský]] in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: ''Dĕvin'' in Czech and ''Der böhmische Mägderkrieg'' in German. In 1791 the Russian poet [[N. P. Osipov]] published {{Interlanguage link multi|Eneida travestied|ru|3=Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку|lt=''Eneida travestied''}} ({{lang-ru|Вирги́лиева Энеи́да, вы́вороченная наизна́нку|italic=yes}}). [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the [[modern Ukrainian language]].

'''Newport Arch''' is the name given to the remains of a 3rd-century Roman gate in the city of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|num=1029539 |desc=Newport Arch|accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Scheduled monument]]&lt;ref name="HEsch"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1005478 |desc=The Newport Arch and town wall|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grade I [[listed building]]&lt;ref name="HEGI"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1388450 |desc=No 52 and adjoining Newport Arch|fewer-links=yes|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reputedly the oldest arch in the United Kingdom still used by traffic.

== History ==
[[File:Newport Arch, late 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|Newport Arch in the second half of the 19th century. A brick building touched the west side of the arch. It was later razed and replaced with one standing further away, allowing for a pavement]]
The arch was remodelled and enlarged when the city, then [[Lindum Colonia]] a Roman town, became capital of the province [[Flavia Caesariensis]] in the 4th century. Though unique in the United Kingdom, it is nevertheless one of many original Roman arches still open to traffic, other examples being two gates through the city walls of the Roman town of [[Diocletianopolis in Thracia|Diocletianopolis]] (now [[Hisarya, Bulgaria]]), as well as numerous examples in [[Turkey]].

As the north gate of the city, it carried the major Roman road [[Ermine Street]] northward almost in a straight line to the [[Humber]].
[[File:Roman Wall.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A surviving section of the Roman city wall to the east of the Arch]]
{{clear left}}
From ''Romano-British Buildings and Earthworks'' by John Ward (1911): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"A considerable portion of the north gate of Lincoln — the Newport Arch — is standing, but is buried to the extent of about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in the soil and débris accumulated since Roman times. The structure is about {{convert|34|ft|m|abbr=on}}. deep and has a single passage for the road, 17½ ft. wide. The inner or back portal of this passage is still intact, and is nearly {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in the clear and rises to a height of about 22½ ft. above the Roman level. Its arch is of a single ring of large limestone [[voussoir]]s rising from imposts which appear to have been moulded. The outer or front arch has long since disappeared. On the east side is a [[postern]] for pedestrians, {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}}. wide and contracting to about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. at the north end, and {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high from the Roman level. On the west side there was a similar postern about a century ago. The whole structure is of good masonry, and it appears to have projected considerably beyond the north face of the town wall."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accidents==
In May 1964 a goods [[lorry]] belonging to the Humber Warehousing Company struck the arch while attempting to pass under it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/lorry-load-trouble/story-23098233-detail/story.html |title=A lorry full of trouble |work= Grimsby Telegraph |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-25881554 |title=Lincoln's Newport Arch needs extra £80,000 for repairs |publisher=BBC News |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years later, in May 2004, another lorry struck the arch, causing minor damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/3751711.stm | work=BBC News | title=Historic Roman arch hit by lorry | date=26 May 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

13 years later, in May 2017, a RASE logistics lorry got stuck underneath the arch; after letting down the tyres, it was able to reverse out with no apparent damage to the structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16144">[[Image:Neun gute helden rathaus koeln.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The thirteenth century carving "Nine Good Heroes" (known as "''Neun Gute Helden''" in the original German) at [[Cologne City Hall|City Hall]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], is the earliest known representation of the Nine Worthies. From left to right are the three Christians: Charlemagne bearing an eagle upon his shield, King Arthur displaying three crowns, and Godfrey of Bouillon with a dog lying before him; then the three pagans: Julius Caesar, Hector, and Alexander the Great bearing a griffon upon his shield; and lastly the three Jews: David holding a sceptre, Joshua, and Judas Maccabeus.]]

The '''Nine Worthies''' are nine historical, scriptural, and legendary personages who personify the ideals of [[chivalry]] established in [[the Middle Ages]], whose lives were deemed a valuable study for aspirants to chivalric status. All were commonly referred to as '[[Prince]]s', regardless of their historical titles. In French they are called ''Les Neuf Preux'' or "Nine Valiants",&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise'' Lexis, 1993: ''Brave, Vaillant''&lt;/ref&gt; giving a more specific idea of the moral virtues they exemplified: those of soldierly courage and generalship.  In Italy they are ''i Nove Prodi''.

The Nine Worthies include three pagans ([[Hector]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), three Jews ([[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Judas Maccabeus]]) and three Christians ([[King Arthur]], [[Charlemagne]], and [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]).

==Origin==

Visible on the fountain, l to r are: Judas Maccabeus, David (with harp), Julius Caesar, Alexander. The figure in the left foreground, [[Mark the Evangelist|St Mark]], with his lion, is part of another group]]

[[File:Hans Burgkmair d. Ä. Drei heidnische Helden.jpg|thumb|right|''The Three Good Pagans'': [[Hector]], Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, from the woodcut series by [[Hans Burgkmair]], 1519.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexander—Attributed coat of arms of Gaius Julius Caesar—2011.png|thumb|right|The Nine Worthies were each attributed a coat of arms during the European mediaeval period. Julius Caesar was attributed a black two-headed eagle on a gold shield.]] --&gt;

They were first described in the early fourteenth century, by [[Jacques de Longuyon]] in his ''Voeux du Paon'' (1312).&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', (1919) 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their selection, as [[Johan Huizinga]] pointed out, betrays a close connection with the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance genre of chivalry]]. Neatly divided into a triad of triads, these men were considered to be paragons of chivalry within their particular traditions, whether [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], or [[Christianity|Christian]]. Longuyon's choices soon became a common theme in the literature and art of the Middle Ages and earned a permanent place in the popular consciousness. The medieval "craving for symmetry"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; engendered female equivalents, the ''neuf preuses'', who were sometimes added, though the women chosen varied. [[Eustache Deschamps]] selected "a group of rather bizarre heroines"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; selected from fiction and history, among them [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], [[Semiramis]]. Literature and suites of [[tapestry]] featured the full complement of eighteen, whose allegorical figures preceded [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI of England]] in his triumphal [[royal entry]] to Paris, 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; A "tenth worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the concept of the "[[Muse#The "tenth Muse"|Tenth Muse]]".&lt;/ref&gt; was added by Deschamps, in the figure of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], the Breton knight to whom France owed recovery from the battles of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy (1346)]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers (1356)]]. [[Francis I of France]] still occasionally paraded himself at court dressed in the "antique mode" to identify himself also as one of the ''Neuf Preux''.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1459 [[Ingeram Codex]] presents the coat of arms of the Nine Worthies among a larger list of [[attributed arms]] of exemplary individuals, as the three "better Jews", "best pagans" and "best Christians"&lt;!--sic, pp. 28-30 File:Ingeram Codex 028.jpg --&gt; alongside the arms attributed to three heroes of [[King David]] (glossed as "the first coats of arms"), the [[Three Magi]],  the "three mildest princes", the "three worst tyrants" ([[Nebuchadnezzar]], [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochos Epiphanes]] and [[Nero]]),  "three patient ones" ([[Alfonso X of Castile|Alphonse the Wise]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and [[Saint Eustachius]]), "three anointed kings"  (France, Denmark and Hungary) and "three noble dynasties" ([[Louis XI of France]], called "Louis the Prudent" as [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and [[Otto III, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] of the [[House of Welf]]).

==Symbolism==
As a group, the nine worthies represent all facets of the perfect chivalrous warrior. All, with the exception of Hector, are conquering heroes. (Despite Arthur's later downfall, historical and literary texts record his early conquests in Britain and on the Continent). Those not royal were presumed to come from knightly families. All lived in the pre-[[Heraldry|heraldic]] era, and [[attributed arms]] were invented for them, as in [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s engraving. All brought glory and honor to their nations and were noted for their personal prowess in arms. As individuals, each displayed some outstanding quality of chivalry which made them exemplars of knighthood. That the nine individual figures were generally not distinguished, iconographically, with respect to relative antiquity or ethnicity, would suggest that the virtues that they manifest are to be understood as timeless and universal.

==Classification==
The Nine Worthies comprise a triad of triads as follows:

===Pagans===
*[[Hector]]
*[[Alexander the Great]]
*[[Julius Caesar]]

===Jews===
*[[Joshua]]
*[[David]]
*[[Judas Maccabeus]]

===Christians===
*[[King Arthur]]
*[[Charlemagne]]
*[[Godfrey of Bouillon]]

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
The Nine Worthies were also a popular subject for [[masque]]s in [[Renaissance]] Europe. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' the comic characters attempt to stage such a masque, but it descends into chaos. The list of Worthies actually named in the play include two not on the original list, [[Hercules]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. Alexander, Judas Maccabaeus, and Hector also appear on stage before the show collapses into complete disorder. The worthies are also mentioned in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' in which [[Doll Tearsheet]] is so impressed by [[Falstaff]]'s bravery in fighting [[Ancient Pistol]] that she says he is "as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies".&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William, ''Henry IV, Part 2'', Act 2, Scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Quixote]] evokes the Nine Worthies in Volume I, Chapter 5, telling a peasant (who is trying to get him to admit who he is) "I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Don Quixote/Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V - In which the narrative of our knight's mishap is continued]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
The Nine Worthies had not devolved to folk culture even in the seventeenth century, for a frieze of the Nine Worthies, contemporary with Shakespeare's comedy, was painted at the outset of the seventeenth century at [[North Mymms|North Mymms Place, Hertfordshire]], an up-to-date house built by the Coningsby family, 1599.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brookmans.com/history/house/ch3.shtml North Mymms Park - A short history - Chapter 3 - Wall Paintings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Cloisters]], in New York City, has important portions of an early 15th-century tapestry series illustrating the surviving five of the Nine Worthies: King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector, and Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/the_cloisters/Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and/ViewObject.aspx?depNm=the_cloisters&amp;Title=Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and_&amp;pID=0&amp;kWd=hector&amp;OID=70008204&amp;vW=0&amp;Pg=1&amp;St=5&amp;StOd=1&amp;vT=2 King Arthur: Tapestry Fragment from the Series, Five Worthies and Attendant Figures (with 32.130.3a, b) | All | The Cloisters | Collection Database | Works of Art | The Metrop...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Nove Prodi'', a fresco by the ''Maestro del Castello della Manta'', an [[anonymous master]], painted c. 1420 in the ''sala baronale'' of the [[Castello della Manta]], Saluzzo, Italy. The series also includes depictions of their female counterparts.

[[Montacute House]] has sculptures of the Nine Worthies spaced along the upper eastern façade on the exterior of the long gallery [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. These figures are dressed in Roman armour.

==Nine Worthy Women==
In the late fourteenth century, Lady Worthies began to accompany the Nine Worthies, though usually not individualized and shown as anonymous [[Amazons|Amazon-styled warriors]]. In later years, nine of the "Most Illustrious Ladies of All Ages and Nations" were chosen from scripture, history and legend to be placed alongside their male counterparts, though the choices for the Lady Worthies were not usually standardized and often varied by region, author and artist.

[[File:Penthesilea as one of the Nine Female Worthie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Penthesilea]] as one of the Lady Worthies]]

[[Eustache Deschamps]] to the ''neuf preux'' adds ''neuf preuses'' (women), including [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], and [[Semiramis]]. Together with their male counterparts, they precede [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as he enters Paris in 1431, and figure in ''[[Le Jouvencel]]''  (1466). The list of ''preuses'' was however less fixed, and not always structured in pagan, Jewish and Christian triads. [[Thomas III of Saluzzo]]&lt;ref&gt;''le chevalier errant'', Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, mss. Fr. 12559, fol. 125v; manuscript dated to 1403-04&lt;/ref&gt; has: ''[[Deipyle|Deiphille]], [[Sinope (mythology)|Synoppe]],  [[Hippolyte]], [[Melanippe|Menalyppe]], [[Semiramis]], [[Lampetho]], [[Tomyris|Thamarys]], [[Teuta]], [[Penthesilea|Penthésilée]]''.

A very fine set of [[Siena|Siennese]] fifteenth century panel paintings, attributed to the [[Master of the Griselda Legend]] and others, now incomplete and widely dispersed, showed male and female worthies - the remaining paintings were reunited in a 2007 exhibition at the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/node/461 Artemesia in Milan], [http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 David in NGA Washington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925142600/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 |date=2008-09-25 }}, [http://www.aworldtowin.net/images/images255/RenaissanceW056.pr.jpg Alexander in Birmingham]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German Renaissance]], [[Hans Burgkmair]] made a set of six [[woodcut]]s, each showing three of the "Eighteen Worthies". In addition to the usual males, his prints showed the Pagan [[Lucretia]], [[Veturia]] and [[Verginia|Virginia]], the Jewish [[Esther]], [[Judith]] and [[Yael]], and the Christian Saints [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], [[Bridget of Sweden]] and [[Elizabeth of Hungary]]. Burgkmair was in touch with [[Augsburg]] [[Renaissance Humanist]] circles, who may have helped choose the group. Apart from Veturia, mother of [[Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]], who tried to save Rome from defeat by her son, the other pagan two were examples of chastity, responsible for no heroic acts except their defence of their own virtue. In contrast, two of the Jewish women, Judith and Jael, are known for their personal assassination of leaders opposed to Israel. Judith carries a sword in one hand and [[Holofernes]]'s severed head in the other, and Jael carries the mallet with which she hammered a peg in the head of [[Sisera]]. The "[[Power of Women]]" and female violence was an interest of German artists at the time, and [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and others made prints of Jael in the act.&lt;ref&gt;H Diane Russell (ed), ''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints'', pp. 36-39, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990, {{ISBN|1-558-61039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian trio of saints, all very popular in Germany at the time, are all women who had been married - Bridget became an [[abbess]] as a widow. In addition, like three of the male worthies, Elizabeth of Hungary was an ancestor of Burgkmair's patron [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Helena was a Roman Empress. Unlike the other two groups, who all face each other, apparently in conversation, these three all look down, and may illustrate the female virtue of silence.&lt;ref&gt;(covers all Burgmair section)H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints''; Nos. 1, &amp; for Jael: 91, 92 National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burgkmair's conception was not very widely followed.

==''Nine Worthies of London''==
{{further|Nine Worthies of London}}

''Nine Worthies of London'' is a book by Richard Johnson, written in 1592, that borrows the theme from the Nine Worthies. The book is subtitled ''Explaining the Honourable Excise of Armes, the Vertues of the Valiant, and the Memorable Attempts of Magnanimous Minds; Pleasaunt for Gentlemen, not unseemely for Magistrates, and most profitable for Prentises'', celebrated the rise of nine famous Londoners through society from the ranks of apprentices or commoners.

The nine were Sir [[William Walworth]], Sir [[Henry Picard (Lord Mayor of London)|Henry Pritchard]], Sir [[Thomas White (merchant)|Thomas White]], Sir [[William Sevenoke]], Sir [[John Hawkwood]], Sir John Bonham, Christopher Croker, Sir Henry Maleverer of Cornhill, and Sir Hugh Calverley.

The term "Nine Worthies" was later used to refer to nine of the privy councillors of [[William III of England|William III]]: [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Devonshire]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Dorset]], [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Monmouth]], [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Edward Russell]], [[Peregrine Osborne, 2nd Duke of Leeds|Carmarthen]], [[Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]], and [[John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale|Lowther]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25496">'''Fine art nude photography''' is a [[genre]] of [[fine-art photography]] which [[Nude photography|depicts the nude]] human body with an emphasis on form, [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emotional content, and other [[aesthetic]] qualities.

The [[Nude (art)|nude]] has been a prominent subject of [[photography]] since its invention, and played an important role in establishing photography as a [[fine art]] medium.

The distinction between fine art photography and other subgenres is not absolute, but there are certain defining characteristics.

[[Erotic photography|Erotic]] interest, although often present, is secondary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Clark, Kenneth| year=1956| title=The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form|chapter=1. The Naked and the Nude|publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton| isbn=0-691-01788-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes art photography from both [[glamour photography]], which focuses on showing the subject of the photograph in the most attractive way, and [[pornographic photography]], which has the primary purpose of [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] the viewer. Fine art photographs are also not taken to serve any journalistic, scientific, or other practical purpose.

The distinction between these is not always clear, and photographers, as with other artists, tend to make their own case in characterizing their work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krosenthal.com/photography.html|author=Rosenthal,Karin|title=About My Work|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavondyss.com/silverbeauty/about.htm|author=Schiesser, Jody|title=Silverbeauty - Artist Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusart.net/|author=Mok, Marcus|title=Artist's Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the viewer may have a different assessment.

The nude remains a controversial subject in all media, but more so with photography due to its inherent realism.&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt; The male nude has been less common than the female, and more rarely exhibited or published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weiermair, Peter  |author2=Nielander, Claus  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hidden Image: Photographs of the Male Nude in the 19th and 20th Centuries|publisher=MIT Press, 1988|isbn=0-262-23137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of children as subjects in nude photography is especially controversial.

Those early photographers in [[Western culture]]s who sought to establish photography as a fine art medium, frequently chose women as the subjects for their nude photographs, in poses that accorded with traditional [[Nude (art)|nudes]] in other media. Before nude photography, art nudes usually used allusions to [[classical antiquity]]; gods and warriors, goddesses and nymphs. Depictions of male and female nudes in traditional art mediums had been mostly limited to portrayals as an ideal warrior or athlete (for men) or that emphasized divinity and reproduction (for women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuan/hd_nuan.htm|title=Sorabella, Jean. January 2008. The nude in western art and its beginnings in antiquity. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early photographic art first engaged these archetypes as well. Poses, [[Photographic lighting|lighting]], [[soft focus]], [[vignetting]] and hand [[Photo manipulation|retouching]] were employed to create photographic images that rose to the level of art comparable to the other arts at that time.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/naked-before-the-camera|title=Naked before the Camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main limitation was that early photographs were [[monochrome]]. Although 19th century artists in other media often used photographs as substitutes for live models, the best of these photographs were also intended as works of art in their own right.

Nude photography was more controversial than painted nude works, and in order to avoid censorship some early nude photographs were described as "studies for artists",&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; while others were used as references by artists to do drawings and paintings as a supplement to live [[Model (art)|models]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] was an early adopter of the practice of using photographs taken specifically for him by his friend, [[Eugène Durieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Delacroix Drawings Made from Photographs|author=Van Deren Coke|journal=Art Journal|volume=21|issue=3|date=Spring 1962|pages=172–174|publisher=College Art Association|jstor=774417|doi=10.2307/774417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Degas]] made his own photographs that he used for painting references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=47047|title=After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back|publisher=The J.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As fine art photography first embraced and then moved passed classical allegorical imagery, both male and female photographers began to use the male nude as another medium to examine issues of representation and identity, sexuality and voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1994). ''The male nude: A male view: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographing nudes (and particularly male nudes) became a way for women artists to engage the subject of “the nude” from the position of power traditionally reserved for male artists;&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1995). ''Male nudes by women: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, nude self-portraiture allowed men to begin to re-evaluate accepted definitions of sensuality and masculinity by photographing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Massengill, Reed. (2005). ''Self-exposure : the male nude self portrait''. New York: Universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alfred Stieglitz ====
[[Alfred Stieglitz]] is a major figure in bringing modern art to America by exhibiting the new genre of art in his New York galleries at the beginning of the 20th century. He is known to the public perhaps more for his relationship with [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], whose nude photos he exhibited in 1921 while married to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2001|title=ART REVIEW: Proselytizing for Modernism|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stieglitz used the camera as a kind of mirror. 'My photographs,' he wrote in 1925, 'are ever born of an inner need--an Experience of Spirit. I do not make ''pictures . . .'' I have a vision of life and I try to find equivalents for it sometimes in the form of photographs.' Often he would write of ''true seeing'' and of ''inness''. As O'Keeffe noted rightly, the man she knew so well was 'always photographing himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 6, 1983|title=Looking Back at the Seer of the New - Alfred Stieglitz: The Man, The Battle, The Art|author=Paul Richard|page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imogen Cunningham ====
[[Imogen Cunningham]] began taking photographs in Seattle in 1905, in the soft-focused ''[[Pictorialism|pictorialist]]'' style popular at that time; but she is best known for the sharp-focused modern style she developed later. She is also attributed as the first woman photographer to take a nude photo of a man (her husband, [[Roi Partridge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampling Imogen Cunningham's Vibrant Diversity|author=Charles Hagan |newspaper=New York Times|date=13 Oct 1995|page=C27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of [[Judy Dater]], one particular photo, ''Imogen and Twinka'', became one of the most recognizable images caught by an American photographer. It features a 91 year old Imogen Cunningham and a nude [[Twinka Thiebaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Greg. [http://www.utata.org/sundaysalon/judy-dater/ Judy Dater], Sunday Salon with Greg Fallis, UTATA.org&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was the first adult full frontal nude photograph published in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, Bicentennial Special Issue (1976) called: ''Remarkable American Women 1776-1976''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Man Ray ====
After [[World War I]], [[avant-garde]] photographers became more experimental in their portrayal of nudity, using reflective distortions and printing techniques to create abstractions or depicting real life rather than classical allusions.

Beginning in the late 1920s [[Man Ray]] experimented with the Sabattier, or [[solarization]] process, a technique that won him critical esteem, especially from the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Many of the central figures of Surrealism—[[André Breton|Breton]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]]—followed his example in using photography in addition to other media. Other photographers, such as [[Maurice Tabard]] and [[Raoul Ubac]], were directly inspired by Man Ray’s techniques, while photographers such as [[André Kertész]] and [[Brassaï]] were indirectly influenced by his innovative approach to the medium.

==== Edward Weston ====
[[Edward Weston]] evolved a particularly American aesthetic, using a [[Large format (photography)|large format]] camera to capture images of [[Nature photography|nature]] and [[Landscape photography|landscapes]] as well as nudes, establishing photography as a fine arts medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativephotography.org/artists/edward-weston|title=Edward Weston|publisher=University of Arizona, Center for Creative Photography|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Weston became the first photographer to be awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|title=Edward Weston Photographs|publisher=Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona Libraries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725011346/http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a famous example of Weston's work see: [[Charis Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Conger, Amy| title=Edward Weston: The Form of Nude|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7148-4573-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bill Brandt ====
[[Bill Brandt]] is best known for a series of nudes developed primarily between 1945 and 1961, that are both personal and universal, sensual and strange, collectively exemplifying the “sense of wonder” that is paramount in his photographs. Brandt’s work is unpredictable not only in the range of his subjects but also in his printing style, which varied widely throughout his career. This exhibition is the first to emphasize the beauty of Brandt’s finest prints, and to trace the arc of their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1343|title=Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diane Arbus ====
Many fine art photographers have a variety of subjects in their work, the nude being one. [[Diane Arbus]] was attracted to unusual people in unusual settings, including a nudist camp. [[Lee Friedlander]] had more conventional subjects, one being [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as a young model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/12/madonna.photo.auction/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Nude photo of Madonna goes for $37,500 |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The distinction between fine art and glamour is often one of [[marketing]], with fine art being sold through galleries or dealers in limited editions signed by the artist, and glamour photos being distributed through mass media.

For some, the difference is in the gaze of the model, with glamour models looking into the camera, while art models do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Conrad,Donna  | publisher=PhotoVision| title = A Conversation with Ruth Bernhard| newspaper = Vol. 1 No. 3| year = 2000  | url = http://www.photovisionmagazine.com/articles/bernhard.interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glamour and [[Fashion photography|fashion]] photographers have aspired to fine art status in some of their work. One of the first was [[Irving Penn]], who progressed from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine to photographing fashion models such as [[Kate Moss]] nude. [[Richard Avedon]], [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Annie Leibovitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|title=Exhibitions: Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005|publisher=The Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have followed a similar path with [[portrait]]s of the famous, many of them nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/08/photography.art|title=Not naked but nude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2012|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or partially clothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/06/miley200806|title=Miley Knows Best|publisher=Vanity Fair|year=2008|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-modern era, where fame is often the subject of fine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/22/andy-warhol-legacy-lives-on|title=Andy Warhol's legacy lives on in the factory of fame|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2012|location=London|first=Alex|last=Needham|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avedon's photo of [[Nastassja Kinski]] with a python, and Leibovitz's magazine covers of [[More Demi Moore|Demi Moore pregnant]] and in [[Demi's Birthday Suit|body paint]], have become iconic. The work of [[Joyce Tenneson]] has gone the other way, from fine art with a unique, soft-focus style showing woman at all stages of life to portraiture of famous people and fashion photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Tenneson|url=http://www.tenneson.com/content/bio|accessdate=2013-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nude photographers have largely worked within established forms that show bodies as sculptural abstractions, some, such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], have created works that deliberately blur the boundaries between [[Erotic photography|erotica]] and art.

Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of underage subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1998/05/01/photo-flap|title=Photo Flap|publisher=Reason|year=1998|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in naturist settings without emphasis on sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sturges, Jock  |author2=Phillips, Jayne Anne |lastauthoramp=yes | title=[[The Last Day of Summer (book)|The Last Day of Summer]] |publisher=Aperture |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sturges, Jock |title=[[Radiant Identities: Photographs by Jock Sturges]]|publisher=Aperture|year=1994|ISBN=0-89381-595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale were [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Mann, Sally |author2=Price, Reynolds| title=Immediate family| publisher=Aperture| year=1992| ISBN=0-89381-523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell|first=Lynn|title=Framing Innocence: A Mother's Photographs, a Prosecutor's Zeal, and a Small Town's Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWshU7qUi-0C|publisher=The New Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59558-626-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models whose bodies do not conform to conventional prejudices about beauty.&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/artist_pages/nimoy/pages/MaxBeaut.htm|title=Leonard Nimoy: The Full Body Project|publisher=R.Michelson Galleries|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Public perception===
At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become difficult to make an artistic statement in nude photography, given the proliferation of non-artistic and pornographic images which taints the subject in the perception of most viewers, limiting the opportunities to exhibit or publish the images. When they appear in mainstream consumer magazines such as ''[[Popular Photography]]'', ''PC Photo'', and ''[[Shutterbug (magazine)|Shutterbug]]''; the editors receive sufficient negative response that they tend to reject the work of serious nude-image photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deitcher|first=Kenneth|year=2008|title=A Figure Study Workshop|journal=PSA Journal|volume=74|issue=3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children as subjects===
Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of [[Minor (law)|underage]] subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"/&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes in books such as ''[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hamilton, David |title=[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]|publisher=Aurum Press|year=1995|ISBN=1-85410-304-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have caused controversy in both the US and the UK. [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in [[Naturism|naturist]] settings&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"/&gt; and states that his work is not exploitative; however in 1990 the FBI raided his studio and made charges that were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogallery.com/Sturges_Jock/sturges-bio.html|title=Jock Sturges Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe : Art: Jock Sturges' photographs of nude families are at issue|date=July 5, 1990|author=Harold Maass|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the local nature of US laws on the issue, books of both Hamilton's and Sturges' photos have been ruled obscene in the states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/08/news/mn-26778|title=Child Porn Fight Focuses on 2 Photographers' Books|date=March 8, 1998|author=J. R. Moehringer|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar controversy emerged in Australia in 2008 when photographs by [[Bill Henson]] were taken from an exhibit due to complaints regarding nudes of a thirteen-year-old girl, but no changes were proved.

[[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale where [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992" /&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"/&gt; Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexualizing Children: Thoughts on Sally Mann|first=Mary|last=Gordon|journal=Salmagundi|issue=111|year=1996|pages=144–145|publisher=Skidmore College|jstor=40535995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body image===
[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models who do not conform to [[Norm (social)|conventional]] ideas about beauty. [[Leonard Nimoy]], after many years photographing conventionally beautiful professional models, realized that he was not capturing individual personalities, so he created a series with women interested in "[[Fat acceptance movement|Fat Liberation]]".&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"/&gt; Sally Mann's more recent nudes have been of her husband, whose body shows the effects of [[muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sally Mann at Gagosian Gallery|last=Kuspit|first=Donald|journal=[[Artforum]]|volume=48|issue=5|date=Jan 2010|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic art===
Many contemporary artists push the boundaries by having work with both aesthetic qualities and [[Erotic photography|explicit sexuality]]. Late in his life [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] created work that was controversial in part by being on display in Washington, DC in a gallery receiving public funds.&lt;ref name="moral"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and the morality of the artist|last=Bernays|first=Anne|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=39|issue=20|date=Jan 20, 1993|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a Mapplethorpe retrospective opened at the Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in 1990, [[Dennis Barrie]] became the first American museum director to be criminally prosecuted for the contents of an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]. Although explicit photos were placed in a separate room with a content warning, Barrie was charged with "pandering obscenity" and showing minors in a state of nudity, but a jury acquitted Barrie and the Arts Center of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|title=Exhibiting Controversy: From Mapplethorpe to "Body Worlds" and Beyond|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615164032/http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13338">A '''pornographic parody film''' is a subgenre of the [[pornography|pornographic film industry]] genre where the basis for the production's story or [[plotline]] is the parody of a [[mainstream]] [[television show]], [[feature film]], [[public figure]], [[video game]] or literary works. This subgenre also includes parody of historical or contemporary events such as [[political scandal]]s. The subgenre has gained acceptance by the adult industry to the extent that major awards are presented in  this category by organizations such as [[31st AVN Awards#Major Awards|AVN]] and [[XRCO Award#Best Comedy or Parody|XRCO]].

==Origin==
''PornParody.com'', a website dedicated to reviewing porn parodies, cites the 1973 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' spoof ''[[Bat Pussy]]'' as possibly the earliest known pornographic parody film,&lt;ref name="BPPornParody"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |title=Bat Pussy – the first superhero porn parody? |date=October 6, 2014 |publisher=PornParody.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008174205/http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |archivedate=October 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which is also shared with the 1973 German animated short ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]''.&lt;ref name=1973Snow&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Snow White and the Seven Perverts (1973) 11 min - Animation : Short : Comedy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782084/|publisher=Amazon via IMDb|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre began taking off in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Brilliant&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=The 14 Most Brilliant Porn Parodies of All Time|url=http://www.details.com/sex-relationships/porn-and-perversions/201002/the-most-brilliant-porn-parodies-of-all-time#/slide=4|publisher=Conde Nast via Details.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; experiencing a surge in popularity during the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name=Wave&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutter|first=Jarod|title=The Big New Wave of Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/The-Big-New-Wave-of-Porn-Parodies-348804.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In 2002, ''Shaving Ryan's Privates'', a movie starring actor-turned-infosec analyst Jeff Bardin, was released. The movie documented porn films that parody classic Hollywood movies. There have been porn parodies produced of [[sitcoms]] such as ''[[Who's The Boss]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', horror and drama movies such as ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', [[sci-fi]] and [[action movie]] blockbusters such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', and of [[Costume drama|period drama]] such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', titled ''[[Down on Abby]]''. The genre includes both [[heterosexual]] as well as [[homosexual]] versions as a "gay porn parody" of the [[reality television series]] ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'' has been produced among others. Parodies also include non-story or event specific productions such as the [[Who's Nailin' Paylin?|several parodies]] that feature a [[Sarah Palin]]-like character.&lt;ref name=AVNPalinPorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasner|first=Paul|title=Behind the Sarah Palin Porn Movie|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Behind-the-Sarah-Palin-Porn-Movie-56373.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Kate|title=The Complete Guide To Porn Parodies of Movies,TV, Celebrities and Politicians|url=http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2013-12-19/porn-parody/|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=io9Guide&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Some parodies utilize techniques such as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref name=HuffSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|title='Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody' Trailer (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/star-wars-xxx-a-porn-paro_n_1194950.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie reviewer commented that the costume of a particular [[comic book]] character in a porn parody was a "better version" of the one used in the mainstream movie.&lt;ref name=BaDigest&gt;{{cite web|last=Faraci|first=Devin|title=The Porno Version Of Quicksilver Looks Better Than The X-MEN Version|url=http://badassdigest.com/2014/02/02/the-porno-version-of-quicksilver-looks-better-than-the-x-men-version/|publisher=Badass Digest|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and review==
Journalist and author [[Charlie Jane Anders]] wrote, prior to blogging on the subject, "I didn't realize just how many porn parodies there are — and how terrible most of them actually are."&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] writer commented that although the parody of the [[PBS]] series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' titled ''Down on Abby'' starring Lexi Lowe is humorous, it is "rife with historical inaccuracies" and "not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off [[French manicure|French tips]] and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]]."&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoeffel|first=Kat|title=Downton Abbey Porn Parody Rife With Historical Inaccuracies|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/downton-abbey-porn-rife-with-inaccuracies.html|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry acceptance===
Acknowledging its origins and public appeal,&lt;ref name=parody/&gt; several industry publications and trade groups have created award categories for the genre. Two of the industry's major award programs offer recognition for this category of adult film.

The [[AVN Award]] added the categories of "Best Parody - Comedy" and "Best Parody - Drama" in 2009.&lt;ref name=parody&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Best-Sex-Parody-Category-Added-to-AVN-Awards-361583.html | title=Best Sex Parody Category Added to AVN Awards | publisher=Adult Video News | date=September 29, 2009 | accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody ''Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody'' was that year's most nominated production as well as the winner of the Comedy category.&lt;ref name=2013AVN&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/And-Now-The-2013-AVN-Award-Winners-503520.html | title=And Now...

The [[XRCO Award]] added its category of "Best Parody" in 2003.&lt;ref name=2003XRCO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Jules Jordan, Evil Angel, Elegant Angel, Wicked Pictures Capture XRCO Awards|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Jules-Jordan-Evil-Angel-Elegant-Angel-Wicked-Pictures-Capture-XRCO-Awards-40011.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the award went to the [[Wicked Pictures]]-produced and [[Jonathan Morgan (director)|Jonathan Morgan]]-directed film ''Space Nuts'', a parody of the [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[Spaceballs]]'' - itself a parody of ''[[Star Wars]]''. ''Space Nuts'' also won the 2004 AVN award for Best Parody - Comedy.&lt;ref name=2003XRCO/&gt;

===Mainstream media===
The genre has gained the attention of the [[mainstream press]]. In 2009 director Jeff Mullen (a.k.a. [[Will Ryder]]) was interviewed by ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Joshua Alston about his leading role in the resurgence of porn parodies.&lt;ref name=AVNNewsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Peter|title='Newsweek' Talks to Jeff Mullen About Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Newsweek-Talks-to-Jeff-Mullen-About-Porn-Parodies-357597.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news|last=Alston|first=Joshua|title=Porn Parody of TV Sitcoms Is Adult Entertainment's 'New Gold Rush'|url=http://www.newsweek.com/porn-parody-tv-sitcoms-adult-entertainments-new-gold-rush-220586 |accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=''Newsweek''|date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Adult Video News]]'' writer Tom Hymes observed, "I have come to the realization that a very real expectation is being created among the celebrity elite: Will my show be the next XXX parody... please?" "What is kind of brilliant about the whole thing is the fact that these mainstream shows and the actors on them now get to rub shoulders with the porn industry without any actual rubbing. That's why I call them the new celebrity-safe sex tapes for safe-sex celebrities."&lt;ref name=CelebSafe&gt;{{cite web |last=Hymes |first=Tom |title=Are Porn Parodies the New Celebrity-Safe Sex Vid? |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Are-Porn-Parodies-the-New-Celebrity-Safe-Sex-Vid-366766.html |publisher=Adult Video News |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' interview with [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]], creator of the [[HBO]] original series ''True Blood'', he stated, "We just found out that they're doing a porn parody of ''[[True Blood]]''. That's certainly a moment of going 'Wow, we've arrived.'"&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX&gt;{{cite web |last=Javors |first=Steve |title=Ann Paquin Gifts 'True Blood' Porn Parody to Cast, Crew |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Ann-Paquin-Gifts-True-Blood-Porn-Parody-to-Cast-Crew-407676.html |work=[[Adult Video News]] |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, actress [[Anna Paquin]] talked about the porn parody of her own show, ''[[True Blood]]'', on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] late night [[talk show]] ''[[Lopez Tonight]]''. Paquin stated, "You know, actually what's interesting is that [fellow cast member] [[Stephen Moyer|Steve]] [Moyer] and I were so amused by it that we got it for everyone on our cast and crew as a wrap gift so I think we probably bought every copy in existence." Copies of ''Tru: A XXX Parody'' were given to the entire cast and crew at the [[wrap party]] for the show's [[True Blood (season 3)|third season]].&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX/&gt;

==Fictional pornography==

Fictional pornography is sometimes used for plot or humor in mainstream film and TV. In ''[[Friends]]'', [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe's]] twin sister starred in ''Buffay, the Vampire Layer'' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alloy.com/entertainment/the-7-best-instances-of-doppelganger-sex/4/|title=The 7 Best Instances of Doppelganger Sex - Page 4 of 4|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List_of_Two_and_a_Half_Men_characters#Lyndsey_McElroy|Lyndsey]] in ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' was the title role of ''Cinnamon's Buns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/two-and-a-half-men-keeps-getting-worse-cinnamons-buns-and-master-bakin-1848199441.html|title='Two And A Half Men' Keeps Getting Worse – 'Cinnamon's Buns And Master Baking' Recap|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Wilson (House)|Wilson]] in ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' acted in ''Feral Pleasures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/03/09/house-wilson-and-wood-nymphs-made-a-porno/|title='House': Wilson and wood nymphs made a porno|date=9 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Stormare]]'s character in ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' can be seen in ''Logjammin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2010/04/07/does-the-big-lebowski-porn-parody-actually-look-good/|title=Does 'The Big Lebowski' Porn Parody Actually Look Good?|first=Alison|last=Nastasi|date=7 April 2010|website=AOL Moviefone|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23520">'''Public history''' is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of [[history]] who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[archival science]], [[oral history]], museum [[curator]]ship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are [[museums]], historic homes and [[historic site]]s, parks, battlefields, [[archives]],  film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Definition==
Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined.  Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians:
* use of the methods of the historical discipline
* an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or [[antiquarian]] purposes
* an emphasis on professional training and practice
* an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past

These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based [[National Council on Public History]]:  "To promote the utility of history in social through professional practice.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncph.org/Portals/13/About%20the%20Council/NCPHsFirstDecade.pdf Reflections on an Idea: NCPH’s First Decade]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;69–85&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, "Public history is a movement,  methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public."  However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncph.org/WhatisPublicHistory/tabid/282/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Public History Redux"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Public History News'' (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if [[shared historical authority]] should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many "publics" for public history complicates the task of definition.  For example, historian [[Peter Novick]] has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called ''private'' history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or ''popular'' history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream:  The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' (1988), 510-21&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Stanton, '' The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Kean]] and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between "historians" and "their publics"'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), ''People and their Pasts: Public History Today'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0909/0909pub1.cfm "A Picture of Public History]:  Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals" in ''Public History News'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, those who embrace the term ''public historian'' accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings.

==Related fields==

Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/3-2015-2/public-history-sublation-german-debate/ Marko Demantowsky, ''“Public History” – Sublation of a German Debate?'', Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include:
* [[Applied history]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Cultural Heritage Management]]
* [[Digital History]]
* [[Heritage Interpretation]]
* [[Historic Preservation]]
* [[Historical archaeology]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Oral History]]
* [[Public humanities]]

In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making.  This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be "public history."

==History==

Public history has many antecedents.  These include [[Museum#History museums|history museums]],  [[Historical society|historical societies]],  public and private [[archive]]s and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, [[Historic preservation|preservation organizations]], historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, [[historical fiction]]).  Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmilla Jordanova, ''The Practice of History'' (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''Public History Review'', vol 10, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Historians in Public:  the Practice of American History, 1890-1970'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, ''Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History'' (Iowa City:  University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as “public history”. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups—for example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities—rather than the  [[Great man theory|“great men”]] who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced [[social history]] as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.&lt;ref&gt;James Green, ''Taking History to Heart:  The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements'' (Amherst, Massachusetts:  [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'', p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the [[United States Bicentennial]] to multiculturalist projects in [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]], paralleled by widespread public interest in [[genealogy]], the tracing of folk and family [[Roots revival|“roots”]], and other history-related activities. In the wake of [[deindustrialization]] in many industrial places, governments also supported [[Urban renewal|regeneration or revitalization projects]] that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for [[place branding|“re-branding”]] a depressed area.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Dicks, ''Culture on Display:  The Production of Contemporary Visitability'' (Maidenhead, UK:  Open University Press, 2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] and the Canadian government's addition of “historical researcher” as a civil service category in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;John R. English, "The Tradition of Public History in Canada," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rise of [[cultural tourism]] and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field.

In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wesley Johnson, "The Origins of ''The Public Historian'' and the National Council on Public History," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of “public history” as a field in its own right.  Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field.  The launch of a professional journal, ''[[The Public Historian]]'', in 1978, and the founding of the [[National Council on Public History]] in 1979 further served to give public-minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods.

Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic “jobs crisis” in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.&lt;ref&gt;English, "Tradition of Public History in Canada"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick, "Public History in Canada:  An Introduction," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Public history also exists as an identifiable field in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]] and Paula Hamilton, “What Makes History Public?” ''Public History Review'' 1992, pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Liddington, "What is Public History?  Publics and Their Pasts, Meanings and Practices," ''Oral History'' (Spring 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. Sutcliffe, "Gleams and Echoes of Public History in Western Europe:  Before and After the Rotterdam Conference," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 6, No. 4 (Fall 1984), pp. 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; and other places. In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Public History Network|url=http://www.historiapublica.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label “public history.”  The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifph.hypotheses.org International Federation for Public History - Fédération Internationale pour l'Histoire Publique]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/PHN-2012-September1.pdf Serge Noiret: Next Steps for the International Federation, Public History News, Volume 32, Number 4, September 2012, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; IFPH is also a permanent &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html#public Internal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203723/http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal ''[[Public History Weekly]]''.

Public history continues to develop and define itself.  There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with [[digital history]], with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge.  In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual [http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=105 NCPH Book Award].  In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians’ sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn Létourneau, and David Northrup, "Canadians and Their Pasts:  An Exploration in Historical Consciousness," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  While high-profile “history wars” have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, [[History wars|Australia's]] ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples,  the furor over [[Jack Granatstein]]’s 1998 book “Who Killed Canadian History?”, or the 1994 controversy over the [[National Museum of American History]]'s planned exhibit on the [[Enola Gay#Recent developments|Enola Gay]] bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings.

An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like [[If This House Could Talk]] are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html  |title= Connecting Neighbors through their buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|relict}}
A '''relict''' is a surviving remnant of a natural phenomenon.

* In [[biology]] a ''relict'' (or relic) is an organism that at an earlier time was abundant in a large area but now occurs at only one or a few small areas.
* In ecology, an [[ecosystem]] which originally ranged over a large expanse, but is now narrowly confined, may be termed a ''relict''.
* In [[geology]], a ''relict'' is a structure or mineral from a parent rock that did not undergo metamorphosis when the surrounding rock did, or a rock that survived a destructive geologic process.
* In [[geomorphology]], a ''relict landform'' is a [[landform]] formed by either erosive or constructive surficial processes that are no longer active as they were in the past.
* In [[agronomy]], a ''relict crop'' is a crop which was previously grown extensively, but is now only used in one limited region, or a small number of isolated regions.
* In [[history]] (as revealed in [[DNA test]]ing), a ''relict population'' is an ancient people in an area who have been largely supplanted by a later group of migrants and their descendants. 
* In [[real estate law]], ''reliction'' is the gradual recession of water from its usual high-water mark so that the newly uncovered land becomes the property of the adjoining [[riparian]] property owner.&lt;ref name="Lear1991a"&gt;Lear, P.W. 1991, ''Accretion, reliction, erosion, and avulsion: a survey of riparian and littoral title problems.'' Journal of Energy, Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Law. vol. 11, pp. 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses:
*In addition, '''relict''' was an ancient term still used in colonial (British) America, and in England of that era, but now archaic, for a [[widow]]; it has come to be a generic or collective term for widows and widowers.
* In [[historical linguistics]], a ''relict'' is a word that is a survivor of a form or forms that are otherwise archaic.

===Human populations===
In various places around the world, minority [[ethnic group]]s represent lineages of ancient [[human migration]]s in places now occupied by more populous ethnic groups, whose ancestors arrived later. For example, the first human groups to inhabit the Caribbean islands were [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes from South and Central America. Genetic testing of natives of Cuba show that, in late pre-Columbian times, the island was home to agriculturalists of [[Taíno people|Taino]] ethnicity. In addition, a relict population of the original hunter-gatherers remained in western Cuba as the [[Ciboney people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory'''''  is a 2000 non-fiction book by the British political theorist [[Bhikhu Parekh]] and published by [[Harvard University Press]]. It creates and defines [[multiculturalism]] in the form of political theory as well as political practice in the modern era, being based on Parekh's experience of Multiculturalism in British society as well as other areas around the world. Parekh's book addresses several topics, primarily multicultural politics, as well as the practice and theory behind addressing these politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-01-01|title=Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory (2000) by Bhikhu Parekh|url=http://culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewArticle/228/209|journal=Culture Machine|volume=1|issn=1465-4121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==
[[Bhikhu Parekh]] is a political theorist who received his PHD at the [[London School of Economics|London School of economics]]. He has taught at University of Glasgow, University of Hull, as well as the [[University of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613173042/http://www.bombaybar.com/lectures/justice_kt_desai_memorial_lecture_2009_lord_bhikhu_parekh.php|title=Bombay Bar Association: Justice KT Desai Memorial Lecture 2009: Lord Bhikhu Parekh-The Constitution and Challenges to India's Unity|date=2010-06-13|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parekh has hands on experience with multiculturalism, as he participated in several issues of multiculturalism in the UK, with a notable position as Chairman on the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A large amount of debate in the UK on multiculturalism stems from Parekh’s work in the early 2000s on while he was Chairman. Charles Taylor addresses that Parekh’s experiences gives him a stronger sense of possible situations and problems in a modern atmosphere.

== Synopsis ==
Culture is the belief or view human beings create regarding the significance of human life, and in close proximity different views and sets of beliefs are created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kvc.minbuza.nl/uk/archive/commentary/parekh.html|title=The Power of Culture - Bhikhu Parekh : A Commitment to Cultural Pluralism|website=kvc.minbuza.nl|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the text, Parekh approaches cultural diversity as a value, not a fact in Britain’s diverse environment. Parekh writes about the dangers of avoiding ignoring diversity as well as if diversity is over addressed. analysis of culture, Montesquieu, Vico, and Herder.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldfarb|first=Jeffrey C.|date=2002-11-01|title=Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory by Bhikhu Parekh|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=726–728|doi=10.1086/378450|issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this analysis, other theorists approach culture in a sense that is too contained, as Parekh believes culture changes on a larger scale.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-01-01|title=Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory (2000) by Bhikhu Parekh|url=http://culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewArticle/228/209|journal=Culture Machine|volume=1|issn=1465-4121}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed Parekh is influenced by Charles Taylor’s essay on multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Much like Taylor, Parekh focuses avoiding ignoring several aspects of multicultural values including but not limited to education, separation and gender values.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Parekh criticizes theorists who over invest in a eurocentric view, and success relies on an equal distribution of political and economic power rather than a minority and majority.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lit.polylog.org/3/rcd-en.htm|title=Cultural Diversity and Dialogue.

Individuals who carry their own culture disturb relationships of power that in return culture has previously been established In.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In later chapters Parekh also addresses separation of church and state will never entirely justify the separation of religion and politics, as religion represents so many citizens of most countries and in the world as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modood|first=Tariq|date=June 2001|title=Their Liberalism and Our Multiculturalism?|journal=The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=245–257|doi=10.1111/1467-856x.00059|issn=1369-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory'' has been reviewed by several political and cultural authors. While some criticism was addressed, the overall reception of Parekh’s work’s is positive as he attempted to remain unbiased and neutral when writing about multiculturalism. Dortha Kolodziejczyk overall acclaims it to be insightful for addressing typically unthought of issues, accrediting it to Parekh’s way of thoroughly addressing both sides of the issues.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Parekh's text was criticized from other cultural authors based on his opinions in the book. Many accused the text of having no real world use, and only theory to back it up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The text has few supported conclusions supported by real life scenarios. Other disagreement stems from Parekh's inability to address concepts of democracy, liberalism, citizenship and nation being from anywhere other than western politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One cultural author Dortha Kolodziejczyk commented on Parekh’s obsession of maintaining a non western approach to liberalism and culture while cementing liberalism as western. Kolodziejcyk says that many of Parekh’s ideas do attempt to bring new ideas and perspectives, but not all of them in practice will work the way he intends.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A '''school voucher''', also called an '''education voucher''', in a '''voucher system''', is a certificate of government funding for a student at a school chosen by the student or the student's parents. The funding is usually for a particular year, term or semester. In some countries, states or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse [[home schooling]] expenses. In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lagrangenews.com/2017/02/02/if-appointed-betsy-devos-views-likely-to-affect-public-private-schools/|title=If appointed, Betsy DeVos’ views likely to affect public, private schools {{!}} LaGrange Daily News|website=www.lagrangenews.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 review of the economics literature on school vouchers, "the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis; however, multiple positive findings support continued exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epple|first=Dennis|last2=Romano|first2=Richard E.|last3=Urquiola|first3=Miguel|title=School Vouchers: A Survey of the Economics Literature |journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=55|issue=2|pages=441–492|doi=10.1257/jel.20150679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 survey of members of [[American Economic Association]] found that over two-thirds of economists support giving parents educational vouchers that can be used at government-operated or privately operated schools, and that support is greater if the vouchers are to be used by parents with low-incomes or parents with children in poorly performing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Whaples|first1=Robert|publisher=[[The Economists' Voice]]|volume=3|issue=9|pages=1–6|url=http://ew-econ.typepad.fr/articleAEAsurvey.pdf|title=Do Economists Agree on Anything?

==History==
France lost the Franco-Prussian War and many blamed the loss on France's inferior military education system. Following the defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the French assembly proposed a religious voucher that would hopefully improve schools by allowing students to seek out the best school. This proposal never moved forward due to the reluctance of the French to subsidize religious education. Despite its failure, this proposal is one of the earliest examples of a voucher system that closely resembles voucher systems proposed and used today in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, Alex. Vouchers, Class Size Reduction, and Student Achievement: Considering the Evidence. Bloomington: Phi Beta Kappa Educational Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest continuing school voucher programs existing today in the United States are the Town Tuitioning programs in Vermont&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/programs/vermont-town-tuitioning-program/|title=Vermont - Town Tuitioning Program|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/programs/maine-town-tuitioning-program/|title=Maine - Town Tuitioning Program|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 1869&lt;ref name=Vermont&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=32|title=Friedman Foundation - Vermont: Town Tuitioning Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1873&lt;ref name=maine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/schoolchoice/ShowProgramItem.do?id=23|title=Friedman Foundation - Maine: Town Tuitioning Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, students in these towns "are eligible for a voucher to attend [either] public schools in other towns or non-religious private schools. In these cases, the 'sending' towns pay tuition directly to the 'receiving' schools."&lt;ref name=Vermont/&gt;&lt;ref name=maine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/school-choice-vouchers.aspx|title=School Choice: Vouchers|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disputed section|http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/school-choice-vouchers.aspx|date=January 2017}} A system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. Today, more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines.&lt;ref name="RDV 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=16 |issue=3 |date=June 1997 |pages=329–335 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7757(96)00078-7 |title=School finance and school choice in the Netherlands |author=Jozef M.

[[Milton Friedman]] argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Friedman | first = Milton | editor-last= Solo | editor-first= Robert A. | title = "The Role of Government in Education," as printed in the book Economics and the Public Interest | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1955 | pages = 123–144 | url = http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEEFriedmanRoleOfGovttable.pdf | access-date = February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that competition would improve schools, cost less and yield superior educational outcomes.  Friedman's reasoning in favor of vouchers gained additional attention in 1980 with the broadcast of his ten part television series ''[[Free to Choose]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Milton Friedman | title = "Free to Choose TV" (website where all ten episodes may be accessed via on-demand video streaming) | medium = Television | publisher = Public Broadcasting Service | year = 1980 | url = http://www.freetochoose.tv/broadcasts/ftc80.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of its companion book of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Milton | last2 = Friedman | first2 = Rose | title = Free to Choose: A Personal Statement | publisher = Harcourt Brace &amp; Company | edition = 1990 | year = 1980 | isbn = 0156334607}}&lt;/ref&gt; (co-written with his wife [[Rose Friedman]], who was also an economist). Episode 6 of the series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Milton Friedman | title = "Free to Choose," Episode 6, "What's Wrong with Our Schools?" | medium = Television | publisher = Public Broadcasting Service | year = 1980 | url = http://www.freetochoose.tv/program.php?id=ftc1980_6&amp;series=ftc80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chapter 6 of the book were both entitled, "What's Wrong with Our Schools?" and asserted that permitting parents and students to use vouchers to [[School choice|choose their schools]] would expand freedom of choice and produce more well-educated students.

In some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a way to perpetuate segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. The vouchers, then known as tuition grants, in many cases, were only good at privately segregated schools, known as [[segregation academies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vergakis |first=Brock |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660226540,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News - Do vouchers equal segregation? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Allah Bakhsh Malik|Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik]] Managing Director Punjab Education Foundation, under the supervision of Professor Henry M. Levin introduced Education Vouchers scheme in Pakistan with the features of equity, productivity, social cohesion and freedom of choice.

==Definitions==
There are important distinctions between different kinds of schools:
* [[State school|Public schools]] operate publicly and are funded by [[taxation|taxes]].
* [[Private school]]s operate privately and are funded privately, such as by [[tuition]] or donations.
* '''School vouchers''' are subsidies given directly to parents for tuition at any school
* [[Charter school]]s are funded publicly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscharterschools.org |title=US Charter Schools Home |publisher=Uscharterschools.org |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is a Charter School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/3 |title=What is a Charter School? |publisher=Public School Review |date=December 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISR&gt;{{cite journal

Those funds, often distributed to families via debit card, can cover private school tuition and fees, online learning programs, private tutoring, community college costs, higher education expenses and other approved customized learning services and materials.

==School voucher economics==

===Background===
Education as a tool for human capital accumulation is often crucial to the development and progression of societies and thus governments have large incentives to continually intervene and improve public education.&lt;ref&gt;Freire-Seren, Maria Jesus. "Human Capital Accumulation and Economic Growth". ''Investigaciones Economicas'' 25, no. 3 (2001):585-602.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, education is often the tool with which societies instill a common set of values that underlie the basic norms of the society. Furthermore, there are positive externalities to society from education. These positive externalities can be in the form of reduced crime, more informed citizens and economic development, known as the neighborhood effect.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Walter. "Externalities in Education." ''Bureau of Economic and Business Research'' Working Paper, no. 877 (1982):1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economic theory, families face a bundle of consumption choices that determine how much they will spend on education and private consumption. Any number of consumption bundles are available as long as they fit within the  budget constraint. Meaning that any bundle of consumption of education and private consumption must not exceed budgetary constraints. Indifference curves represent the preferences of one good over another. The indifference curve determines how much education an individual will want to consume versus how much private consumption an individual will want to consume.&lt;ref name="Gruber, Jonathan 2015"&gt;Gruber, Jonathan.''Public Finance and Public Policy, 5th edition''. London: Worth Publishers, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Education Consumption Choices.png|thumb|Education Consumption Choices]]

Government intervention in education typically takes two forms. The first approach can be broad, such as instituting charter schools, magnet schools, or for-profit schools and increasing competition. The second approach can be individually focused such as providing subsidies or loans for individuals to attend college or school vouchers for K-12.&lt;ref name="Gruber, Jonathan 2015"/&gt;

[[File:Voucher Consumption Bundles 2.png|thumb|Family consumption bundles with vouchers]]

Vouchers are typically instituted for 2 broad economic reasons.&lt;ref name="Gruber, Jonathan 2015"/&gt;  The first reason is consumer sovereignty. A family can choose to where their child goes to school and pick the school that is closest to their preference of education provider.

The second reason is vouchers are proposed to increase market competition amongst schools. Similar to the free market theorem, vouchers hope to make schools more competitive while lowering costs for schools and increasing the educational quality for consumers, the families.

In many instances where school voucher programs have been instituted, there have been mixed results, with some programs showing increased benefits of school vouchers and some instances showing detrimental effects.

===Positive and negative effects of school vouchers===

====Positive effects====

In the United States, vouchers are usually funded with state dollars, and in other countries, through a variety of government funding vehicles. It is important to note that schools in the United States retain their federal and local funding regardless of enrollment- only state funding is dependent on enrollment size.&lt;ref name="edchoice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edchoice.org/blog/how-to-accurately-calculate-the-fiscal-impact-of-school-voucher-programs/|last=Leuken|first=Martin|title=How to Accurately Calculate the Fiscal Impact of School Voucher Programs|publisher=''EdChoice''|date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of improving student performance involves improving teacher and school performance. In theory, more school vouchers would prompt the formation of more private schools which will give parents more choice in school. This increased competition would make both the private and public schools, who are both competing for the voucher funds, maintain a high-quality of teaching as well as keeping costs low. 
Indeed, there is evidence that school vouchers result in cost savings for school systems. A fiscal analysis of Indiana's school voucher system showed annual savings, per student, for the state government.&lt;ref name="edchoice.org"/&gt;

Proponents of voucher schools argue that there is evidence of multiple benefits for students and families because of school vouchers. There is evidence to show that the use of school vouchers results in increased test scores and higher high school graduation rates for students. A case study in the country of Colombia showed that the presence of voucher programs resulted in an increase of 10 percentage points in a child's likelihood of finishing the 8th grade and showed a 0.2 standard deviations increase in achievement on standardized tests.&lt;ref name="Angrist 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angrist |first=Joshua |first2=Eric |last2=Bettinger |first3=Erik |last3=Bloom |first4=Elizabeth |last4=King |first5=Michael |last5=Kremer |display-authors=1 |title=Vouchers for Private Schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=5 |year=2002 |pages=1535–1558 |doi=10.1257/000282802762024629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, evidence shows that African Americans experience increased college enrollment rates under voucher programs.&lt;ref&gt;Chingos, Matthew and Paul Peterson. “The Effects of School Vouchers on College Enrollment: Experimental Evidence from New York City.” Brookings Institution, Brown Center on Education Policy, August 2012, http://paulepeterson.org/sites/default/files/Impacts_of_School_Vouchers_FINAL.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that these gains for African American students are not present for other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, Patrick J. “The Potential Impact of Vouchers.” Peabody Journal of Education 79, no. 3 (2004): 57-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also shown spatial benefits of voucher system. Public schools, which are near private schools that accept vouchers, often have better test scores than other public schools not near voucher ready private schools.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jay and Marcus Winters. “When School’s Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement.” Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, no 2 (2003), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research by Caroline Hoxby shows that when voucher systems are available, both the public and private schools in that school system have increased test scores and graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Hoxby, Caroline. “Rising Tide.” Education Next 1, no. 4 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative effects====

While there are some studies that show the positive effects of voucher programs, there is also research that shows the ineffectiveness of school vouchers. There have been some recent case studies showing that in voucher system school districts, students attending the public school, as opposed to the private school with a voucher, tend to outperform their private school peers.&lt;ref&gt;“Voucher Research Brief.” Public Policy Forum 102, no. 1(2014): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides general lack of results, critics of school vouchers argue that vouchers will lead to segregation. Empirical studies show that there is some evidence that school vouchers can lead to racial or income segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brunner |first=Eric J. |first2=Jennifer |last2=Imazeki |first3=Stephen L. |last3=Ross |display-authors=1 |title=Universal Vouchers and Racial and Ethnic Segregation |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |year=2010 |pages=912–927 |doi=10.1162/REST_a_00037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However research on this topic is inconclusive, as there is also valid research that shows under certain circumstances, income and racial segregation can be reduced indirectly by increasing school choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nechyba |first=Thomas |title=School Finance, spatial income segregation, and the nature of communities |journal=Journal of Urban Economics |volume=54 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=61–88 |doi=10.1016/S0094-1190(03)00041-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, since school vouchers are funded by the government, the implementation could cause the funds for public schools to be reduced. Private-school vouchers affect government budgets through two channels: additional direct voucher expenditures, and public-school cost savings from lower enrollments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2017/12/the-fiscal-effect-of-private-school-vouchers|title=The Fiscal Effect of Private-School Vouchers - Analysis - United States Joint Economic Committee|last=Committee|first=United States Joint Economic|website=www.jec.senate.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voucher programs would be paid for by the government's education budget, which would be subtracted from the public school's budget. This might affect the public-school system by giving them less to spend and use for their student's education.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study by Abdulkadiroğlu et al. found that disadvantaged students who won a lottery (the Louisiana Scholarship Program) to get vouchers to attend private schools had worse education outcomes than disadvantaged students who did not win vouchers: "LSP participation lowers math scores by 0.4 standard deviations and also reduces achievement in reading, science, and social studies. These effects may be due in part to selection of low-quality private schools into the program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdulkadiroğlu|first=Atila|last2=Pathak|first2=Parag A.|last3=Walters|first3=Christopher R.|date=2018|title=Free to Choose: Can School Choice Reduce Student Achievement? |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=10|issue=1|pages=175–206|doi=10.1257/app.20160634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==

===Colombia===
The PACES voucher program was established by the [[Colombian government]] in late 1991. It aimed to assist low-income households by distributing school vouchers to students living in neighborhoods situated in the two lowest socioeconomic strata. Between 1991 and 1997, the PACES program awarded 125,000 vouchers to lower-income [[secondary school]] students. Those vouchers were worth about US $190 in 1998, and data shows that matriculation fees and other monthly expenses incurred by voucher students attending [[Private school|private schools]] averaged about US $340 in 1998, so a majority of voucher recipients supplemented the voucher with personal funds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Angrist |first=Joshua |last2=Bettinger |first2=Eric |last3=Kremer |first3=Michael |title=Long-Term Consequences of Secondary School Vouchers: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2006 |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=847–862 |doi=10.1257/aer.96.3.847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:School Voucher Diagram.svg|thumb|Basic School Voucher Utility Maximization Picture]]
The students selected to be in the program were selected by lottery. The vouchers were able to be renewed annually, conditional on students achieving satisfactory academic success as indicated by scheduled grade promotion. The program also included incentives to study harder as well as widening schooling options.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Empirical evidence showed that the program had some success. Joshua Angrist shows that after 3 years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to attend private school and complete .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished the 8th grade.&lt;ref name="Angrist 2002" /&gt;The study also reported that there were larger voucher effects for boys than for girls, especially in mathematics performance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is important to note that the program did not have a significant impact on dropout rates. Angrist reports that lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. The voucher program also reported some social effects. Lottery winners worked less on average than non-lottery winners. Angrist reports that this was correlated with a decreased likelihood to marry or cohabit as teenagers.&lt;ref name="Angrist 2002" /&gt; In general, the school voucher program's benefits outweighed the costs.

===Chile===
In 1981, [[Chile]] implemented a universal school voucher system for both elementary and secondary school students. As a result, over 1,000 private schools entered the market, and private enrollment increased by 20-40% by 1998, surpassing 50% in some urban areas.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Chang-Tai |last2=Urquiola |first2=Miguel |title=The effects of generalized school choice on achievement and stratification: Evidence from Chile's voucher program |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=90 |issue=8–9 |year=2006 |pages=1477–1503 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1981 to 1988, the private school enrollment rate in urban areas grew 11% more than the private school enrollment rate in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This change coincided with the transfer of public school administration from the [[central government]] to local municipalities. The financial value of a voucher didn’t depend on the income of the family receiving it, and the program allowed private voucher schools to be selective, while [[State school|public schools]] had to accept and enroll every interested student. At the turn of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, student achievement in Chile was low compared to students in other nations based on international test-scores. This disparity led to the Chilean government enacting substantial educational reforms in 2008, including major changes in the school voucher system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murnane |first=Richard J. |last2=Waldman |first2=Marcus R. |last3=Willett |first3=John B. |last4=Bos |first4=Maria Soledad |last5=Vegas |first5=Emiliana |date=June 2017 |title=The Consequences of Educational Voucher Reform in Chile |work=NBER Working Paper No. 23550 |doi=10.3386/w23550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean government passed the Preferential School Subsidy Law (SEP) in January 2008. This piece of legislation made the educational voucher system much more like the regulated compensatory model championed by [[Christopher Jencks]]. Under SEP, the voucher system was altered to take family incomes into account. The vouchers provided to “priority students,” students whose family income was in the bottom 40% of Chileans in were worth 50% more than those given to the families of students in the upper 60%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Schools with larger numbers of priority students were eligible to receive per-student bonuses, the size of which was tied to the percentage of priority students in the student body. When SEP was started, it covered preschool to fourth grade, and an additional school-year of coverage was added each subsequent year. Almost every public school chose to participate in SEP in 2008, as well as almost two-thirds of private subsidized elementary schools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There were three important requirements attached to the program. The first requirement stipulated that participating schools could not charge fees to priority students, although private schools in the voucher system could do so for non-priority students. The second requirement ensured that schools could not select students based on their academic ability, not expel them on academic grounds. The third requirement postulated that schools had to self-enroll themselves in an accountability system that ensured that schools were responsible for the utilization of financial resources and student test scores.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Europe===
In most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g. Belgium or France), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.

====Ireland====
{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
Most schools in Ireland are state-aided parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers salaries and a per head fee paid to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?maincat=&amp;pcategory=17216&amp;ecategory=20658&amp;sectionpage=12251&amp;language=EN&amp;link=link001&amp;page=1&amp;doc=18626 |title=Irish Government Department of Education website |publisher=Education.ie |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are given to the school regardless of whether or not it requires its students to pay fees. (Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive with opponents claiming this gives them an unfair advantage.)

There is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents, which are organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own school. In the event of a school failing to attract students it immediately loses its per-head fee and over time loses its teaching posts – and teachers are moved to other schools which are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/44/38574871.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Irish report 02_04_07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995–7 Rainbow Coalition (which contained parties of the centre right and the left) introduced free third-level education to primary degree level. Critics of the latter development charge that it has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the number of students overall and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This concurs with evidence from the UK of a decrease in attendance numbers after the introduction of fees. However, since the economic crisis, there has been extensive talk and debate regarding the reintroduction of third-level fees.

====Sweden====
{{Further information|Education in Sweden}}
In [[Sweden]], a system of school vouchers (called ''skolpeng'') was introduced in 1992 at primary and secondary school level, enabling free choice among publicly run schools and privately run ''friskolor'' ("free schools"). The voucher is paid with public funds from the local [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] (''kommun'') directly to a school based solely on its number of students. Both public schools and free schools are funded the same way. Free schools can be run by not-for-profit groups as well as by for-profit companies, but may not charge top-up fees or select students other than on a first-come, first-served basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Choice Revolution: Privatization of Swedish Welfare Services in the 1990s |first=Paula|last=Blomqvist |journal=Social Policy &amp; Administration |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139–155 |date=April 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00382.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in free schools in 2008 and the number is growing fast, leading the country to be viewed as a pioneer of the model.&lt;ref name="swedishmodeleconomist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11535645|title=Making money from schools: The Swedish model|publisher=The Economist | date=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Spectator|year=2008|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/526631/made-in-sweden-the-new-tory-education-revolution.thtml|title=Made in Sweden: the new Tory education revolution|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627082940/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/526631/made-in-sweden-the-new-tory-education-revolution.thtml|archivedate=June 27, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3717744.stm|title=Swedish parents enjoy school choice | location=London | date=October 5, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Mike | last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Washington Times|year=2008|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/11/embracing-private-schools/|title=Embracing private schools: Sweden lets companies use taxes for cost-efficient alternatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435386/How-choice-has-transformed-education-in-Sweden.html|title=How choice has transformed education in Sweden | location=London | first=Johnny | last=Munkhammar | date=May 25, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Per Unckel]], governor of Stockholm and former Minister of Education, has promoted the system, saying "Education is so important that you can’t just leave it to one producer, because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes." The Swedish system has been recommended to [[Barack Obama]] by some commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2009/03/15/opinion/1194838660912/sweden-s-choice.html|title=Sweden’s Choice: Why the Obama Administration Should Look to Europe for a School Voucher Program that Works|author=Lance T.

A 2004 study concluded that school results in public schools improved due to the increased competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=School vouchers in practice: competition will not hurt you |first1=F.

Though Rachel Wolf, director of the New Schools Network, has suggested that Sweden's education standards had slipped for reasons other than as a result of free schools.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/feb/09/swedish-style-schools-wont-raise-standards | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Swedish-style 'free schools won't improve standards' | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd | date=February 9, 2010 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
A voucher system for children three to six years-old who attend a non-profit [[kindergarten]] was implemented in [[Hong Kong]] in 2007. Each child will get HK$13,000 per year. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts. $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in Education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose non-profit schools with a yearly fee less than $24,000. The government hoped that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an Education certificate by the year 2011–12, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16,000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee.

[[Milton Friedman]] criticised the system, saying "I do not believe that [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|CE]] Mr. Tsang's proposal is properly structured." He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive market place so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. &lt;!--source: ming pao news

After protests by parents with children enrolled in for profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for- profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non profit.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistani Punjab, the Education Voucher Scheme (EVS) was introduced by Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik Managing Director and Chief Executive of Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), especially in urban slums and poorest of the poor in 2005. The initial study was sponsored by Open Society Institute New York USA. Professor Henry M. Levin extended Pro-Bono services for children of poor families from Punjab. To ensure educational justice and integration, the government must ensure that the poorest families have equal access to quality education. The voucher scheme was designed by the Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Open Society Institute. It aims to promote freedom of choice, efficiency, equity, and social cohesion.

A pilot project was started in 2006 in the urban slums of Sukhnehar, Lahore, where a survey showed that all households lived below the poverty line. Through the EVS, the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children 5–13 years of age. The vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. In the pilot stage, 1,053 households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. The EVS makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education. In the FAS program, every school principal has the choice to admit a student or not. However, in the EVS, a school cannot refuse a student if the student has a voucher and the family has chosen that school. The partner schools are also accountable to the PEF: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes, additional private investments, and improvements in working conditions of the teachers. The EVS provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school, and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program.

When it comes to the selection of schools, the following criteria are applied across the board: (i) The fee paid by the PEF to EVS partner schools is PKR 300 per child per month. Schools charging higher fees can also apply to the program, but they will not be paid more than PKR 450, and they will not be entitled to charge the difference to students’ families. (ii) Total school enrollment should be between 100 and 500 children.  (iii) The school should have an adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. (iv) EVS partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. However, if the parents prefer a particular school farther away, the PEF will not object, provided that the school fulfills the EVS selection criteria. (v) The PEF advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. It then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects, and conducts physical inspections of these schools. PEF offices display a list of all the EVS partner schools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children.

By now more than 140, 000 students are benefiting from EVS and the program is being scaled up by financing from Government of Punjab.

==School voucher public policy in the United States==

In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education-reform proposals leading up to the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. As of December 2016, 14 states had traditional school voucher programs. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/interactive-guide-to-school-choice.aspx#/|title=Interactive Guide to School Choice Laws|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states consist of: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The capital of the United States, [[Washington, D.C.]], also had operating school voucher programs as of December 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  When including scholarship tax credits and education savings accounts – two alternatives to vouchers – there are 27 states plus the District of Columbia with private school choice programs. Most of these programs were offered to students in low-income families, low performing schools, or students with disabilities. By 2014, the number participating in either vouchers or tax-credit scholarships increased to 250,000, a 30% increase from 2010, but still a small fraction compared to the 55 million in traditional schools.&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephanie|first1=Simon|title=Special report: Taxpayers fund creationism in the classroom|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/education-creationism-104934.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s [[Milwaukee Public Schools|public schools]] were the first to offer vouchers and has nearly 15,000 students using vouchers as of 2011. The program, entitled the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, originally funded school vouchers for nonreligious, private institutions. It was, however, eventually expanded to include private, religious institutions after it saw success with nonreligious, private institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, D. d., &amp; Cowen, o. j. (2015). School Vouchers and Student Neighborhoods: Evidence from the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. ''Education Policy Analysis Archives'', ''23''(60/61), 1-24. doi:10.14507/epaa.v23.1930&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006/07 school year marked the first time in Milwaukee that more than $100 million was paid in vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=533306|title=Vouchers to Pass $100 Million Mark, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 21, 2006|accessdate=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-six percent of Milwaukee students will receive public funding to attend schools outside the traditional Milwaukee Public School system. In fact, if the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin.  [[St. Anthony High School (Milwaukee)|St. Anthony Catholic School]], located on Milwaukee's south side, boasts 966 voucher students, meaning that it very likely receives more public money for general school support of a parochial elementary or high school than any before it in American history. A 2013 study of Milwaukee's program posited that the use of vouchers increased the probability that a student would graduate from high school, go to college, and stay in college.&lt;ref name=EdWeek&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/vouchers/|title = Vouchers|last = |first = |date = August 11, 2011|work = Education Week|access-date = July 17, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 paper published by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] found that participation in Louisiana's voucher program “substantially reduces academic achievement” although that the result may be reflective of the poor quality of private schools in the program.&lt;ref name=EdWeek /&gt;

Recent analysis of the competitive effects of school vouchers in Florida suggests that more competition improves performance in the regular public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Figlio |first2=Cassandra M. D. |last2=Hart |year=2014 |title=Competitive Effects of Means-Tested School Vouchers |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=133–56 |doi=10.1257/app.6.1.133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest school voucher program in the United States is Indiana's [[Indiana Choice Scholarships]] program.

===Proponents===
Proponents of school voucher and education tax credit systems argue that those systems promote [[free market]] competition among both private and public schools by allowing parents and students to choose the school where to use the vouchers. This choice available to parents forces schools to perpetually improve in order to maintain enrollment. Thus, proponents argue that a voucher system increases school performance and accountability&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/media/2349/Roads-Education-and-Waterways-The-Case-Against-Public-Services&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides [[consumer sovereignty]] – allowing individuals to choose what product to buy, as opposed to a [[Public administration|bureaucracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ingrimayne.com/econ/AllocatingRationing/DollarVoting.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ingrimayne.com/econ/government/MajorityRule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument is supported by studies such as "When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement" ([[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford's [[Caroline Hoxby]], who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts.&lt;ref name="hoxby1998"/&gt; Hoxby studied the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools. Public schools forced to compete made greater test-score gains than schools not faced with such competition,&lt;ref name="hoxby2001"/&gt; and that the so-called effect of [[cream skimming]] did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby's research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers.&lt;ref name="hoxby1998"&gt;Hoxby, Caroline "Analyzing School Choice Reforms that Use America's Traditional Forms of Parental Choice" in Paul E. Peterson and Bryan C. Hassel eds., Learning from School Choice, Brookings Institution, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoxby2001"&gt;Hoxby, Caroline, "Rising Tide" Education Next, Winter, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ewp_02.htm |title=Education Working Paper 2 &amp;#124; When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement |publisher=Manhattan-institute.org |date=March 14, 2001 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chap06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf |title=chap06.choice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809100251/http://www.allianceforschoolchoice.org/UploadedFiles/ResearchResources/Competition-%20Hoxby.pdf |archive-date=August 9, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, similar competition has helped in manufacturing, energy, transportation, and parcel postal ([[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx]] vs. [[USPS]]) sectors of government that have been [[Socialism|socialized]] and later opened up to free market competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=2237]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/713.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081022232722/http://lexingtoninstitute.org/713.shtml |date=October 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is argued that such competition has helped in higher education, with publicly funded universities directly competing with private universities for tuition money provided by the Government, such as the [[GI Bill]] and the [[Pell Grant]] in the United States. The [[Foundation for Educational Choice]] alleges that a school voucher plan "embodies exactly the same principle as the GI bills that provide for educational benefits to military veterans. The veteran gets a voucher good only for educational expense and he is completely free to choose the school at which he uses it, provided that it satisfies certain standards."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edchoice.org/The-Friedmans/The-Friedmans-on-School-Choice/What-s-Wrong-with-Our-Schools-.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Pell Grant, a need-based aid, like the Voucher, can only be used for authorized school expenses at qualified schools, and, like the Pell, the money follows the student, for use against those authorized expenses (not all expenses are covered).&lt;ref name="PELL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Pell Grants are usually awarded only to undergraduate students. |url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HowCalculated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wondering how the amount of your federal student aid is determined? |url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/how-calculated |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents are encouraged by private school sector growth, as they believe that private schools are typically more efficient at achieving results at a much lower per-pupil cost than public schools. A [[CATO Institute]] study of public and private school per pupil spending in Phoenix, Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, New York City, and Houston found that public schools spend 93% more than estimated median private schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | last=Schaeffer | first=Adam | title=They Spend WHAT? (The Real Cost of Public Schools) | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11432 | publisher=Cato Institute | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents claim that institutions often are forced to operate more efficiently when they are made to compete&lt;ref name=chap06/&gt; and that any resulting job losses in the public sector would be offset by the increased demand for jobs in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=284]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich von Hayek]] on the privatizing of education:

{{quote|As has been shown by Professor Milton Friedman (M. Friedman, The role of government in education, 1955), it would now be entirely practicable to defray the costs of general education out of the public purse without maintaining government schools, by giving the parents vouchers covering the cost of education of each child which they could hand over to schools of their choice. It may still be desirable that government directly provide schools in a few isolated communities where the number of children is too small (and the average cost of education therefore too high) for privately run schools. But with respect to the great majority of the population, it would undoubtedly be possible to leave the organization and management of education entirely to private efforts, with the government providing merely the basic finance and ensuring a minimum standard for all schools where the vouchers could be spent. (F. A. Hayek, in his 1960 book [[The Constitution of Liberty]], section 24.3)}}

{{quote|
The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.

I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers – so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.

If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, "Let's start a school."
|sign=[[Steve Jobs]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a practical matter, proponents note, most U.S. programs only offer poor families the same choice more affluent families already have, by providing them with the means to leave a failing school and attend one where the child can get an education. Because public schools are funded on a per-pupil basis, the money simply follows the child, but the cost to taxpayers is less because the voucher generally is less than the actual cost.

In addition, they say, the comparisons of public and private schools on average are meaningless. Vouchers usually are utilized by children in failing schools, so they can hardly be worse off even if the parents fail to choose a better school. Also, focusing on the effect on the public school suggests that is more important than the education of children.

Some proponents of school vouchers, including the Sutherland Institute and many supporters of the Utah voucher effort, see it as a remedy for the negative cultural impact caused by under-performing public schools, which falls disproportionately on demographic minorities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} During the run-up to the November referendum election, Sutherland issued a controversial publication:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/vouchersvows.pdf |title=Sutherland Institute &amp;#124; Vouchers Vows &amp; Vexations |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728075042/http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/vouchersvows.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voucher, Vows, &amp; Vexations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695210997,00.html |title=Deseret Morning News &amp;#124; Voucher foe in 'lion's den'? |publisher=Deseretnews.com |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutherland called the publication an important review of the history of education in Utah, while critics just called it revisionist history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&amp;id=274 The Sutherland Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217202856/http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/news/news_details.asp?c=1&amp;id=274 |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sutherland then released a companion article in a law journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |title=Removing Classrooms from the Battlefield: Liberty, Paternalism, and the Redemptive Promise of Educational Choice, 2008 BYU Law Review 377 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5noKmGSvh?url=http://www.sutherlandinstitute.org/uploads/lawreview2008witte.pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an academic conference about school choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm Law School Conference on School Choice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155328/http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2008_2.htm |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EdChoice]], founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a non-profit organization that promotes universal school vouchers and other forms of school choice. In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/friedman/downloadFile.do?id=255 |title=Forster, Greg.

[[EdChoice]] also argues that education funding should belong to children, not a specific school type or building.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edchoice.org/blog/arguments-for-and-against-school-choice-2017/|title=Arguments For and Against School Choice in 2017|date=2017-07-27|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their purpose for the argument is to try to argue that people should prioritize a student's education and their opportunity over making a specific type of school better. They also emphasize that if a family chooses a public school, the funds also go to that school.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This would mean that it would also benefit those who value the public education system.

===Opponents===
The main critique of school vouchers and education tax credits is that they put public education in competition with private education, threatening to reduce and reallocate public school funding to private schools. Opponents question the belief that private schools are more efficient.

Public school teachers and teacher unions have also fought against school vouchers. In the United States, public school teacher unions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bender |first=Michael C. |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2008/06/13/0613constitutionalamendments.html |title=Local News: West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Martin &amp; St. Lucie Counties |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=June 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the [[National Education Association]] (the largest labor union in the USA), argue that school vouchers erode educational standards and reduce funding, and that giving money to parents who choose to send their child to a religious or other school is unconstitutional. The latter issue was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', which upheld Ohio's voucher plan in a 5-4 ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/1661/Getting-an-Education-VOUCHER-CONTROVERSY.html |title=Getting an Education - The Voucher Controversy - School, Public, Schools, Charter, Private, and Vouchers |publisher=Libraryindex.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16378.htm |title=Vouchers |publisher=NEA |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/19133.htm |title=List of NEA beliefs and legal fights against vouchers |publisher=Nea.org |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the use of public school funding for vouchers to private schools was disallowed by the Louisiana Supreme Court in 2013. The Louisiana Supreme Court did not declare vouchers unconstitutional, just the use of money earmarked for public schools via the Louisiana Constitution for funding Louisiana's voucher program.&lt;ref&gt;See Strauss, V. (May 7, 2013). Louisiana Supreme Court rules school voucher funding unconstitutional. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/05/07/louisiana-supreme-court-rules-school-voucher-funding-unconstitutional/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Education Association]] also points out that access to vouchers is just like “a chance in a lottery” where parents had to be lucky in order to get a space in this program. Since almost all students and their families would like to choose the best schools, those schools, as a result, quickly reach its maximum capacity number for students that state law permits. Those who did not get vouchers then have to compete again to look for some other less preferred and competitive schools or give up searching and go back to their assigned local schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pons|first=Michael|title=School Vouchers: The Emerging Track Record|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16970.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kozol]], a prominent public school reform thinker and former public school teacher called vouchers the "single worst, most dangerous idea to have entered education discourse in my adult life".&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kaiser, "[http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-5728-an-interview-with-educator-and-activist-jonathan-kozol.html An Interview with Educator and Activist Jonathan Kozol]", March 4, 2009, Express Milwaukee.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Education Association]] additionally argues that more money should go towards the [[Public Education]] to help the schools struggling and improve the schools overall, instead of reducing the public school's fund to go towards school vouchers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/19133.htm|title=The Case Against Vouchers|work=NEA|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their argument claims that increasing that amount of money that goes towards public education would also increase the amount of resources put into public schools, therefore, improving the education.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This argument made towards school vouchers reflect the way the organization values public education. For example, in an interview in May 2017 regarding [[Donald Trump]]'s 2018 Budget Proposal, the organization's president, [[Lily Eskelsen García]], claimed:

“We should invest in what makes schools great, the things that build curiosity and instill a love of learning. That is what every student deserves and what every parent wants for his or her child. It should not depend on how much their parents make, what language they speak at home, and certainly, not what neighborhood they live in.” -[[National Education Association]] President [[Lily Eskelsen García]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/70780.htm|title=NEA President: Trump-DeVos budget is a wrecking ball aimed at public schools|work=NEA|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there are multiple studies that support the arguments made by opponents of school vouchers. One of these studies, conducted by the [[Tulane University]]’s Education Research Alliance, consists of observing the relationship between voucher programs and student’s test scores. They found that students in the Louisiana voucher program initially had lower test scores, but after three years, their scores matched those of students who stayed in public schools from standardized test scores spanning from 2012 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4832923/betsy-devos-trump-administration-school-choice-vouchers/|title=Here's Why Researchers Say Betsy DeVos' Proposed School Voucher Program Won't Work|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who can benefit from vouchers may not know it. In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools. A student whose household income was low (up to about $44,000 for a family of three) who attended a school ranked "C", "D", or "F" could apply for vouchers to attend another school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisianaweekly.com/voucher-bills-pass/ See Tidmore, C. (2012, April 10).  Voucher bill passes]&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the estimated 380,000&lt;ref&gt;See Mooney, K. (March 12, 2012). Louisiana legislature prepares to debate expansion of voucher program. [http://www.thepelicanpost.org/2012/03/12/louisiana-legislature-prepares-to-debate-expansion-of-voucher-program/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014214604/http://www.thepelicanpost.org/2012/03/12/louisiana-legislature-prepares-to-debate-expansion-of-voucher-program/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eligible students during the school year when the bill was passed (2012/13), only 5,000 students knew about and applied for the vouchers, and accepted them.&lt;ref&gt;See Louisiana State Department of Education website for its Louisiana Scholarship program.[http://www.louisianabelieves.com/schools/louisiana-scholarship-program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[United States Department of Education]] released a report concluding that average test scores for reading and mathematics, when adjusted for student and school characteristics, tend to be very similar among public schools and private schools.  Private schools performed significantly better than public schools only if results were not adjusted for factors such as race, gender, and free or reduced price lunch program eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2006461 |title=Comparing Private Schools and Public Schools Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date=July 14, 2006 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research questions assumptions that large improvements would result from a more comprehensive voucher system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2008/wp2008_08.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''School Vouchers and Student Achievement: Recent Evidence, Remaining Questions'', August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the limited budget for schools, it is claimed that a voucher system would weaken public schools while not providing enough money for people to attend [[private school]]s. 76% of the money given in Arizona's voucher program went to children already in private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Palast | first=Greg | title=Armed Madhouse (No Child's Behind Left) | url=http://www.gregpalast.com/no-childs-behind-left/ | publisher=Dutton Adult | year=2006 | isbn=0-525-94968-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources claim that public schools' higher per-pupil spending is due to having a higher proportion of students with behavioral, physical and emotional problems, since in the United States, public schools must by law accept any student regardless of race, gender, religion, disability, educational aptitude, and so forth, while private schools are not so bound.  They argue that some, if not all, of the cost difference between public and private schools comes from "[[cream skimming]]", whereby the private schools select only those students who belong to a preferred group – whether economic, religious, educational aptitude level, or ethnicity – rather than from differences in administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html |title=What Would A School Voucher Buy The Real Cost Of Private Schools |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/b/2007/10/28/are-private-schools-more-cost-effective-than-public-ones.htm |title=Are Private Schools More Cost Effective Than Public Ones? |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The end result, it has been argued, is that a voucher system has led or would lead students who do not belong to the private schools' preferred groupings to become concentrated at public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gifted Children Left Behind |author=Susan Goodkin and David G. Gold |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=August 27, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/26/AR2007082600909.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, of the ten state-run voucher programs in the United States at the beginning of 2011, four targeted low-income students, two targeted students in failing schools, and six targeted students with special needs. (Louisiana ran a single program targeting all three groups.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campanella |first=Andrew |title=Hope for America's Children (School Choice Yearbook 2010–11) |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/AFC/scy2011.pdf |publisher=Alliance for School Choice |date=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that voucher programs are often implemented without the necessary safeguards that prevent institutions from discriminating against marginalized communities. In the United States, as of 2016, there are currently no state laws that require voucher programs to not discriminate against marginalized communities.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne E. Eckes, Julie Mead &amp; Jessica Ulm (2016) Dollars to Discriminate: The (Un)intended Consequences of School Vouchers, Peabody Journal of Education, 91:4, 537-558, DOI: 10.1080/0161956X.2016.1207446&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, while some voucher programs may explicitly be aimed at marginalized communities, this is not necessarily always the case. A common argument for school vouchers is that it allows for marginalized communities of color to be uplifted from poverty. Historically, however, data suggests that voucher programs have been used to further segregate Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Gooden, Huriya Jabbar &amp; Mario S. Torres, Jr. (2016) Race and School Vouchers: Legal, Historical, and Political Contexts, Peabody Journal of Education, 91:4, 522-536, DOI: 10.1080/0161956X.2016.1207445&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some data has shown that the effects of voucher programs such as the New York City School Choice Scholarship Program, are marginal when it comes to increasing student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Bitler, Thurston Domina, Emily Penner &amp; Hilary Hoynes (2015) Distributional Analysis in Educational Evaluation: A Case Study from the New York City Voucher Program, Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness, 8:3, 419-450, DOI: 10.1080/19345747.2014.921259&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument against a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to taxpayers. In many states, members of a community's board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. By contrast, although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers cannot vote on budget issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system—a policy he calls "neovouchers"—present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit.&lt;ref&gt;See Welner, Kevin G. (2008) [http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0742540790&amp;thepassedurl=%5Bthepassedurl%5D NeoVouchers: The Emergence of Tuition Tax Credits for Private Schooling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212431/http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB%2FCATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0742540790&amp;thepassedurl=%5Bthepassedurl%5D |date=September 26, 2011 }}. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of lack of accountability is the voucher situation in Louisiana. In 2012,  Louisiana State Superintendent of Education John White selected private schools to receive vouchers, then tried to fabricate criteria (including site visits) after schools had already received approval letters. One school of note, New Living Word in Ruston, Louisiana, did not have sufficient facilities for the over-300 students White and the state board of education had approved.&lt;ref&gt;See Leader, Barbara (July 2, 2012). Email exchange reveals voucher scheme. [http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20120702/NEWS01/207020308/Email-exchange-reveals-voucher-scheme] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804022132/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20120702/NEWS01/207020308/Email-exchange-reveals-voucher-scheme# |date=August 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a voucher audit in 2013, New Living Word had overcharged the state $395,000. White referred to the incident as a "lone substantive issue".&lt;ref&gt;See Sentell, W. (June 30, 2013). Ruston school banned from accepting voucher students. [http://theadvocate.com/home/6377589-125/ruston-school-banned-from-accepting]&lt;/ref&gt; However, most voucher schools did not undergo a complete audit for not having a separate checking account for state voucher money.&lt;ref&gt;See CenLamar (July 8, 2013).Audit reveals systemic, widespread problems in Louisiana's voucher program. [http://cenlamar.com/2013/07/08/audit-reveals-systemic-widespread-problems/]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Susanne Wiborg, an expert on comparative education, Sweden's voucher system introduced in 1992 has "augmented social and ethnic segregation, particularly in relation to schools in deprived areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10725724 |title=Free schools 'could widen social divide' |first=Hannah |last=Richardson |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax-credit scholarships which are in most part disbursed to current private school students or to families which made substantial donations to the scholarship fund, rather than to low-income students attempting to escape from failing schools, amount to nothing more than a mechanism to use public funds in the form of foregone taxes to support private, often religiously based, private schools.&lt;ref name=NYTBD /&gt;

====Legal challenges====
The school voucher question in the United States has also received a considerable amount of judicial review in the early 2000s.

A program launched in the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] in 1995 and authorized by the state of [[Ohio]] was challenged in court on the grounds that it violated both the federal constitutional principle of separation of church and state and the guarantee of religious liberty in the [[Ohio Constitution]]. These claims were rejected by the [[Ohio Supreme Court]], but the federal claims were upheld by [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|the local federal district court]] and by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit appeals court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edreform.com/school_choice/supreme_court_ruling.htm|title=Legal Summary of U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 436 U.S.|accessdate=April 21, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417233028/http://edreform.com/school_choice/supreme_court_ruling.htm|archive-date=April 17, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that nearly all of the families using vouchers attended Catholic schools in the Cleveland area was cited in the decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/27/scotus.school.vouchers/|accessdate=April 21, 2006|title=Supreme Court affirms school voucher program|first=Terry|last=Friden|date=July 27, 2002 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was later reversed during 2002 in a landmark case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', in which the divided court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled the Ohio school voucher plan constitutional and removed any constitutional barriers to similar voucher plans in the future, with conservative justices [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[William Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] in the majority.

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], writing for the majority, stated that "The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits." The Supreme Court ruled that the Ohio program did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]], because it passed a five-part test developed by the Court in this case, titled the Private Choice Test.

Dissenting opinions included Justice Stevens's, who wrote "...the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government's choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible." and Justice Souter's, whose opinion questioned how the Court could keep ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' on as precedent and decide this case in the way they did, feeling it was contradictory. He also found that religious instruction and secular education could not be separated and this itself violated the Establishment Clause.

In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down legislation known as the [[Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program]] (OSP), which would have implemented a system of school vouchers in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5159138|accessdate=April 21, 2006|title=Court Throws Out Florida School Voucher Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that the OSP violated article IX, section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution: "Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2006/sc04-2323.pdf|accessdate=November 1, 2006|title=Florida Supreme Court Official Opinion: SC04-2323 – John Ellis "Jeb" Bush, Etc., Et Al. v. Ruth D. Holmes, Et Al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was criticized by Clark Neily, [[Institute for Justice]] senior attorney and  legal counsel to Pensacola families using Florida Opportunity Scholarships, as, "educational policymaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v10n2/Neily.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals, Twelfth Circuit |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728130452/http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v10n2/Neily.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political support====
Political support for school vouchers in the United States is mixed. On the left/right spectrum, conservatives are more likely to support vouchers. Some state legislatures have enacted voucher laws.  In [[New Mexico]], then-Republican [[Gary Johnson]] made school voucher provision the major issue of his second term as [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/schoolreform-news.org/Article/10881/Better_Education_Does_Make_All_the_Difference_Governor_Gary_E_Johnson.html |title=Better Education Does Make All the Difference: Governor Gary E. Johnson |first=George A. |last=Clowes |date=October 1, 2000 |work=School Reform News |publisher=[[The Heartland Institute]] |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the federal government operates the largest voucher program, for evacuees from the region affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The Federal government provided a voucher program for 7,500 residents of [[Washington, D.C.]] - the [[D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonscholarshipfund.org/index.html |title=Washington Scholarship Fund |publisher=Washington Scholarship Fund |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  until in early March 2009 congressional Democrats were moving to close down the program  and remove children from their voucher-funded school places at the end of the 2009/10 school year under the $410 billion [[Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;Under Title IV of H.R.1015&lt;/ref&gt; which, as of March 7 had passed the House and was pending in the Senate. The Obama administration stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-03-04-duncan-vouchers_N.htm |title=Secretary Duncan wants D.C. kids to keep vouchers |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it preferred to allow children already enrolled in the program to finish their schooling while closing the program to new entrants.  However, its preference on this matter does not appear to be strong enough to prevent the President from signing the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-3/2/09/ |title=Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 3/2/09 &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050348/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-3/2/09/ |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not the public generally supports vouchers is debatable. Majorities seem to favor improving existing schools over providing vouchers, yet as many as 40% of those surveyed admit that they do not know enough to form an opinion or do not understand the system of school vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/citizen/issueguides/education/publicview/redflags|title=Public Agenda Online, "Red Flags on Education: Lack of Knowledge About Vouchers."|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, a voucher system proposed by [[Tim Draper]] was placed on the [[California]] ballot as Proposition 38. It was unusual among school voucher proposals in that it required neither [[accreditation]] on the part of schools accepting vouchers, nor proof of need on the part of families applying for them; neither did it have any requirement that schools accept vouchers as payment-in-full, nor any other provision to guarantee a reduction in the real cost of private school tuition. The measure was defeated by a final percentage tally of 70.6 to 29.4.

A statewide universal school voucher system providing a maximum tuition subsidy of $3,000 was passed in Utah in 2007, but 62% of voters repealed it in a statewide referendum before it took effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695225580,00.html|title=Vouchers Killed|accessdate=November 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 27, 2011 [[Indiana]] passed a statewide voucher program, the largest in the U.S. It offers up to $4,500 to students with household incomes under $41,000, and lesser benefits to households with higher incomes. The vouchers can be used to fund a variety of education options outside the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/politics/state_politics/keys-to-govs-education-reform-pass|title=Gov's Education Reform Passes|publisher=WISHTV News|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130022452/http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/politics/state_politics/keys-to-govs-education-reform-pass|archive-date=January 30, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] found that the program does not violate the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Indiana court upholds broadest school voucher program | publisher =Associated Press | date =March 26, 2013 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/26/indiana-court-upholds-broadest-school-voucher-program/ | accessdate =March 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trump's 2018 FY 2018 Budget ====
President [[Donald Trump]] proposed a 2018 budget that includes $250 million for voucher initiatives, which are state-funded programs that pay for students to go to private school.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4832923/betsy-devos-trump-administration-school-choice-vouchers/|title=Here's Why Researchers Say Betsy DeVos' Proposed School Voucher Program Won't Work|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 2018 budget served the purpose of, “Expanding school choice, ensuring more children have an equal opportunity to receive a great education, maintaining strong support for the Nation’s most vulnerable students, simplifying funding for post secondary education, continuing to build evidence around educational innovation, and eliminating or reducing Department programs consistent with the limited Federal role in education.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/budget-factsheet.pdf|title=FACT SHEET: President Trump’s FY 2018 Budget|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budget reduces more than 30 programs that duplicate other programs, which are ineffective; or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Another $1 billion is set aside for encouraging schools to adopt school choice-friendly policies.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;[[File:Secretary_of_Education_Betsy_DeVos_at_CPAC_2017_Feb_23rd_2017_by_Michael_Vadon_21.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Secretary_of_Education_Betsy_DeVos_at_CPAC_2017_Feb_23rd_2017_by_Michael_Vadon_21.jpg|thumb|U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos]][[Betsy DeVos]], Trump's education secretary, is also an advocate for voucher programs, and has argued that they would lead to better educational outcomes for students.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Both Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos want to propose cutting the Education Department's budget by about $3.6 billion and spend more than $1 billion on private school vouchers and other school choice plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/devos-seeks-massive-cuts-from-education-department-to-support-school-choice/|title=DeVos seeks cuts from Education Department to support school choice|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=2018-02-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-22|last2=Douglas-Gabriel|first2=Danielle|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Balingit|first3=Moriah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos makes a statement regarding the purpose and importance of the budget. DeVos claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“This budget makes an historic investment in America’s students. President Trump is committed to ensuring the Department focuses on returning decision-making power back to the States, where it belongs, and on giving parents more control over their child’s education. By refocusing the Department’s funding priorities on supporting students, we can usher in a new era of creativity and ingenuity and lay a new foundation for American greatness.” — Betsy DeVos, U.S. [[Secretary of Education]]&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;blockquote/&gt;

====Teaching creationism instead of evolution====
Some private religious schools in voucher programs teach [[creationism]] instead of the [[Evolution|theory of evolution]], including religious schools that teach religious theology side-by-side with or in place of science.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;  Over 300 schools in the US have been documented as teaching creation and receive taxpayer money. Contrary to popular belief {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}, a strict definition of state-funded religious education was narrowly deemed constitutional in ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/01/16/creationism-spreading-in-schools-thanks-to-vouchers/ |title=Creationism spreading in schools, thanks to vouchers|first=Zack|last=Kopplin|date=January 16, 2013 | work=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, currently 35 states have passed various [[Blaine Amendment]]s restricting or prohibiting public funding of religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/01/constitution-check-are-the-states-blaine-amendments-on-shaky-ground/ |title=Constitution Check: Are the states' "Blaine Amendments" on shaky ground? |last1=Denniston |first1=Lyle |author-link=Lyle Denniston |date=January 19, 2016 |website=constitutioncenter.org |publisher=[[National Constitution Center]] |access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fem män höjer sina snapsglas ute i en trädgård stående vid ett trädgårdsbord med kaffekoppar och flaskor - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0048890.jpg|thumb|Snaps drinking in Sweden, early 20th century.]]
'''Snaps''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈsnaps|lang}}, {{IPA-da|ˈsnɑbs|lang}}) is a [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word for a small shot of a strong alcoholic beverage taken during the course of a meal. A ritual that is associated with drinking snaps is a tradition in [[Scandinavia]], especially in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], where it is very common to drink snaps at holidays such as [[Midsummer]], Christmas and Easter. This ritual has been described by one author as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A group of people are clustered around a table for a typical lunch that will include several courses and a clear, fiery drink. The host pours the ice-cold liquid into frosty, conical glasses with long stems. He raises his glass, at which point the diners turn to one another and make eye contact, making certain not to leave anyone out. “''Skål!''” calls out the host, and everyone takes a sip. Again there is eye contact, and then the glasses are set on the table, not to be lifted again until the host raises his. The liquid is [[Akvavit|aquavit]]. The ritual is virtually the same throughout Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Spirits: A Guide to Their History, Production, and Enjoyment|last= Blue |first= Anthony Dias |year= 2004|publisher= HarperCollins Publishers|location= New York|isbn= 0-06-054218-7|page= &amp;nbsp;42}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Denmark, a snaps will always be [[akvavit]], although there are many varieties of it. In Sweden, ''snaps'' is a more general term; it is usually akvavit, although it may also be [[vodka]], bitters/bitter liqueurs or some other kind of ''[[brännvin]]''/''[[brændevin]]''. Spirits such as [[whisky]] or [[brandy]] are seldom drunk as snaps.

The word “snaps” also has the same meaning as German ''[[Schnapps#German|Schnaps]]'' ({{IPA-de|ʃnɑːps|lang}}), in the sense of “any strong alcoholic drink.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Norwegian-English Dictionary |last=Haugen |first=Einar |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn= |pages= |url= }} &amp;nbsp;The definition given is “nip, schnaps; shot (of brandy,&lt;br /&gt; aquavit, etc.).”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
An [[entrée]] consisting of [[pickled herring]] and potatoes is typically served with snaps, as is the Swedish ''[[surströmming]]''.

Swedes, Danes and [[Swedish-speaking Finns]] have a tradition of singing songs (called ''[[snapsvisor]]'') before drinking snaps. These ''snapsvisor '' are typically odes to the joys of drinking snaps. They may praise the flavour of snaps or express a craving for it.

Snaps and ''snapsvisor'' are essential elements of [[crayfish party|crayfish parties]], which are notoriously tipsy affairs. Dozens of songs may be sung during such a party, and every song requires a round of snaps. However, the glass need not be emptied every time.

==Home liquor production in Scandinavia==
Distilling snaps at home is illegal in [[Scandinavia]]n countries, unless approved by tax authorities.

Illegal home distilling, however, is a widespread tradition,  especially in many rural communities of Sweden, Finland and Norway.

A tradition of “home flavouring” snaps exists in Scandinavia. This tradition is strongest in the southern areas, particularly Denmark. A snaps enthusiast will typically buy a commercially made, neutral-tasting snaps, and then add flavour to it by adding herbs found in nature or grown in a garden. For instance, in northern Denmark, various spices are added to snaps to produce a version called "bjesk", which roughly translated means “bitter”. In [[Hirtshals]], the [[Vendsyssel Historical Museum|Hirtshals Museum]] tells the story of the "bjesk".

Popular flavours for home flavouring include [[Blackthorn]], [[Bog-myrtle]], [[Dill]], [[Persian Walnut]], [[Hypericum perforatum|St. John’s Wort]], [[Galium odoratum|Woodruff]], and [[Artemisia absinthium|Wormwood]]. The herbs are commonly used singly, but some enthusiasts experiment with mixing them to achieve “the perfect flavour.”

The '''sociological study of [[peace]], [[war]], and [[social conflict]]''' entails the use of [[sociological theory]] and methods to analyze [[group conflict]]s, especially [[collective violence]] and alternative constructive nonviolent forms of [[conflict transformation]].  

The [[by-law|by-laws]] of the Section on Peace, War and Social Conflict of the [[American Sociological Association]] specify:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html What is the Peace, War, and Social Conflict Section?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911102238/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html |date=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose of the Section on Peace, War, and Social Conflict is to foster the development and application of sociological theories and methods for the understanding and study of dynamics of collective conflict and its prevention, conduct, and resolution. Included is the study of military institutions and conflict between collectivities such as countries, ethnic groups, political movements, and religious groups. Also included are the roles of military organizations, other governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and social movements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge logo.jpg|thumb|200px|Emblem of the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge]]
The '''Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge''' (อาศรมวัฒนธรรมไทย-ภารต) is one of the most prestigious Indian [[cultural organisation]] in [[Thailand]] that seeks to promote comparative studies and exchange between Thai and Indian history and culture. It was founded in 1940 in [[Bangkok]] by [[Prafulla Kumar Sen|Swami Satyananda Puri]] with encouragement from the Indian [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. The Swami Satyananda Puri foundation was established by the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge in 1942. The SSPF library today is a reference library that houses many old and rare Indian texts. The foundation is also involved in promoting work on Indian culture, especially on the [[Ramayana]].

Today, the TBCL promotes Indian cultural affairs in [[Thailand]] and supports Thai and Indian students, studying both in [[Thailand]] as well as for studies in India.&lt;ref name=Kratoska&gt;{{harvnb|Kratoska|2002|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/indian-associations/thai-bharat-cultural-lodge---promoting-cross-border-cultural-interaction.html Indians in Thailand - Thai Bharat cultural lodge - promoting cross border cultural interaction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government also provides assistance to the Cultural lodge for promoting Indian languages and culture.

'''''The One Doctor''''' is a [[Big Finish Productions]] [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio drama]] based on the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]].

==Plot==
The Sixth Doctor and Mel come up against an impostor Doctor and his companion Sally-Anne.

During the serial, the Doctor and his companions undertake a quest to find the three greatest treasures of the Generios system.

The story was essentially Big Finish's Christmas [[pantomime|panto]], and features an extra Christmas scene as a hidden track at the end of the story. The episodes are heavily laden with comedy and the impostor Doctor's name, Banto Zame, is an intentional{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} rhyme with [[pantomime dame|Panto Dame]].

===The Shelves of Infinity===
Banto Zame and [[Mel Bush]] arrive on Generios Eight to try to locate one of the treasures, '''The Shelves of Infinity''' ('''Unit ZX419'''). The Shelves of Infinity were designed and created by the Assembler race on Generios Eight, considered the pinnacle of their race. The pieces that make up the shelves are constantly phasing in and out of this dimension, so they can never be completely assembled. The Shelves of Infinity were stored in Warehouse ZX under the code ZX419.

Banto and Mel encounter the Assemblers and manage to convince them to let them take unit ZX419, but only if they could assemble it. Banto scoffs, saying it will be easy. Once the two start building the shelves, they notice parts are going missing. The instructions make sense, but they never get any closer to actually building it. Eventually, they come up with a way to fool the Assemblers: since the building process can never be finished, the Assemblers do not know what the finished product would look like.

The Assemblers are fooled long enough for the Doctor to arrive in the [[TARDIS]], and Banto and Mel escape with the Shelves of Infinity.

===Mentos===

Another of the treasures, '''Mentos''' (also known as the '''Mentos Device'''), is an advanced computer and information retrieval system. It is one of the three treasures of the Generios system in the far future, described by the Doctor as the "vulgar end of time".

Mentos appears in our universe as a small metal box that projects the [[holograph]]ic image of an old man which acts as its real world interface. The box is actually a portal to a shadow universe which is populated by countless information collectors—research devices that travel through time and space, constantly seeking out the answer to any given question. As a result, Mentos literally knows everything there is to know.

Mentos was made to participate in ''Superbrain'', a [[game show]] (a parody of ''[[The Weakest Link]]''). However, as Mentos was able to answer every question put to it, the game continued endlessly. Eventually, the two factions which were vying for control of the Mentos device fought and wiped each other out, along with the codes that would shut down the Questioner and end the game. Mentos, programmed to continue answering questions until it got a wrong answer, outlasted the civilisation that created it by over 330 centuries.

The Doctor arrived on Generios Fourteen to collect Mentos. An alien cylinder was holding Generios One, the capital planet of the system, hostage, threatening to destroy it unless the people of Generios handed over their three greatest treasures. Unable to disconnect the computer without ending the game, the Doctor tried to stump Mentos without success until he and Sally Anne Stubbins asked it what it did ''not'' know. With Mentos being unable to answer that question, the game ended, with its score a "pitiful" 679,330,567,010 credits. The Doctor was then able to disconnect the device and take it with him.

During the Doctor's initial attempts to outwit Mentos, the computer tiredly asked him if he was going to ask it "one of those tricky fox-the-computer logic conundrums", like the [[liar paradox]]. In the [[Third Doctor]] serial ''[[The Green Death]]'', the Doctor asked the rogue [[artificial intelligence]] BOSS the same question. Mentos, however, stated that it would not have made a difference—it is able to answer those kinds of questions as well.

===The Lonely Jelloid!===

The final episode of the play mainly focuses on the Doctor and co. attempting to retrieve a giant crystal from a planet guarded by a large, lonely jelloid organism (voiced by Matt Lucas&amp;nbsp;— Lucas also voiced the cylinder).  At the play's conclusion it is revealed that the cylinder was actually after the Doctor all along and the request for the three treasures was a trap&amp;nbsp;— as only the Doctor could have retrieved them.  Banto Zame is wrongly identified as the Doctor and is taken away to face punishment for the Doctor's future actions. The Doctor later comments that he shall rescue Zame from this fate.

Also, there are two hidden tracks that appear at the end of the CD. The first is a short scene in which The Doctor and Mel attempt to view the Queen's Speech on the Time and Space Visualiser. The Second is of Mentos and the Quiz Host. This latter scene is extensive and is composed of a question-and-answer format heard during the third episode. Both hidden scenes have the characters wish everyone listening a happy Christmas.

"'''The Paddock and the Mouse'''" is a poem by the 15th-century Scottish poet [[Robert Henryson]] and part of his collection of moral [[fable]]s known as the ''[[Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian]]''. It is written in [[Middle Scots]]. As with the other tales in the collection, appended to it is a ''[[wiktionary:moralitas|moralitas]]'' which elaborates on the moral that the fable is supposed to contain.

The tale is an expansion of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's Fable]] of [[The Frog and the Mouse]] and concerns a mouse that desires to cross a stream. A [[wiktionary:paddock|paddock]]{{efn|Either a [[toad]] or a frog.&lt;ref name="MED Paddock"&gt;{{cite web|title=paddok(e (n.)|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED32151|work=Middle English Dictionary|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert L. Kindrick notes that "Apparently toads, frogs, and paddocks are sometimes treated indifferently in medieval literature";&lt;ref name="TEAMS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kindrick|first=Robert L.|title=The Morall Fabillis|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/morfram.htm|work=TEAMS Texts|publisher=University of Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt; he nevertheless notes it firstly as a frog, corresponding with ''rava'' in [[Gualterus Anglicus]]' version of ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', a source of Henryson's.&lt;ref name="TEAMS" /&gt; In his modern English text, [[Seamus Heaney]] simply translates as "toad".&lt;ref name="Henryson 2009, p. 169ff."&gt;Henryson 2009, p. 169ff.&lt;/ref&gt;}} offers his assistance and, to prove his trustworthiness, discusses the difference between appearing and being virtuous. As the two cross the stream tied together, the paddock betrays and tries to drown the mouse. Their struggle is seen by a [[kite (bird)]], who grabs and kills them both.

==Synopsis==
===Tale===
A mouse is sat alongside a stream, lamenting being unable to cross it and reach the cereals and other foodstuffs on the opposite side. A [[wiktionary:paddock|paddock]] approaches and says that he will assist her in crossing; the mouse enquires as to how the creature is able to swim, and he explains how his anatomy allows him to. However, the mouse suspects, on the basis of [[physiognomy]], that the paddock is untrustworthy; she highlights his features, and recites the proverb that a man's morals is shown in his face. To this the paddock replies with another proverb, do not judge a man by his looks, and gives several instances in which goodness in appearance is not replicated in spirit. Finally, the mouse acedes to the help, although is still concerned about a potential loss of liberty and life which will accompany being tied to the paddock as they cross the water; she makes the paddock swear an oath that he will assist her in crossing. The two tie themselves together with some string and proceed to swim. However, as they start across the stream the paddock swims downwards with the intention of drowning the mouse; the mouse decries the creature's deception, but struggles upwards to prevent herself from drowning. Seeing the struggle is a nearby [[kite (bird)|kite]]. The bird flies down and grabs the two—as they are bound together—and carries them away, where he kills and disembowels them, though they do not satiate his appetite much.

[[File:The Phantom Carriage (1921).webm|thumb|thumbtime=11|upright=1.5|''The Phantom Carriage'']]
'''''The Phantom Carriage''''' ({{lang-sv|Körkarlen}}, literally "The Wagoner") is a 1921 Swedish [[film]] generally considered to be one of the central works in the history of [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish cinema]]. Released on [[New Year's Day]] 1921, it was directed by and starred [[Victor Sjöström]], alongside [[Hilda Borgström]], [[Tore Svennberg]] and [[Astrid Holm]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/K/Korkarlen1920.html |title=Progressive Silent Film List: The Phantom Carriage |accessdate=2009-04-25|work=Silent Era}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the novel ''[[Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!]]''  (''Körkarlen''; 1912), by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel prize]]-winning Swedish author [[Selma Lagerlöf]].

The film is notable for its special effects, its advanced (for the time) narrative structure with [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s within flashbacks, and for having been a major influence on the works of [[Ingmar Bergman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bo Florin (2010), "Victor Sjöström and the Golden Age", Mariah Larsson and Anders Marklund (eds), "Swedish Film: An Introduction and Reader", Lund: Nordic Academic Press, pp. 76-85, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as ''The Phantom Chariot'', ''Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!'' and ''The Stroke of Midnight''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Titles&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx?id%3d1225%26epslanguage%3dsv%26searchword%3dk%C3%B6rkarlen%26type%3dMovieTitle%26match%3dBegin%26page%3d1 Körkarlen—titlar] (in Swedish) at the [[Swedish Film Institute]]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110614061243/http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Titles&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx%3Fid%3D1225%26epslanguage%3Dsv%26searchword%3Dk%C3%B6rkarlen%26type%3DMovieTitle%26match%3DBegin%26page%3D1 |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On [[New Year's Eve]], dying [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] Sister Edit has one last wish: to speak with David Holm. David, a drunkard, is sitting in a graveyard, telling his two drinking buddies about his old friend Georges, who told him about the legend that the last person to die each year has to drive Death's carriage and collect the souls of everybody who dies the following year. Georges himself died on New Year's Eve the previous year.

Gustafsson, a colleague of Edit, finds David, but is unable to convince him to go see her. When his friends try to drag him there, a fight breaks out, and David is struck on the head with a bottle just before the clock strikes twelve. David's soul emerges from his body as the carriage appears. The driver is Georges.

Georges reminds David of how the latter once lived a happy life with his wife Anna, their two children and his brother, until Georges led him astray. As shown in a flashback that follows, David was jailed for drunkenness. Before being released from prison, he was shown his brother, who had been sentenced to a long term for killing a man while drunk. When David went home, he found the apartment empty. Furious, he became determined to track Anna down and have his revenge.

During his search throughout Sweden, David arrives at a new Salvation Army Mission on New Year's Eve. Maria does not want to answer the bell, as it is very late, but Edit lets him in. Despite his rudeness to her, she mends his coat while he sleeps. The next day, she asks him to return in one year; she had prayed that the first visitor would have good fortune for that period and wants to know the outcome of her prayer. He agrees, but before he leaves, he tears out her patches.

Georges informs David that the promise has to be fulfilled and takes him against his will in the carriage to Edit. In another flashback it is shown how Edit once found David in a bar with Gustafsson and another man. Edit persuaded the other man to go home with his wife and gave Gustafsson an advertisement for a Salvation Army meeting. At the meeting, Gustafsson submitted himself to God, but David remained completely unrepentant. Anna was at the meeting, but David did not recognize her. Later, Anna told Edit who she was, and Edit tried to effect a reconciliation. At first, the couple were optimistic, but soon David's behavior drove Anna to despair once again. One night, Anna pleaded with him not to expose their children to his [[tuberculosis|consumption]] (the same fatal disease Edit caught from him). When he refused, Anna locked him in the kitchen and tried to flee again with their children, but fainted. He broke through the door with an axe, but did not physically hurt her.

When Georges arrives in Edit's room, she begs him to let her live until she sees David again. She thinks she is the one to blame for his magnified sins, as she brought the couple together again. When David hears this, he is deeply moved. He kisses her hands, and when Edit sees his regret, she can die in peace. Georges does not take her, saying others will come for her. He then shows David that Anna, afraid of leaving her children alone after she herself dies of consumption, is planning to poison them and herself. David begs Georges to do something, but Georges has no power over the living. In desperation David prays to god to be given another chance. Then David regains consciousness in the graveyard. He rushes to Anna before she can act. With great difficulty, he convinces her that he sincerely wishes to reform.

==Production==

===Development===
Since 1917, there was a deal between Selma Lagerlöf and [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|A-B Svenska Biografteatern]] to adapt at least one Lagerlöf novel for film every year. Prior to ''The Phantom Carriage'', Sjöström had made three of these adaptions which had all been well received by critics, the audience and Lagerlöf herself. Since all of them had taken place in a rural setting, Sjöström felt that he wanted a change for the fourth and suggested the urban, gritty [[Körkarlen]]. Lagerlöf was initially sceptical about the possibility to adapt the novel's elements of [[occult]]ism and [[mysticism]], and Sjöström was well aware of the difficulties. The script took eight days to finish and in April 1920 Sjöström travelled to Lagerlöf's mansion Mårbacka in [[Värmland]] to present it. After two hours of Sjöström reading loud and performing the whole script by himself, Lagerlöf responded by offering him dinner, which Sjöström took as an approval.&lt;ref name=lagerlof&gt;Grönkvist, Lars "[http://www.selmalagerlof.nu/_filmguld.html Selma Lagerlöf försökte stoppa Stillers filmversion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201064402/http://selmalagerlof.nu/_filmguld.html |date=2009-02-01 }}" (in Swedish) Selma Lagerlöf 150 år&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Korkarlen-screen.png|thumb|left|Double exposures on a gritty [[Landskrona]]-inspired street.]]

===Filming===
Shooting took place from May to July 1920 in the newly started [[Filmstaden]] studios in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. The set design was inspired by the southern Swedish town [[Landskrona]], which corresponded to what Lagerlöf had in mind when writing the novel. Lagerlöf's original wish was to film it on location in Landskrona, but Sjöström chose to do it in studio for the technical benefits.&lt;ref name="sfi" /&gt;

===Post-production===
Post-production was famously long and intense due to the extensive use of special effects, developed by cinematographer [[Julius Jaenzon]] and lab executive Eugén Hellman. Double exposures made in the camera (optical printing wasn't available until the early 1930s), had been used before by Jaenzon, already in ''[[Sir Arne's Treasure]]'' from 1919, but were here developed to be far more advanced with several layers. This allowed the ghost characters to walk around in three dimensions, being able to first be covered by an object in the foreground, but when in the same take walking up in front of the object, it would be seen through the ghost's semi-transparent body.&lt;ref name=sfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-film/Filmdatabasen/?itemid=3504&amp;type=MOVIE&amp;iv=Comments&amp;ref=/templates/SwedishFilmSearchResult.aspx?id=1225&amp;epslanguage=sv&amp;searchword=k%C3%B6rkarlen&amp;type=MovieTitle&amp;match=Begin&amp;page=1|title=Den svenska biohösten|website=Svenska Filminstitutet}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty was that the cameras were hand-cranked, meaning that the camera had to be cranked at exactly the same speed in the different exposures for the end result to appear natural.&lt;ref name="lagerlof" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 100%, based on {{nowrap|11 reviews}}, with a [[rating average]] of 9/10.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Phantom Carriage (1921) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_phantom_carriage/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] from ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' praised the film, calling it a masterpiece.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=The Phantom Carriage|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-phantom-carriage/Film?oid=1065842|website=Chicago Reader|publisher=Jonathan Rosenbaum|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The film was a powerful influence on the later Swedish film director [[Ingmar Bergman]] who also utilised the figure of Death in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', where the referring to him as a "strict master" is a reference to ''The Phantom Carriage''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomkvist, Mårten (14 December 2007) "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/stumma-parlor-lyser-upp-1.706371 Stumma pärlor lyser upp]" (in Swedish) ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''. Retrieved on 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman also cast Sjöström in the leading role for ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', which also features references to the film. Bergman has said that he first saw it at 15 and watched it at least once every year.&lt;ref&gt;Bergdahl, Gunnar (31 July 2007). "[http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article558995.ab Ingmar Bergmans utlåtanden om svenska filmer—Körkarlen]" (in Swedish) ''[[Aftonbladet]]''. Retrieved on 14 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The television play ''[[The Image Makers]]'' (2000), directed by Bergman, is a historical drama depicting the making of ''The Phantom Carriage''.

[[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' features several thematic similarities, as well as the famous sequence where [[Jack Nicholson]] uses an axe to break through a wooden door.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thorellifilm.com/sidaMedia/filmartiklar2_guldalder.htm Den svenska filmens Guldålder]" (in Swedish) Thorellifilm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtracks and home media==
The original screenings didn't have an original soundtrack, instead various pieces by [[Ture Rangström]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] and [[Max Reger]] were performed by the orchestras.&lt;ref name="sfi" /&gt; For a long time several different soundtracks, generally of low quality, were used for television screenings and video releases. However, in 1998, on demand from the [[Swedish Film Institute]], a new soundtrack was composed by renowned Swedish silent film composer and live pianist [[Matti Bye]], which was highly praised and has been featured on all following VHS and DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;Pauli, Calle (13 December 2007) "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/det-varas-for-stumfilmsmusiken-1.539819 Det våras för stumfilmsmusiken]." (in Swedish) ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''. Retrieved on 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], a new soundtrack was composed and performed live by pop icon [[Jonathan Richman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=83 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE WITH JONATHAN RICHMAN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222121255/http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=83 |date=2007-12-22 }} ''[[San Francisco International Film Festival]]''&lt;/ref&gt; No Region-1 DVD release with this version has been announced.

In 2008, the now defunct Tartan Films (now [[Palisades Tartan]]), under license from the [[Swedish Film Institute]], released a region 2 DVD version of the film, with a newly commissioned soundtrack by the electronic music group [[KTL (band)|KTL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/66977/the-phantom-carriage-ktl-edition.html|title=The Phantom Carriage (KTL Edition) Review|date=5 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Criterion Collection]] released a restored version of the film on Blu-ray and DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/27630-the-phantom-carriage|title=The Phantom Carriage|website=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tooth Fairy''' is a [[fantasy]] figure of early childhood in [[Western world|Western]] and Western-influenced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, John R.; McKee, Judy S.; Jernigan, Louise F., ''Psychological Reports'', Vol. 46 (3, Pt. 1), June 1980. "Children's belief in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy". pp. 691–694.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[folklore]] states that when children lose one of their [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]], they should place it underneath their pillow and the Tooth Fairy will visit while they sleep, replacing the lost tooth with a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Linda S.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklore|year=2007|publisher=Facts on file Inc|location=NY, NY, United States of America|isbn=0-8160-5699-4|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy to collect is practiced in various countries.

==Origins==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
In [[Northern Europe]], there was a tradition of ''tand-fé'' or tooth fee, which was paid when a child lost their first tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigfússon |authorlink2=Guðbrandur Vigfússon |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2 |work=[[William Craigie|William A. Craigie]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press ]]|year= 1957}} [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html s.v. ''tannfé'' first edition available on ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is recorded in writings as early as the [[Edda]]s, which are the earliest written record of [[Norsemen|Norse]] and Northern European traditions.

The reward left varies by country, the family's economic status, amounts the child's peers report receiving and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patcas, Hubertus JM van Waes, Moritz M Daum and Markus A Landolt. ''Medical Journal of Australia'', Vol. 207, 2017. "Tooth Fairy guilty of favouritism!". pp 482-486.{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/11/tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism|title=tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Helen, Joy Cullen. ''Australian Journal of Early Childhood'', Vol. 28, 2003. "The Tooth Fairy Comes, or Is It Just Your Mum and Dad?: A Child's Construction of Knowledge". pp 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 survey by [[Visa Inc.]] found that American children receive $3.70 per tooth on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57600762/tooth-fairy-inflation-flies-high|title=Tooth Fairy inflation flies high|date=30 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tooth fairy leaving less money|publisher=UPI Quirks in the News|date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], other [[superstition]]s arose surrounding children's teeth. In [[England]], for example, children were instructed to burn their baby teeth in order to save the child from hardship in the afterlife. Children who didn't consign their baby teeth to the fire would spend eternity searching for them in the afterlife. The [[Vikings]], it is said, paid children for their teeth. In the Norse culture, children's teeth and other articles belonging to children were said to bring good luck in battle, and Scandinavian warriors hung children's teeth on a string around their necks. Fear of witches was another reason to bury or burn teeth. In medieval Europe, it was thought that if a witch were to get hold of one's teeth, it could lead to them having total power over him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recess.ufl.edu/transcripts/2005/0823.shtml|title=Legends of the Tooth Fairy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern incarnation of these traditions into an actual Tooth Fairy has been dated to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Tooth fairy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tooth%20fairy "Tooth fairy,"] [[Merriam-Webster]].com, 2015 (viewed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; or 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Heidi|title=8 Popular Tooth Myths Debunked|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/8-popular-tooth-myths-debunked-8#slide-8|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=[[Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is an earlier reference to the tooth fairy in a 1908 "Household Hints" item in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'':
{{quotation|"Tooth Fairy.
Many a refractory child will allow a loose tooth to be removed if he knows about the Tooth Fairy.  If he takes his little tooth and puts it under the pillow when he goes to bed the Tooth Fairy will come in the night and take it away, and in its place will leave some little gift.  It is a nice plan for mothers to visit the 5 cent counter and lay in a supply of articles to be used on such occasions.

==Appearance==
Unlike [[Santa Claus]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Easter Bunny]], there are few details of the Tooth Fairy's appearance that are consistent in various versions of the myth. A 1984 study conducted by [[Rosemary Wells]] revealed that most, 74 percent of those surveyed, believed the Tooth Fairy to be female, while 12 percent believed the Tooth Fairy to be neither male nor female and 8 percent believed the Tooth Fairy could be either male or female.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FkdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3809,192140&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=Tooth Fairy Lore Extracted|date=2 February 1984|work=[[Toledo Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her findings regarding the Tooth Fairy's appearance, Wells explained - "You've got your basic Tinkerbell-type Tooth Fairy with the wings, wand, a little older and whatnot. Then you have some people who think of the tooth fairy as a man, or a bunny rabbit or a mouse."&lt;ref name="The Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6626,6866738&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=The tooth fairy: friend or foe?|date=31 July 1991|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review of published children's books and popular artwork found the Tooth Fairy to also be depicted as a child with wings, a [[pixie]], a [[dragon]], a blue mother-figure, a flying [[ballerina]], two little old men, a dental hygienist, a potbellied flying man smoking a cigar, a bat, a bear and others. Unlike the well-established imagining of Santa Claus, differences in renderings of the Tooth Fairy are not as upsetting to children.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;
 
===Depiction on coins and currency===
Starting in 2011, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] began selling special sets for newborn babies, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, "Oh Canada" and the Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy quarters, which were issued only in 2011 and 2012, were packaged separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=2012%20CANADA%20Tooth%20Fairy%20Gift%20Sett%20Special%20quarter%20reverse%20Mint%20sealed%20&amp;_itemId=200712964004 2012 CANADA Tooth Fairy Gift Sett Special quarter reverse Mint sealed | eBay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief==

Belief in the Tooth Fairy is viewed in two very different ways. On the one hand, children believing is seen as part of the trusting nature of childhood. Conversely, belief in the Tooth Fairy is frequently used to label adults as being too trusting and ready to believe anything.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;[[Rosemary Wells|Wells, Rosemary]]. "The Making of an Icon: The Tooth Fairy in North American Folklore and Popular Culture" in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays''. Peter Narváez ed., 1997. pp 426-446. [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While parents are often unsure of themselves when promoting the fiction of the Tooth Fairy, the majority of children report positive outcomes. Upon learning the Tooth Fairy is not real, 75% of children reported liking the custom; 20% were neutral and 3% were not in favor and said they did not intend to continue the practice.

Parents tend to view the myth as providing comfort for children in the loss of their tooth.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; Research finds that belief in the Tooth Fairy may provide such comfort to a child experiencing fear or pain resulting from the loss of a tooth.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Cindy Dell. "Flight Toward Maturity: The Tooth Fairy" in ''Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America''. [[University of Chicago Press]], 1995. pp 355-364.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers especially seem to value a child's belief as a sign that their "baby" is still a child and is not "growing up too soon".&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; By encouraging belief in a fictional character, parents allow themselves to be comforted that their child still believes in fantasy and is not yet "grown up".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Children often discover the Tooth Fairy is imaginary as part of the 5- to 7-year shift, often connecting this to other gift-bearing imaginary figures (such as [[Santa Claus]] and the [[Easter Bunny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sameroff, Arnold and Susan C. Mcdonough. ''Phi Delta Kappan'', Vol. 76, 1994, "Educational implications of developmental transitions: revisiting the 5- to 7-year shift".&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Vicki Lansky]] advises parents to tell their children early that the tooth fairy pays a whole lot more for a perfect tooth than for a decayed one. According to Lansky, some families leave a note with the payment, praising the child for good dental habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansky|first=Vicki|title=Practical parenting tips|publisher=Unicorn books|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7806-005-1|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research findings suggest a possible relationship between a child's continued belief in the Tooth Fairy (and other fictional characters) and [[false memory syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe1, Gabrielle F. and Eric Smith. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'', Volume 22, Issue 5, pages 625–642, July 2008. "The tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth: how belief in the Tooth Fairy can engender false memories".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (or Ratón Pérez, "Pérez Mouse" in English) is a figure popular in Spanish and Hispanic American cultures, similar to the Tooth Fairy, originating in Madrid in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez". The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] was used by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela&lt;ref name="Producto"&gt;[http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html ¡Producto Registrado!: Agosto 1998: Centuria Dental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |date=20 October 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

In [[Italy]], the Tooth Fairy is also often replaced by a small mouse, named ''Topolino''.

In [[France]] and French-speaking [[Belgium]], this character is called ''la petite souris'' ("[[The Little Mouse|the little mouse]]"). From parts of [[Lowland Scotland]] comes a tradition similar to the fairy mouse: a white fairy rat who purchases children's teeth with coins.

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and specially in [[Biscay]], there is ''Mari Teilatukoa'' (Mary from the roof), who lives in the roof of the [[baserri]] and catches the teeth thrown by the children.

In some [[Asia|Asian countries]], such as [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], when a child loses a tooth, it is customary for him or her to throw it onto the roof if it came from the lower jaw, or into the space beneath the floor if it came from the upper jaw. While doing this, the child shouts a request for the tooth to be replaced with the tooth of a mouse. This tradition is based on the fact that the teeth of mice grow for their entire lives, a characteristic of all rodents. In some cultures in India, children bury their teeth in the soil near big trees.

In [[Japan]], a different variation calls for lost upper teeth to be thrown straight down to the ground and lower teeth straight up into the air; the idea is that incoming teeth will grow in straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeler|first=Selby B.|title=Throw Your Tooth on the Roof: Tooth Traditions from Around the World|year=1998|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-6181-5238-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Middle Eastern countries (including [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]), there is a tradition of throwing a baby tooth up into the sky to the sun or to [[Allah]]. This tradition may originate in a pre-Islamic offering, and dates back to at least the 13th century. It is also mentioned by [[Izz bin Hibat Allah Al Hadid]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hamdani&gt;Al Hamdani, Muwaffak and Wenzel, Marian.

[[File:Transgenic hydra endo.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]]-marked endodermal epithelial cells in [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]]]
[[Cnidarians]] such as [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] have become attractive model organisms to study the [[evolution]] of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. However, despite long-term efforts, stably [[transgenic animals]] could not be generated, severely limiting the functional analysis of [[gene]]s. For analytical purposes, therefore, an important technical breakthrough in the field was the development of a transgenic procedure for generation of stably transgenic lines by embryo [[microinjection]].

== Uses ==

Hydra polyps are small and transparent which makes it possible to trace single cells [[in vivo]]. In addition, transgenic Hydra provide a ready system for generating [[gain-of-function]] phenotypes. With the use of transgenes producing dominant-negative versions of [[protein]]s, one should be able to obtain [[loss-of-function]] phenotypes as well. 
Current technology allows generation of reporter constructs using promoters of various Hydra genes fused to [[fluorescent]] proteins.

Since transgenic Hydra lines have become an important tool to dissect molecular mechanisms of development, a “Hydra Transgenic Facility” has been established at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel (Germany).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''You can click, but you can't hide''' is a propaganda campaign run jointly by several international associations, most notably the [[Motion Picture Association|MPA]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], and the [[Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.|GVU]], as part of the larger ''"Respect Copyrights"'' campaign against [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of [[motion pictures]]. The associations have long alleged that Internet file sharing, or maintaining a file sharing tracker, network or [[search engine]], constitutes [[copyright infringement]] because the practice hurts their profits.

The phrase is an adaptation of the phrase "You can run but you can't hide," a statement attributed to American boxer [[Joe Louis]]. The "Illegal Downloading: Inappropriate for all ages" campaign logo is based on the [[MPAA]] Rating System logos.

In addition to a print and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] campaign, [[BitTorrent tracker]] websites closed between October 2004 and May 2005 due to legal action by the associations have replaced their front page with the campaign's logo and an accompanying message:

''There are websites that provide legal downloads. This is not one of them. This website has been permanently shut down by court order because it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures. The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.''

==LokiTorrent controversy==
The associations have also obtained records from some closed tracker sites, which could be used to trace individual users. The administrator of one such site, [[LokiTorrent]], closed the site and turned over its logs, amidst controversy, as part of a settlement ending a 2005 copyright infringement lawsuit filed by MPAA studios against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4256449.stm |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] campaign's signature replaced the content of the website upon its shutting down.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |title=MPAA notice on LokiTorrent website |accessdate=February 10, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210215106/http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |archivedate=February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other campaigns==
The arresting nature of the graphics, and the use of scare tactics in this campaign is a marked difference from previous large-scale copyright-promotion campaigns such as [[Home Taping is Killing Music]] and [[Who Makes Movies?]], which appealed to the consumer's interest in the art form and the consumer's compassion for movie industry workers. John G. Malcolm, former Senior Vice President and Director of Worldwide Anti-Piracy for the MPAA, has been quoted saying that the goal of the campaign is to "make an example of" internet movie thieves and other pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/MPAA%20you%20can%20click%20but%20you%20cant%20hide.htm|title=Motion Picture Association of America enforces its message 'you can click but you can't hide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former MPAA chief Dan Glickman insisted in a statement to film [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] traders that the MPAA "will find you, and you will be held responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/68741|title=MPAA Sues Three|date=21 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Update on campaign==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In 2010 they conducted survey and found out as the years progressed more and more people continued to find more ways and websites to download illegal music. Troels Møller from pro-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] group [[:da:Piratgruppen|Piratgruppen]] stated, "The advertising campaigns used to prevent illegal downloads have been a waste of money and have in general been a cop-out from the record industry". He believes that these campaigns are useless and have no real major effect on the daily consumer of music. This scare tactic is not a significant factor and has little to no success for music listeners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1389">'''Íslenski listinn''' is the Icelandic top 20 music chart. The list gets updated weekly. The end of the year list contains the top 50 songs of the year. The list has been published by many medias over the years, such as newspapers, television, and radio, and is currently hosted by the radio station [[FM 957 (Icelandic Radio Station)|FM957]] which is owned by [[365 (media corporation)|365 media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fm957.visir.is/fm957/islenski-listinn/|title=Íslenski listinn {{!}} FM957.is|website=fm957.visir.is|language=is|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Íslenski listin, and it's current name, was announced for the first time in the newspaper [[DV (newspaper)|DV]] in [[January]] [[1993]]. The list was a co-operation between DV, the radiostation Bylgjan and [[Vífilfell|Coca-Cola Iceland]]. The list were to be a top 40 list and published every Thursday in a special music segment of the newspaper. Then on Thursaday night, the songs would play on the radio in a special 3 hour radio program on Bylgjan. The first radio program was hosted by Jón Axel Ólafsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=194514
