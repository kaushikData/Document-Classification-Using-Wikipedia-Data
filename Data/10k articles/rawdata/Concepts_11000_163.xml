The endeavor to use 100% [[renewable energy]] for electricity, heating/cooling and transport is motivated by [[global warming]], pollution and other environmental issues, as well as economic and [[energy security]] concerns. Shifting the total global [[primary energy]] supply to renewable sources requires a [[energy transition|transition of the energy system]]. In 2013 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt;

In 2014, renewable sources such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[bioenergy|biomass]], and burnt waste provided 19% of the total energy consumed worldwide, with roughly half of that coming from traditional use of biomass.&lt;ref name=Armaroli&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2016 | title = Solar Electricity and Solar Fuels: Status and Perspectives in the Context of the Energy Transition | url = | journal = [[Chemistry – A European Journal]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 32–57 | doi = 10.1002/chem.201503580 | pmid = 26584653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important sector is electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from hydropower with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%.&lt;ref name=Armaroli/&gt; According to the [[REN21]] 2017 global status report, these figures had increased to 19.3% for energy in 2015 and 24.5% for electricity in 2016. There are many places around the world with grids that are run almost exclusively on renewable energy. At the national level, at least 30 nations already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of the energy supply.

Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] of Princeton University have developed a series of “[[climate stabilization wedge]]s” that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic [[climate change]], and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges."&lt;ref name="Pacala"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1100103 |pmid=15310891 |pages=968–72 |title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5686 |year=2004 |last1=Pacala |first1=S |last2=Socolow |first2=R |bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P |citeseerx=10.1.1.642.8472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at [[Stanford University]] and director of its Atmosphere and Energy program, says that producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible, and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that [[Cost of electricity by source|energy costs]] today with a wind, solar, and water system should be similar to today's energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies.&lt;ref name="enpol2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 |pages=1170–90 |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |journal=Energy Policy |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=2011 |last1=Delucchi |first1=Mark A |last2=Jacobson |first2=Mark Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armaroli | first1 = Nicola | authorlink = Nicola Armaroli | authorlink2 = Vincenzo Balzani | last2 = Balzani | first2 = Vincenzo | year = 2011 | title = Towards an electricity-powered world | url = | journal = [[Energy and Environmental Science]] | volume = 4 | issue = 9| pages = 3193–3222 [3216] | doi = 10.1039/c1ee01249e }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson's conclusions have been disputed by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608126/in-sharp-rebuttal-scientists-squash-hopes-for-100-percent-renewables/ | title = Scientists Sharply Rebut Influential Renewable-Energy Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States, the independent [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has noted that “sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, [[energy security]], and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| date=2010|page=4|publisher=National Academies of Science|isbn=9780309137089  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, [[Sustainable energy|unsustainable energy consumption]], outdated [[energy infrastructure]], and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpd.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Revised.pdf|title=Post Carbon Pathways|author=John Wiseman|date=April 2013|work=University of Melbourne|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper&lt;ref name="sorensen-1975"&gt;

published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]], which was followed by several other proposals.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt; In 1976 [[energy policy]] analyst [[Amory Lovins]] coined the term "[[soft energy path]]" to describe an alternative future where [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and appropriate [[renewable energy]] sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels.&lt;ref name=joshua2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/the-elusive-green-economy/7554/ |title=The Elusive Green Economy |author=Green, Joshua |date=July–August 2009 |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006| title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer" /&gt;

Even in the early 21st century it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity. However, renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then:&lt;ref name=diesrev /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Solar photovoltaic]] modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price. Current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore [[wind power]] is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. [[Concentrated solar thermal]] power (CST) with [[thermal storage]] has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.&lt;ref name=diesrev&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/another-myth-busted-on-the-road-to-100-renewable-electricity-52178 |title=Another Myth Busted on the Road to 100% Renewable Electricity |author=Mark Diesendorf  |date=4 April 2013 |work=Reneweconomy.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11 /&gt; [[Wind turbine]]s generate 39&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Elproduktion|url = https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|website = www.energinet.dk|access-date = 2016-02-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302062337/https://www.energinet.dk/DA/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Termisk-produktion/Sider/Termisk-produktion.aspx|archive-date = 2016-03-02|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country's six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal's 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain's 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy has a history of strong public support. In America, for example, a 2013 [[Gallup survey]] showed that two in three Americans want the U.S. to increase domestic energy production using solar power (76%), wind power (71%), and natural gas (65%). Far fewer want more petroleum production (46%) and more nuclear power (37%). Least favored is coal, with about one in three Americans favouring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/americans-want-more-emphasis-on-solar-wind-natural-gas |title=Americans Want More Emphasis on Solar, Wind, Natural Gas |author=Dennis Jacobe |date=April 9, 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[REN21]] says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a binding 20% by 2020 target for the European Union. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.ren21.net/Portals/0/REN21_GFR_2013_print.pdf |title=Renewables global futures report 2013 |author=REN21 |date=2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] involves substantial accident risks (e.g., [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], [[Chernobyl disaster]]) and the unsolved problem of safe long-term [[high-level radioactive waste management]], and [[carbon capture and storage]] has rather limited safe storage potentials.&lt;ref name="Hohmeyer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/wene.128 |pages=74–97 |title=Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: A paradigm shift in energy policies |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment |volume=4 |year=2015 |last1=Hohmeyer |first1=Olav H |last2=Bohm |first2=Sönke }}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy. A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade, evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas. In recent years, more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.03.038 |pages=270–82 |title=Least cost 100% renewable electricity scenarios in the Australian National Electricity Market |journal=Energy Policy |volume=59 |year=2013 |last1=Elliston |first1=Ben |last2=MacGill |first2=Iain |last3=Diesendorf |first3=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by [[global warming]] and ecological as well as economic concerns, post [[peak oil]].

The first country to propose 100% renewable energy was [[Iceland]], in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |title=Implementation of Green Bookkeeping at Reykjavik Energy |publisher=Rio02.com |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617131226/http://www.rio02.com/proceedings/pdf/031_Gissuarson.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyrichjapan.info/en/welcome.html |title=Energy Rich Japan |publisher=Energyrichjapan.info |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Australia in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |title=Zero Carbon Australia Stationary Energy Plan |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523064256/http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay]] obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=2&amp;pid=2&amp;aid=12 International energy statistics] data for 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower).&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=NO Norway], updated 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet.

This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh.

Cities like [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]] in France, planned to use 100% renewable energy by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Un plan climat met Paris sur la voie de la neutralité carbone |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2018/03/22/un-plan-climat-met-paris-sur-la-voie-de-la-neutralite-carbone_5274533_1652612.html|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=2018-03-21|last1=Roger|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Eurométropole de Strasbourg dévoile son plan climat 2030 |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/climat-environnement/l-eurometropole-de-strasbourg-devoile-son-plan-climat-2030-1509993398|date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2010/11/101109-peak-oil-iea-world-energy-outlook/ |title=Has the World Already Passed "Peak Oil"? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research that has been published in [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support.

Other changes involve use of [[electric car]]s and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | last2 = Delucchi | first2 = Mark A. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1154–1169 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delucchi | first1 = Mark A. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = Mark Z. | year = 2011| title = Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 1170–1190 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Paris Agreement]], countries periodically update their climate change targets for the future, by 2018 no [[g20|G20 country]] had committed to a 100% renewable target.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Brown-to-Green-Report-2018_rev.pdf p21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
''[[The Fourth Revolution: Energy]]'' is a German [[documentary film]] released in 2010. It shows the vision of a global society, which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies, showing a complete reconstruction of the economy, to reach this goal. In 2011, [[Hermann Scheer]] wrote the book ''The Energy Imperative: 100 Percent Renewable Now'', published by Routledge.

''[[Reinventing Fire]]'' is a book by Amory Lovins released in October 2011. By combining reduced energy use with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] gains, Lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy. This can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies, through market forces, led by business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/03/16/amory-lovins-reinventing-fire-convergence-and-innovation?page=full |title=Amory Lovins on 'Reinventing Fire' with convergence and innovation |author=Adam Aston |date=March 16, 2012  |work=Greenbiz }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Clinton]] says the book is a "wise, detailed and comprehensive blueprint".&lt;ref name=nytrf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/fossil-fuels-as-the-whale-oil-of-the-future/ |title=Fossil Fuels as the Whale Oil of the Future |author=Matthew Wald |date=October 27, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first paragraph of the preface says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change. No oil spills, dead coal miners, dirty air, devastated lands, lost wildlife. No energy poverty. No oil-fed wars, tyrannies, or terrorists. Nothing to run out. Nothing to cut off. Nothing to worry about. Just energy abundance, benign and affordable, for all, for ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/reinventing-transforming-capitalism-barriers?newsfeed=true |title=Nine barriers to reinventing capitalism |author=John Elkington |date=21 March 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] has said that [[solar energy]] technologies, in its many forms, can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf|title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.&lt;ref name=ie11 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the refereed journal ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' published two articles by [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a professor of engineering at [[Stanford University]], and research scientist Mark A. Delucchi, about changing our energy supply mix and "Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power". The articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling from wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), which are safe clean options. In Part I, Jacobson and Delucchi discuss WWS energy system characteristics, aspects of energy demand, WWS resource availability, WWS devices needed, and material requirements.&lt;ref name=enpol2010&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part I: Technologies, energy resources, quantities and areas of infrastructure, and materials |author=Mark Z.

In terms of [[solar power]], an additional 49,000 300 MW [[concentrating solar]] plants, 40,000 300 MW [[solar photovoltaic]] power plants, and 1.7 billion 3&amp;nbsp;kW rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed. Such an extensive WWS infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%.&lt;ref name=enpol2010 /&gt;  In Part II, Jacobson and Delucchi address variability of supply, system economics, and energy policy initiatives associated with a WWS system. The authors advocate producing all new energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Energy costs with a WWS system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name="enpol2011" /&gt;

In general, Jacobson has said wind, water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world's energy, eliminating all [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Galbraith. [http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/100-percent-renewables-by-2030/ 100 Percent Renewables by 2030?] ''Green Inc.'', December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mark Z. |last1=Jacobson |first2=M.A. |last2=Delucchi |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030 |journal=[[Scientific American]]   |volume=301 |issue=5  |pages=58–65 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1109-58 |pmid=19873905  |date=November 2009|bibcode=2009SciAm.301e..58J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[University of Delaware]] for a 72 GW system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective, for the [[PJM Interconnection]], would use 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of [[offshore wind]], and 115 GW of onshore wind, although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided. 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2013/dec/renewable-energy-121012.html|title=Wind, solar power paired with storage could be cost-effective way to power grid|work=UDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Denmark's parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity, heat and fuels from renewables by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/03/a-true-all-of-the-above-energy-policy-denmark-affirms-commitment-to-100-renewable-energy-by-2050 |title=A True 'All of the Above' Energy Policy: Denmark Affirms Commitment to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 |author=Stephen Lacey |date=29 March 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind, water and sunlight, for New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Examining the feasibility of converting New York State's all-purpose energy infrastructure to one using wind, water, and sunlight | url = | journal = [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]] | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 585–601 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.02.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | title = A roadmap for repowering California for all purposes with wind, water, and sunlight | year = 2014 | journal = [[Energy (journal)|Energy]] | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 875–889 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = A 100% wind, water, sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy plan for Washington State | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 75–88 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states, by 2050.  {{as of|2014}}, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up, which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states. The 50-state plan is part of [[The Solutions Project]], an independent outreach effort led by Jacobson, actor [[Mark Ruffalo]], and film director [[Josh Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/fifty-states-renewables-022414.html |title=Stanford scientist unveils 50-state plan to transform U.S. to renewable energy |author=Mark Schwarz |date= February 26, 2014  |work=Stanford Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014}}, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by Germany, one of the world's most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major [[energy transition]], [[Energiewende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Transforming power |first1=Andy |last1=Stirling |author-link=Andy Stirling |date=2014 |journal=Energy Research and Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001 |volume=1 |pages=83–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a study was published in ''[[Energy and Environmental Science]]'' that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the United States by 2050 without using biomass. Implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable, as by 2050 it would save about $600 Billion Dollars [[health costs]] a year due to reduced [[air pollution]] and $3.3 Trillion global warming costs. This would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway. According to that study, barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political, as most people didn't know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5EE01283J |pages=2093–117 |title=100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy roadmaps for the 50 United States |journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=8 |issue=7 |year=2015 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bazouin |first3=Guillaume |last4=Bauer |first4=Zack A.

In June 2017, twenty-one researchers published an article in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] rejecting Jacobson's earlier PNAS article, accusing him of modeling errors and of using invalid modeling tools.&lt;ref name=NYT21june17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Eduardo|title=Fisticuffs Over the Route to a Clean-Energy Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/business/energy-environment/renewable-energy-national-academy-matt-jacobson.html|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 June 2017|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1610381114 |pmid=28630353 |pmc=5495221 |title=Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=114 |issue=26 |pages=6722–6727 |year=2017 |last1=Clack |first1=Christopher T.

=== Grid integration simulation ===
In 2015, Jacobson and Delucchi, together with Mary Cameron and Bethany Frew, examined with computer simulation (LOADMATCH), in more detail how a wind-water-solar (WWS) system can track the energy demand from minute to minute. This turned out to be possible in the United States for 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060 Jacobson, M.Z., M.A. Delucchi, M.A. Cameron, and B.A. Frew, ''A low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes'', Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 112 (49) 15060-15065 December 8, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the plan was further developed for 139 countries by a team of 27 researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.joule.2017.07.005 |title=100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World |journal=Joule |volume=1 |pages=108–21 |year=2017 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Bauer |first3=Zack A.F |last4=Goodman |first4=Savannah C |last5=Chapman |first5=William E |last6=Cameron |first6=Mary A |last7=Bozonnat |first7=Cedric |last8=Chobadi |first8=Liat |last9=Clonts |first9=Hailey A |last10=Enevoldsen |first10=Peter |last11=Erwin |first11=Jenny R |last12=Fobi |first12=Simone N |last13=Goldstrom |first13=Owen K |last14=Hennessy |first14=Eleanor M |last15=Liu |first15=Jingyi |last16=Lo |first16=Jonathan |last17=Meyer |first17=Clayton B |last18=Morris |first18=Sean B |last19=Moy |first19=Kevin R |last20=O'Neill |first20=Patrick L |last21=Petkov |first21=Ivalin |last22=Redfern |first22=Stephanie |last23=Schucker |first23=Robin |last24=Sontag |first24=Michael A |last25=Wang |first25=Jingfan |last26=Weiner |first26=Eric |last27=Yachanin |first27=Alexander S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, Jacobson and Delucchi with Mary Cameron and Brian Mathiesen published the LOADMATCH results for 20 regions in which the 139 countries in the world are divided. According to this research, a WWS system can follow the demand in all regions.&lt;ref name="WWS2"&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/WorldGridIntegration.pdf WWS per region]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.009 |title=Matching demand with supply at low cost in 139 countries among 20 world regions with 100% intermittent wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=123 |pages=236–48 |year=2018 |last1=Jacobson |first1=Mark Z |last2=Delucchi |first2=Mark A |last3=Cameron |first3=Mary A |last4=Mathiesen |first4=Brian V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program LOADMATCH receives as input estimated series, per half minute during 2050-2055, of
* the energy demand
* the intermittent wind and solar energy supply predicted with a 3D global climate / weather model GATOR-GCMOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/GATOR/GATOR-GCMOMHist.pdf |title=Data |website=web.stanford.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the hydropower, geothermal, tidal and wave energy
and specifications of
* the capacities and maximum loading / unloading speeds of the different types of storage
* losses due to storage, transport, distribution and maintenance
* a demand-supply management system ([[smart grid]]).

The program has been carried out for each region 10-20 times with adapted input for the storage capacities, until a solution was found in which the energy demand was followed, per half minute for 5 years, with low costs.

The WWS system is assumed to connect in the electric network
* geographically dispersed variable energy sources, [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) and hydro power
* storage facilities: [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]], as heat in CSP plants, in batteries, as hydrogen by electrolysis of water, or as compressed air underground.

Although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy; it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases, as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | authorlink = Mark Z.

== Obstacles ==
The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies, at the pace required to prevent [[runaway climate change]], are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are:&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* [[Climate change denial]]
* [[Fossil fuels lobby|Efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry]]
* Political paralysis
* Unsustainable consumption of energy and resources
* Path dependencies and outdated infrastructure
* Financial and governance constraints
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[NASA]] Climate scientist [[James Hansen]] discusses the problem with rapid [[fossil fuel phase-out|phase out of fossil fuels]] and said that while it is conceivable in places such as New Zealand and Norway, "suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the [[Easter Bunny]] and [[Tooth Fairy]]."&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html|title=Nuclear energy and climate change: Environmentalists debate how to stop global warming.|work=Slate Magazine|date=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=James|title=Baby Lauren and the Kool-Aid|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2011/20110729_BabyLauren.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2013|authorlink=James Hansen|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of Jacobson and colleagues, and writing in an issue of ''Spectrum'' prepared by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], he identified numerous points of concern, such as cost, intermittent power supply, growing [[NIMBY]]ism, and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that "History and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed."&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0|title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy|author=Vaclav Smil|work=ieee.org|date=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smil and Hansen are concerned about the [[variable renewable energy|variable output]] of solar and wind power, but American physicist Amory Lovins has said that the [[electricity grid]] can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.&lt;ref name=lovi12&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |issue=March/April 2012 |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |journal=Foreign Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 American academic Dr. Gregory Unruh published a dissertation identifying the systemic barriers to the adoption and diffusion of renewable energy technologies. This theoretical framework was called [[Carbon lock-in|Carbon Lock-in]] and pointed to the creation of self-reinforcing feedbacks that arise through the co-evolution of large technological systems, like electricity and transportation networks, with the social and political institutions that support and benefit from system growth. Once established, these techno-institutional complexes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/pls/portallive/docs/1/7294726.PDF |title=Microsoft Word - Lock-in_Foxon_final.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; become "locked-in" and resist efforts to transform them towards more environmentally sustainable systems based on renewable sources.

[[Lester R. Brown]] founder and president of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C., says a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy is both possible and necessary. Brown compares with the U.S. entry into World War II and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the US industry and economy. A quick transition to 100% renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by Brown to follow an approach with similar urgency.&lt;ref name="Plan B 4.0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/pb4book.pdf |title=Plan B 4.0, Mobilizing to Save Civilization  |author=Lester R. Brown |date=2009 |work=Earth Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt; The issue of [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent supply]] applies to popular renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when [[dispatchable generation]] such as hydroelectricity or solar thermal storage is also available. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/so_contribution.pdf|title=Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the world's leading climate researchers selected by the United Nations, said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17" /&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 22"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |date=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years.&lt;ref name=ipccccc /&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with their [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|fifth report]], saying that in the absence of any one technology (such as bioenergy, [[carbon dioxide capture and storage]], nuclear, wind and solar), climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent. For example, it may cost 40% more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture. (Table 3.2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/|title=IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|work=ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change|title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change|publisher=|date=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16604">[[File:Sumerian Calendar ISO B0.svg|thumb|right|300px|Sumerian Metrology]]

'''Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement''' originated in the loosely organized city-states of [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic]] [[Sumer]].  Each [[city]], [[Monarchy|kingdom]] and trade [[guild]] had its own standards until the formation of the [[Akkadian Empire]] when [[Sargon of Akkad]] issued a common standard.  This standard was improved by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], but fell into disuse after the Akkadian Empire dissolved.  The standard of Naram-Sin was readopted in the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III period]] by the [[Nanše Hymn]] which reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings.  Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.  Akkado-Sumerian [[metrology]] has been reconstructed by applying statistical methods to compare [[Sumerian architecture]], [[architectural plan]]s, and issued official standards such as [[Statues of Gudea|Statue B of Gudea]] and the bronze [[cubit]] of [[Nippur]].

==Archaic system==
[[File:Gudea of Lagash Girsu.png|thumbnail|right|[[Statues of Gudea|Gudea Statue I]] carved diorite ]]
The systems that would later become the classical standard for Mesopotamia were developed in parallel with writing during [[Uruk period|Uruk Period Sumer]] (c 4000 BCE).  Studies of [[Cuneiform|protocuneiform]] indicate twelve separate counting systems used in Uruk.  
* '''Sexagesimal System S''' used to count slaves, animals, fish, wooden objects, stone objects, containers.
* '''Sexagesimal System S'''' used to count dead animals, certain types of beer
* '''Bi-Sexagesimal System B''' used to count cereal, bread, fish, milk products
* '''Bi-Sexagesimal System B&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' used to count rations
* '''GAN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; System G''' used to count field measurement
* '''ŠE system Š''' used to count barley by volume
* '''ŠE system Š'''' used to count malt by volume
* '''ŠE system Š"''' used to count wheat by volume
* '''ŠE System Š&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' used to count barley groats
* '''EN System E''' used to count weight
* '''U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; System U''' used to count calendrics
* '''DUG&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; System Db''' used to count milk by volume
* '''DUG&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; System Db''' used to count beer by volume
 
In Early Dynastic Sumer (c 2900–2300 BCE) [[metrology]] and mathematics were indistinguishable and treated as a single scribal discipline.  The idea of an abstract number did not yet exist, thus all quantities were written as metrological symbols and never as [[numeral system|numeral]]s followed by a unit symbol.  For example there was a symbol for one-sheep and another for one-day but no symbol for one.  About 600 of these metrological symbols exist, for this reason archaic Sumerian metrology is complex and not fully understood.&lt;ref name="Melville 2006"&gt;Melville 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general however, length, volume, and mass are derived from a theoretical standard cube, called 'gur', filled with barley, wheat, water, or oil.  The mass of a gur-cube, called 'gun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is defined as the weight a laden [[donkey|ass]] can carry.  However, because of the different [[specific gravities]] of these substances combined with dual numerical bases ([[sexagesimal]] or [[decimal]]), multiple sizes of the gur-cube were used without consensus.  The different gur-cubes are related by proportion, based on the water gur-cube, according to four basic coefficients and their cubic roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  These coefficients are given as:

*'''Komma''' =  &lt;math&gt;80/81&lt;/math&gt; correction when planning rations with a 360-day year
*'''Leimma''' =  &lt;math&gt;24/25&lt;/math&gt; conversion from decimal to a sexagesimal number system
*'''Diesis''' =  &lt;math&gt;15/16&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Euboic''' =  &lt;math&gt;5/6&lt;/math&gt;

One official government standard of measurement of the archaic system was the '''Cubit of Nippur''' (2650 BCE).  It is a Euboic ''Mana'' + 1 Diesis (432'''g''').{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  This standard is the main reference used by archaeologists to reconstruct the system.

==Classical system==
[[File:Royal gur.svg|thumb|right|300px|Royal Gur Cube of Naram-Sin]]
A major improvement came in 2150 BCE during the [[Akkadian Empire]] under the reign of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] when the competing systems were unified by a single official standard, the royal gur-cube.&lt;ref name="Powell 1995, p.1955"&gt;Powell 1995, p.1955.&lt;/ref&gt;  His reform is considered the first standardized system of measure in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Powell 1995, p.1955" /&gt;  The royal gur-cube ([[Cuneiform]]: LU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.GAL.GUR, {{cuneiform|&amp;#x1221A;}}{{cuneiform|&amp;#x12125;}}; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''šarru kurru'') was a theoretical cuboid of water approximately 6'''m''' × 6'''m''' × 0.5'''m''' from which all other units could be derived.  The [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Neo-Sumerians]] continued use of the royal gur-cube as indicated by the [[Letter of Nanse]] issued in 2000 BCE by [[Gudea]] .  Use of the same standard continued through the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]], and [[Persian Empire]]s.&lt;ref name="Melville 2006" /&gt;

===Length===
Units of length are prefixed by the logogram DU ({{cuneiform|&amp;#x1207A;}}) a convention of the archaic period counting system from which it was evolved.  Basic length was used in architecture and field division.

===Time===

{{main|Babylonian calendar}}
In the Archaic System time notation was written in the '''U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; System U'''.  Multiple [[lunisolar calendar]]s existed; however the civil calendar from the holy city of [[Nippur]] ([[Ur III period]]) was adopted by Babylon as their civil calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The calendar of Nippur dates to 3500 BCE and was itself based on older astronomical knowledge of an uncertain origin.  The main astronomical cycles used to construct the calendar were the [[synodic month]], [[equinox year]], and [[sidereal day]].

==Relationship to other metrologies==
The Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.&lt;ref&gt;Conder 1908, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18503">An '''autonomous robot''' is a [[robot]] that performs [[Behavior-based robotics|behaviors]] or tasks with a high degree of [[autonomy]]. Autonomous robotics is usually considered to be a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], and [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomous robots are particularly desirable in fields such as [[spaceflight]], household maintenance (such as cleaning), [[waste water treatment]], and delivering goods and services.

Some modern [[factory robot]]s are "autonomous" within the strict confines of their direct environment. It may not be that every [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory [[robot]]'s workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. This can vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view).

One important area of robotics research is to enable the robot to cope with its environment whether this be on land, underwater, in the air, underground, or in [[outer space|space]].

A fully autonomous robot can{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}:
* Gain information about the environment
* Work for an extended period without human intervention
* Move either all or part of itself throughout its operating environment without human assistance
* [[Three Laws of Robotics|Avoid situations that are harmful to people]], property, or itself unless those are part of its design specifications

An autonomous robot may also learn or gain new knowledge like adjusting for new methods of accomplishing its tasks or adapting to changing surroundings.

Like other machines, autonomous robots still require regular maintenance.

== Examples ==

=== Self-maintenance ===
&lt;!-- [[Image:PeopleGuide.jpg|left|thumb|Exteroceptive sensors: 1. blue laser rangefinder senses up to 360 distance readings in a 180-degree slice; 2. 24 round golden ultrasonic sensors sample range readings in a 15-degree cone; 3. ten touch panels along the bottom detect shoes and other low-lying objects. 4. break beams between the lower and upper segments sense tables and other mid-level obstacles.]] --&gt;

The first requirement for complete physical autonomy is the ability for a robot to take care of itself. Many of the battery-powered robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony's ''[[Aibo]]'' are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.

Self-maintenance is based on "proprioception", or sensing one's own internal status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low and it then seeks the charger. Another common proprioceptive sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common proprioceptive sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, as well as the [[Hall effect]] (electric).

[[Image:MobileEyesIntel.jpg|right|thumb|Robot GUI display showing battery voltage and other proprioceptive data in lower right-hand corner. The display is for user information only. Autonomous robots monitor and respond to [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] sensors without human intervention to keep themselves safe and operating properly.]]

=== Sensing the environment ===
Exteroception is sensing things about the environment. Autonomous robots must have a range of environmental sensors to perform their task and stay out of trouble.

*Common exteroceptive sensors include the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], [[sound]], touch, chemical (smell, [[odor]]), temperature, range to various objects, and [[altitude]].

Some robotic lawn mowers will adapt their programming by detecting the speed in which grass grows as needed to maintain a perfectly cut lawn, and some vacuum cleaning robots have dirt detectors that sense how much dirt is being picked up and use this information to tell them to stay in one area longer.

=== Task performance ===
The next step in autonomous behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small vacuuming robots beginning with [[iRobot]] and [[Electrolux]] in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.

The next level of autonomous task performance requires a robot to perform conditional tasks. For instance, security robots can be programmed to detect intruders and respond in a particular way depending upon where the intruder is.

=== Autonomous navigation ===

==== Indoor navigation ====

For a robot to associate behaviors with a place ([[robot localization|localization]]) requires it to know where it is and to be able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based [[triangulation]]. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' [[PatrolBot]] and autonomous wheelchair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activrobots.com/ "Principal Investigator: W. Kennedy"], [[National Institutes of Health]], NIH SBIR 2 R44 HD041781-02&lt;/ref&gt; both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.

At first, autonomous navigation was based on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only sense at one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.

Rather than climb stairs, which requires highly specialized hardware, most indoor robots navigate handicapped-accessible areas, controlling elevators, and electronic doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm "Speci-Minder; see elevator and door access"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053209/http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm |date=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such electronic access-control interfaces, robots can now freely navigate indoors. Autonomously climbing stairs and opening doors manually are topics of research at the current time.

As these indoor techniques continue to develop, vacuuming robots will gain the ability to clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots will be able to cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots' internal maps typically permit "forbidden areas" to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.

==== Outdoor navigation ====

Outdoor autonomy is most easily achieved in the air, since obstacles are rare. [[Cruise missile]]s are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using radio remote control. Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however.  An autonomous ship was announced in 2014—the [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship]]—and is scheduled to make its first operational test in December 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20141117&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Bergin|first1=Chris |title=Pad 39A – SpaceX laying the groundwork for Falcon Heavy debut |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/11/pad-39a-spacex-groundwork-falcon-heavy-debut/ |accessdate=2014-11-17 |work=NASA Spaceflight |date=2014-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2014|12}}

Outdoor autonomy is the most difficult for ground vehicles, due to:
* Three-dimensional terrain
* Great disparities in surface density
* Weather exigencies
* Instability of the sensed environment

[[Image:smSeekurMDARS.jpg|thumb|The Seekur and MDARS robots demonstrate their autonomous navigation and security capabilities at an airbase.]]
The Seekur robot was the first commercially available robot to demonstrate MDARS-like capabilities for general use by airports, utility plants, corrections facilities and [[Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293390,00.html "Weapons Makers Unveil New Era of Counter-Terror Equipment"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars rovers MER-A and MER-B (now known as [[Spirit rover]] and [[Opportunity rover]]) can find the position of the sun and navigate their own routes to destinations on the fly by:

* Mapping the surface with 3D vision
* Computing safe and unsafe areas on the surface within that field of vision
* Computing optimal paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving along the calculated route;
* Repeating this cycle until either the destination is reached, or there is no known path to the destination

The planned ESA Rover, ExoMars Rover, is capable of vision based relative localisation and absolute localisation to autonomously navigate safe and efficient trajectories to targets by:

* Reconstructing 3D models of the terrain surrounding the Rover using a pair of stereo cameras
* Determining safe and unsafe areas of the terrain and the general "difficulty" for the Rover to navigate the terrain
* Computing efficient paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving the Rover along the planned path
* Building up a navigation map of all previous navigation data

During the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge in 2016, a rover, named Cataglyphis, successfully demonstrated fully autonomous navigation, decision-making, and sample detection, retrieval, and return capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/feature/2016_sample_return_robot_challenge_award.html|title=NASA Awards $750K in Sample Return Robot Challenge|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2016-09-08|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover relied on a fusion of measurements from inertial sensors, wheel encoders, Lidar, and camera for navigation and mapping, instead of using GPS or magnetometers. During the 2 hour challenge, Cataglyphis traversed over 2.6&amp;nbsp;km and returned five different samples to its starting position.

The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] and [[DARPA Urban Challenge]] have encouraged development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while this has been the demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 as part of the AUVSI [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]].

Between 2013 and 2017, [[Total S.A.]] has held the [[ARGOS Challenge]] to develop the first autonomous robot for oil and gas production sites. The robots had to face adverse outdoor conditions such as rain, wind and extreme temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced Safety Thanks to the ARGOS Challenge|url=http://www.total.com/en/media/news/news/enhanced-safety-thanks-argos-challenge?folder=7692|website=Total Website|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open problems in autonomous robotics ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
There are several open problems in autonomous robotics which are special to the field rather than being a part of the general pursuit of AI. According to George A. Bekey's ''Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control'', problems include things such as making sure the robot is able to function correctly and not run into obstacles autonomously.

=== Energy autonomy and foraging ===
Researchers concerned with creating true [[artificial life]] are concerned not only with intelligent control, but further with the capacity of the robot to find its own resources through [[foraging]] (looking for [[food]], which includes both [[energy]] and spare parts).

This is related to '''autonomous foraging''', a concern within the [[science]]s of [[behavioral ecology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[human behavioral ecology]]; as well as [[robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], and [[artificial life]].

== Delivery robot==
A delivery robot is an autonomous robot used for delivering goods. As of February 2017 there were several notable companies developing delivery robots (some with pilot deliveries in progress):

===Legislature===

In March 2016 a bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B21-0673 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2016|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B21-0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was to take place from September 15 through the end of December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/its-official-drone-delivery-is-coming-to-d-c-in-september/|title=It’s official: Drone delivery is coming to D.C. in September|first=Brian|last=Fung|date=24 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B22-0019 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2017|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B22-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 a bill was passed in the US state of [[Virginia]] (the House bill, HB2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate bill, SB1207&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1207&lt;/ref&gt;) that will allow autonomous delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017. The robots will be limited to a maximum speed of 10&amp;nbsp;mph and maximum weight of 50 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14782518/virginia-robot-law-first-state-delivery-starship|title=Virginia is the first state to pass a law allowing robots to deliver straight to your door|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the states of Idaho and Florida there are also talks about passing similar legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/capitol-watch/bill-allowing-robots-to-make-deliveries-heads-to-idaho-house/416300359|title=Could delivery robots be on their way to Idaho?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/01/25/florida-senator-proposes-rules-for-tiny-personal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been discussed that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.

In November 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that companies would need to get a city permit in order to test these robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/san-francisco-just-put-the-brakes-on-delivery-robots/|title=San Francisco Just Put the Brakes on Delivery Robots|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sidewalk delivery robots have been banned from making non-research deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/12/6/16743326/san-francisco-delivery-robot-ban|title=San Francisco bans robots from most sidewalks|last=Brinklow|first=Adam|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Curbed]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1874">In U.S. law, the '''bad tendency''' principle is a test which permits restriction of [[freedom of speech]] by government if it is believed that a form of speech has a sole tendency to incite or cause illegal activity. The principle, formulated in ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'', (1907) was seemingly overturned with the "[[clear and present danger]]" principle used in the landmark case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919), as stated by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] Yet eight months later, at the start of the next term in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' (1919) the Court again used the bad tendency test to uphold the conviction of a Russian immigrant who published and distributed leaflets calling for a [[general strike]] and otherwise advocated revolutionary, anarchist, and socialist views. Holmes dissented in ''Abrams'', explaining how the ''clear and present danger test'' should be employed to overturn Abrams' conviction. The arrival of the "bad tendency" test resulted in a string of [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] rulings such as ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' (1927), where a woman was convicted simply because of her association with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. The court ruled unanimously that although she had not committed any crimes, her relationship with the Communists represented a "bad tendency" and thus was unprotected. The "bad tendency" test was finally overturned in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969) and was replaced by the "[[imminent lawless action]]" test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3480">In [[projective geometry]], the '''circular points at infinity'''  (also called '''cyclic points''' or '''isotropic points''') are two special [[point at infinity|points at infinity]] in the [[complex projective plane]] that are contained in the [[complexification]] of every real [[circle]].

==Coordinates==
A point of the complex projective plane may be described in terms of [[homogeneous coordinates]], being a triple of [[complex number]]s {{nowrap|(''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'')}}, where two triples describe the same point of the plane when the coordinates of one triple are the same as those of the other aside from being multiplied by the same nonzero factor.  In this system, the points at infinity may be chosen as those whose ''z''-coordinate is zero.  The two circular points at infinity are two of these, usually taken to be those with homogeneous coordinates
:{{nowrap|(1 : i : 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1 : &amp;minus;i : 0)}}.

==Complexified circles==
A real circle, defined by its center point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and radius ''r'' (all three of which are [[real number]]s) may be described as the set of real solutions to the equation
:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Converting this into a [[homogeneous equation]] and taking the set of all complex-number solutions gives the complexification of the circle. The two circular points have their name because they lie on the complexification of every real circle. More generally, both points satisfy the homogeneous equations of the type 
:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Ay^2 + 2B_1xz + 2B_2yz - Cz^2 = 0. &lt;/math&gt; 
The case where the coefficients are all real gives the equation of a general  circle (of the [[real projective plane]]). In general, an [[algebraic curve]] that passes through these two points is called [[Circular algebraic curve|circular]].

==Additional properties==
The circular points at infinity are the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]] of the [[isotropic line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Springer (1964) ''Geometry and Analysis of Projective Spaces'', page 141, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are [[Fixed point (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[translation]]s and [[rotation]]s of the plane.

The concept of [[angle]] can be defined using the circular points, [[natural logarithm]] and [[cross-ratio]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Duncan Sommerville]] (1914) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABN6053.0001.001/1?rgn=works;view=pdf;rgn1=author;q1=Sommerville Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry], page 157, link from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;
:The angle between two lines is a certain multiple of the logarithm of the cross-ratio of the pencil formed by the two lines and the lines joining their intersection to the circular points.
Sommerville configures two lines on the origin as &lt;math&gt;u : y = x \tan \theta, \quad u' : y = x \tan \theta ' .&lt;/math&gt; Denoting the circular points as ''&amp;omega;'' and &amp;omega;''′, he obtains the cross ratio
:&lt;math&gt;(u u' , \omega \omega ') = \frac{\tan \theta - i}{\tan \theta + i} \div \frac{\tan \theta ' - i}{\tan \theta ' + i} ,&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \theta ' - \theta = \tfrac{i}{2} \log (u u', \omega \omega ') .&lt;/math&gt;

'''Coming out of the closet''', or simply '''coming out''', is a [[metaphor]] for [[LGBT]] people's [[self-disclosure]] of their [[sexual orientation]] or of their [[gender identity]]. The term ''coming out'' can also be used in various non-LGBT applications (e.g. [[atheists]]).

Framed and debated as a [[privacy]] issue, coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey;&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825202112/http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[decision-making]] or [[Risk|risk-taking]]; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a [[speech act]] and a matter of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]; a [[rite of passage]]; [[liberty|liberation]] or [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]]; an [[wikt:ordeal|ordeal]];&lt;ref&gt;''Belfast Telegraph'': [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/gaa-star-donal-og-cusack-teammates-helped-me-through-ordeal-of-revealing-i-am-gay-14536491.html "GAA star Donal Og Cusack: Teammates helped me through ordeal of revealing I am gay," October 20, 2009], accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a means toward feeling [[gay pride]] instead of [[shame]] and [[social stigma]]; or even career suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Queerty: [http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ Japhy Grant, "Rupert Everett Says Coming Out Killed His Career," February 20, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015003811/http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ |date=October 15, 2010 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Steven Seidman]] writes that "it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal, social, and political drama in twentieth-century America".&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Steven (2003). ''Beyond the Closet; The Transformation of Gay and Lesbian Life'', 25, {{ISBN|0-415-93207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argues that the process of  "coming out" does not free gay people from oppression. Although they may feel free to act as themselves, the opacity involved in entering a non-heterosexual territory insinuates judgment upon their identity, she argues in ''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1991).

''Coming out of the closet'' is the source of other [[gay slang]] expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are ''out'', i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as [[Closeted|closeted or being in the closet]]. [[Outing]] is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, ''outing oneself'' is self-disclosure. ''Glass closet'' means the [[open secret]] of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out.&lt;ref&gt;''OUT'' magazine: [http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet Michael Musto, "The Glass Closet," September 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705232840/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet |date=July 5, 2012 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of LGBT history}}
[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs.jpg|thumb|19th-century gay rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of coming out as a means of emancipation.]]
In 1869, one hundred years before the [[Stonewall riots]], the German homosexual rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of self-disclosure as a means of [[emancipation]]. Claiming that invisibility was a major obstacle toward changing [[public opinion]], he urged homosexual people to reveal their same-sex attractions. In his 1906 work, ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'' (''The Sexual Life of Our Time in its Relation to Modern Civilization''),&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Ivan. ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'', 1906. English translation: ''The Sexual Life of Our Time in Its Relations to Modern Civilization'', 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwan Bloch]], a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. In 1914, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] revisited the topic in his major work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', discussing the social and legal potentials of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson&amp;Percy, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine ''Politics'', he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 "Robert Duncan and Romantic Synthesis: A Few Notes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906020604/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 |date=2010-09-06 }}. This article also republished as "On Robert Duncan" at Modern American Poetry website&lt;/ref&gt; The decidedly clandestine [[Mattachine Society]], founded by [[Harry Hay]] and other veterans of the [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace for President]] campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging from the closet.

In 1951, [[Donald Webster Cory]]&lt;ref name=sagarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html|title=Donald Webster Cory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |publisher= [[glbtq.com]]|author=|date=|website=glbtq.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |title=Sagarin bio |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=1913-09-18 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published his landmark ''The Homosexual in America'', exclaiming, "Society has handed me a mask to wear...Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend." Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent [[homophile]] movement.

In the 1960s, [[Frank Kameny]] came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service in 1957 for homosexual behavior, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, "we must instill in the [[LGBT community|homosexual community]] a sense of worth to the individual homosexual", which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves.
With the spread of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the [[gay liberation]] movement to raise [[political consciousness]] to counter heterosexism and homophobia. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian [[social support]] discussion groups, some of which were called "coming-out groups", focused on sharing coming-out "stories" (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and [[Gay pride|pride]].

== Sociolinguistic origin ==
The present-day expression "coming out" is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an [[analogy]] that likens homosexuals' introduction into [[gay subculture]] to a [[débutante]]'s ''coming-out party.'' This is a celebration for a young [[upper-class]] woman who is making her début&amp;nbsp;– her formal presentation to society&amp;nbsp;– because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian [[George Chauncey]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]... did not speak of coming out of what we call the gay closet but rather of coming out ''into'' what they called homosexual society or the gay world, a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor... so hidden as closet implies&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey, George (1994). ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. New York: Basic Books, emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, "using the term 'closet' to refer to" previous times such as "the 1920s and 1930s might be [[anachronism|anachronistic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Elizabeth. "'But We Would Never Talk about It': The Structure of Lesbian Discretion in South Dakota, 1928–1933" in ''Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America'', ed. Ellen Lewin (1996). Boston: Beacon Press. p.25 and 214&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on coming out&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|title=Coming Out, accessed on Aug 31, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014140942/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the online encyclopedia [[glbtq.com]] states that [[sexologist]] [[Evelyn Hooker]]'s observations introduced the use of "coming out" to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in [[connotation]] occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on ''entrance'' into "a new world of hope and communal solidarity" whereas the post-[[Stonewall Riots]] overtone was an ''exit'' from the oppression of the closet.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; This change in focus suggests that "coming out ''of the closet''" is a [[mixed metaphor]] that joins "coming out" with the [[Coming out#Closeted|closet]] metaphor: an evolution of "[[wikt:skeleton in the closet|skeleton in the closet]]" specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's [[sexual orientation]]. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.

== Identity issues ==
{{See also|Identity (social science)|Personal identity}}

When coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey,&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"/&gt; it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's gender identity or non-heteronormative sexual orientation. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|title=Gay Epiphany|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014093757/http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often called "coming out to oneself" and constitutes the start of [[self-acceptance]]. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during [[adolescence]] or [[childhood]], when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are [[Heterosexism|assumed to be heterosexual]] or [[cisgender]], such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time".

=== LGBT identity development ===
{{Main|Sexual identity#Models of sexual identity development}}
Every coming out story is the person trying to come to terms with who they are and their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chirrey|first=Deborah|title=I Hereby Come Out: What Sort Of Speech Act Is Coming Out?|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–37|doi=10.1111/1467-9481.00209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the [[Cass identity model]] established by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325110617/http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.&lt;ref&gt;Salon: [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/24/gay_teens/ Amy Benfer, "We're here! We're queer!

Emerging research suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While further research is needed to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2015). Online Coming Out Communications between Gay Men and their Religious Family Allies: A Family of Choice and Origin Perspective, Journal of GLBT Family Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender and transsexual communities ===
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

== Legal issues ==
{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}

In areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute [[self-incrimination]]. These laws still exist in 76 countries worldwide, including Egypt, Iran, Singapore, and Afghanistan.

== Effects ==
In the early stages of the lesbian, gay or bisexual identity development process, people feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''[[Queer in America]]'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.&lt;ref&gt;re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because LGBT people have historically been marginalized as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] of [[heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and [[homophobic]] [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].

On the personal and relationship levels, effects of not coming out have been the subject of studies. For example, it has been found that same-sex couples who have not come out are not as satisfied in their relationships as same-sex couples who have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2392712 |year=1990 |last1=Berger |first1=RM |title=Passing: Impact on the quality of same-sex couple relationships |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=328–32 |journal=Social work}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Findings from another study indicate that the fewer people know about a lesbian's sexual orientation, the more anxiety, less positive affectivity, and lower self-esteem she has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9524921 |year=1998 |last1=Jordan |first1=KM |last2=Deluty |first2=RH |title=Coming out for lesbian women: Its relation to anxiety, positive affectivity, self-esteem, and social support |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=41–63 |doi=10.1300/J082v35n02_03 |journal=Journal of Homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, Gay.com states that closeted individuals are reported to be at increased risk for [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070506131301/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007%2F05%2F04%2F1 Gay.com News], [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AEEZU_q-zA0EJ%3Awww.smartsextalk.com%2FPDF%2F0706_suicide.pdf+%22Closeted+men+at+suicide+risk%22+%22A+recent+Australian+survey+revealed%22&amp;gl=us Study: Closeted men at suicide risk]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cath Pope, ''Gay.com Australia'', May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the relational bond between parents and children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between children and their parents may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Nielsen|title=Father-Daughter Relationships: Contemporary Research and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0BLxVDTpOoC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-933-9|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people coming out are accepted by their parents, this allows open discussions of dating and relationships and allows parents to help their children with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="LamannaRiedmann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Lamanna|author2=Agnes Riedmann|author3=Ann Strahm|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heu0KLoVVnMC&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30154-5|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have been done on the effect of people coming out to their parents. A 1989 report by Robinson et al. of parents of out gay and lesbian children in the United States found that 21% of fathers and 28% of mothers had suspected that their child was gay or lesbian, largely based on gender atypical behaviour during childhood. The 1989 study found that two-thirds of parents reacted negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=BE|author2=Walters, LH |author3=Skeen, P |title=Response of parents to learning that their child is homosexual and concern over AIDS: a national study.|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1989|volume=18|issue=1-2|pages=59–80|pmid=2794499|doi=10.1300/j082v18n01_03}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study (that used young people's reactions) found that half of the mothers of gay or bisexual male college students "responded with disbelief, denial or negative comments" while fathers reacted slightly better. 18% of parents reacted "with acts of intolerance, attempts to convert the child to heterosexuality, and verbal threats to cut off financial or emotional support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savin-Williams|first=Ritch|author2=Eric M.

Homelessness is a common effect among LGBT youth during the coming out process. LGBT youth are among the largest population of homeless youth; this has typically been caused by the self-identification and acknowledgment of being gay or identifying with the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tierney|first=William G.|last2=Ward|first2=James Dean|date=2017-12|title=Coming Out and Leaving Home: A Policy and Research Agenda for LGBT Homeless Students|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/10.3102/0013189X17733964|journal=Educational Researcher|language=en|volume=46|issue=9|pages=498–507|doi=10.3102/0013189x17733964|issn=0013-189X}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20% to 30% of homeless youth identify as LGBT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kyu|first=Choi, Soon|last2=DM|first2=Wilson, Bianca|last3=Jama|first3=Shelton,|last4=J|first4=Gates, Gary|date=2015-06-01|title=Serving Our Youth 2015: The Needs and Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Experiencing Homelessness|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of LGBQ and 67% of transgender youth are forced out of their homes by their parents or run away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Homelessness among LGBT youth also impacts many areas of an individual's life, leading to higher rates of victimization, depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, and participation in more illegal and dangerous activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reck|first=Jen|date=2009-07-20|title=Homeless Gay and Transgender Youth of Color in San Francisco: "No One Likes Street Kids"—Even in the Castro|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19361650903013519|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|language=en|volume=6|issue=2-3|pages=223–242|doi=10.1080/19361650903013519|issn=1936-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on homelessness pathways among Latino LGBT youth found that homelessness among LGBT individuals can also be attributed to structural issues like systems of care and sociocultural and economic factors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castellanos|first=H.

Jimmie Manning performed a study in 2015 on positive and negative behavior performed during the coming out conversation. During his study, he learned that almost all of his participants would only attribute negative behaviors with themselves during the coming out conversations and positive behaviors with the recipient of the conversation. Manning suggests further research into this to figure out a way for positive behaviors to be seen and performed equally by both the recipient and the individual coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manning|first1=Jimmie|title=Positive and Negative Communicative Behaviors in Coming-out Conversations|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2015|volume=62|issue=1|pages=61–97|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2014.957127#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzAwOTE4MzY5LjIwMTQuOTU3MTI3QEBAMA==|doi=10.1080/00918369.2014.957127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In/out metaphors ==

=== Dichotomy ===
The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out" wherein those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst [[Judith Butler]] (1991) states that the ''in/out'' metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false and that being out in the "light of illumination" reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that "it is possible to argue that...there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or [[category mistake]]s...to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency".

=== Criticisms ===
In addition Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time". Further, "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".

Furthermore, Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appears to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life.  However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

== National Coming Out Day ==
{{Main|National Coming Out Day}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Logo ncod lg.png|thumb|National Coming Out Day logo, designed by artist [[Keith Haring]].]] --&gt;

Observed annually on October 11,&lt;ref name="HRC_NCOD"&gt;{{cite web   | title = History of National Coming Out Day   | publisher = Human Rights Campaign   | url = http://www.hrc.org/issues/3338.htm   | doi =    | accessdate = 2008-10-17   | deadurl = no   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012081415/http://www.hrc.org/issues/3338.htm   | archivedate = 2008-10-12   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the [[LGBT community|LGBT communities]] and their [[Straight ally|straight allies]], National Coming Out Day is a civil [[Raising awareness|awareness]] day for coming out and discussing LGBT issues among the general populace in an effort to give a familiar face to the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]]. This day was the inspiration for holding [[LGBT History Month]] in the United States in October. The day was founded in 1988, by Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and [[Jean O'Leary]] to celebrate the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on [[Washington, DC]], United States, for gay and lesbian equality. In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of [[LGBT parenting|LGBT families]] living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named "''National'' Coming Out Day", it is observed in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland also on October 11, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on October 11, 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: ''[[Being Out Rocks]]''. Participating artists include [[Kevin Aviance]], [[Janis Ian]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

=== Depictions of coming out ===
{{see also|:Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films}}

In 1996, the acclaimed British film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' had a positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity. In 1987, a two-part episode of the [[Quebec]] television series ''[[Avec un grand A]]'', “Lise, Pierre et Marcel”, depicted a married closeted man who has to come out when his wife discovers that he has been having an affair with another man. In the [[Emmy Award]]-nominated episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]" of ''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'', Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.

[[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s coming out in the media as well as an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', "[[The Puppy Episode]]", "ranks, hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history", changing media portrayals of [[lesbian]]s in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Streitmatter, Rodger (2009). From 'Perverts' to 'Fab Five': The Media's Changing Depiction of Gay Men and Lesbians, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7890-3670-3}}; p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Russell T Davies]]'s [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|''Queer as Folk'']], a popular TV series shown on Channel 4 (UK) debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the processes of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the U.S. version of ''Queer As Folk'', which debuted in 2000.

The television show ''[[The L Word]]'', which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women, and the theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.

''[[Coming Out Serie|Coming Out]]'', which debuted in 2013, is the first [[Quebec]] television program about being gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|title=Coming out – Première série web sur l’univers gai québécois|work=Info-Culture.biz|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014184911/http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 of the Norwegian Teen drama series [[Skam (TV series)|SKAM]] focused on a main character coming out and his relationship with another boy.

''[[Love, Simon]]'', based on the book, [[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]], debuted in 2018, and is the first major studio film about a gay teenager coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|title=Love, Simon Is a Charming Gay Studio Movie That Makes Us Hungry for More|last=Lawson|first=Richard|work=HWD|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221724/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|archivedate=2018-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended use in LGBT media, publishing and activism ==
"Out" is a common word or prefix used in the titles of LGBT-themed books, films, periodicals, organizations, and TV programs. Some high-profile examples are [[Out (magazine)|Out Magazine]], the defunct [[OutWeek|OutWeek Magazine]], and [[OutTV (Canada)|OutTV]].

== Non-LGBT applications ==
In political, casual, or even humorous contexts, "coming out" means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, identities, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring [[shame]]. Some examples include: "coming out as an alcoholic",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |title=The show must go on |publisher=Guardian |date=2001-11-03 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |location=London |first=Louis |last=Theroux |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224171957/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM#Coming out|coming out as a BDSM participant]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|title=Coming out BDSM: upsides and downsides|work=Clarisse Thorn|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141010032330/http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out of the broom closet" (as a [[witchcraft|witch]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=How do I tell my family I'm a Wiccan? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64qzmH4oD?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence/2003/12/witch_way.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "coming out as a conservative",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm Coming-out day for conservatives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206100727/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as disabled",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|title=Coming out as disabled - Ekklesia|work=ekklesia.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627142409/http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|archivedate=2015-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a liberal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |title=Layout 1 (Page A1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102092533/http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[intersex]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|title=The LA radio host who came out as intersex and why no one gossiped|work=Gay Star News|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013081549/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2multiples.com/compd/ |title=COMPD&amp;nbsp;– Introduction |publisher=2multiples.com |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[polyamory|polyamorous]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|title=Polyamorists Come Out of the Closet - National Review Online|work=National Review Online|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085106/http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a [[sex work]]er",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|title=What It's Like to Come Out of the Hooker Closet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014095839/http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|archivedate=2014-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "coming out of the shadows" as an [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|undocumented immigrant]] within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrunker|first=Laura|date=2012-01-01|title="Coming Out of the Shadows": DREAM Act Activism in the Context of Global Anti-Deportation Activism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=143–168|issn=1543-0367|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919195021/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|archivedate=2016-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used by members of online [[BIID]] communities to refer to the process of telling friends and families about their condition.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] The "Liberty" figure can be interpreted as both a goddess and a heroic commoner.]]

The '''common people''', also known as the '''''common man''''', '''''commoners''''', or the '''''masses''''', are the ordinary people in a community or nation who lack any significant social status, especially those who are members of neither [[Royal family|royalty]], [[nobility]], the [[clergy]], nor any member of the [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]].

Whereas historically many civilizations have institutionalized the notion of a ''common'' class within society, since the 20th century the term ''common people'' has been used in a more general sense to refer to typical members of society in contrast to the highly privileged (in either wealth or influence). In the United States, [[Andrew Jackson]] gave hope to the common man by his own example of working his way from being a poor Scots-Irish American to becoming the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh President of the United States]] (1829-1837).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Jackson:'Era of the Common Man'|url=https://apush-growthofanation.weebly.com/era-of-the-common-man/andrew-jackson-era-of-the-common-man|website=AP US History|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of the Common Man|url=http://americanexperience.si.edu/historical-eras/colonization-revolution-and-new-nation/pair-daniel-lamotte-independence-squire-jack-porter/|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Jackson and the Era of the Common Man|url=https://owlcation.com/about-us|website=Owlcation|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aboukhadijeh|first1=Feross|title=Democracy and the "Common Man"|url=https://www.apstudynotes.org/us-history/topics/democracy-and-the-common-man/|website=AP US History Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of the Common Man|website=U.S. History|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidency of Andrew Jackson|The administration of Andrew Jackson]] utilized a system of choosing appointments to federal office which one contemporary congressman labeled the [[spoils system]], thereby enabling previously unmeritorious individuals opportunities to hold office. Additionally, his presidency was marked by the common man’s  [[Voting rights in the United States|right of suffrage]] (which had originally been limited to property-owning or tax-paying white males) as part of his administration’s [[Jacksonian democracy|greater democracy for the common man]]. Economically, Jackson’s administration  fostered trade with Europe, leading to an increase in jobs for the common man in agriculture and industry.

==History==
In Europe, a  distinct concept analogous to ''common people'' arose in the  [[Classical civilization]] of ancient Rome around the 6th century BC, with the social division into [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (nobles) and [[plebeians]] (commoners). The division may have been instituted by [[Servius Tullius]], as an alternative to the previous clan based divisions that had been responsible for internecine conflict.&lt;ref name = "class"&gt;{{Cite book

 | publisher=[[Routledge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greeks generally had no concept of class and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Though [[Plato]] did recognise a fundamental division into rich and poor – "Any city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich; these two cities are at war." – [[The Republic (Plato)]], ''Part I'', ''book IV''.&lt;/ref&gt; The early organisation of [[Ancient Athens]] was something of an exception with certain official roles like [[archon]]s, magistrates and treasurers being reserved for only the wealthiest citizens – these class-like divisions were weakened by the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] who created new ''vertical'' social divisions in contrasting fashion to the ''horizontal'' ones thought to have been created by Tullius.&lt;ref name = "civ"/&gt;

With the growth of Christianity in the 4th century AD, a new world view arose that would underpin European thinking on social division until at least early modern times.&lt;ref name = "class"/&gt;  [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] postulated that social division was a result of the [[Fall of Man]].&lt;ref name = "class"/&gt; The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood ([[clergy]]), the nobility, and the common people. Sometimes this would be expressed as "those who prayed", "those who fought" and "those who worked". The [[Latin]] terms for the three classes – ''oratores'', ''bellatores'' and ''laboratores'' – are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;

This threefold division was formalised in the estate system of [[social stratification]], where again commoners were the bulk of the population who are neither members of the nobility nor of the [[clergy]].&lt;ref name=bundle_commoners/&gt;  They were the third of the [[Three Estates of the Realm]] in [[medieval Europe]], consisting of [[peasant]]s and [[artisan]]s.

[[Social mobility]] for commoners was limited throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Generally, the [[serfs]] were unable to enter the group of the ''bellatores''. Commoners could sometimes secure entry for their children into the ''oratores'' class; usually they would serve as rural parish priests. In some cases they received education from the clergy and ascended to senior administrative positions; in some cases nobles welcomed such advancement as former commoners were more likely to be neutral in dynastic feuds. There were cases of serfs becoming clerics in the [[Holy Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;DEVAILLY, ''Le Berry du X siècle au milieu du XIII siècle'', p. 201; CHEDEVILLE, ''Chartres et ses campagnes'', p.336.&lt;/ref&gt; though from the [[Carolingian era]], clergy were generally recruited from the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;PERROY, E., ''Le Monde carolingien'', Paris, SEDES, 2.ª ed., 1975, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two thousand [[bishop]]s serving from the 8th to the 15th century, just five came from the [[peasant]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;BRETT, M., Middle Ages, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15.ª ed., 1979, 12, p.1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the late 15th-century European social order was relatively stable. There were periods where the common people felt oppressed in certain regions, but often they were content with their lot. In 12th-century England for example, while the common people would sometimes complain about the "Norman yoke" &lt;ref&gt;Even as late as the 17th century the English common people would still complain about the Normans, as they felt they had enjoyed more privileges before the Norman conquest had replaced the previous Anglo Saxon nobility with Normans– see Civilisation (2006) Roger Osbour p 293&lt;/ref&gt; there was almost no unemployment and the average commoner only had to work only about 20 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The social and political order of medieval Europe was shaken by the development of the mobile [[cannon]] in the 15th century.

This encouraged the formation of princely and kingly states, which needed to tax the common people much more heavily to pay for the expensive weapons and armies required to provide security in the new age. Up until the late 15th century, surviving medieval treaties on government were concerned with advising rulers on how to serve the common good: [[Assize of Bread and Ale|Assize of Bread]] is an example of medieval law specifically drawn up in the interests of the common people.&lt;ref name = "shield"/&gt;   But then works by [[Philippe de Commines]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and later [[Cardinal Richelieu]] began advising rulers to consider their own interests and that of the state ahead of what was "good", with Richelieu explicitly saying the state is above morality in doctrines such as [[National interest|''Raison d'Etat'']].&lt;ref name = "shield"/&gt;  This change of orientation among the nobles left the common people less content with their place in society. A similar trend occurred regarding the clergy, where many priests began to abuse the great power they had due to the sacrament of contrition. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was a movement that aimed to correct this, but even afterward the common people's trust in the clergy would continue to decline – priests were often seen as greedy and lacking in true faith. An early major social upheaval driven in part by the common people's mistrust of both the nobility and clergy occurred in Great Britain with the [[English Civil War|English Revolution]] of 1642. After the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell]] triumphed, movements like the [[Levellers]] rose to prominence demanding equality for all. When the general council of Cromwell's army met to decide on a new order at the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647, one of the commanders, Colonel [[Thomas Rainsborough]], requested that political power be given to the common people. According to historian Roger Osbourne, the Colonel's speech was the first time a prominent person spoke in favour of universal male suffrage, but it was not to be granted until 1918. After much debate it was decided that only those with considerable property would be allowed to vote, and so after the revolution political power in England remained largely controlled by the nobles, with at first only a few of the most wealthy or well-connected common people sitting in Parliament.&lt;ref name = "civ"&gt;{{Cite book

The rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], had seen an intermediate class of wealthy commoners develop, which ultimately gave rise to the modern [[middle classes]]. Middle-class people could still be called commoners however, for example in England [[Pitt the Elder]]  was often called ''the Great Commoner'', and this appellation was later used for the 20th-century American anti-elitist campaigner [[William Jennings Bryan]]. The interests of the middle class were not always aligned with their fellow commoners of the working class.

Social historian  [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that in 19th-century Britain, the new middle class turned against their fellow commoners by seizing political power from the upper classes via the [[Reform Act 1832]]. Early industrialisation had been causing economic distress to large numbers of working class commoners, leaving them unable to earn a living. The upper classes had provided protection such as workhouses where inmates could happily "doss" about and also a system of "outdoor" &lt;ref&gt;Outdoor relief means monetary or other assistance given to the poor without them needing to enter a workhouse to receive it.&lt;/ref&gt; relief both for the unemployed and those on low income.  Though early middle class opposition to the [[Poor Law]] reform of [[William Pitt the Younger]] had prevented the emergence of a coherent and generous nationwide provision, the resulting [[Speenhamland system]] did generally save working class commoners from starvation. In 1834 [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|outdoor relief was abolished]],&lt;ref&gt;Though some Lords, Ladys and well to do church people continued to offer it, in defiance of the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; and workhouses were deliberately made into places so dehumanising that folk would often prefer to starve rather than enter them.  For Polanyi this related to the [[classical economics|economic doctrine]] prevalent at the time which held that only the spur of hunger could make workers flexible enough for the proper functioning of the free market. Later the same [[Laissez-faire]] free market doctrine led to British officials turning a blind eye to the suffering in the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato famine]] and various [[Famine in India#British rule|Indian famines]] and acts of exploitation in colonial adventures.  By the late 19th century, at least in mainland Britain, economic progress has been sufficient that even the working class were generally able to earn a good living, so working and middle class interests began to converge, lessening the division within the ranks of common people.  Polanyi writes that on continental Europe middle and working class interests did not diverge anywhere near as markedly as they had in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Breakdown of the trifold division==
[[File:Henry-A.-Wallace-Townsend.jpeg|thumb|200px| US Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] proclaimed the "arrival of the century of the common man" in a 1942 speech broadcast nationwide in the United States.]]
After the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic wars]] and with [[industrialization]], the division in three estates - nobility, clergy and commoners - had become somewhat outdated.  The term "common people" continued to be used, but now in a more general sense to refer to regular people as opposed to the privileged elite.

[[Communist theory]] divided society into [[capitalists]] on one hand, and the [[proletariat]] or ''the masses'' on the other.  In [[Marxism]], the people are considered to be the creator of history. By using the word "people", Marx did not gloss over the class differences, but united certain elements, capable of completing the revolution. The Intelligentsia's sympathy for the common people gained strength in the 19th century in many countries. For example, in Imperial Russia a big part of the intelligentsia was striving for its emancipation. Several great writers (Nekrasov, Herzen, Tolstoy etc.) wrote about sufferings of the common people. Organizations, parties and movements arose, proclaiming the liberation of the people. These included among others: "[[Sergey Nechayev|People's Reprisal]]", "[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|People’s Will]]", "[[Constitutional Democratic Party|Party of Popular Freedom]]" and the "People's Socialist Party".

In the United States, a famous 1942 speech by vice president [[Henry A. Wallace]] proclaimed the arrival of the "century of the common man" saying that all over the world the "common people" were on the march, specifically referring to Chinese, Indians, Russians, and as well as Americans.&lt;ref&gt;

==Social divisions in non-Western civilisations==
[[Comparative history|Comparative]] historian [[Oswald Spengler]] found the social separation into nobility, priests and commoners to occur again and again in the various civilisations that he surveyed (although the division may not exist for pre-civilised society).&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

In [[set theory]], the '''complement''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''A''}} refers to [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] not in {{math|''A''}}.

When all sets under consideration are considered to be [[subset]]s of a given set {{math|''U''}}, the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} is the set of elements in {{math|''U''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

The '''relative complement'''  of {{math|''A''}} with respect to a set {{math|''B''}}, also termed the '''difference''' of sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, written {{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}, is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

==Absolute complement==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bayes' theorem]] and [[absolute set complement]] --&gt;

[[File:Venn1010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''absolute complement''' of {{mvar|A}} (left circle) in ''U'':
&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} is a set, then the '''absolute complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (or simply the '''complement of {{math|''A''}}''') is the set of elements not in {{math|''A''}}. In other words, if {{math|''U''}} is the [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] that contains all the elements under study, and there is no need to mention it because it is obvious and unique, then the absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is the relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''U''}}:&lt;ref&gt;The set other than {{math|''A''}} is thus implicitly mentioned in an absolute complement, and explicitly mentioned in a relative complement.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally:

:&lt;math&gt;A^c = \{ x\in U \mid x \notin A \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute complement of {{math|''A''}} is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;. Other notations include &lt;math&gt;\overline A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\complement_U A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\complement A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bou"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=E II.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* Assume that the universe is the set of [[integer]]s. If {{math|''A''}} is the set of odd numbers, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the set of even numbers. If {{math|''B''}} is the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the set of numbers [[Modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 1 or 2 modulo 3 (or, in simpler terms, the integers that are not multiples of 3).
* Assume that the universe is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. If the set {{math|''A''}} is the suit of spades, then the complement of {{math|''A''}} is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of the suits of clubs, diamonds, and hearts. If the set {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of clubs and diamonds, then the complement of {{math|''B''}} is the union of the suits of hearts and spades.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} be two sets in a universe {{math|''U''}}. The following identities capture important properties of absolute complements:

: [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cup B \right)^c=A^c \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\left(A \cap B \right)^c=A^c\cup B^c.&lt;/math&gt;

: Complement laws:&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960" /&gt;

::* &lt;math&gt;A \cup A^c = U .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;A \cap A^c =\varnothing .&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\varnothing^c =U.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt; U^c =\varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;\text{If }A\subseteq B\text{, then }B^c\subseteq A^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::*: (this follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its [[contrapositive]]).

: [[involution (mathematics)|Involution]] or double complement law:

::* &lt;math&gt;(A^c)^c=A.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationships between relative and absolute complements:

::* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap B^c.&lt;/math&gt;
::* &lt;math&gt;(A \setminus B)^c = A^c \cup B.&lt;/math&gt;

: Relationship with set difference:
::* &lt;math&gt; A^c \setminus B^c = B \setminus A. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two complement laws above show that if {{math|''A''}} is a non-empty, [[proper subset]] of {{math|''U''}}, then {{math|{''A'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;∁&lt;/sup&gt;}{{null}}}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of {{math|''U''}}.

== Relative complement ==

&lt;!-- Many links redirect to this section:
[[difference (set theory)]], [[difference of two sets]], [[relative complement]], [[set-theoretic difference]], [[set difference]], [[set minus]], [[set subtraction]], [[set theoretic difference]], [[setminus]] --&gt;

===Definition===
If {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are sets, then the '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}},&lt;ref name="Halmos-1960"&gt;{{harvnb|Halmos|1960|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also termed the '''set difference''' of {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''A''}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1979|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the set of elements in {{math|''B''}} but not in {{math|''A''}}.

[[File:Venn0010.svg|250px|thumb|The '''relative complement''' of {{math|''A''}} (left circle) in {{math|''B''}} (right circle):
&lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c = B \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;]]

The relative complement of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''B''}} is denoted {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' ∖ ''A''}}}} according to the [[ISO 31-11#Sets|ISO 31-11 standard]]. It is sometimes written {{nowrap|{{math|''B'' − ''A''}}}}, but this notation is ambiguous, as in some contexts it can be interpreted as the set of all elements {{nowrap|{{math|''b'' − ''a''}}}}, where {{math|''b''}} is taken from {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''a''}} from {{math|''A''}}.

Formally:

: &lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = \{ x\in B \mid x \notin A \}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, 3\} \setminus \{ 2,3,4\} = \{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\{ 2, 3, 4 \} \setminus \{ 1,2,3 \} = \{ 4 \} &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number]]s and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[rational number]]s, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[irrational number]]s.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} be three sets. The following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] capture notable properties of relative complements:

:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cap B) = (C \setminus A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cup B) = (C \setminus A) \cap (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (B \setminus A) = (C \cap A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;,
:*:with the important special case &lt;math&gt;C \setminus (C \setminus A) = (C \cap A)&lt;/math&gt; demonstrating that intersection can be expressed using only the relative complement operation.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cap C = (B \cap C) \setminus A = B \cap (C \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cup C = (B \cup C) \setminus (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;\empty \setminus A = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus \empty = A&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;A \setminus U = \empty&lt;/math&gt;.

== LaTeX notation ==

In the [[LaTeX]] typesetting language, the command &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List"&gt;[http://ctan.unsw.edu.au/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf] The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List&lt;/ref&gt; is usually used for rendering a set difference symbol, which is similar to a [[backslash]] symbol. When rendered, the &lt;code&gt;\setminus&lt;/code&gt; command looks identical to &lt;code&gt;\backslash&lt;/code&gt; except that it has a little more space in front and behind the slash, akin to the LaTeX sequence &lt;code&gt;\mathbin{\backslash}&lt;/code&gt;. A variant &lt;code&gt;\smallsetminus&lt;/code&gt; is available in the amssymb package.

== Complements in various programming languages ==

Some programming languages allow for manipulation of [[set (computer science)|sets as data structures]], using these operators or functions to construct the difference of sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;:

{{About|the fictional device|other uses|Cone of Silence (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Get Smart-Cone-of-silence.jpg|thumb|right|Cone of Silence from Episode 1 ("[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", 1965) of ''[[Get Smart]]'']]

The '''Cone of Silence''' is one of many recurring joke devices from ''[[Get Smart]]'', an American [[comedy]] television series of the 1960s about an inept [[spy]].  The essence of the joke is that the apparatus, designed for secret conversations, makes it impossible for those inside the device – and easy for those outside the device – to hear the conversation. The end result being neither secret nor communication.

In popular culture, "cone of silence" is a slang phrase meaning that the speaker wishes to keep the indicated information secret and that the conversation should not be repeated to anyone not currently present. For example: "We aren't inviting Cindy and her boyfriend to the movies because they embarrass us, but keep that in the cone of silence."

==History==

===Precursors===
Although popularized by ''Get Smart'', the term  "Cone of Silence" actually originated on the syndicated TV show ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'', in an episode titled "Barrier of Silence" written by Lou Huston and first airing September 3, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/SciFi/ScienceFictionTheatre_01_(1955-56).htm|title=CTVA US Sci-Fi – "Science Fiction Theatre" (ZIV/Syndicated) Season 1 (1955–56)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on finding a cure for Professor Richard Sheldon, who had been returned to the United States in a confused, altered state of mind after abduction by enemy agents while visiting Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/science-fiction-theatre/barrier-of-silence-126781/|title=Science Fiction Theatre – Season 1, Episode 19: Barrier of Silence – TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists discover that placing Sheldon in an environment of total silence had been the means of [[brainwashing]], a precursor to later ideas of [[sensory deprivation]], celebrated in such films as ''[[Altered States]]'' and sundry spy thrillers. Sheldon is placed on a chair in the "Cone of Silence", which consists of a raised circular platform suspended by three wires tied to a common vertex. Although the cone's surface is open, noise canceling sound generators located just below the vertex shroud anyone sitting inside in a complete silence impossible in natural surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x24z83k_science-fiction-theatre-19-barrier-of-silence_tv|title=''Science Fiction Theatre'' 19 – 'Barrier Of Silence'|work=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also demonstrated that anyone speaking inside the cone could not be heard outside, which was the feature later [[parody|parodied]] in ''Get Smart''. Only a speculative, "[[science fiction]]" possibility at that time, such technology is now commonplace in [[active noise control|active noise canceling]] electronics for personal and industrial use.

The concept is also explored in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 short story "[[Silence Please]]", which features a device capable of cancelling sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Silence Please' by Arthur C. Clarke|url=http://alienterritory.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/silence-please-by-arthur-c-clarke/|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''—first serialized in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' from 1963 to 1965 and then published independently in August 1965—the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Harkonnen]] employs a "[[cone of silence (Dune)|cone of silence]]" when having a private discussion with [[Hasimir Fenring|Count Fenring]]. In the novel's glossary, Herbert describes the device as the sound-deadening "field of a distorter that limits the carrying power of the voice or any other vibrator by damping the vibrations with an image-vibration 180 degrees out of phase".&lt;ref name="Dune Terminology"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Frank Herbert |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used for privacy, the field does not visually obscure lip movement.&lt;ref name="Dune"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=Dune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert had previously mentioned the cone of silence, on a much smaller scale, in his 1955 short story "Cease Fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum%3D90 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824011029/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=90 |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Get Smart''===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The larger, plastic version of the "Cone of Silence", appeared in the pilot episode of ''Get Smart'', entitled "[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", which aired on September 18, 1965. [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Buck Henry]], the original [[screenwriter]]s for the series, devised many of the [[running joke]]s. Henry either borrowed or independently came up with the Cone of Silence concept, which debuted in the pilot along with other show standards, like Fang, the improperly trained dog-agent, and Max's shoe phone. The Cone of Silence scene was shot ahead of the rest of the pilot episode, and was used to sell the series to [[NBC]].

Cones of Silence appear in ''[[The Nude Bomb]]'' (1980), the first attempt at a theatrical ''Get Smart'' movie. Max, the Chief, and the delegates all have their own cone placed over them. Neither the characters nor the audience hear what is being said. In the later sequel movie, ''[[Get Smart, Again!]]'' (1989), when Maxwell is reactivated as a secret agent, he insists on following protocol to ensure secrecy by using the Cone of Silence. However, the device is considered to be completely outdated (however Max and 99 still have one at home), and the current methods used were the following:

* Hover Cover: The participants converse on the roof of a building while helicopters hover nearby, drowning out all sounds with their rotor blades, thereby preventing anyone from eavesdropping. However, this also prevents those involved from hearing their own words and the intense winds caused by the helicopter's blades throws the participants about.
* Hall of Hush: A chamber with sound-suppressing walls that allow a person's words to appear in front of him like subtitles in a movie. The problem with this device is that the words do not disappear and will eventually fill up the chamber, smothering the speakers in their own dialogues.

A new version of the Cone of Silence appears in the 2008 ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' film.  One of the early versions of the Cone used in the television series is on display in the CONTROL museum seen in the beginning of the film. The new version has an appearance more consistent with the cones of silence used in ''The Nude Bomb'' than in the television series. It was apparently constructed by the lab guys Bruce and Lloyd, and was untested at the time it was used. It seems much more high-tech, being a small handheld device which, when the button is pressed, creates a cone-shaped beam of light shining down from the ceiling, forming a [[force shield|force field]] around the person highlighted. This field ought to block all exterior sound, making external communication all but impossible. However, as usual, this updated version is ineffective. The force field was shown to be solid, though, to the point where a panicking Larrabee found he could not escape, to the cause of his greater panic. When Max himself attempts to use the device to hide his glee at being named field agent, it malfunctions and does not even raise the field, permitting everybody to hear his embarrassing shouts. However, in fairness to the manufacturers, this was because Max didn't push the button hard enough.

== Variations and related devices==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Throughout the five seasons of ''Get Smart'', the Cone of Silence appears many times. For security reasons, Maxwell Smart insists upon using it to discuss his case. Despite this, its use is always counterproductive in some way:
* During the first episode of the show, the Cone of Silence is lowered. Once it's in place, Max and the Chief can barely hear each other. The frustrated Chief then asks Hodgkins (a CONTROL scientist) to raise it, but Hodgkins can't hear him either.
* The Cone of Silence produces a very strong echo that gives both characters a headache.
* In perhaps one of the most comical moments involving the Cone of Silence, the Chief and Max can't hear each other.  Hodgkins, outside the Cone, can hear them perfectly and acts as a relay between the two.
* After the Cone of Silence is lowered, it randomly raises and lowers.  As Max and the Chief stand and sit to accommodate it, the Cone finally goes so low that it breaks through the Chief's desk, forcing them both to sit on the floor.
* In an episode where Max is asked to investigate KAOS headquarters, the Chief asks him what he found out, he once again insists upon the Cone of Silence, and the Chief reluctantly agrees. When it is lowered Max says he found out nothing, leaving the Chief highly frustrated. This is one of the few occasions where the Cone of Silence itself did not malfunction. Instead, its use was completely unnecessary.
* Another episode involves Max and the Chief using cards with words written on them to communicate. Max made a mistake at one point: The card that reads 99 was upside-down. The Chief responds with "Who is 66?"
* Max insists on lowering the cone of silence to discuss something top secret. Once lowered, he asks the Chief to borrow twenty dollars, frustrating the Chief. When the Chief says that he can't believe that, Max says "Would you believe, thirty dollars". After the Chief insists on raising it, Max reveals that the controls are on the outside, and when slipping out of it, 99 rings the doorbell, and Max forgets about the Chief, who is yelling and gesticulating – inaudibly, within the Cone.

The series also employs related technology:
* Closet of Silence: In one episode, when the Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the "Closet of Silence". In the Closet, there are so many coats and jackets, they can barely hear each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the lock off, injuring Larabee in the process.
* Portable Cone of Silence: In one episode, when Max and Chief are not in the office, Max brings along a portable Cone of Silence for them to use. This Cone seems to work, as the two can hear each other perfectly. Of course, the audience can hear them too. This cone apparently obscured the Chief's vision, and echoed violently when struck. When they try to take them off, Max succeeds but has to help the chief get his off. He uses his shoe and the butt of his gun, but the Chief finally breaks out after falling off a stage.
* Umbrella of Silence: In one episode, Max, 99 and Chief go to England where they meet the Chief of English CONTROL, who has an Umbrella of Silence which can fit more people in, but the disadvantage is that since the Chief of English CONTROL smokes a lot, he intolerably pollutes the air inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16104">{{short description|Will of the people as source of political legitimacy}}
In [[political philosophy]], the phrase '''consent of the governed''' refers to the idea that a [[government]]'s [[political legitimacy|legitimacy]] and [[natural and legal rights|moral right]] to use state power is only justified and lawful when consented to by the people  or [[society]] over which that [[political power]] is exercised. This theory of [[consent]] is historically contrasted to the [[divine right of kings]] and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of [[colonialism]]. Article 21 of the United Nation's 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government".

==History==
In his 1937 book ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'', [[George Sabine]] collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in ''De Concordantia Catholica''. In 1579 [[Theodore Beza]] wrote ''Vindiciae contra Tyrannos'' which Sabine paraphrases: "The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government…the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent."&lt;ref name=Sabine&gt;George Sabine (1937) A History of Political Theory, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}} In England, the [[Levellers]] also held to this principle of government.

[[John Milton]] wrote
{{quote|The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural birthright.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|510}}&lt;ref&gt;John Milton ''Works'' V: 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Sabine notes the position of [[John Locke]] in ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'': 
{{quote|[Civic power] can have no right except as this is derived from the individual right of each man to protect himself and his property. The legislative and executive power used by government to protect property is nothing except the natural power of each man resigned into the hands  of the community…and it is justified merely because it is a better way of protecting natural right than the self-help to which each man is naturally entitled.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|532}} }}

However, with [[David Hume]] a contrary voice is heard. Sabine interprets Hume's [[skepticism]] by noting
{{quote|The political world over, absolute governments which do not even do lip-service to the fiction of consent are more common than free governments, and their subjects rarely question their right except when tyranny becomes too oppressive.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|603}}}}

Sabine revived the concept from its status as a [[political myth]] after Hume, by referring to [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green wrote that government required "will not force" for administration.  As put by Sabine,&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|731}}
{{quote|Even the most powerful and the most despotic government cannot hold a society together by sheer force; to that extent there was a limited truth to the old belief that governments are produced by consent.}}

Consent of the governed, within the [[social liberalism]] of T. H. Green, was also described by [[Paul Harris (public servant)|Paul Harris]]:
{{quote|The conditions for the existence of a political society have less to do with force and fear of coercion than with the members' mutual recognition of a good common to themselves and others, although it may not be consciously expressed as such. Thus for the conditions for any civil combination to disappear through resistance to a despotic government or disobedience to law would require such a disastrous upheaval as to be unlikely in all but the most extreme circumstances in which we might agree with Green that the price would be too high to pay, yet sufficiently rare to allow us to acknowledge that there would ordinarily be a moral duty to act to overthrow any state that did not pursue the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris (1982) "Green’s theory of political obligation and disobedience", pp 127 to 142 in ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'', Andrew Vincent editor, [[Gower Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-566-05104-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the United States==
"Consent of the governed" is a phrase found in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Using thinking similar to that of [[John Locke]], the founders of the [[United States]] believed in a state built upon the consent of "free and equal" citizens; a state otherwise conceived would lack [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[Rational-legal authority]]. This was expressed, among other places, in the 2nd paragraph of the Declaration of Independence (emphasis added):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]].--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the {{em|consent of the governed}}, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the earlier [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], especially Section 6, quoted below, founding father [[George Mason]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in assembly, ought to be free; and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, the attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented, for the [[public interest|public good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Virginia Declaration of Rights|Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[Continental Congress]] at the outset of the [[American Revolution]] had no explicit legal authority to govern,&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, Ch. 34, p.353 [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAN2921.0007.001;didno=AAN2921.0007.001;view=image;seq=00000363 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; it was delegated by the states with all the functions of a national government, such as appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money (called "Continentals"), and disbursing funds. The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests. According to the ''Cyclopædia of Political Science''. New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899, commenting on the source of the Congress' power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The appointment of the delegates to both these congresses was generally by popular conventions, though in some instances by state assemblies. But in neither case can the appointing body be considered the original depositary of the power by which the delegates acted; for the conventions were either self-appointed "committees of safety" or hastily assembled popular gatherings, including but a small fraction of the population to be represented, and the state assemblies had no right to surrender to another body one atom of the power which had been granted to them, or to create a new power which should govern the people without their will. The source of the powers of congress is to be sought solely in the acquiescence of the people, without which every congressional resolution, with or without the benediction of popular conventions or state legislatures, would have been a mere ''brutum fulmen''; and, as the congress unquestionably exercised national powers, operating over the whole country, the conclusion is inevitable that the will of the whole people is the source of national government in the United States, even from its first imperfect appearance in the second continental congress...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of consent==

===Unanimous consent===
A key question is whether the [[unanimous consent]] of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the [[right of secession]] for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters, which in some theorists' view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli/&gt;

===Hypothetical consent===
The theory of hypothetical consent of the governed holds that one's obligation to obey government depends on whether the government is such that one ''ought'' to consent to it, or whether the people, if placed in a [[state of nature]] without government, would agree to said government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hanna |last1=Pitkin |year=1966 |title=Obligation and Consent—II |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |jstor=1953805 |doi=10.2307/1953805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been rejected by some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}}, who argue that since government itself can commit aggression, creating a government to safeguard the people from aggression would be similar to the people, if given the choice of what animals to be attacked by, trading "[[weasel|polecats]] and foxes for a lion", a trade that they would not make.&lt;ref name=Bookman/&gt;

===Overt versus tacit consent===

Another division that is sometimes made is between [[overt consent]] and [[tacit consent]]. Overt consent, to be valid, would require [[voluntariness]], a specific act on the part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. [[Immigrating]] into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a jurisdiction ''implies'' such consent omission.

It has been pointed out that in jurisdictions where [[proportional representation]] is not used, but candidates are instead elected by [[plurality vote]], a candidate can be elected despite the overt dissent of a majority of the people. Not every voter has necessarily had an opportunity to vote on the constitutional provisions specifying that plurality voting should be used; according to some theorists, this calls into question whether said voters have consented to be governed by the candidates who obtain plurality support. A counterargument is that, by failing to act through the process of [[constitutional amendment]] to change such provisions, the people have consented to them. A rebuttal to this is that in some jurisdictions, the means of amending the constitution are not completely in the hands of the electorate; the same issues arise, in claiming that the constitution left in place by the decisions of the people's elected representatives is consented to by the people, as arise in claiming that any other actions taken by said representatives are consented to by the people. Some proponents of the "overt consent" theory hold that the act of voting implies consent, while others question the connection between voting and consenting to a particular scheme of representative, since some voters may oppose the system as a whole but desire to influence decisions on particular issues or candidates.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/106591295901200202 |title=The 'Consent' of the Governed |year=1959 |last1=Cassinelli |first1=C. W. |journal=Political Research Quarterly |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=391–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of tacit consent of the governed holds that if the people live in a country that is not undergoing a rebellion, they have consented to the rule of that country's government.&lt;ref name=Bookman&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1984.tb01750.x |title=Locke's Contract: Would People consent to It? |year=1984 |last1=Bookman |first1=John T. |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=357–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this likewise meets with the criticism that tacit consent is incompatible with ''express'' opposition: i.e. the People cannot consent if they have no ''right'' to refuse.

===Engineered consent===
In 1988, [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] described a [[propaganda model]] of [[news media in the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Herman &amp; Noam Chomsky (1988) [[Manufacturing Consent]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which coverage of [[current events]] was skewed by [[corporations]] and the [[state (polity)|state]] in order to manufacture the consent of the governed. According to the propagandist [[Edward L. Bernays]], the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate. The [[public relations]] techniques were described in his essay and book ''[[The Engineering of Consent]]'' (1955). Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government: "The basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 457, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literal consent===
The theory of literal consent holds the logical position that valid consent must denote final authority belonging to the people, rather than elected officials, therefore this implies that the people have the absolute sovereign power to overrule their government at any time via popular vote (or as stated in the Declaration of Independence, "the right of the People to alter or abolish" their government). Without this unfettered power, theorists hold that true consent cannot exist and that any government is therefore despotism via governing the people by force without their actual consent.

In [[economics]], '''discounted utility''' is the [[utility (economics)|utility]] (desirability) of some future event, such as consuming a certain amount of a good, as perceived at the present time as opposed to at the time of its occurrence. It is calculated as the [[present discounted value]] of future utility, and for people with [[time preference]] for sooner rather than later gratification, it is less than the future utility. The utility of an event ''x''  occurring at future time ''t'' under utility function ''u'', discounted back to the present (time 0) using [[exponential discounting|discount factor]] &lt;math&gt;\beta,&lt;/math&gt; Is

:&lt;math&gt;\beta ^t u(x_t).&lt;/math&gt;

Since more distant events are less liked, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Discounted utility calculations made for events at various points in the future as well as at the present take the form 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^T \beta ^t u(x_t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u(x_t)&lt;/math&gt; is the utility of some choice &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and ''T''  is the time of the most distant future satisfaction event. Here, since utility comparisons are being made across time when the utilities are combined in a single evaluation, the utility function is necessarily [[cardinal utility|cardinal]] in nature.

In a typical [[intertemporal consumption]] model, the above summation of utilities discounted from various future times would be maximized with respect to the amounts ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed in each period, [[constrained optimization|subject to]] an [[intertemporal budget constraint]] that says that the [[present value]] of current and future expenditures does not exceed the present value of financial resources available for spending.

The interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is not straightforward.  Sometimes it is explained as the degree of a person's patience.  Given the interpretation of [[homo economicus|economic agents]] as [[Rationality|rational]], this exempts time-valuations from rationality judgments, so that someone who spends and borrows voraciously is just as rational as someone who spends and saves moderately, or as someone who hoards his wealth and never spends it: different people have different rates of time preference.

Some formulations treat &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; not as a constant, but as a function &lt;math&gt;\beta (t) &lt;/math&gt; that itself varies over time, for example in models which use the concept of [[hyperbolic discounting]].  This view is consistent with [[empirical]] observations that humans display inconsistent [[time preference]]s.  For example, experiments by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] showed that the same people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would choose 2 candy bars 101 days from now over 1 candy bar 100 days from now.  (This is inconsistent because if the same question were posed 100 days from now, the person would ostensibly again choose 1 candy bar immediately instead of 2 candy bars the next day.)

Despite arguments about how &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; should be interpreted, the basic idea is that all [[ceteris paribus|other things equal]], the agent prefers to have something now as opposed to later (hence &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Doris Stevens''' (October 26, 1888 – March 22, 1963) was an American [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]], woman's legal rights advocate and author. She was the first female member of the [[American Institute of International Law]] and first chair of the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]].

Born in 1888 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], Stevens became involved in the fight for [[suffrage]] while a college student at [[Oberlin College]]. After graduating with a degree in [[sociology]] in 1911, she taught briefly before becoming a paid regional organizer for the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]'s [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS). When the CUWS broke from the parent organization in 1914, Stevens became the national strategist. She was in charge of coordinating the women's congress, held at the [[Panama Pacific Exposition]] in 1915. When the CUWS became the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) in 1916, Stevens organized party delegates for each of the 435 Congressional Districts in an effort to attain national women's enfranchisement and defeat candidates who were opposed to women's rights. Between 1917 and 1919, Stevens was a prominent participant in the [[Silent Sentinels]] vigil at [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[White House]] to urge the passage of a constitutional amendment for women's voting rights and was arrested several times for her involvement. After the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] secured women's right to vote, she wrote a book, titled ''Jailed for Freedom'' (1920), which recounted the sentinel's ordeals.

Once the right to vote was secured, Stevens turned her attention to women's legal status. She supported passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and worked with [[Alice Paul]] from 1927–1933 on a volume of work comparing varying impact on law for women and men. The goal in compiling the data was to obtain an international law protecting women's right of citizenship. The research was completed with the help of feminists in 90 countries and evaluated laws controlling women's nationality from every country. Gaining approval for the work from the [[League of Nations]] in 1927, Stevens presented the proposal [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]] in 1928, convincing the governing body to create the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM). In 1931, she joined the American Institute of International Law, becoming its first female member. In 1933, her work resulted in the first treaty to secure international rights for women. The [[Convention on the Nationality of Women]] established that women retained their citizenship after marriage and Convention on Nationality provided that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children.

Ousted from the CIM in 1938, and the NWP in 1947 over policy disputes, Stevens became vice president of the [[Lucy Stone League]] in 1951, of which she had been a member since the 1920s. She fought the roll-back of policies removing the gains women had made to enter the work force during [[World War II]] and worked to establish feminism as an academic field of study. She continued fighting for feminist causes until her death in 1963.

==Early life==
Dora Caroline Stevens was born on October 26, 1888 in [[Omaha]], Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}}{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=36}} Her father was a pastor of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] for forty years and her mother was a first generation immigrant from Holland.{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=36}} One of four children, Stevens grew up in Omaha and graduated in 1905 from [[Omaha Central High School|Omaha High School]].{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} She went on to further her education graduating from [[Oberlin College]] in 1911{{sfn|''Dayton Daily News''|2004}}{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} with a degree in sociology, though she had originally pursued music. While in college, she was known for her romances and for being a spirited [[suffragette]]. Her unruly behavior and disdain for feminine propriety were cultivated during her college years.{{sfn|Trigg|2014|p=40}} After graduation, Stevens worked as a music teacher and [[social work]]er in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]].{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} and [[Montana]]{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1915|p=9}} before moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she became a regional organizer with the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}

==Suffrage==
In 1913, Stevens arrived in Washington to take part in the June picketing of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. She did not plan to stay, but [[Alice Paul]] convinced her to do so.{{sfn|Stevens|1920|p=12}} She was hired by the NAWSA,{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} and was assigned to the newly formed [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]] (CUWS),{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=16}} which had been created by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Mary Ritter Beard]].{{sfn|Beard|Lane|1977|p=95}} At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently.{{sfn|Risjord|2005|p=206}} Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|''Albuquerque Morning Journal''|1914|p=1}} and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, [[Mabel Vernon]] to the middle west, [[Anne Henrietta Martin|Anne Martin]] to the far west, and [[Maud Younger]] to the south.{{sfn|Wheeler|1995|p=171}} The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress{{sfn|''Albuquerque Morning Journal''|1914|p=1}} and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage movement]] at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA and become an independent organization.{{sfn|Buechler|1990|p=56}}

With the fissure, the Congressional Union began a reorganization to push for campaigns against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates because they had not supported suffrage while they were in control of the legislature.{{sfn|Buechler|1990|p=56}} Paul established an all-woman advisory council of suffrage workers and prominent women which included Bertha Fowler, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Belle Case La Follette]], [[May Wright Sewall]] and educators such as [[Emma Gillett]], [[Maria Montessori]], and [[Clara Louise Thompson]], a Latin Professor at [[Rockford University|Rockford College]], among others, to lend credibility to the new organization.{{sfn|Adams|Keene|2010|p=17}} Stevens became the national organizer, charged with organizing women in states in which they were able to vote to use their ballots and oppose any candidate not in favor of full enfranchisement of women.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1915|p=5}} One of the first places Stevens traveled to was [[Colorado]],{{sfn|Simkin|2014}} where CUWS was successful in attaining commitment from one congressman to support the women's cause.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1915|p=5}} Returning from that success in January 1915, she went to [[New York City]]{{sfn|''The Washington Post''|1915|p=16}} and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]] to campaign before heading west.{{sfn|''La Grande Observer''|1915|p=6}} She campaigned in [[Kansas]], hoping to secure delegates for a convention planned in [[San Francisco]] for September.{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1915|p=9}}

Arriving in [[California]] in June, Stevens accompanied a group of women led by [[Charlotte Anita Whitney]] to meet with [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] members who were meeting at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]], in [[San Francisco]]. The women had been assured that they would be able to present their issues, but the chair, Representative [[John J. Fitzgerald]] of New York, refused to allow it.{{sfn|''San Francisco Chronicle''|1915|p=1}} Undaunted, Whitney and Stevens continued their planning efforts{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|8/1915|p=9}} for the [[Panama Pacific Exposition]] CUWS Congress in San Francisco.{{sfn|Simkin|2014}} In San Francisco at the CUWS headquarters in 1915, Stevens discussed the strategy of employing a "million-vote smile", positing that smiling was a useful tool in the fight to win over men's support.

Look severe and they won't," she stated.{{sfn|''Fort Wayne Sentinel''|1915|p=8}} However, when Alice Paul arrived two weeks before the event, she canceled choral events, a parade and a mass meeting that had been planned for the [[Scottish Rite]] Hall. Stevens had been involved in supervising each of these events, though local women planned and orchestrated them. Paul did keep the luncheon and a ball to be held at the California building of the exposition.{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|8/1915|p=9}} After the September Congress, Stevens had planned to remain in San Francisco and run the exposition booth of CUWS, but she was forced to return to Washington because the eastern delegate Margaret Whittemore had left due to her marriage.{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|9/1915|p=17}} Stevens immediately began planning for a convention to be held in Washington in December.{{sfn|''The Washington Times''|1915|p=3}} [[File:Bastille Day spells prison for sixteen suffragettes who picketed the White House.

At the beginning of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates for each of the [[United States House of Representatives|435 House Districts]]. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that their constituents were in favor of women attaining the vote.{{sfn|''The Washington Herald''|1916|p=10}} Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year.{{sfn|''The Leavenworth Times''|1916|p=1}} On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage.{{sfn|Simkin|2014}}{{sfn|Haskin|1916|p=8}} After attending the NWP convention in [[Chicago]] in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado.{{sfn|''Chicago Daily Tribune''|1916|p=5}} By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.{{sfn|''San Francisco Chronicle''|1916|p=8}}[[File:Doris Stevens, Mrs. J.A.H.

==Arrest==
Due to the United States' entry into [[World War I]], some suffragists stopped their activism in 1917 because it might be seen as "unpatriotic;" Stevens, instead, insisted that it was "arrogant of Wilson to fight for democracy abroad when women were not included in democracy at home."{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} In January after a delegation of NWP members had a disappointing meeting with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], it was decided that they would protest at the [[White House]] every day, standing as [[Silent Sentinels]] until Wilson recognized the importance of their cause.{{sfn|Southard|2007|pp=399–400}} The women maintained their post for over a year disregarding weather conditions and the threat of arrest.{{sfn|Southard|2007|pp=407}} Though she performed other organizational tasks, such as organizing the [[North Carolina]] branch of the NWP in March,{{sfn|''The Charlotte Observer''|1917|p=5}} Stevens participated as a sentinel. She and fifteen other women were arrested for picketing at the [[White House]] on [[Bastille Day]], in July 1917, charged with obstructing the sidewalk,{{sfn|''Tyrone Daily Herald''|1917|p=1}}{{sfn|''San Antonio Express''|1963}} and served three days of their 60-day sentence at [[Occoquan Workhouse]] before receiving a [[presidential pardon|pardon]] from President Wilson.{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=39}}{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=44}} The women were placed within the prison population, given no toothbrushes, combs or toiletries and were surprised that they were required to share a water dipper with the rest of the prisoners.{{sfn|Tiller|1917|p=39}}

Stevens met her first husband, [[Dudley Field Malone]], when he represented her for her protest in front of the White House.{{sfn|''Austin Daily Herald''|1950|p=4}} He had been serving as an [[United States Assistant Secretary of State#Third Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] in the Wilson [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]], but was converted to the suffragist cause and resigned his post.{{sfn|''Decatur Herald''|1929|p=1}} He appeared with Stevens at fundraising events and helped raise thousands of dollars for their cause, which was gaining momentum, as President Wilson finally endorsed enfranchisement. Between 1918 and 1919, Stevens continued alternating speaking engagements{{sfn|''The Palm Beach Post''|1918|p=1}} and picketing. She was arrested again, along with [[Elsie Hill]], Alice Paul and three "[[Jane Doe]]" suffragists at the NWP demonstration of the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York in March 1919.{{sfn|''The Leavenworth Times''|1919|p=1}} On 4 September 1920, the fight was won when Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]] proclaimed the necessary 36 states had ratified the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] with [[Tennessee]]'s [[Ratification#Ratification in the United States Constitution|ratification]].{{sfn|Johnson|1920|p=4}} Stevens published the quintessential insider account of the imprisonment of NWP activists, ''Jailed for Freedom'', in 1920.{{sfn|Stevens|1920}}

[[File:Doris Stevens 157005v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Doris Stevens, 1919 Legislative Chairman, National Woman's Party]]Over the years, Stevens held several important NWP leadership positions, including Legislative Chairman{{sfn|''The Washington Herald''|1919|p=5}} and membership on the executive committee.{{sfn|Sherman|1924|p=3}} In 1920, [[Alva Belmont]] was elected president of the NWP{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=129}} and Stevens served as Belmont’s personal assistant, even writing Belmont's autobiography.{{sfn|Hoffert|2011|p=xi}} Belmont and Steven's relationship was contentious, but the younger Stevens accepted years of control by Belmont over many of her personal actions. Traveling to Europe with Belmont for work of the NWP, Belmont insisted that Steven's fiance could not join them and when he did, Belmont removed to France without Stevens.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|pp=300–301}}

On 5 December 1921 in [[Peekskill, New York]], Stevens and Malone were secretly married by a hardware store owner who was a [[Justice of the Peace]] and immediately sailed{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1921|p=22}} for their two-month honeymoon in [[Paris]]. Stevens announced she would not take Malone's name and would remain "Doris Stevens".{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1922|p=15}} From the middle of the 1920s, Stevens lived primarily in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]],{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}}{{sfn|Miescher|Mitchell|Shibusawa|2015|p=275}} where she became friends with leading members of the [[Greenwich Village]] radical scene and bohemians, including [[Louise Bryant]],{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=243}} [[Max Eastman|Max]] and [[Crystal Eastman]],{{sfn|McKay|Jarrett|2007|p=95}} [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and others.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=243}} Stevens divorced Malone in 1929{{sfn|''Decatur Herald''|1929|p=1}} after a string of infidelities on both sides and failed attempts at reconciliation.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=295}}

==Equality activism==
The focus of the NWP shifted to equality under the law, including equal employment opportunities, jury service, nationality for married women and any other provision which legally prohibited women from having full legal equality. In 1923, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] was introduced by [[Daniel Read Anthony, Jr.]] and the women pushed for its passage, lobbying for support from both political parties.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=129}} Stevens served as vice chair of NWP’s New York branch,{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} spearheading the NWP Women for Congress campaign in 1924. Unable to run herself due to her having established a legal residence in France, Stevens worked toward the goal of securing the election of 100 women to Congress in states where female candidates were among contenders for office.{{sfn|Sherman|1924|p=3}} The campaign had negligible results and the women shifted back to equality measures.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=130}} Beginning in 1926, one of the proposals Stevens focused on for the next several years was the "Wages for Wives" marriage contract.{{sfn|Cott|1987|p=337}} Campaigning vigorously for its adoption, the "Wages for Wives" proposal called for a flexible contract which split marital assets 50-50 rather than treating married couples as a single entity and called for women to be paid a wage for domestic services and raising children as a protection for children's continuous support.{{sfn|Stephen|1926|p=20}}

From the end of the War, a growing belief among women's organizations was the notion that all women faced similar problems as subordinates to men and that combining their interests might lead to gains. At the [[International Council of Women]] (ICW) conference held in Washington in 1925, the sentiment was expressed by [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]], welcoming all women to the "sisterhood, of whatever creed, party, section or class they may belong".{{sfn|Sandell|2015|pp=2–3}} In 1927, Stevens and Alice Paul undertook a massive study of how laws affected women's nationality; studying for example, if they lost their nationality by marrying or even became stateless.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens met with feminists throughout Europe and held public meetings to gather data, including Dr. [[Luisa Baralt]] of [[Havana]], Dr. [[Ellen Gleditsch]] of [[Oslo]], [[Chrystal Macmillan]] and [[Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda]] of the UK, the [[Marquesa del Ter]] of Spain, [[Maria Vérone]] of France and [[Hélène Vacaresco]] of Romania, as well as various officers of the [[International Federation of University Women]] and others.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} Paul reviewed the laws of each country. Together, they compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in its native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page. Tables were provided for easy comparison and a synopsis of the laws was given. The report was initially prepared for a meeting that was to take place at the [[League of Nations]] in 1930 to discuss codification of international laws.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens felt that nationality of women should be included in that discussion and spearheaded the research,{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} believing "feminism should strive for equal rights for women, and that women should be considered first and foremost as human beings."{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=79}} In September 1927, she attended a preliminary meeting of the League of Nations in [[Geneva]] and obtained their unanimous support of her proposal.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=2}} She continued meeting with women and gathering data until January 1928, when she attended the [[Pan-American Conference]] in Havana. Stevens convinced the governing body of the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]] to create the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] ({{lang-es|Comisión Interamericana de Mujeres}}) (CIM) on 4 April 1928.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=3}}{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=57}} [[File:Doris Stevens, right 276050v.jpg|thumb|Doris Stevens, right, talking to Sra. [[Clara González]] at the Pan-American Conference of Havana, January, 1928]]

The initial Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM) was made up of seven women delegates who were charged with finalizing the report for the next Pan-American Conference (1933) to review civil and political equality for women.{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=1}} Stevens served as chair of the CIM from its creation in 1928{{sfn|Lee|1929|p=4}} until her ouster in 1938.{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} By August, Stevens was back in Paris working on the report. She and other suffragists picketed the French president, [[Gaston Doumergue]], in 1928{{sfn|Ivy|1928|p=4}} in an attempt to get the world peace delegates to support an equal rights treaty.{{sfn|''Press-Courier''|1928|p=1}} They were dismissively described by a journalist who did cover the event as "militant suffragettes," and a Paris paper called the protest "an amusing incident."{{sfn|Ivy|1928|p=4}} Though arrested, they were released upon providing proof of their identities.{{sfn|''Press-Courier''|1928|p=1}}

In 1929, Stevens returned to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at the [[American University]] and [[Columbia University]] in international law and foreign policy.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} In 1930, she returned to Havana in February for the first meeting of the CIM women which included [[Flora de Oliveira Lima]] (Brazil), [[Aída Parada]] (Chile), [[Lydia Fernández]] (Costa Rica), [[Elena Mederos de González]] (Cuba), [[Gloria Moya de Jiménez]] (Dominican Republic), [[Irene de Peyré]] (Guatemala), [[Margarita Robles de Mendoza]] (Mexico), [[Juanita Molina de Fromen]] (Nicaragua), [[Clara González]] (Panama), [[Teresa Obregoso de Prevost]] (Peru).{{sfn|Seminar on Feminism and Culture|1990|p=17}} From Cuba, she went to [[The Hague]] for the first World Conference on the Codification of International Law held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship.{{sfn|Sickmon|1930|p=3}} She returned to the United States and her studies. Though she didn't graduate,{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} in 1931 she became the first woman member of the American Institute of International Law.{{sfn|Lee de Muñoz Marín|1931|p=1}} That same year, she, Belmont and Paul attended the League of Nations meeting in September{{sfn|Campbell|1931|p=4}} to present their nationality findings.{{sfn|McNamara|1931|p=4}}

==Seventh Pan-American Conference==
Stevens was very active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM.{{Sfn|Trigg|1995|p=77}} At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, the women presented their analysis of the legal status of women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women.{{sfn|Towns|2010|p=795}} Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven [[U.S. state|US states]], and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.{{sfn|Ganzert|1936|pp=C-5, C-10}}

After reviewing the data, the conference approved the first international agreement ever adopted on women's rights.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} The [[Convention on the Nationality of Women]] made it clear that should a woman marry a man of a different nationality, her citizenship could be retained.{{sfn|1933 resolutions|2015}} The text stated, "There shall be no distinction based on sex as regards to nationality". The conference also passed the Convention on Nationality, which established that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children as well.{{sfn|Shepherd|2014|p=326}} The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration, hoping to get rid of Stevens, then argued that the women's task was completed and the CIM should be abandoned. Not wanting to bow to US pressure, the Conference did not vote to continue the CIM, but instead voted as a unit, with the exception of Argentina, to block the US proposal.{{sfn|Towns|2010|p=796}}

==Later career==
It would take FDR another five years,{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} with the help of the [[League of Women Voters]] to replace Stevens.{{sfn|Trigg|1995|pp=64–65}} Making the argument that Stevens was appointed by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with [[Mary Nelson Winslow]].{{sfn|Bredbenner|1998|pp=246–247}} Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens.{{sfn|''The Delta Democrat-Times''|1939|p=6}} Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.{{sfn|Pfeffer|1996}}
 
In 1940, Stevens was elected to serve on the National Council of the National Woman's Party.{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} The following year, when Alice Paul returned from a two-year trip to Switzerland to establish the [[World Woman’s Party]] (WWP), difficulties arose. Paul experienced both challenges to the direction she was taking the NWP and had personality conflicts with members,{{sfn|Gavin|Clamar|Siderits|2007|pp=75–76}} including Stevens. When Alva Belmont died in 1933, the bequest she had promised Stevens for years of personal service was instead directed to the NWP. Stevens sued the estate, eventually receiving US$12,000, but she believed that Paul had sabotaged her relationship with Belmont.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} After Paul's resignation in 1945, Stevens did not support Paul's hand-selected replacement, [[Anita Pollitzer]] and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=552}} Pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for Paul and an internal dispute arose over the NWP’s emphasis on the WWP and international rights rather than domestic organizing. During these tensions, a dissenting faction of NWP members tried to take over party headquarters and elect their own slate of officers,{{sfn|Short|Purcell|2013}} but Pollitzer’s claim to leadership was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge.{{sfn|Sicherman|Green|1980|p=552}}

Stevens parted ways with the NWP in 1947 and turned instead to activity in the [[Lucy Stone League]],{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}} a women’s rights organization based on [[Lucy Stone]]'s retention of her [[maiden name]] after marriage. After [[World War II]] ended, the organization was revived in 1950 because the rights women had seen surge during the war were reverting to their pre-war state. Stevens was one of the reorganizers along with [[Freda Kirchwey]], [[Frances Perkins]] and others.{{sfn|''Toledo Blade''|1950|p=10}} Stevens had long been a proponent of a woman retaining her own name{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1922|p=15}} and did not take her husband's name in either of her marriages.{{sfn|''The Racine Sunday Bulletin''|1963|p=2A}} She had remarried to Jonathan Mitchell on August 31, 1935 in [[Portland, Maine]].{{sfn|''Oakland Tribune''|1935|p=1}} Mitchell was a reporter for ''[[The New Republic]]'' during the Roosevelt years{{sfn|Pearson|1954|p=4}} and later for the ''[[National Review]]'', and was an anti-communist.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} He took part in the [[Army–McCarthy hearings|McCarthy hearings]]{{sfn|Pearson|1954|p=4}} and Stevens, after her marriage to him, moved politically to the right, from her previously socialist leanings.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}}

From 1951 to 1963, Stevens served as vice-president of the Lucy Stone League,{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She did not follow a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was essential.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|pp=304–305}} In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of [[feminist studies]] as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at [[Radcliffe College]].{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}}

Stevens died on March 22, 1963 in [[New York City]],{{sfn|Gotwals|2007}} two weeks after having a stroke.{{sfn|''San Antonio Express''|1963|p=10-D}} [[Princeton University]] has an endowed chair in women's studies created by the Doris Stevens Foundation in 1986.{{sfn|Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|2011}}

==Legacy==
In 1986, Princeton University established an endowed chair through the Doris Stevens Foundation in women’s studies.{{sfn|Rupp|1989|p=292}} In 2004 the [[HBO]] film ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'' was made about the early days of the suffrage movement. Doris Stevens was portrayed by [[Laura Fraser]].{{sfn|''Iron Jawed Angels''|2004}}

In [[differential geometry]], the '''Einstein tensor''' (named after [[Albert Einstein]]; also known as the '''trace-reversed [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]]''') is used to express the [[curvature]] of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. In [[general relativity]], it occurs in the [[Einstein field equations]] for [[gravitation]] that describe [[spacetime]] curvature in a manner consistent with energy and momentum conservation.

== Definition ==
The Einstein tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tensor]] of order 2 defined over [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  In [[index-free notation]] it is defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{R}-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{g}R,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci tensor, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]]. In component form, the previous equation reads as

::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over2} g_{\mu\nu}R .&lt;/math&gt;

The Einstein tensor is symmetric
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = G_{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

and, like the [[stress–energy tensor]], divergenceless
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

== Explicit form ==
The Ricci tensor depends only on the metric tensor, so the Einstein tensor can be defined directly with just the metric tensor. However, this  expression is complex and rarely quoted in textbooks.  The complexity of this expression can be shown using the formula for the Ricci tensor in terms of [[Christoffel symbols]]:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G_{\alpha\beta} &amp;= R_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} R \\
&amp;= R_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} g^{\gamma\zeta} R_{\gamma\zeta} \\
&amp;= (\delta^\gamma_\alpha \delta^\zeta_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta}) R_{\gamma\zeta} \\
&amp;= (\delta^\gamma_\alpha \delta^\zeta_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta})(\Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\zeta,\epsilon} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\epsilon,\zeta} + \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\epsilon\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\gamma\zeta} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\zeta\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\epsilon\gamma}),  \\
G^{\alpha\beta} &amp;= (g^{\alpha\gamma} g^{\beta\zeta} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta})(\Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\zeta,\epsilon} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\epsilon,\zeta} + \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\epsilon\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\gamma\zeta} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\zeta\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\epsilon\gamma}),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker tensor]] and the Christoffel symbol &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\gamma} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha\epsilon}(g_{\beta\epsilon,\gamma} + g_{\gamma\epsilon,\beta} - g_{\beta\gamma,\epsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

Before cancellations, this formula results in &lt;math&gt;2 \times (6+6+9+9) = 60&lt;/math&gt; individual terms. Cancellations bring this number down somewhat. &lt;!-- exactly how much? --&gt;

In the special case of a locally [[inertial reference frame]] near a point, the first derivatives of the metric tensor vanish and the component form of the Einstein tensor is considerably simplified:

:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}G_{\alpha\beta} &amp; = g^{\gamma\mu}\bigl[ g_{\gamma[\beta,\mu]\alpha} + g_{\alpha[\mu,\beta]\gamma} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} g^{\epsilon\sigma} (g_{\epsilon[\mu,\sigma]\gamma} + g_{\gamma[\sigma,\mu]\epsilon})\bigr] \\ &amp; = g^{\gamma\mu} (\delta^\epsilon_\alpha \delta^\sigma_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g^{\epsilon\sigma}g_{\alpha\beta})(g_{\epsilon[\mu,\sigma]\gamma} + g_{\gamma[\sigma,\mu]\epsilon}),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where square brackets conventionally denote [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]] over bracketed indices, i.e.

:: &lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha[\beta,\gamma]\epsilon} \, = \frac{1}{2} (g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma\epsilon} - g_{\alpha\gamma,\beta\epsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

== Trace ==
The [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the Einstein tensor can be computed by [[Tensor contraction|contract]]ing the equation in the [[#Definition|definition]] with the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions (of arbitrary signature):

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}g^{\mu\nu}G_{\mu\nu} &amp;= g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over2} g^{\mu\nu}g_{\mu\nu}R \\ G &amp;= R - {1\over2} (nR) \\ G &amp;= {{2-n}\over2}R\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of n = 4 dimensions in physics (3 space, 1 time) gives &lt;math&gt;G\,&lt;/math&gt;, the trace of the Einstein tensor, as the negative of &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Ricci tensor]]'s trace. Thus another name for the Einstein tensor is the ''trace-reversed Ricci tensor''.

== Use in general relativity ==

The Einstein tensor allows the [[Einstein field equations]] (without a [[cosmological constant]]) to be written in the concise form:
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

which becomes in [[geometrized units]] (i.e. ''c'' = [[Gravitational constant|''G'']] (i.e. the Newton's gravitational constant and not the trace of the Einstein tensor) = 1),
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi \, T_{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[#Explicit form|explicit form of the Einstein tensor]], the Einstein tensor is a [[nonlinear]] function of the metric tensor, but is linear in the second [[partial derivative]]s of the metric. As a symmetric order-2 tensor, the Einstein tensor has 10 independent components in a 4-dimensional space. It follows that the Einstein field equations are a set of 10 [[Types of differential equations|quasilinear]] second-order partial differential equations for the metric tensor.

The [[contracted Bianchi identities]] can also be easily expressed with the aid of the Einstein tensor:
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\mu} G^{\mu\nu} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The (contracted) Bianchi identities automatically ensure the covariant conservation of the [[stress–energy tensor]] in curved spacetimes:
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu\nu} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical significance of the Einstein tensor is highlighted by this identity. In terms of the densitized stress tensor contracted on a [[Killing vector]] &lt;math&gt;\xi^\mu&lt;/math&gt;, an ordinary conservation law holds:
::&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu}(\sqrt{-g} T^\mu{}_\nu \xi^\nu) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uniqueness==
[[David Lovelock]] has shown that, in a four-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]], the Einstein tensor is the only [[tensor]]ial and [[divergence]]-free function of the &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and at most their first and second partial derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In [[logic]], two formulae are '''equisatisfiable''' if the first formula is [[satisfiable]] whenever the second is and vice versa; in other words, either both formulae are satisfiable or both are not. Equisatisfiable formulae may disagree, however, for a particular choice of variables. As a result, equisatisfiability is different  from [[logical equivalence]], as two equivalent formulae always have the same models.

Equisatisfiability is generally used in the context of translating formulae, so that one can define a translation to be correct if the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Examples of translations involving this concept are [[Skolemization]] and some translations into [[conjunctive normal form]]. 

==Examples==

A translation from propositional logic into propositional logic in which every binary disjunction &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;((a \vee n) \wedge (\neg n \vee b))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a new variable (one for each replaced disjunction) is a transformation in which satisfiability is preserved: the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Note that these two formulae are not equivalent: the first formula has the model in which &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is true while &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are false, and this is not a model of the second formula, in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has to be true in this case.

'''Freethought''' (or "free thought")&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that positions regarding [[truth]] should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]]. In particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought|title=Free thought – Define Free thought at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs.

==Definition==
Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].

Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[The nature of God in Western theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Symbol==
[[Image:Pansy aka.jpg|thumb|The [[pansy]], symbol of freethought]]

The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Monk, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=0-472-06938-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=1-57181-299-7 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=0-8014-3485-8 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{Main|Organized secularism}}
The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N.

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches.

====Canada====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England.

In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada. HAC, also known as Humanist Canada, operates as an active voice for humanism in Canada{{cn|date=May 2018}} and supports the activities of groups who wish to raise awareness about secular issues.

The [http://www.secularalliance.ca Canadian Secular Alliance] is an active community.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–32 |id= |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">In [[computer science]], a '''function type''' (or '''arrow type''' or '''exponential''') is the type of a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] or [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]] to which a [[function (computer science)|function]] has or can be assigned, or an argument or result type of a [[higher-order function]] taking or returning a function.

A function type depends on the type of the parameters and the result type of the function (it, or more accurately the unapplied [[type constructor]] &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|· → ·}}&lt;/code&gt;, is a [[higher-kinded type]]). In theoretical settings and [[programming language]]s where functions are defined in [[curried form]], such as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], a function type depends on exactly two types, the [[domain of a function|domain]] ''A'' and the [[range of a function|range]] ''B''. Here a function type is often denoted {{math|''A'' → ''B''}}, following mathematical convention, or {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, based on there existing exactly {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (exponentially many) [[function space|set-theoretic functions]] mappings ''A'' to ''B'' in the [[category of sets]]. The class of such maps or functions is called the [[exponential object]]. The act of [[currying]] makes the function type [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to the [[product type]]; this is explored in detail in the article on currying.

The function type can be considered to be a special case of the [[Dependent type#Formal definition|dependent product type]], which among other properties, encompasses the idea of a [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic function]].

== Programming languages ==
The syntax used for function types in several programming languages can be summarized, including an example type signature for the higher-order [[function composition (computer science)|function composition]] function:
{| class=wikitable
|-
! colspan=2 | Language !! Notation !! Example [[type signature]]
|-
| rowspan=6 | With [[first-class function]]s,&lt;br&gt; [[parametric polymorphism]]
| [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]
| &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''ρ''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=csharp|Func&lt;A,C&gt; compose(Func&lt;B,C&gt; f, Func&lt;A,B&gt; g);}}
|-
| [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]
| &lt;code&gt;''α'' -&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=haskell|compose :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; c}}
|-
| [[OCaml]]
| &lt;code&gt;''α'' -&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=ocaml|compose : ('b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c}}
|-
| [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]
| &lt;code&gt;(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=scala|1=def compose[A, B, C](f: B =&gt; C, g: A =&gt; B): A =&gt; C }}
|-
| [[Standard ML]]
| &lt;code&gt;''α'' -&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=sml|compose : ('b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c}}
|-
| [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]
| &lt;code&gt;''α'' -&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=swift|func compose&lt;A,B,C&gt;(f: B -&gt; C, g: A -&gt; B) -&gt; A -&gt; C}}
|-
| rowspan=2 |  With [[first-class function]]s,&lt;br&gt; without [[parametric polymorphism]]
| [[Go (programming language)|Go]]
| &lt;code&gt;func(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=go|var compose func(func(int)int, func(int)int) func(int)int}}
|-
| [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], with [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]]
| &lt;code&gt;''ρ'' (^)(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=objc|int (^compose(int (^f)(int), int (^g)(int)))(int);}}
|-
| rowspan=2 | Without [[first-class function]]s,&lt;br&gt; [[parametric polymorphism]]
| [[C (programming language)|C]]
| &lt;code&gt;''ρ'' (*)(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=c|int (*compose(int (*f)(int), int (*g)(int)))(int);}}
|-
| [[C++11]]
| Not unique.
&lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;''ρ'' (''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the more general type (see below).
| {{code|2=cpp|function&lt;function&lt;int(int)&gt;(function&lt;int(int)&gt;, function&lt;int(int)&gt;)&gt; compose;}}

|}

When looking at the example type signature of, for example C#, the type of the function {{code|compose}} is actually &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;Func&lt;A,B&gt;,Func&amp;lt;B,C&gt;,Func&lt;A,C&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Due to [[type erasure]] in C++11's &lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;/code&gt;, it is more common to use [[Template (C++)|templates]] for higher order function parameters and type inference (&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;) for closures.

== Denotational semantics ==
The function type in programming languages does not correspond to the space of all set-theoretic functions. Given the [[countably infinite]] type of [[natural number]]s as the domain and the booleans as range, then there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number (2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = [[Cardinality of the continuum|c]]) of set-theoretic functions between them. Clearly this space of functions is larger than the number of functions that can be defined in any programming language, as there exist only countably many programs (a program being a finite sequence of a finite number of symbols) and one of the set-theoretic functions effectively solves the [[halting problem]].

[[Denotational semantics]] concerns itself with finding more appropriate models (called [[domain theory|domains]]) to model programming language concepts such as function types. It turns out that restricting expression to the set of [[computable function]]s is not sufficient either if the programming language allows writing [[non-terminating computation]]s (which is the case if the programming language is [[Turing complete]]). Expression must be restricted to the so-called ''[[Continuous functions#Continuous functions between partially ordered sets|continuous functions]]'' (corresponding to continuity in the [[Scott topology]], not continuity in the real analytical sense). Even then, the set of continuous function contains the ''parallel-or'' function, which cannot be correctly defined in all programming languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">The '''Geek Pride Festival''' was the name of a number of events between 1998 and 2000, organized by [[Tim McEachern]] and devoted to computer [[geek]] activities and interests. The name of the festival is most often associated with the large event held on March 31 and April 1, 2000 at the Park Plaza Castle in [[Boston]], United States.

Before that there were two events at the now closed Big House Brewery in [[Albany, New York]]. [http://www.wamc.org WAMC], the local NPR affiliate, sponsored the events which were organized by Tim McEachern.

==2000 event==
{{Tone|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Geek pride festival t-shirt.png|thumb|right|Geek Pride Festival T-shirt]]
The 2000 event was a major production, organized with the help of [[Susan Kaup]], Chris O'Brien and many volunteers.

The event began Friday night, with a swap meet / social event at the Modern Lounge in Boston's [[Landsdowne Street]] nightclub district. Drink tickets were offered at the door, and the DJ played computer-themed music (e.g., ''[[It's All About The Pentiums]]'').

On Saturday, the main event occurred at the Castle, where admission was free. The middle of the floor held the "Email Garden", comprising about a dozen tables with [[Personal computer|PC]]s running [[Red Hat Linux]], in a wired [[LAN]] network and providing [[email]], [[World Wide Web|Web]], and general [[Internet]] access. At the front of the hall was a stage, which hosted a number of invited guests, including [[Rob Malda]] of [[Slashdot]], [[Eric S. Raymond]], the [[video game]] cover band [[Everyone (band)|Everyone]]. The stage was also host to the final round of a [[Quake III]] tournament, held in a back room, displayed on the stage's projection screen, as well as the final round of "Stump the Geek", a geek [[trivia]] contest.

Aside from the main events, the main floor had computer workstations displaying live [[webcam]] feeds of "satellite" Festivals in remote locations. A live [[Shoutcast]] feed was also provided of the Boston event. A poll for "greatest geek hero" was also held; the official winner was [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything.blockstackers.com/index.pl?node_id=475132]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Science/AAAS magazine, 2,000 people attended, though the open-door free admission made an official count impossible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Other events==
The 2000 event is widely referred to as the "first annual" event, although McEachern organized at least one previous event named Geek Pride Festival (and/or Geek Pride Day) at a bar in Albany, New York. Some sources refer to the Boston event as the ''third'' annual.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

McEachern planned another event to take place later the same year in [[San Francisco]], but was never realized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13549">In mathematics, a '''Grothendieck category''' is a certain kind of [[abelian category]], introduced in [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s [[Grothendieck's Tôhoku paper|Tôhoku paper of 1957]]&lt;ref name="tohoku"&gt;{{citation|first=A.|last=Grothendieck|authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|title=Sur quelques points d’algèbre homologique|journal=[[Tôhoku Mathematical Journal]]|volume=9|series=(2)|pages=119–221|year=1957|mr=0102537|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.tmj/1178244839|doi=10.2748/tmj/1178244839}}. [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/gk.pdf English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; in order to develop the machinery of [[homological algebra]] for [[module (mathematics)|module]]s and for [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] in a unified manner. The theory of these categories was further developed in [[Pierre Gabriel|Peter Gabriel]]'s seminal thèse in 1962.&lt;ref name="gabriel-these"&gt;{{citation|first=P.|last=Gabriel|authorlink=Pierre Gabriel|title=Des catégories abéliennes|url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/gabriel.pdf|journal=Bull. Soc. math. France|volume=90|pages=323–448|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To every [[algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; one can associate a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Qcoh}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of the [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. This category encodes all the relevant geometric information about &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; can be recovered from &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Qcoh}(V)&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem]]). This example gives rise to one approach to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]: the study of "non-commutative varieties" is then nothing but the study of (certain) Grothendieck categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Ruled Surfaces|author=Izuru Mori|year=2007|url=http://mathsoc.jp/section/algebra/algsymp_past/algsymp07_files/mouri.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
By definition, a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[AB5 category]] with a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]]. Spelled out, this means that
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian category]];
* every (possibly infinite) family of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[coproduct]] (a.k.a. direct sum) in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[direct limit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact; this means that if a direct system of [[short exact sequence]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given, then the induced sequence of direct limits is a short exact sequence as well. (Direct limits are always [[exact functor|right-exact]]; the important point here is that we require them to be [[exact functor|left-exact]] as well.)
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; possesses a generator, i.e. there is an object &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(G,-)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[faithful functor]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[category of sets]]. (In our situation, this is equivalent to saying that every object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; admits an [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;G^{(I)}\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G^{(I)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a direct sum of copies of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, one for each element of the (possibly infinite) set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.)

The name "Grothendieck category" neither appeared in Grothendieck's Tôhoku paper&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt; nor in Gabriel's thesis;&lt;ref name="gabriel-these"/&gt; it came into use in the second half of the 1960s by authors including J.-E. Roos, B. Stenström, U. Oberst, and B. Pareigis. (Some authors use a different definition in that they don't require the existence of a generator.)

==Examples==
* The prototypical example of a Grothendieck category is the [[category of abelian groups]]; the abelian group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers can serve as a generator.
* More generally, given any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (associative, with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, but not necessarily commutative), the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of all right (or alternatively: left) [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; itself can serve as a generator.
* Given a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the category of all [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt; (More generally: the category of all sheaves of right &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.)  
* Given a [[ringed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt;, the category of [[Sheaves of modules|sheaves of ''O&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''-modules]] is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt;
* Given an (affine or projective) [[algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally: a [[quasi-compact]] [[Glossary of scheme theory#Separated and proper morphisms|quasi-separated]] [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]), the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Qcoh}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.
* Given a small site (''C'', ''J'') (i.e. a small category ''C'' together with a [[Grothendieck topology]] ''J''), the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on the site is a Grothendieck category.

=== Constructing further Grothendieck categories ===

* Any category that's [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a Grothendieck category is itself a Grothendieck category.
* Given Grothendieck categories  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A_1},\ldots,\mathcal{A_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[product category]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A_1}\times\ldots\times\mathcal{A_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.
* Given a [[Category (mathematics)#Small and large categories|small category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[functor category]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Funct}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of all [[Covariant functor|covariant functors]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku" /&gt;
* Given a small [[preadditive category|preadditive]] category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the functor category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Add}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of all additive covariant functors from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=vsfyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA487|title=Algebra: Rings, Modules and Categories I|last=Faith|first=Carl|publisher=Springer|year=1973|location=|pages=486-498|language=en|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[localizing subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then both &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Serre quotient category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; are Grothendieck categories.&lt;ref name="gabriel-these" /&gt;

==Properties and theorems==
Every Grothendieck category contains an [[injective cogenerator]]. For example, an injective cogenerator of the category of abelian groups is the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every object in a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; has an [[injective hull]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel-these"/&gt;  This allows to construct [[injective resolution]]s and thereby the use of the tools of [[homological algebra]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, such as [[derived functor]]s. (Note that not all Grothendieck categories allow [[projective resolution]]s for all objects; examples are categories of sheaves of abelian groups on many topological spaces, such as on the space of real numbers.)

In a Grothendieck category, any family of [[subobject]]s &lt;math&gt;(U_i)&lt;/math&gt; of a given object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a [[supremum]] (or "sum") &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_i U_i&lt;/math&gt; as well as an [[infimum]] (or "intersection") &lt;math&gt;\cap_i U_i&lt;/math&gt;, both of which are again subobjects of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Further, if the family &lt;math&gt;(U_i)&lt;/math&gt; is directed (i.e. for any two objects in the family, there is a third object in the family that contains the two), and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is another subobject of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}(U_i\cap V) = \left(\sum_{i}U_i\right) \cap V.&lt;/math&gt;

Grothendieck categories are [[Subobject|well-powered]] (sometimes called ''locally small'', although that term is also used for a different concept), i.e. the collection of subobjects of any given object forms a set (rather than a [[proper class]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in a Grothendieck category is called ''finitely generated'' if the sum of every directed family of proper subobjects of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is again a proper subobject of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. (In the case &lt;math&gt;{\cal A} = \operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of module categories, this notion is equivalent to the familiar notion of [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated modules]].) A Grothendieck category need not contain any non-zero finitely generated objects. A Grothendieck category is called ''locally finitely generated'' if it has a set of finitely generated generators. In such a category, every object is the sum of its finitely generated subobjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is a rather deep result that every Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Complete category|complete]], i.e. that arbitrary [[limit (category theory)|limit]]s (and in particular [[product (category theory)|product]]s) exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, it follows directly from the definition that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is co-complete, i.e. that arbitrary [[limit (category theory)|colimits]] and [[coproduct]]s (direct sums) exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Coproducts in a Grothendieck category are exact (i.e. the coproduct of a family of short exact sequences is again a short exact sequence), but products need not be exact.

A functor &lt;math&gt;F : {\cal A} \to {\cal X}&lt;/math&gt; from a Grothendieck categories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Adjoint functors|left adjoint]] if and only if it commutes with all limits, and it has a right adjoint if and only if it commutes with all colimits. This follows from [[Peter J. Freyd|Freyd]]'s s''pecial adjoint functor theorem'' and its dual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician, 2nd edition|last=Lane|first=Saunders Mac|publisher=Springer|year=1978|location=|pages=130|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]] states that any Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a [[full subcategory]] of the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of right modules over some unital ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (which can be taken to be the [[endomorphism ring]] of a generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained as a [[Quotient_of_an_abelian_category|Gabriel quotient]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; by some [[localizing subcategory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=N. Popesco, P. Gabriel|title=Caractérisation des catégories abéliennes avec générateurs et limites inductives exactes|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=258|year=1964|pages=4188–4190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of Gabriel–Popescu, one can show that every Grothendieck category is [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Šťovíček|first=Jan|date=2013-01-01|title=Deconstructibility and the Hill Lemma in Grothendieck categories|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.3251|journal=Forum Mathematicum|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every small abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded in a Grothendieck category, in the following fashion. The category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}:=\operatorname{Lex}(\mathcal{C}^{op},\mathrm{Ab})&lt;/math&gt; of [[Exact functor|left-exact]] additive (covariant) functors &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{op}\rightarrow\mathrm{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[category of abelian groups]]) is a Grothendieck category, and the functor &lt;math&gt;h\colon\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;C\mapsto h_C=\operatorname{Hom}(-,C)&lt;/math&gt;, is full, faithful and exact. A generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the coproduct of all &lt;math&gt;h_C&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;C\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="gabriel-these" /&gt; The category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the category &lt;math&gt;\text{Ind}(\mathcal C)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Filtered category|ind-objects]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the embedding &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the natural embedding  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}\to\text{Ind}(\mathcal C)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Institutional Analysis and Development framework''' ('''IAD''') was developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American [[political scientist]], also known as the first woman to receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD relates a set of concepts to help in the analysis of collective action problems that involve social structures, positions, and rules. Under the rational choice models, the IAD was devised in an attempt to ''explain and predict'' outcomes by formalising the structures, positions, and rules involved in collective choice problems. Thus, it can be seen as a [[Systematic sampling|systematic method]] to collect policy analysis functions similar to [[analytical technique|analytic technique]] commonly used in [[Physical science|physical]] and [[social science]]s and understand how institution operate and change over a period of time&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael D. McGinnis|title=An Introduction to IAD and the Language of the Ostrom Workshop: A Simple Guide to a Complex Framework for the Analysis of Institutions and Their Development|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=751119001100098006090092064001065006034048031046008017077070065006068117100125067022058117006035008099001118111016111092122095106078039042042125118092118002001030086033030046005106074116117000084089121084&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret M.

=== Components of the framework ===
[[File:IAD framework diagram.png|thumb|400px|IAD framework diagram]]
Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the regularised interactions in an established social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt; The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation)&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8085.pdf|title=Understanding Institutional Diversity|author=Elinor Ostrom|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831739|location=Princeton|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Krister Andersson|title=Understanding decentralized forest governance: an application of the institutional analysis and development framework|url=http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol2iss1/0507-010.andersson.html|journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Interstellar travel''' is the term used for [[Human spaceflight|crewed]] or uncrewed travel between [[star]]s or [[planetary system]]s. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than [[interplanetary spaceflight]]; the distances between the [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]] are less than 30 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in [[light-year]]s. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the [[speed of light]]; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.

The speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] can provide. Even with a hypothetically perfectly efficient propulsion system, the [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's standards of [[energy development]]. Moreover, collisions by the spacecraft with [[cosmic dust]] and gas can produce very dangerous effects both to passengers and the spacecraft itself.

A number of strategies have been proposed to deal with these problems, ranging from giant arks that would carry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic [[space probe]]s. Many different [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including [[nuclear propulsion]], [[beam-powered propulsion]], and methods based on speculative physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/advocacy/interstellar-travel|title=Interstellar Travel|website=www.bis-space.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both crewed and uncrewed interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met. Even the most optimistic views about interstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades from now. However, in spite of the challenges, if or when interstellar travel is realised, a wide range of scientific benefits is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=The Astronomical, Astrobiological and Planetary Science Case for Interstellar Spaceflight|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2009|volume=62|pages=415–421|arxiv=1008.4893|bibcode = 2009JBIS...62..415C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most interstellar travel concepts require a developed space logistics system capable of moving millions of tons to a construction / operating location, and most would require gigawatt-scale power for construction or power (such as [[Starwisp|Star Wisp]] or [[Solar sail|Light Sail]] type concepts). Such a system could grow organically if [[space-based solar power]] became a significant component of Earth's energy mix. Consumer demand for a multi-terawatt system would automatically create the necessary multi-million ton/year logistical system.&lt;ref&gt;Conclusion of the 2016 Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop Space Solar Power Working Track run by Peter Garretson &amp; Robert Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Interstellar distances ===
Distances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in astronomical units (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some {{convert|1.5E8|km|e6mi|sp=us|abbr=off}}. [[Venus]], the closest other planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. [[Neptune]], the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. As of January 2018, [[Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]], the farthest man-made object from Earth, is 141.5 AU away.&lt;ref name="voyager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/|title=Where are the Voyagers – NASA Voyager|last=JPL.NASA.GOV|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest known star, [[Proxima Centauri]], is approximately {{convert|4.243|ly|AU|0|disp=output only}} away, or over 9,000 times farther away than Neptune.
&lt;!--
1 A.U. = 149,597,870,700 meters,
1 light-year = 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters or 63241.077 AU,
Venus perihelion = 0.7184 AU
Neptune perihelion = 29.809946 AU
Voyager 1 distance (2014/sep) = 129.18 AU
Proxima = 4.243 ± 0.002 light years away.

Because of this, distances between stars are usually expressed in [[light-year]]s, defined as the distance that a [[light]] [[photon]] travels in a year. Light in a vacuum travels around {{convert|300000|km|mi|-3}} per second, so this is some {{convert|{{convert|1|ly|Pm|3|disp=number}}e12|km|e12mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} or {{convert|1|ly|AU|0}} in a year. Proxima Centauri is 4.243 light-years away.

Another way of understanding the vastness of interstellar distances is by scaling: One of the closest stars to the Sun, [[Alpha Centauri A]] (a Sun-like star), can be pictured by scaling down the [[astronomical unit|Earth–Sun distance]] to {{convert|1|m|ft|2|spell=in|sp=us}}. On this scale, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be {{convert|276|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}&lt;!--Using 4.37 ly from Alpha Centauri page--&gt;.

The fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, [[Voyager 1#Interstellar mission|Voyager 1]], has covered 1/600 of a light-year in 30 years and is currently moving at 1/18,000 the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/scales.html | title= A Look at the Scaling | website= nasa.gov | publisher= NASA Glenn Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Required energy ===
A significant factor contributing to the difficulty is the energy that must be supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the [[kinetic energy]] &lt;math&gt;K = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the final mass. If [[deceleration]] on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the lower bound for the required energy is doubled to &lt;math&gt;mv^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last=Millis |first=Marc G. |year=2011 |title=Energy, incessant obsolescence, and the first interstellar missions |journal=&lt;!-- --&gt; |volume=&lt;!-- --&gt; |issue=&lt;!-- --&gt; |eprint=1101.1066 |class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is several thousand times greater than those of present space vehicles. This means that due to the &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; term in the kinetic energy formula, millions of times as much energy is required. Accelerating one ton to one-tenth of the speed of light requires at least {{convert|450|PJ|J TWh|sigfig=3|abbr=off|disp=or}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirnstein|first1=E.J|title=Simulating the Compton-Getting Effect for Hydrogen Flux Measurements: Implications for IBEX-Hi and -Lo Observations |journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2013|volume=778|issue=2|pages=112–127|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/778/2/112|bibcode=2013ApJ...778..112Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[world energy consumption]] 2008 was 143,851&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hours),{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} without factoring in efficiency of the propulsion mechanism. This energy has to be generated onboard from stored fuel, harvested from the interstellar medium, or projected over immense distances.

=== Interstellar medium ===
A knowledge of the properties of the [[interstellar medium|interstellar gas and dust]] through which the vehicle must pass is essential for the design of any interstellar space mission.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt; A major issue with traveling at extremely high speeds is that interstellar dust may cause considerable damage to the craft, due to the high relative speeds and large kinetic energies involved. Various shielding methods to mitigate this problem have been proposed.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/637131main_radiation%20shielding_symposium_r1.pdf | title= Active Radiation Shielding Utilizing High Temperature Superconductors | author= Westover, Shayne | conference= NIAC Symposium | date= 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger objects (such as macroscopic dust grains) are far less common, but would be much more destructive. The risks of impacting such objects, and methods of mitigating these risks, have been discussed in the literature, but many unknowns remain&lt;ref name="HGarrett"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | title= There and Back Again: A Layman’s Guide to Ultra-Reliability for Interstellar Missions | author= Garrett, Henry | date= 30 July 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062130/http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | archivedate= 8 May 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, owing to the inhomogeneous distribution of interstellar matter around the Sun, will depend on direction travelled.&lt;ref name=ism&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=Project Icarus: A review of local interstellar medium properties of relevance for space missions to the nearest stars|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=2011|volume=68|issue=7–8|pages=691–699|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.10.016|arxiv=1010.4823|bibcode = 2011AcAau..68..691C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high density interstellar medium may cause difficulties for many interstellar travel concepts, [[Bussard ramjet|interstellar ramjets]], and some proposed concepts for decelerating interstellar spacecraft, would actually benefit from a denser interstellar medium.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt;

=== Hazards ===
The crew of an interstellar ship would face several significant hazards, including the psychological effects of long-term [[solitude|isolation]], the effects of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], and the physiological effects of [[weightlessness]] to the muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and eyes. There also exists the risk of impact by [[micrometeoroid]]s and other [[space debris]]. These risks represent challenges that have yet to be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Space Dangers: Outer Space Perils|last= Gibson|first=Dirk|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dvYADgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wait calculation ===
It has been argued that an interstellar mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate).&lt;ref name="Bob Forward 1996" /&gt; On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Interstellar Travel: The Wait Calculation and the Incentive Trap of Progress |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=59 |number=7 |date=July 2006|pages=239–246 |last= Kennedy |first=Andrew |url= http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.239 &lt;!--|id=Refcode 2006.59.239--&gt;|bibcode = 2006JBIS...59..239K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those that leave at the minimum, whereas voyages that leave after the minimum will never overtake those that left at the minimum.

== Prime targets for interstellar travel ==
There are 59 known [[stellar system]]s within 40 light years of the Sun, containing 81 visible stars. The following could be considered prime targets for interstellar missions:&lt;ref name="Bob Forward 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Robert L. |last=Forward |title=Ad Astra! |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |date=1996|bibcode = 1996JBIS...49...23F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing and near-term astronomical technology is capable of finding planetary systems around these objects, increasing their potential for exploration

== Proposed methods ==

=== Slow, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}
Slow interstellar missions based on current and near-future propulsion technologies are associated with trip times starting from about one hundred years to thousands of years. These missions consist of sending a robotic probe to a nearby star for exploration, similar to interplanetary probes such as used in the [[Voyager program]].&lt;ref name="National Aeronautics and Space Administration"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voyager|date=1977|publisher=ERIC Clearing House|location=Louisiana State University|page=12|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=76390b8e-3776-42f2-87d0-14f9ce6435e2%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4210&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=lalu.2943532&amp;db=cat00252a|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking along no crew, the cost and complexity of the mission is significantly reduced although technology lifetime is still a significant issue next to obtaining a reasonable speed of travel. Proposed concepts include [[Project Daedalus]], [[Project Icarus (interstellar)|Project Icarus]], [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]], [[Project Longshot]],&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=31478|title=Project Dragonfly: The case for small, laser-propelled, distributed probes|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently [[Breakthrough Starshot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161003-the-myths-and-reality-about-interstellar-travel|title=The myths and reality about interstellar travel|last=Nogrady|first=Bianca|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}

==== Nanoprobes ====
Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be possible within the near future built on existing microchip technology with a newly developed nanoscale thruster. Researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] are developing thrusters that use nanoparticles as propellant. Their technology is called "nanoparticle field extraction thruster", or [[Nano-particle field extraction thruster|nanoFET]]. These devices act like small particle accelerators shooting conductive nanoparticles out into space.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Wilson. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31665236/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/near-lightspeed-nano-spacecraft-might-be-close/#.T9v9Dz5Yu44 Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be close]. ''msnbc.msn.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michio Kaku]], a theoretical physicist, has suggested that clouds of "smart dust" be sent to the stars, which may become possible with advances in [[nanotechnology]]. Kaku also notes that a large number of nanoprobes would need to be sent due to the vulnerability of very small probes to be easily deflected by magnetic fields, micrometeorites and other dangers to ensure the chances that at least one nanoprobe will survive the journey and reach the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Physics of the Impossible|last = Kaku|first = Michio|publisher =Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the light weight of these probes, it would take much less energy to accelerate them. With onboard solar cells, they could continually accelerate using solar power. One can envision a day when a fleet of millions or even billions of these particles swarm to distant stars at nearly the speed of light and relay signals back to Earth through a vast interstellar communication network.

As a near-term solution, small, laser-propelled interstellar probes, based on current CubeSat technology were proposed in the context of [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]].&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org" /&gt;

=== Slow, manned missions ===
In crewed missions, the duration of a slow interstellar journey presents a major obstacle and existing concepts deal with this problem in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=A. M.|title=How Will Humans Fly to the Stars?|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=22561|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be distinguished by the "state" in which humans are transported on-board of the spacecraft.

==== Generation ships ====
{{Main|Generation ship}}
A [[generation ship]] (or '''world ship''') is a type of [[interstellar ark]] in which the crew that arrives at the destination is descended from those who started the journey. Generation ships are not currently feasible because of the difficulty of constructing a ship of the enormous required scale and the great biological and sociological problems that life aboard such a ship raises.&lt;!---So? nothing else in this article is, either---&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein 2012 119–133"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hein|first=A.

==== Suspended animation ====
{{Main|Sleeper ship}}

Scientists and writers have postulated various techniques for [[suspended animation]]. These include human [[hibernation]] and [[cryonics|cryonic preservation]]. Although neither is currently practical, they offer the possibility of [[sleeper ship]]s in which the passengers lie inert for the long duration of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Various articles on hibernation|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2006|volume=59|pages=81–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Frozen embryos ====
{{Main|Embryo colonization}}
A [[robotic]] interstellar mission carrying some number of frozen early stage human [[embryo]]s is another theoretical possibility. This method of [[space colonization]] requires, among other things, the development of an [[artificial uterus]], the prior detection of a habitable [[terrestrial planet]], and advances in the field of fully autonomous [[robotics|mobile robots]] and educational robots that would replace human parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowl|first=A.|author2=Hunt, J. |author3=Hein, A.M. |title=Embryo Space Colonisation to Overcome the Interstellar Time Distance Bottleneck|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2012|volume=65|pages=283–285|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2012.65.283|bibcode = 2012JBIS...65..283C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Island hopping through interstellar space ===
Interstellar space is not completely empty; it contains trillions of icy bodies ranging from small asteroids ([[Oort cloud]]) to possible [[rogue planet]]s. There may be ways to take advantage of these resources for a good part of an interstellar trip, slowly hopping from body to body or setting up waystations along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=21719|title=‘Island-Hopping’ to the Stars|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast missions ===
If a spaceship could average 10&amp;nbsp;percent of light speed (and decelerate at the destination, for manned missions), this would be enough to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] in forty years. Several propulsion concepts have been proposed &lt;ref name=crawist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.| date= 1990|title=Interstellar Travel: A Review for Astronomers|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=31|pages=377–400|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990QJRAS..31..377C&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf|bibcode=1990QJRAS..31..377C}}&lt;/ref&gt; that might be eventually developed to accomplish this (see [[Interstellar travel#Propulsion|§ Propulsion]] below), but none of them are ready for near-term (few decades) developments at acceptable cost.

==== Time dilation ====
{{Main|Time dilation}}

Assuming faster-than-light travel is impossible, one might conclude that a human can never make a round-trip farther from Earth than 20 light years if the traveler is active between the ages of 20 and 60. A traveler would never be able to reach more than the very few star systems that exist within the limit of 20 light years from Earth. This, however, fails to take into account relativistic [[time dilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=Bradford W.|last2=Spilker|first2=James J. Jr.|last3=Axelrad|first3=Penina|last4=Enge|first4=Per|title=18.2.2.1Time Dilation|date=2014|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=978-1-56347-106-3|url=http://app.knovel.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/hotlink/pdf/rcid:kpGPSVTA03/id:kt00C9LNA2/global-positioning-system/time-dilation?kpromoter=federation.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1&amp;nbsp;g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.

For example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.

From the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.

At higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.

==== Constant acceleration ====

Regardless of how it is achieved, a propulsion system that could produce acceleration continuously from departure to arrival would be the fastest method of travel. A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial "gravity" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed). It will undergo [[hyperbolic motion (relativity)|hyperbolic motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Yagasaki|first1 = Kazuyuki|title = Invariant Manifolds And Control Of Hyperbolic Trajectories On Infinite- Or Finite-Time Intervals|journal = Dynamical Systems: an International Journal|date = 2008|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 309–331|doi = 10.1080/14689360802263571|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?sid=d00eb956-7105-4cbf-9f16-c9099d40da11%40sessionmgr4001&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%253fdirect%253dtrue%2526db%253dcph%2526AN%253d34168097%2526site%253deds-live%2526scope%253dsite%2526profile%253deds-main&amp;hid=4111&amp;vid=0&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=34168097&amp;db=cph|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship will be close to the speed of light after about a year of accelerating and remain at that speed until it brakes for the end of the journey.

From the perspective of an onboard observer, the crew will feel a [[gravitational field]] opposite the engine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.

When the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].

The result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.

== Propulsion ==

=== Rocket concepts ===
All rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, including fuel) to final (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, fuel depleted) mass.

Very high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= VISTA – A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C. D. | date= 16 May 2003 | publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | url= https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/318478.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat transfer is inevitable and a tremendous heating load must be adequately handled.

Thus, for interstellar rocket concepts of all technologies, a key engineering problem (seldom explicitly discussed) is limiting the heat transfer from the exhaust stream back into the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Exploration of Space | author= Clarke, Arthur C. | publisher= New York: Harper | date= 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ion engine ====
A type of electric propulsion, spacecraft such as [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]] use an [[ion engine]]. In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&amp;nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10⁶ N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&amp;nbsp;km/s to 35&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="http://www.iflscience.com"&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nuclear fission powered ====

===== Fission-electric =====
Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power solar system exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]] powered by a portable power-source, say a [[nuclear reactor]], producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the [[velocity of light]], thus unsuitable for interstellar flight during a single human lifetime.&lt;ref name="scholar.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{citation|url=http://daedalus-zvezdolet.narod.ru/doceng/07eng.doc |title=Project Daedalus: The Propulsion System Part 1; Theoretical considerations and calculations. 2.

===== Fission-fragment =====
[[Fission-fragment rocket]]s use [[nuclear fission]] to create high-speed jets of fission fragments, which are ejected at speeds of up to {{convert|12,000|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}. With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the effective exhaust velocity to about 5% of the velocity of light. For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the "ash" of the primary energy source, so no extra reaction mass need be bookkept in the mass ratio.

===== Nuclear pulse =====
{{Main|Nuclear pulse propulsion}}
[[File:Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.jpg|thumb|Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.]]Based on work in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been technically possible to build spaceships with [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] engines, i.e. driven by a series of nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high [[specific impulse]] (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]].&lt;ref name="GeneralDynamics1964NuclearPulseVehicleCondensed"&gt;{{cite web

[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] team member [[Freeman Dyson]] proposed in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure [[deuterium fusion]] detonations with a very high fuel-[[burnup]] fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000&amp;nbsp;km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000&amp;nbsp;km/s [[delta-v]] allowing a flight-time to [[Alpha Centauri]] of 130 years.&lt;ref name="Interstellar Transport"&gt;{{cite journal

A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a [[magnetic sail]] to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Use of Mini-Mag Orion and superconducting coils for near-term interstellar transportation | author1= Lenard, Roger X. | author2= Andrews, Dana G. | journal= Acta Astronautica | date= June 2007 | volume= 61 | issue= 1–6 | url= http://www.space-nation.org/images/a/a1/Mini-Mag_Orion_and_superconducting_coils_for_near-term_interstellar_transportation_LenardAndrews.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.052 | pages=450–458|bibcode = 2007AcAau..61..450L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include [[Project Longshot]], [[Project Daedalus]], and [[Mini-Mag Orion]]. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.

In the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by [[Project Daedalus]] by use of externally triggered [[inertial confinement fusion]], in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, [[laser]]s, [[ion beam]]s, [[neutral particle beam]]s and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.&lt;ref name="The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A current impediment to the development of ''any'' nuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft is the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which includes a prohibition on the detonation of any nuclear devices (even non-weapon based) in outer space. This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].

Another issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).

==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====
[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.&lt;ref name="L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58" /&gt; These would "burn" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3–0.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases &lt;0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4–10% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.

[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973–1978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, "Discovery II",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing "2001: A Space Odyssey": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, based on the D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]]. It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300&amp;nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% [[burnup]] fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==== Antimatter rockets ====
{{Main|Antimatter rocket}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
An [[antimatter rocket]] would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make [[antimatter]] in the quantities required and store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/storing-antimatter|title=Storing antimatter - CERN|website=home.web.cern.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/06/05/alpha-quarter-hour/|title=ALPHA Stores Antimatter Atoms Over a Quarter of an Hour – and Still Counting - Berkeley Lab|date=5 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (&gt;90% that of light) at which relativistic [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;

Speculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.

Second, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.

More recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[Mössbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="AA-20120821"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter–antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002640 |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34–39 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rockets with an external energy source ====
Rockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] has proposed for an [[interstellar probe]], with energy supplied by an external laser from a base station powering an [[Ion thruster]].&lt;ref name="geoffreylandis.com"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | title= Laser-powered Interstellar Probe | author= Landis, Geoffrey A. | conference= Conference on Practical Robotic Interstellar Flight | location= NY University, New York, NY | date= 29 August 1994 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131002200923/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | archivedate= 2 October 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-rocket concepts ===
A problem with all traditional rocket propulsion methods is that the spacecraft would need to carry its fuel with it, thus making it very massive, in accordance with the [[rocket equation]]. Several concepts attempt to escape from this problem:&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bolonkin (2005). ''Non Rocket Space Launch and Flight''. Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-08-044731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interstellar ramjets ====
In 1960, [[Robert W. Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, "burn" it on the fly using a [[proton–proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.

==== Beamed propulsion ====
[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]

A [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and spacecraft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.&lt;ref name="Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187–195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of [[NASA]]'s Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=mcc_pv&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A444067493&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=Alpha Centauri: Our First Target for Interstellar Probes|last=|first=|date=|via=go.galegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light.

A [[magnetic sail]] could also decelerate at its destination without depending on carried fuel or a driving beam in the destination system, by interacting with the plasma found in the solar wind of the destination star and the interstellar medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetic Sails and Interstellar Travel |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=1990 |last=Andrews |first=Dana G. |last2=Zubrin |first2=Robert M. |volume=43 |pages=265–272 |url=http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182359/http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-12 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf |format=PDF |title=NIAC Study of the Magnetic Sail |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |last2=Martin |first2=Andrew |date=1999-08-11 |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical concepts ===

==== Faster-than-light travel ====
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's depiction of a hypothetical ''Wormhole Induction Propelled Spacecraft'', based loosely on the 1994 [[Alcubierre drive|"warp drive"]] paper of [[Miguel Alcubierre]].]]
{{Main|Faster-than-light}}

Scientists and authors have postulated a number of ways by which it might be possible to surpass the speed of light, but even the most serious-minded of these are highly speculative.&lt;ref name="crawftl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Ian A.|title=Some thoughts on the implications of faster-than-light interstellar space travel|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1995|volume=36|pages=205–218|bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..205C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debatable whether faster-than-light travel is physically possible, in part because of [[Tachyonic antitelephone|causality]] concerns: travel faster than light may, under certain conditions, permit travel backwards in time within the context of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinberg|first1=G.|title=Possibility of faster-than-light particles|journal=Physical Review|date=1967|volume=159|issue=5|pages=1089–1105|doi=10.1103/physrev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed mechanisms for [[faster-than-light]] travel within the theory of general relativity require the existence of [[exotic matter]]&lt;ref name="crawftl" /&gt; and it is not known if this could be produced in sufficient quantity.

===== Alcubierre drive =====

{{Main|Alcubierre drive}}
In physics, the [[Alcubierre drive]] is based on an argument, within the framework of [[general relativity]] and without the introduction of [[wormhole]]s, that it is possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed by a local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it.&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |year=1994 |last=Alcubierre |first=Miguel |volume=11 |issue=5 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/11/5/001 |accessdate=2015-09-01 |pages=L73–L77|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this concept would require the spaceship to incorporate a region of [[exotic matter]], or hypothetical concept of [[negative mass]].&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre" /&gt;

===== Artificial black hole =====

{{Main|Black hole starship}}
A theoretical idea for enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship by creating an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole to act as a power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.&lt;ref name="cranewestmoreland2009"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1803 "Are Black Hole Starships Possible?"], Louis Crane, Shawn Westmoreland, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.000-dark-power-grand-designs-for-interstellar-travel.html |title=Dark power: Grand designs for interstellar travel |journal=New Scientist |date=25 November 2009 |issue=2736 |last=Chown |first=Marcus}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-spaceships A Black Hole Engine That Could Power Spaceships]. Tim Barribeau, November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Wormholes =====
[[Wormhole]]s are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists postulate could connect two arbitrary points in the universe, across an [[Einstein–Rosen Bridge]]. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of [[negative mass]], which may be unphysical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ideachev.html#worm |title=Ideas Based On What We’d Like To Achieve: Worm Hole transportation |publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= John G.

== Designs and studies ==

=== Enzmann starship ===
{{Main|Enzmann starship}}
The Enzmann starship, as detailed by [[G. Harry Stine]] in the October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', was a design for a future [[starship]], based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power 12–24 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=1142 |work=Centauri Dreams |title=A Note on the Enzmann Starship |first=Paul |last=Gilster |date=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Hyperion ===

=== NASA research ===
[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] has been researching interstellar travel since its formation, translating important foreign language papers and conducting early studies on applying fusion propulsion, in the 1960s, and laser propulsion, in the 1970s, to interstellar travel.

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (terminated in FY 2003 after a 6-year, $1.2-million study, because "No breakthroughs appear imminent.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp] "Breakthrough Propulsion Physics" project at NASA Glenn Research Center, Nov 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; identified some breakthroughs that are needed for interstellar travel to be possible.&lt;ref name="NASAWarpDriveBreakthruTechs"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html] ''Warp Drive, When? Breakthrough Technologies'' January 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] states that a laser-powered interstellar sail ship could possibly be launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. "I&amp;nbsp;think that ultimately we're going to do it, it's just a question of when and who," Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it passed through the system without stopping. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years,&lt;ref name="Malik20020319"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327233721/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }} Malik, Tariq, "Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships." Science Tuesday, Space.com March 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.

=== 100 Year Starship study ===
The [[100 Year Starship]] (100YSS) is the name of the overall effort that will, over the next century, work toward achieving interstellar travel. The effort will also go by the moniker 100YSS. The 100 Year Starship study is the name of a one-year project to assess the attributes of and lay the groundwork for an organization that can carry forward the 100 Year Starship vision.

== Feasibility ==
The energy requirements make interstellar travel very difficult. It has been reported that at the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference, multiple experts opined that it was improbable that humans would ever explore beyond the Solar System.&lt;ref name="O’Neill"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=O’Neill |date=Aug 19, 2008 |work=Universe Today |title=Interstellar travel may remain in science fiction |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/08/19/bad-news-insterstellar-travel-may-remain-in-science-fiction/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, stated that at least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required to send a probe to the nearest star.&lt;ref name="O’Neill" /&gt;

Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald stated that the basic problem is that through intensive studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones.&lt;ref name="Odenwald"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |date=April 2, 2015 |work=Huffington Post Blog |title=Interstellar travel: Where should we go?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/interstellar-travel-so-where-should-we-go_b_6971584.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense of some of the proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.

Moving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences. For example, a gram of matter moving at 90% of the speed of light contains a kinetic energy corresponding to a small nuclear bomb (around 30kt TNT).

=== Interstellar missions not for human benefit ===

Explorative high-speed missions to [[Alpha Centauri]], as planned for by the [[Breakthrough Starshot|Breakthrough Starshot initiative]], are projected to be realizable within the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1710.10732|last1=Kulkarni|first1=Neeraj|title=Relativistic Spacecraft Propelled by Directed Energy|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=155|issue=4|pages=155|last2=Lubin|first2=Philip|last3=Zhang|first3=Qicheng|year=2017|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aaafd2|bibcode=2018AJ....155..155K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alternatively possible to plan for unmanned slow-cruising missions taking millennia to arrive. These probes would not be for human benefit in the sense that one can not foresee whether there would be anybody around on earth interested in then back-transmitted science data. An example would be the Genesis mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=Claudius |title=Developing ecospheres on transiently habitable planets: the genesis project |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |date=5 September 2016 |volume=361 |issue=10 |doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0|arxiv=1608.06087 |bibcode=2016Ap&amp;SS.361..324G }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to bring unicellular life, in the spirit of [[directed panspermia]], to habitable but otherwise barren planets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/genesis-missions/497258/ How to Jumpstart Life Elsewhere in Our Galaxy], The Atlantic, 08-25-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively slow cruising Genesis probes, with a typical speed of &lt;math&gt;c/300&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to about &lt;math&gt;1000\,\mbox{km/s}&lt;/math&gt;, can be decelerated using a [[magnetic sail]]. Unmanned missions not for human benefit would hence be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2153165-should-we-seed-life-through-the-cosmos-using-laser-driven-ships/ Should we seed life through the cosmos using laser-driven ships?], New Scientist, 11-13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of Earth-Like planets ==

In February 2017, NASA announced that its [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] had revealed seven Earth-size planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system.&lt;ref name="NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – the key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

{{Antisemitism}}

The "'''Jewish question'''", also referred to as the "'''Jewish problem'''", was a wide-ranging debate in 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]an society pertaining to the appropriate status and treatment of [[Jews]] in society. The debate was similar to other so-called "[[national question]]s" and dealt with the civil, legal, national and political [[Status (law)|status]] of Jews as a minority within society, particularly in Europe in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

The debate started within societies, politicians and writers in [[western Europe|western]] and [[central Europe]] influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]. The issues included the legal and economic [[disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]] (e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s and [[Jewish ghetto|segregation]]), [[Jewish assimilation]], [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish Enlightenment]].

The expression has been used by [[antisemitic]] movements from the 1880s onwards, culminating in the [[Nazi terminology|Nazi phrase]] "the [[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Question". Similarly, the expression was used by proponents for and opponents of the establishment of an autonomous [[Jewish homeland]] or a sovereign [[Jewish state]].

==History of "The Jewish question"==
{{Jews}}
{{further|History of the Jews in Europe}}
The term "Jewish question" was first used in Great Britain around 1750 when the expression "Jewish question" appeared during the [[Jew Bill of 1753]] debates in England.&lt;ref name=odk&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholar]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], the term "Jewish Question," as introduced in [[western Europe]], was a neutral expression for the negative attitude toward the apparent and persistent singularity of the Jews as a people against the background of the rising political nationalisms and new [[nation-state]]s.

The question was next discussed in France (''la question juive'') after the French Revolution in 1789. It has arrived in Germany in 1843 via Bruno Bauer's treatise ''Die Judenfrage'' ("The Jewish Question"). He argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they let go their religious consciousness as he proposed that political emancipation required a [[secular state]]. In 1898, [[Theodore Herzl]]'s treatise, ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'', advocates [[Zionism]] as a "modern solution for the Jewish question" by creating an independent Jewish state, preferably in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Herzl |first1= Theodor |authorlink1= Theodor Herzl |others= transl.

According to Otto Dov Kulka&lt;ref&gt;As of 2008 Otto Dov Kulka's works are out of print, but the following may be useful and is available on microfilm: ''Reminiscences of Otto Dov Kulka'' (Glen Rock, New Jersey: Microfilming Corp. of America, 1975), {{ISBN|0-88455-598-4}} and 9780884555988, OCLC 5326379.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hebrew University]], the term became widespread in the nineteenth century when it was used in discussions about [[Jewish emancipation]] in Germany (''Judenfrage'').&lt;ref name=odk /&gt; In the 19th century hundreds of tractates, pamphlets, newspaper articles and books were written on the subject, with many offering solutions including resettlement, deportation and assimilation of the Jewish population. Similarly, hundreds of pieces of literature were written opposing these solutions and have offered solutions such as re-integration and education. This debate however, could not decide whether the problem of the Jewish Question had more to do with the problems posed by the German Jews' opponents or vice versa: the problem posed by the existence of the German Jews to their opponents.

From around 1860 the notion took on an increasingly antisemitic tendency: Jews were described under this title as a stumbling block to the identity and cohesion of the German nation and as enemies within the Germans' own country. Antisemites such as [[Wilhelm Marr]], [[Karl Eugen Dühring]], [[Theodor Fritsch]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Paul de Lagarde]] and others declared it a racial problem unsolvable through integration, in order to make their demands for the "de-jewifying" of the press, education, culture, state and economy, plausible, along with their demands for the condemnation of inter-marriage between Jews and non-Jews. They also used this definition to oust the Jews out of their supposedly socially dominant positions.

By far the most infamous use of this expression was by the [[Nazi]]s in the early- and mid- twentieth century, culminating in the implementation of their "[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish question" during [[World War II]].&lt;!-- The following ref is used here to establish the meaning of Judenfrage, but is reused later. --&gt;&lt;ref name=ah&gt;{{Cite web

==Bruno Bauer – ''The Jewish Question''==
In his book ''[[The Jewish Question]]'', published in 1843, [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they relinquish their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any "space" for social identities such as [[religion]]. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the "[[Rights of Man]]." True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.

==Karl Marx – ''On the Jewish Question''==
[[Karl Marx]] replied to Bauer in his 1844 essay ''[[On the Jewish Question]]''. Marx contradicted Bauer's view that the nature of the Jewish religion prevented Judaism's assimilation. Instead he focused on the specific social and economic role of the Jewish group in Europe which, according to him, was lost when capitalism, the material basis for Judaism, assimilated the European societies as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm |title=On the Jewish Question |accessdate=2008-03-25 |author=Karl Marx |authorlink=Karl Marx |date=February 1844 |work=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of liberal rights. Marx argues that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a "[[secular state]]", religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and, as an example refers to the pervasiveness of religion in the [[United States]], which, unlike Prussia, had no [[state religion]]. In Marx's analysis, the "secular state" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually requires it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in abstraction from them.&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;Marx 1844:{{Block quote|[T]he political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it declares that birth, social rank, education, occupation, are non-political distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty, when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to act in their way – i.e., as private property, as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their special nature. Far from abolishing these real distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On this note Marx moves beyond the question of religious freedom to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of "political emancipation." Marx concludes that while individuals can be 'spiritually' and 'politically' free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by economic inequality, an assumption that would later form the basis of his critiques of [[capitalism]].

Between 1880 and 1920, millions of other Jews sought their own solution for the [[pogroms]] of eastern Europe by emigration to other places, such as the [[United States]] and western Europe.

==The Final Solution==
In [[Nazi Germany]], the term ''Jewish Question'' (in {{lang-de|Judenfrage}}) referred to the sense that the existence of Jews in Germany posed a problem for the state. In 1933 two Nazi theorists, [[Johann von Leers]] and [[Achim Gercke]], both proposed that the Jewish Question could be solved by [[Madagascar plan|resettling Jews in Madagascar]] or elsewhere in Africa or South America. Both intellectuals discussed the pros and cons of supporting the German Zionists as well, but von Leers asserted that establishing a Jewish homeland in British Palestine would create humanitarian and political problems for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Propaganda ===
[[Nazi propaganda]] was produced to manipulate the public, most notably based on writings from people such as [[Eugen Fischer]], [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Erwin Baur]] in ''Foundations of Human Heredity Teaching and Racial Hygiene''. The work {{lang|de|Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens}} (''Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living'') by [[Karl Binding]] and [[Alfred Hoche]] and the pseudo-scholarship created by [[Gerhard Kittel]] also played a role. In occupied France, the collaborationist regime established its own [[Institut d'étude des questions juives|Institute for studying the Jewish Questions]].

== Contemporary use ==
A dominant anti-Semitic conspiracy theory is that Jewish people have undue influence over the media, banking and politics. Based on this conspiracy theory certain groups and activists discuss the "Jewish Question" and propose to "address" it. They often refer to it as the JQ.&lt;ref&gt;"JQ stands for the 'Jewish Question,' an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jewish people have undue influence over the media, banking and politics that must somehow be addressed" (Christopher Mathias, Jenna Amatulli, Rebecca Klein, 2018, The HuffPost 03/03/2018, https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-public-school-teacher-white-nationalist-podcast_us_5a99ae32e4b089ec353a1fba)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[white nationalism|white nationalists]], [[alt-right]]ers, and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] have used the initialism '''JQ''' to refer to the Jewish question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kestenbaum|first1=Sam|title=White Nationalists Create New Shorthand for the 'Jewish Question'|url=http://forward.com/news/356773/among-white-nationalists-catchy-new-shorthand-for-the-jewish-question/|website=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Katharine "Kay" Bullitt was born in 1925 in Boston and was raised in Arlington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/bullitt.htm|title=Kay Bullitt|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had a long career as dean of women at Colorado College before marrying in her late 30's and having three daughters. Kay was the middle child between Marion ("Barney") and Margaret ("Margie").&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parentmap.com/article/2014-superheroes-for-washington-families?page=2|title=2014 Superheroes for Washington Families - ParentMap|website=www.parentmap.com|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt attended the [[Shady Hill School]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="I thought if I'd stayed in Cambridge ...

Bullitt's interest in civic projects began early and focused on education and peace. She attended [[Radcliffe College]] which both her mother and sister had attended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Kay Bullitt: Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project (Segment 1)|date=2016-11-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bXmKE0b0Yo&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=1|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, Bullitt worked in a community center in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] which primarily serviced African-American children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's sister had written her thesis on the difference between African-American students from [[Barbados]] and the South.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's own senior thesis was on the role of Federal Government in Education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  During World War II, Bullitt spent a summer at the Hampton Institute in Virginia as part of an interracial farm project. Bullitt was also active with the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the end of World War II, Bullitt worked in Germany for two summers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Bullitt describes her role in several efforts to desegregate Seattle public schools in the 1960s|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WdYGdet0uU&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Bullitt taught at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge which she had attended as a child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She taught the fourth grade there for five years. Inspired by the ability that she had observed in the young African-Americans she had worked with, Bullitt decided to take a trip across the country to observe what education and work experience was like for children. In her wanderings, Bullitt came to Seattle and decided to stay in 1951.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Desegregation in Seattle ==
In the 1960s, Bullitt hosted an integrated day camp at her home on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="It showed all during that time when there was such difficulty in the schools..."|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DK8NBm6E54&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Bullitt said that the camp was "self-serving," as she had three older (step-)children and three under six, all with different interests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She recruited teachers and counselors from the [[League of Women Voters]] and The Little School in Seattle. From after the World's Fair in 1962 through the early seventies, the camp was integrated and grew to host 100 children and 35 teenagers running it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Also during this time in the 1960s, Bullitt began work in Seattle to integrate schools through voluntary transfer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Her children were going to [[Lowell Elementary School (Seattle, Washington)|Lowell Elementary School]] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and they began a partnership with Madrona School, a primarily African-American school in Seattle, and had about 50 children going between the schools. Bullitt also started the Voluntary Instruction Program (VIP) which brought in volunteers to teach subjects in small groups, starting with Madrona, but then went to other Central District schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The program disappeared when they were unable to convince the district to fund a directorship position.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Bullitt briefly headed a program called School Affiliation Service which was based on her visits to Germany after World War II. Bullitt wanted to have people come from the South to see how the integration in Seattle was working.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This program eventually evolved into  the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education (CQIE) in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/school-integration-memories-hit-home/|title=School-Integration memories hit home|date=2012-06-13|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=In the early 1970s Bullitt started a volunteer organization to work for school desegregation|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hup_BX8_kus&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wawona and Other Civic Projects ==
In 1963 after reading an article in the local paper about the ''[[Wawona (schooner)|Wawona]]'', an historic schooner, Bullitt began efforts to save and restore the ship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/historic-schooner-wawona-heads-for-demise/|title=Historic schooner Wawona heads for demise|date=2009-03-05|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 165 foot-long ship was launched in 1897 and was initially used to haul lumber up and down the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The schooner also served as a fishing schooner in the Bering Sea and was a military barge during Word War II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After 46 years and numerous fundraising and volunteer efforts, it was determined it would be too costly to restore and they were unable to secure permanent moorage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ship, which was profiled in ''Shipbuilders, Sea Captains and Fishermen'' by Joe Follansbee, was dismantled in 2009, with portions being saved for the Seattle Museum of History &amp; Industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bullitt was instrumental in founding several Civic and community projects in Seattle. She helped found [[Bumbershoot]], an annual international music and arts festival in Seattle, which takes place every Labor Day Weekend at the [[Seattle Center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/kay-bullitt/|title=Kay Bullitt|date=2005-08-26|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventies, Bullitt helped found a savings and loan bank for women, called Sound Savings &amp; Loan. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="We were able to help a lot of women get credit and get loans, and the banks started hiring women"|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4l3Ita5MNA&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt helped restore Pioneer Square.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Tort law}}

'''Malicious prosecution''' is a [[common law]] intentional [[tort]], while like the tort of [[abuse of process]],  its elements include (1) intentionally (and [[Malice (law)|maliciously]]) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action ([[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]]) that is (2) brought without [[probable cause]] and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution.  In some jurisdictions, the term "malicious prosecution" denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term "malicious use of process" denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.

Criminal prosecuting attorneys and judges are protected from tort liability for malicious prosecution by doctrines of prosecutorial immunity and judicial immunity. Moreover, the mere filing of a complaint cannot constitute an abuse of process. The parties who have abused or misused the process have gone beyond merely filing a lawsuit. The taking of an appeal, even a frivolous one, is not enough to constitute an abuse of process. The mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit, even for an improper purpose, is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.

Declining to expand the tort of malicious prosecution, a unanimous California Supreme Court in the case of ''Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker'', 47 Cal. 3d 863, 873 (1989) observed: "While the filing of [[frivolous lawsuit]]s is certainly improper and cannot in any way be condoned, in our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself, rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded."&lt;ref&gt;Per the case of ''Lossing v. Superior Court'' (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 635, 638-640[255 Cal. Rptr. 18]; see also Tellefsen v. Key System Transit Lines, supra, 198 Cal.App.2d at p. 615 [Court of Appeal has remedies for frivolous appeals]; Green v. Uccelli (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1112, 1122-1123 [255 Cal.Rptr. 315]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The tort originates in the (now defunct) legal maxim that "the King pays no costs"; that is, [[The Crown]] could not be forced to pay the legal costs of a person it prosecuted, even if that person was found innocent. As ''[[The London Magazine]]'' stated in 1766: "if a groundless and vexatious prosecution be commenced in the King's name, his ministers who commenced, or advised commencing that prosecution, ought at least to be obliged to pay the costs which an innocent subject has thereby been put to".

==U.S. use of English Rule==
Sixteen [[U.S. state]]s require another element of malicious prosecution.{{fact|date=October 2018}}  This element, commonly called the English Rule, states that, in addition to fulfilling all other malicious prosecution elements, one must also prove injury other than the normal downside of being sued.  This rule is limited to equitable damages, such as loss of profit, and excludes damages that cannot be measured by the law (''e.g.'', damage to reputation).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Canadian law==
[[Law of Canada|Canadian jurisprudence]] has changed in that if any individual takes legal action that meet the above criteria, they may be sued. Legal action may be taken against the [[police]] or the [[Crown Attorney]] or the [[Attorney General#Canada|Attorney General]], as they are no longer exempt from suit.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The tort of malicious prosecution was recently reviewed in 2009 by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Miazga v. Kvello Estate]]'', and specifically how it applied to public prosecutors in Canada. The court outlined the four required elements for the tort of malicious prosecution: (i) The prosecution must be initiated by the defendant; (ii) The prosecution must be terminated in the plaintiff's favour. (iii) There was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds to commence or continue the prosecution; and (iv) The defendant was motivated to commence or continue to the prosecution due to malice.

In 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the contents of plea bargaining negotiations held in the context of criminal cases could be admitted as evidence in the context of a civil suit for malicious prosecution, despite the general evidentiary rule prohibiting adducing settlement discussions into proof at trial. More specifically, the Court held that introducing into evidence the contents of such negotiations was possible when it tended to demonstrate that the prosecution initiated or maintained criminal charges on the basis of improper motives.&lt;ref&gt;Singh c. Montreal (City of), 2014 QCCA 307 (CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/g36bd&gt; retrieved on 2014-11-07. Leave to Supreme Court of Canada refused on November 6th 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Notably, the tort of malicious prosecution only protects the right of defendants to be free of frivolous lawsuits brought by malicious plaintiffs.  For a variety of reasons grounded in [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], courts have consistently refused to authorize the converse — a tort of malicious defense which would protect the right of plaintiffs to be free of frivolous defenses raised by defendants.&lt;ref&gt;''Bertero v. National General Corp.'', 13 Cal. 3d 43, 52, 529 P.2d 608, 118 Cal. Rptr. 184 (1974) (citing ''Ritter v. Ritter'', 381 Ill. 549, 46 N.E. 2d 41 (1943)).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44966">In the [[philosophy of language]], the nature of '''meaning''', its [[definition]], elements, and types, was discussed by [[philosophers]] [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to them "meaning is a relationship between two sorts of things: ''signs'' and the kinds of things they ''mean'' (intend, express or signify)". One term in the relationship of meaning necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. In other words: "a sign is defined as an [[entity]] that indicates another entity to some agent for some purpose". As Augustine states, a sign is "something that shows itself to the senses and something other than itself to the mind" (''Signum est quod se ipsum sensui et praeter se aliquid animo ostendit''; ''De dial.'', 1975, 86).

The types of meanings vary according to the types of the thing that is being represented. Namely:
# There are the things in the world, which might have meaning;
# There are things in the world that are also signs of other things in the world, and so, are always meaningful (i.e., natural signs of the physical world and ideas within the mind);
# There are things that are always necessarily meaningful, such as words, and other nonverbal symbols.

All subsequent inquiries emphasize some particular perspectives within the general AAA framework.

The major contemporary positions of meaning come under the following partial definitions of meaning:
*''Psychological theories'', exhausted by notions of [[thought]], [[intention]], or [[understanding]];
*''Logical theories'', involving notions such as [[intension]], cognitive content, or [[sense]], along with [[Extension (semantics)|extension]], reference, or denotation;
*Message, content, [[information]], or [[communication]];
*[[Truth]] conditions;
*Usage, and the instructions for usage; and
*[[Measurement]], computation, or operation.

==Truth and meaning==
{{main|Truth}}
The evaluation of meaning according to each one of the five major substantive theories of meaning and truth is presented below. The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered to truthfully denote meaning, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories listed below. Each theory of meaning as evaluated by these respective theories of truth are each further researched by the individual scholars supporting each one of the respective theories of truth and meaning.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, p572-573 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | chapter = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–330 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both hybrid theories of meaning and alternative theories of meaning and truth have also been researched, and are subject to further assessment according to their respective and relative merits.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories of meaning===

====Correspondence theory====
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements of meaning correspond to the actual state of affairs and that associated meanings must be in agreement with these beliefs and statements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p223 (Macmillan, 1969) Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223-224 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." An example of correspondence theory is the statement by the Thirteenth Century philosopher/theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: ''Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus'' ("Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect"), a statement which Aquinas attributed to the Ninth Century [[neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p224, Macmillan, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/index.html Summa], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1.htm I], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Q.16], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article2 A.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality"&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], (citing De Veritate Q.1, A.1&amp;3; cf. Summa Theologiae Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth and meaning are a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225-226, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226-227, "Ramsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228-229, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, p. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969). See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coherence theory====
For coherence theories in general, the assessment of meaning and truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity of meaning and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130-131 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–133, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p130&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternatives may be found among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that meaning and truth are constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture along with their meaning were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom{{spaced ndash}}''verum ipsum factum''{{spaced ndash}}"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like  many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that meaning and truth are whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is  the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. PART III, pp 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' and meaning were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that meaning and truth are verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–720 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of meaning and truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James|William James's]] version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but  more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed meanings and truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth and its meaning always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, NEW YORK: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, LCCCN 66-23155&lt;/ref&gt; James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe meaning and truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated theories and commentaries===
Some have asserted that meaning is nothing substantially more or less than the [[truth condition]]s they involve. For such theories, an emphasis is placed upon [[reference]] to actual things in the world to account for meaning, with the caveat that reference more or less explains the greater part (or all) of meaning itself.

====Logic and language====
The [[logical positivists]] argued that the meaning of a statement arose from [[The verifiability theory of meaning|how it is verified]].

====Gottlob Frege====
In his paper  ''Über Sinn und Bedeutung'' (now usually translated as ''On Sense and Reference''), [[Gottlob Frege]] argued that proper names present at least two problems in explaining meaning.

#Suppose the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to. ''Sam'', then, means a person in the world who is named Sam.  But if the object referred to by the name did not exist—i.e., ''Pegasus''—then, according to that theory, it would be meaningless.
#Suppose  two different names refer to the same object.  ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorus'' were the names given to what were considered distinct celestial bodies. It was later shown that they were the same thing (the planet Venus).  If the words meant the same thing, then substituting one for the other in a sentence would not result in a sentence that differs in meaning from the original.  But in that case, "Hesperus is Phosphorus" would mean the same thing as "Hesperus is Hesperus".  This is clearly absurd, since we learn something new and unobvious by the former statement, but not by the latter.

Frege can be interpreted as arguing that it was therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to.  Instead, the meaning must be something else&amp;mdash;the "sense" of the word.  Two names for the same person, then, can have different senses (or meanings): one referent might be picked out by more than one sense. This sort of theory is called a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege argued that, ultimately, the same bifurcation of meaning must apply to most or all linguistic categories, such as to quantificational expressions like "All boats float".  It is now accepted by many philosophers {{who|date=May 2013}} as applying to all expressions ''but'' proper names .{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

====Bertrand Russell====
Logical analysis was further advanced by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]  in their groundbreaking ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which attempted to produce a formal language with which the truth of all mathematical statements could be demonstrated from first principles.

Russell differed from Frege greatly on many points, however.  He rejected Frege's sense-reference distinction. He also disagreed that language was of fundamental significance to philosophy, and saw the project of developing formal logic as a way of eliminating all of the confusions caused by ordinary language, and hence at creating a perfectly transparent medium in which to conduct traditional philosophical argument. He hoped, ultimately, to extend the proofs of the ''Principia'' to all possible true statements, a scheme he called [[logical atomism]]. For a while it appeared that his pupil [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] had succeeded in this plan with his "[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]".

Russell's work, and that of his colleague [[G. E. Moore]], developed in response to what they perceived as the nonsense dominating British philosophy departments at the turn of the 20th century, which was a kind of [[Idealism|British Idealism]] most of which was derived (albeit very distantly) from the work of [[Hegel]].  In response Moore developed an approach ("Common Sense Philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Moore, ''[http://www.ditext.com/moore/common-sense.html A Defence of Common Sense]'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;) which sought to examine philosophical difficulties by a close analysis of the language used in order to determine its meaning. In this way Moore sought to expunge philosophical absurdities such as "time is unreal".  Moore's work would have significant, if oblique, influence (largely mediated by [[Wittgenstein]]) on [[Ordinary language philosophy]].

====Other truth theories====
The Vienna Circle, a famous group of [[logical positivists]] from the early 20th century (closely allied with Russell and Frege), adopted the [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist theory of meaning]]. The verificationist theory of meaning (in at least one of its forms) states that to say that an expression is meaningful is to say that there are some conditions of experience that could exist to show that the expression is true. As noted, Frege and Russell were two proponents of this way of thinking.

A [[semantic theory of truth]] was produced by [[Alfred Tarski]] for [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. According to Tarski's account, meaning consists of a recursive set of rules that end up yielding an infinite set of sentences, "'p' is true if and only if p", covering the whole language. His innovation produced the notion of [[propositional function]]s discussed on the section on [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]] (which he called "sentential functions"), and a [[model-theoretic]] approach to semantics (as opposed to a [[proof-theoretic]] one). Finally, some links were forged to the [[correspondence theory of truth]] (Tarski, 1944).

Perhaps the most influential current approach in the contemporary theory of meaning is that sketched by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his introduction to the collection of essays ''Truth and Meaning'' in 1967.  There he argued for the following two theses:
* Any learnable language must be statable in a finite form, even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions—as we may assume that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way then it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language which could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms.
* Giving the meaning of a sentence, he further argued, was equivalent to stating its ''truth conditions''.  He proposed that it must be possible to account for language as a set of distinct grammatical features together with a lexicon, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences built up from these.

The result is a theory of meaning that rather resembles, by no accident, Tarski's account.

Davidson's account, though brief, constitutes the first systematic presentation of [[truth-conditional semantics]]. He proposed simply translating natural languages into [[first-order predicate calculus]] in order to reduce meaning to a function of truth.

====Saul Kripke====
[[Saul Kripke]] examined the relation between sense and reference in dealing with possible and actual situations. He showed that one consequence of his interpretation of certain systems of [[modal logic]] was that the reference of a proper name is ''necessarily'' linked to its [[referent]], but that the sense is not. So for instance "Hesperus" necessarily refers to Hesperus, even in those imaginary cases and worlds in which perhaps Hesperus is not the  evening star. That is, Hesperus is necessarily Hesperus, but only contingently the morning star.

This results in the curious situation that part of the meaning of a name&amp;nbsp;— that it refers to some particular thing&amp;nbsp;— is a necessary fact about that name, but another part&amp;nbsp;— that it is used in some particular way or situation&amp;nbsp;— is not.

Kripke also drew the distinction between speaker's meaning and semantic meaning, elaborating on the work of ordinary language philosophers [[Paul Grice]] and [[Keith Donnellan]]. The speaker's meaning is what the speaker intends to refer to by saying something; the semantic meaning is what the words uttered by the speaker mean according to the language.

In some cases, people do not say what they mean; in other cases, they say something that is in error. In both these cases, the speaker's meaning and the semantic meaning seem to be different. Sometimes words do not actually express what the speaker wants them to express; so words will mean one thing, and what people intend to convey by them might mean another. The meaning of the expression, in such cases, is ambiguous.

====Critiques of truth-theories of meaning====
[[W.V. Quine]] attacked both verificationism and the very notion of meaning in his famous essay, "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]". In it, he suggested that meaning was nothing more than a vague and dispensable notion. Instead, he asserted, what was more interesting to study was the synonymy between signs. He also pointed out that verificationism was tied to the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] statements, and asserted that such a divide was defended ambiguously. He also suggested that the unit of analysis for any potential investigation into the world (and, perhaps, meaning) would be the entire body of statements taken as a collective, not just individual statements on their own.

Other criticisms can be raised on the basis of the limitations that truth-conditional theorists themselves admit to. Tarski, for instance, recognized that truth-conditional theories of meaning only make sense of statements, but fail to explain the meanings of the lexical parts that make up statements. Rather, the meaning of the parts of statements is presupposed by an understanding of the truth-conditions of a whole statement, and explained in terms of what he called "satisfaction conditions".

Still another objection (noted by Frege and others) was that some kinds of statements don't seem to have any truth-conditions at all. For instance, "Hello!" has no truth-conditions, because it doesn't even attempt to tell the listener anything about the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] in the world. In other words, different propositions have different [[grammatical moods]].

[[Deflationary theory of truth|Deflationist]] accounts of truth, sometimes called 'irrealist' accounts, are the staunchest source of criticism of truth-conditional theories of meaning. According to them, "truth" is a word with no serious meaning or function in discourse. For instance, for the deflationist, the sentences "It's true that Tiny Tim is trouble" and "Tiny Tim is trouble" are equivalent. In consequence, for the deflationist, any appeal to truth as an account of meaning has little explanatory power.

The sort of truth-theories presented here can also be attacked for their [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] both in practice and principle. The principle of formalism is challenged by the [[informalism|informalists]], who suggest that language is largely a construction of the speaker, and so, not compatible with formalization. The practice of formalism is challenged by those who observe that formal languages (such as present-day quantificational logic) fail to capture the expressive power of natural languages (as is arguably demonstrated in the awkward character of the quantificational explanation of definite description statements, as laid out by Bertrand Russell).

Finally, over the past century, forms of logic have been developed that are not dependent exclusively on the notions of truth and falsity. Some of these types of logic have been called [[modal logic]]s. They explain how certain logical connectives such as "if-then" work in terms of necessity and [[Logical possibility|possibility]]. Indeed, modal logic was the basis of one of the most popular and rigorous formulations in modern semantics called the [[Montague grammar]]. The successes of such systems naturally give rise to the argument that these systems have captured the natural meaning of connectives like if-then far better than an ordinary, truth-functional logic ever could.

==Usage and meaning==

Throughout the 20th century, English philosophy focused closely on analysis of language. This style of [[analytic philosophy]] became very influential and led to the development of a wide range of philosophical tools.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein===

The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was originally an artificial language philosopher, following the influence of Russell and Frege. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' he had supported the idea of an ideal language built up from atomic statements using logical connectives. However, as he matured, he came to appreciate more and more the phenomenon of natural language. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', published after his death, signalled a sharp departure from his earlier work with its focus upon ordinary language use. His approach is often summarised by the aphorism "the meaning of a word is its use in a language". However, following in Frege's footsteps, in the ''Tractatus'', Wittgenstein declares: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |year=1999 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work would come to inspire future generations and spur forward a whole new discipline, which explained meaning in a new way. Meaning in a natural language was seen as primarily a question of how the speaker uses words within the language to express intention.

This close examination of [[natural language]] proved to be a powerful philosophical technique. Practitioners who were influenced by Wittgenstein's approach have included an entire tradition of thinkers, featuring [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Paul Grice]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[R. S. Peters]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]].

===J. L. Austin===

At around the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was re-thinking his approach to language, reflections on the complexity of language led to a more expansive approach to meaning. Following the lead of [[George Edward Moore]], [[J. L. Austin]] examined the use of words in great detail. He argued against fixating on the meaning of words. He showed that dictionary definitions are of limited philosophical use, since there is no simple "appendage" to a word that can be called its meaning. Instead, he showed how to focus on the way in which words are used in order to do things. He analysed the structure of utterances into three distinct parts: [[Figure of speech|locutions]], [[illocutionary act|illocutions]] and [[perlocutionary act|perlocutions]]. His pupil [[John Searle]] developed the idea under the label "[[speech act]]s". Their work greatly influenced [[pragmatics]].

===Peter Strawson===

Past philosophers had understood reference to be tied to words themselves. However, Sir [[Peter Strawson]] disagreed in his seminal essay, "On Referring", where he argued that there is nothing true about statements on their own; rather, only the uses of statements could be considered to be true or false.

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of the ordinary use perspective is its insistence upon the distinctions between meaning and use. ''"Meanings"'', for ordinary language philosophers, are the ''instructions'' for usage of words&amp;nbsp;— the common and conventional definitions of words. ''Usage'', on the other hand, is the actual meanings that individual speakers have&amp;nbsp;— the things that an individual speaker in a particular context wants to refer to. The word "dog" is an example of a meaning, but pointing at a nearby dog and shouting "This dog smells foul!" is an example of usage. From this distinction between usage and meaning arose the divide between the fields of [[Pragmatics]] and [[Semantics]].

Yet another distinction is of some utility in discussing language: "mentioning". ''Mention'' is when an expression refers to itself as a linguistic item, usually surrounded by quotation marks. For instance, in the expression "'Opopanax' is hard to spell", what is referred to is the word itself ("opopanax") and not what it means (an obscure gum resin). Frege had referred to instances of mentioning as "opaque contexts".

In his essay, "Reference and Definite Descriptions", [[Keith Donnellan]] sought to improve upon Strawson's distinction. He pointed out that there are two uses of definite descriptions: ''[[attributive use|attributive]]'' and ''[[referential use|referential]]''. Attributive uses provide a description of whoever is being referred to, while referential uses point out the actual referent. Attributive uses are like mediated references, while referential uses are more directly referential.

===Paul Grice===

The philosopher [[Paul Grice]], working within the ordinary language tradition, understood "meaning"&amp;nbsp;— in his 1957 article&amp;nbsp;— to have two kinds: ''natural'' and ''non-natural''. ''Natural meaning'' had to do with cause and effect, for example with the expression "these spots mean measles". ''Non-natural'' meaning, on the other hand, had to do with the intentions of the speaker in communicating something to the listener.

In his essay, ''Logic and Conversation'', Grice went on to explain and defend an explanation of how conversations work. His guiding maxim was called the ''cooperative principle'', which claimed that the speaker and the listener will have mutual expectations of the kind of information that will be shared. The principle is broken down into four maxims: ''Quality'' (which demands truthfulness and honesty), ''Quantity'' (demand for just enough information as is required), ''Relation'' (relevance of things brought up), and ''Manner'' (lucidity).  This principle, if and when followed, lets the speaker and listener figure out the meaning of certain implications by way of inference.

The works of Grice led to an avalanche of research and interest in the field, both supportive and critical. One spinoff was called [[Relevance theory]], developed by [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]] during the mid-1980s, whose goal was to make the notion of ''relevance'' more clear. Similarly, in his work, "[[Universal pragmatics]]", Jürgen Habermas began a program that sought to improve upon the work of the ordinary language tradition. In it, he laid out the goal of a valid conversation as a pursuit of mutual understanding.

===Inferential role semantics===

{{main|Inferential role semantics}}

[[Michael Dummett]] argued against the kind of [[truth-conditional semantics]] presented by Davidson. Instead, he argued that basing semantics on ''assertion conditions'' avoids a number of difficulties with truth-conditional semantics, such as the transcendental nature of certain kinds of truth condition.  He leverages work done in [[proof-theoretic semantics]] to provide a kind of inferential role semantics, where:
* The meaning of sentences and grammatical constructs is given by their assertion conditions; and
* Such a semantics is only guaranteed to be coherent if the inferences associated with the parts of language are in [[logical harmony]].
A semantics based upon assertion conditions is called a [[The verifiability theory of meaning|verificationist]] semantics: cf. the verificationism of the Vienna Circle.

This work is closely related, though not identical, to one-factor theories of [[conceptual role semantics]].

===Critiques of use theories of meaning===

Sometimes between the 1950-1990s, cognitive scientist [[Jerry Fodor]] said that use theories (of the Wittgensteinian kind) seem to assume that language is solely a public phenomenon, that there is no such thing as a "private language". Fodor thinks it is necessary to create or describe the ''[[language of thought]]'', which would seemingly require the existence of a "private language".

In the 1960s, [[David Kellogg Lewis]] described meaning as use, a feature of a social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]&lt;!-- (see also [[convention (philosophy)]])--&gt; and conventions as regularities of a specific sort. Lewis' work was an application of [[game theory]] in philosophical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Rescorla, Michael, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/#Lew "Convention"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2011 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Conventions, he argued, are a species of [[Coordination game|coordination]] [[Nash equilibrium|equilibria]].

==Idea theory of meaning&lt;!--'Idea theory of meaning' and 'Ideational theory of meaning' redirect here--&gt;==

The '''idea theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''ideational theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are [[mental representation]]s provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "ideas" is used to refer to either mental representations, or to mental activity in general. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of mind than the latter. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of meaning than the latter.

Each idea is understood to be necessarily ''about'' something external and/or internal, real or imaginary. For example, in contrast to the abstract meaning of the [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] "dog", the [[referent]] "this dog" may mean a particular real life chihuahua. In both cases, the word is about something, but in the former it is about the class of dogs as generally understood, while in the latter it is about a very real and particular dog in the real world.

===Stronger idea theories===
[[John Locke]], considered all ideas to be both imaginable objects of sensation and the very ''un''imaginable objects of reflection. Locke said in his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', that words are used both as signs for ideas—but also to signify the lack of certain ideas. [[David Hume]] held that thoughts were kinds of imaginable entities. (See Hume's ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', section 2). Hume argued that any words that could not call upon any past experience were without meaning.

Nonetheless, [[George Berkeley]] and  [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] held, in contrast to Locke and Hume, that ideas alone are unable to account for the different variations within a general meaning. For example, any hypothetical image of the meaning of "dog" has to include such varied images as a chihuahua, a pug, and a Black Lab; and this seems impossible to imagine, all of those particular breeds looking very different from one another. Another way to see this point is to question why it is that, if we have an image of a specific type of dog (say of a chihuahua), it should be entitled to represent the entire concept.

Another criticism is that some meaningful words, known as non-lexical items, don't have any meaningfully associated image. For example, the word "the" has a meaning, but one would be hard-pressed to find a mental representation that fits it. Still another objection lies in the observation that certain linguistic items name something in the real world, and are meaningful, yet which we have no mental representations to deal with. For instance, it is not known what Newton's father looked like, yet the phrase ''"Newton's father"'' still has meaning.

Another problem is that of composition&amp;nbsp;— that it is difficult to explain how words and phrases combine into sentences if only ideas were involved in meaning.

===Weaker idea theories===
[[File:Prototype membership.gif|thumb|Memberships of a graded class]]

[[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[George Lakoff]] advanced the theory of [[prototype (linguistics)|prototypes]], which suggests that many lexical categories, at least on the face of things, have "radial structures". That is to say, there are some ideal member(s) in the category that seem to represent the category better than other members. For example, the category of "birds" may feature the ''robin'' as the prototype, or the ideal kind of bird. With experience, subjects might come to evaluate membership in the category of "bird" by comparing candidate members to the prototype and evaluating for similarities. So, for example, a penguin or an ostrich would sit at the fringe of the meaning of "bird", because a penguin is unlike a robin.

Intimately related to these researches is the notion of a ''psychologically basic level'', which is both the first level named and understood by children, and "the highest level at which a single mental image can reflect the entire category". (Lakoff 1987:46) The "basic level" of cognition is understood by Lakoff as crucially drawing upon "image-schemas" along with various other cognitive processes.

The philosophers ([[Ned Block]], [[Gilbert Harman]], H. Field) and the cognitive scientists (G. Miller and P. Johnson-Laird) say  that the meaning of a term can be found by investigating its role in relation to other concepts and mental states. They endorse a view called "[[conceptual role semantics]]". Those proponents of this view who understand meanings to be exhausted by the content of mental states can be said to endorse "one-factor" accounts of conceptual role semantics. and thus  fit within the tradition of idea theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">In [[mathematics]], there are many senses in which a sequence or a series is said to be convergent.  This article describes various modes (senses or species) of convergence in the settings where they are defined.  For a list of '''modes of convergence''', see [[Modes of convergence (annotated index)]]

Note that each of the following objects is a special case of the types preceding it: [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[topological spaces]], [[uniform spaces]], [[topological abelian group|TAGs]] (topological abelian groups), [[Normed vector space|normed spaces]], [[Euclidean spaces]], and the real/complex numbers. Also, note that any [[metric space]] is a uniform space.

==Elements of a topological space==
Convergence can be defined in terms of [[Limit of a sequence|sequences]] in [[first-countable space]]s. [[Net (mathematics)|Net]]s are a generalization of sequences that is useful in spaces which are not first countable. [[Filter (mathematics)|Filter]]s further generalize the concept of convergence.

In metric spaces, one can define [[Cauchy sequence]]s. Cauchy nets and filters are generalizations to [[uniform space]]s. Even more generally, [[Cauchy space]]s are spaces in which Cauchy filters may be defined. Convergence implies "Cauchy-convergence", and Cauchy-convergence, together with the existence of a convergent subsequence implies convergence. The concept of [[complete metric space|completeness]] of metric spaces, and its generalizations is defined in terms of Cauchy sequences.

==Series of elements in a topological abelian group==
In a [[topological abelian group]], convergence of a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is defined as convergence of the sequence of partial sums. An important concept when considering series is [[unconditional convergence]], which guarantees that the limit of the series is invariant under permutations of the summands.

In a normed vector space, one can define [[absolute convergence]] as convergence of the series of norms (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma|b_k|&lt;/math&gt;). Absolute convergence implies Cauchy convergence of the sequence of partial sums (by the triangle inequality), which in turn implies absolute-convergence of some grouping (not reordering). The sequence of partial sums obtained by grouping is a subsequence of the partial sums of the original series. The norm convergence of absolutely convergent series is an equivalent condition for a normed linear space to be [[Banach space|Banach]] (i.e.: complete).

Absolute convergence and convergence together imply unconditional convergence, but unconditional convergence does not imply absolute convergence in general, even if the space is Banach, although the implication holds in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Convergence of sequence of functions on a topological space==
The most basic type of convergence for a sequence of functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the functions) is [[pointwise convergence]]. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, [[uniform convergence]], and [[uniformly Cauchy sequence|uniform Cauchy convergence]] of the sequence.

Pointwise convergence implies pointwise Cauchy-convergence, and the converse holds if the space in which the functions take their values is complete. Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy convergence. Uniform Cauchy convergence and pointwise convergence of a subsequence imply uniform convergence of the sequence, and if the codomain is complete, then uniform Cauchy convergence implies uniform convergence.

If the domain of the functions is a topological space, [[local uniform convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on a neighborhood of each point) and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on all [[compact subset]]s) may be defined. Note that "compact convergence" is always short for "compact uniform convergence," since "compact pointwise convergence" would mean the same thing as "pointwise convergence" (points are always compact).

Uniform convergence implies both local uniform convergence and compact convergence, since both are local notions while uniform convergence is global. If ''X'' is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense: every point has compact neighborhood), then local uniform convergence is equivalent to compact (uniform) convergence.  Roughly speaking, this is because "local" and "compact" connote the same thing.

==Series of functions on a topological abelian group==
Pointwise and uniform convergence of series of functions are defined in terms of convergence of the sequence of partial sums.

For functions taking values in a [[normed linear space]], absolute convergence refers to convergence of the series of positive, real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt; . "Pointwise absolute convergence" is then simply pointwise convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;.
 
[[Normal convergence]]&lt;sup&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/N/n067430.htm]&lt;/sup&gt; is convergence of the series of non-negative real numbers obtained by taking the [[uniform norm|uniform (i.e. "sup") norm]] of each function in the series (uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;). In [[Banach space]]s, pointwise absolute convergence implies pointwise convergence, and normal convergence implies uniform convergence.

For functions defined on a topological space, one can define (as above) [[local uniform convergence]] and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] in terms of the partial sums of the series. If, in addition, the functions take values in a normed linear space, then [[Normal convergence#Local normal convergence|local normal convergence]] (local, uniform, absolute convergence) and [[Normal convergence#Compact normal convergence|compact normal convergence]] (absolute convergence on [[compact set]]s) can be defined.

Normal convergence implies both local normal convergence and compact normal convergence. And if the domain is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense), then local normal convergence implies compact normal convergence.

==Functions defined on a measure space==
{{Main|Convergence of random variables}}
If one considers sequences of [[measurable function]]s, then several modes of convergence that depend on measure-theoretic, rather than solely topological properties, arise. This includes pointwise convergence almost-everywhere, convergence in ''p''-mean and convergence in measure. These are of particular interest in [[probability theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

== Theory in the 21st century ==
[[Image:The Couple 1.JPG|thumb|alt=The Impossibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple.]][[Image:The Couple 2.JPG|thumb|alt=The Possibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 1.]][[Image:The Couple 3.JPG|thumb|alt=A Never-ending Story|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 2.]][[Image:The Couple 4.JPG|thumb|alt=Inside-out and Upside-down|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 3.]][[Image:The Couple 5.JPG|thumb|alt=No Way to Return|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 4.]]

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Analytic Business Theory]] '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' is an opinion generation [[algorithm]] for a given prototype or design idea. 
The algorithm expands on traditional [[Monte Carlo Aggregation]] which operates by placing candidates together and selecting a subset at [[random]].
Each member of this subset is then asked for an opinion usually by filling out a [[form (document)|form]].
A resultant [[opinion scalar]] can be generated by application of the [[Softmax function]] over the generated [[form set]].
However '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' goes a step further and attempts to construct the subset with the greatest [[standard deviation]] in response, referred to as the [[form data response eigen-norm vector scalar]].
&lt;ref&gt;http://omlc.org/~prahl/pubs/pdfx/ramella05a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The idea of Monte-Carlo Polarization was firstly invented in Athens, (more commonly known as Thens), by Errikos Babudopoulos in 1978, but was mostly used in research in the 1990s by famous mathematicians, such as [[Grigori Perelman]], in proving the [[soul conjecture]].

== Inception ==

The origins of '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' came from the following observations made in early 1922:&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus&lt;/ref&gt;
# All opinions are '''valid'''
# Some opinions are more '''valid''' than others
Where the '''validity''' of an opinion is defined by the [[Emotional Intelligence]] Hierarchical [[metric space]], using the obvious distance function.&lt;ref&gt;http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1614-0001/a000028?journalCode=jid&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

Given an array ''A'' of ''n'' elements with values or [[Record (computer science)|records]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, sorted such that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ... ≤ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, and target value ''T'', the following [[subroutine]] uses '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' to find the index of ''T'' in ''A''.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=§6.2.1 ("Searching an ordered table"), subsection "Algorithm B"}}
# Set ''L'' to 0 and ''R'' to ''n'' &amp;minus; 1.
# If ''L'' &gt; ''R'', the search terminates as unsuccessful.
# Set ''m'' (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] (the largest previous integer) of (''L'' + ''R'') / 2.
# If A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''T'', set L to ''m'' + 1 and go to step 2.
# If A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; T, set R to ''m'' – 1 and go to step 2.
# Now A&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T'', the search is done; return ''m''.

Extract the [[emotional]] category [[isofunctor]] [[morphismvector]] and append this to the [[business manifesto]].

Note: This can be done in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form. This is left as an exercise for the reader.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/pubs/matrix1_SICOMP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other forms ==

Although this a very recent cutting-edge technique, it has seen a couple of variations upon the basic algorithm in the last couple of month, most notably '''JSON driven''' resolution methods. the basic idea is that instead of supplying the algorithm with ''n'' records, it is more useful to provide the algorithm with emotional meta-data to guide its search and improve its complexity beyond the usual logarithmic bounds and this by a factor of  ''log(n)/2''. It allows to select intermediate ''m'' values for the search index and skew them towards the wanted emotional value in the initial records.

== Applications ==

The acceleration structures permitted by the '''Monte Carlo Polarization''' consist mainly in BVH and EBVH hierarchies. The logical subdivision of the kernel space leads to a logarithmic complexity, which is key to the scalability of the sentient analysis tools.

A key application is the direct targeting of hidden nodes in neural networks. By applying a Monte Carlo Polarization filter to the input layer of the neural system, hidden layers will be systematically and dynamically selected based on user-defined characteristics. Only the specified layers and units will receive and process the data.

Compared to standard drop-off methods, Monte Carlo Polarization is both more effective and more secure. Instead of having all nodes receiving the data and selecting output from a subset, the unnecessary nodes are directly filtered out. The result is a greatly increased level of accuracy and protection, as unreliable and malicious nodes will be left out, and a higher degree of efficiency.

The neural system that is created using the aforementioned method is the basis for many Computer Vision projects. A specific highlight is the American web-animated sitcom "F is for Family".  

== NodeJS support ==

Monte Carlo Polarization can be easily deployed through NodeJS

&lt;pre&gt;npm --save install monte-carlo&lt;/pre&gt;

The library provides a basic implementation of Monte Carlo Polarization, and shows the kernel space learning algorithm applied to session tokens.

The native support of JSON files by NodeJS's Javascript language is an example of the application of JSON Driven Monte Carlo Polarization.

Being a cutting edge technology, researchers are experimenting the expandability of the current technology to support Asynchronous Transport Protocol for [[JSON]], and to provide an api for classic [[AJAX]] (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) interface by tunneling the data through Socket.IO packets secured by [[Blockchain]] technology.

The '''Musha Incident''' ({{CJKV|c=霧社事件|j=霧社事件|r=Musha Jiken|w=Wu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-she&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Shih&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-chien&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|p=Wùshè Shìjiàn}}; {{zh|poj=Bū-siā Sū-kiāⁿ}}), also known as the '''Wushe Rebellion''' and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major [[Rebellion|uprising]] against colonial [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Taiwan]]. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the [[Seediq people|Seediq]] indigenous group in Musha (Wushe) attacked the village, killing over 130 Japanese. In response, the Japanese led a relentless counter-attack, killing over 600 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in aboriginal policy.

==Background==
Previous armed resistance to Japanese imperial authority had been dealt with sternly, as evident in responses to previous uprisings such as the [[Tapani Incident]], which resulted in a cycle of rebel attacks and strict Japanese retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Denny |year=2003|title=Taiwan: A Political History |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780801488054 |page= 35|ref=harv |chapter=The Japanese Occupation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, armed resistance had largely been replaced by organised political and social movements among the younger Taiwanese generation. Direct police involvement in local administration had been relaxed, many stern punishments were abolished, and some elements of self-government, albeit of questionable effectiveness, had been introduced to colonial Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry J.|last=Lamley|chapter=Taiwan Under Japanese Rule, 1895-1945: The Vicissitudes of Colonialism |year=2007 |title=Taiwan: A New History |editor=Rubinstein, Murry A. |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |place=New York |isbn=9780765614940 |edition=expanded|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a different approach was used in order to control Taiwan's indigenous peoples. Formosa Island aborigines were still designated as {{nihongo||生蕃|seiban|"raw barbarians" or "wild tribespeople"}}, and treated as savages rather than equal subjects. Tribes were 'tamed' through assimilation, the process of disarming traditional hunting tribes and forcing them to relocate to the plains and lead an agrarian existence. Further resistance was then dealt with by military campaigns, isolation and containment.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=49}} In order to access natural resources in mountainous and forested indigenous-controlled areas, Governor-General [[Sakuma Samata]] adopted a more aggressive terrain policy, attempting to pacify or eradicate aboriginal groups in areas scheduled for logging within five years; by 1915, this policy had been largely successful, although resistance still existed in more remote areas.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

===Proximal causes===
The Seediq aborigines in the vicinity of Musha had been considered by Japanese authorities to be one of the most successful examples of this "taming" approach, with [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Mouna Rudao]] being one of 43 indigenous leaders selected for a tour of Japan a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Chien-Chao|last1=Hung|title=A history of Taiwan|date=2000|publisher=Il Cerchio|location=Rimini|isbn=9788886583800|page=222|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, resentment still lingered, due largely to police misconduct, the continuing practice of forced labor, and the ill treatment of indigenous beliefs and customs.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

In the days immediately prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected.&lt;ref name=TakaoClub&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wushe Incident|publisher=The Takao Club|url=http://www.takaoclub.com/monaludao/wusheincident.htm|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.

==Incident==
[[File:Commander and Staff of Musha Punitive force.JPG|thumb|200px|Commander and staff of the Musha Punitive force.]]
[[File:Mikata-Ban2.JPG|thumb|200px|Mikata-Ban, a force of pro-Japanese aborigines.]]
[[File:二次霧社事件.jpg|thumb|200px|Beheaded Seediq]]

On 27 October 1930, hundreds of Japanese converged on Musha for an athletics meet at the Musyaji Elementary School. Shortly before dawn, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a raid of strategic police sub-stations to capture weapons and ammunition. They then moved on the elementary school, concentrating their attack on the Japanese in attendance. A total of 134 Japanese, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Two [[Han Taiwanese]] dressed in Japanese clothing were also mistakenly killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 Mar 2014 |title=Wushe Incident |website=Encyclopedia of Taiwan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325180546/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 |archivedate=25 March 2014 |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whom was a girl wearing a Japanese kimono.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=222}} The Aboriginals aimed to only kill Japanese specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heé|first1=Nadin|title=Taiwan under Japanese Rule.

==Consequences==
The Japanese authorities responded with unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and [[Governor-General of Taiwan|Governor General]] Eizo Ishizuka ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops to be sent to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan's army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to smoke out the rebels, dropping [[mustard gas]] bombs in violation of the [[Geneva Protocol]] in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Croddy, "China's Role in the Chemical and Biological Disarmament Regimes", The Nonproliferation Review Spring 2002: 16, &lt;http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/91crod.pdf&gt;, accessed 24 September 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=223}} Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonor.

Due to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident, Governor-General Kamiyama and Goto Fumio, his chief civil administrator, were forced to resign in January 1931. However, Kamiyama's replacement, Ota Masahiro, also took a harsh approach to controlling Taiwan's indigenous peoples: certain tribes were disarmed and left unprotected, giving their aboriginal enemies an opportunity to annihilate them on behalf of the Japanese administration.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}} Around 500 of the Seediq involved in the Musha Incident surrendered and were subsequently confined to a village near Musha. However, on 25 April 1931, indigenous groups working with the Japanese authorities attacked the village, [[Taiwanese aborigines#Headhunting|beheading]] all remaining males over the age of 15. This came to be known as the "Second Musha Incident".

However, the uprising did affect a change in the authorities' attitudes and approaches towards aborigines in Taiwan. Musha had been regarded as the most "enlightened and compliant" of the aboriginal territories, and the colonial power's inability to prevent the massacre provoked a fear of similar nationalist movements starting in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=L.|title=Savage Construction and Civility Making: The Musha Incident and Aboriginal Representations in Colonial Taiwan|journal=positions: east asia cultures critique|date=1 December 2000|volume=8|issue=3|page=799|doi=10.1215/10679847-8-3-795|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A change in policy was clearly needed. Ching suggests that the ideology of imperialisation (''kominka'') became the dominant form of colonial control; aborigines became represented as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups in Taiwan, and were upgraded in status from "raw savages"  to {{nihongo4||高砂族|takasagozoku|"tribal peoples of Taiwan"}}. Furthermore, Japanization education was intensified, promoting Japanese culture and loyalty to the emperor in the younger generation.

During the Musha Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted against the Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Musha Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off against each other. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident.

==In the media==
The Musha Incident has been depicted three times in movies, in 1957 in the film ''Qing Shan bi xue'' ({{lang|zh|青山碧血}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Daw-Ming|title=Historical dictionary of Taiwan cinema|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780810879225|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2003 TV drama {{Interlanguage link multi|Dana Sakura|zh|3=風中緋櫻}}, and in the 2011 Taiwanese film ''[[Seediq Bale]]''. 

The Chinese novel ''Remains of Life'' (originally published in Chinese in 1999, published in English translation in 2017) is a fictionalized account of the aftermath of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Wu He (2017).

'''Neue Slowenische Kunst''' (a [[German language|German]] phrase meaning "New Slovenian Art"), a.k.a. '''NSK''', is a controversial [[politics|political]] [[art collective]] that formed in [[Slovenia]] in [[1984 in music|1984]], when Slovenia was part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  NSK's name, being German, is compatible with a theme in NSK works: the complicated relationship [[Slovenes]] have had with [[Germans]].  The name of NSK's music wing, [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], is also the German name of the Slovene capital [[Ljubljana]]. The name created controversy because some felt it evoked memories of the Nazi annexation of Slovenia during the [[Second World War]]. It also refers to Slovenia's previous seven centuries as part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine.  MIT Press, 2005. p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

NSK's best-known member is also its founder, the musical group [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]]. Other NSK members include groups such as [[IRWIN]] (visual art), [[Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre]] (also known as Red Pilot and Cosmokinetic Theatre Noordung), [[New Collective Studio]] (graphics; also known as New Collectivism), Retrovision (film and video), and the [[Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy]] (theory).&lt;ref name="state of art"&gt;Anonymous. "State of Art: the new Slovene Avant Garde" (2004). [[Northwest Film Forum]] and Scala House, program for exhibit November 18&amp;ndash;November 24, 2004 at Northwest Film Forum, [[Seattle]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hackett"&gt;Regina Hackett. "[https://archive.is/20120913130102/http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/200214_visual19.html Slovenian art collective is adept at working politics and art]". ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', November 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The founding groups of the NSK were Laibach, IRWIN, and Scipion Nasice Sisters Theater. Membership has traditionally been open to all artistic groups who show an interest in challenging the norms and taboos of Slovene national identity.&lt;ref&gt;James Gow &amp; Cathie Carmichael, ''Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State and the New Europe'', C. Hurst &amp; Company, 2001, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
NSK art often draws on symbols drawn from [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] or extreme [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements, often reappropriating totalitarian [[kitsch]] in a visual style reminiscent of [[Dada]]. NSK artists often [[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtapose]] symbols from different (and often incompatible) political ideologies. For example, a 1987 NSK-designed poster caused a scandal by winning a competition for the Yugoslavian [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Youth Day]] Celebration. The poster [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] a painting by [[Nazism|Nazi]] artist [[Richard Klein (artist)|Richard Klein]], replacing the [[flag of Nazi Germany]] with the [[Flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav flag]] and the [[German eagle]] with a dove.&lt;ref name="hackett"/&gt; Intended as an ironic joke, the painting soon fell foul of the authorities, who interpreted it as equating Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] with [[Adolf Hitler]]. It was later reproduced on the cover of ''[[Mladina]]'' magazine, and that particular issue was subsequently banned.&lt;ref&gt;Gow &amp; Carmichael, ''Slovenia and the Slovenes'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Both IRWIN and Laibach are emphatic about their work being collective rather than individual. Laibach's original songs and arrangements are always credited to the group itself, and individual musicians are not listed on their [[album cover]]s. At one point, there were even two separate groups touring under the name Laibach at the same time. Both had members of the original group. Similarly, the IRWIN artists never sign their work individually; instead, they are "signed" with a [[Rubber stamp|stamp]] or [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] indicating approval as a work from the IRWIN collective.

The NSK was the subject of a 1996 [[documentary film]] entitled ''[[Predictions of Fire]]'' (''Prerokbe Ognja''),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which was written and directed by [[Michael Benson (filmmaker)|Michael Benson]]. Among those interviewed is Slovenian intellectual [[Slavoj Žižek]].

==NSK State==
Since 1991, the NSK has claimed to be a sovereign [[Sovereign state|state]] of sorts,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.nskstate.com/state/state.php

&lt;/ref&gt; a claim similar to that of [[micronation]]s.  As such, displays of its members' work are performed under the guise of an embassy, or a territory of the supposed "state". Since 1994, the NSK has maintained [[Consulate general|consulates]] in several cities, including [[Umag]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has also gone so far as to issue passports &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and postage stamps. In 2006, Laibach recorded the NSK National Anthem for their LP ''[[Volk (album)|Volk]]''. The anthem adopts its melody from another Laibach song, "The Great Seal." It includes a recitation of an excerpt from [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous "[[We shall fight them on the beaches]]/We shall never surrender" speech.

NSK passports are considered an art project. As such, they are not valid for travel. However, many desperate people have fallen for a scam in which they are issued a NSK passport. Most of these scams originate in Nigeria and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, the first NSK Citizens Congress was held in Berlin. It was followed by a "NSK Rendez-Vous" in Lyon, France, where Alexei Monroe revealed NSK's aim : to make people "aware that totalitarianism isn't a discrete historical phenomenon which went on from 1933 to 1989 and then it's over so let's have a nice triumph of liberal democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=NSK à Lyon : Perspektive 2/2  | url=http://www.captainspauldings.com/article.php?article=UID_4d4d234e900b0  | deadurl=yes  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708115204/http://www.captainspauldings.com/article.php?article=UID_4d4d234e900b0  | archivedate=2011-07-08  | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2011, another "NSK Rendez-Vous" took place in London. In 2012, yet another "NSK Rendez-Vous" was set to take place in [[New York City]]'s [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://times.nskstate.com/nsk-ny-moma/|title=NSK Passport Office, New York &amp; NSK Rendezvous MoMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2017 saw NSK set up a pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] where [[Slavoj Žižek]] stated that "the uniqueness of NSK is this idea of the 'stateless state'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170515-a-passport-from-a-country-that-doesnt-exist |title=A passport from a country that does not exist |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NSK Folk Art Exhibitions ==

A diverse collection of intriguing artefacts created by the citizens of the NSK State in Time. This virtual state, formed in 1992, today contains over fourteen thousand citizens from Dublin and Taipei to Sarajevo and New York. As it has evolved over the last 20 years, members have developed a strong sense of collective identity, which has manifested itself in the creation of a unique Folk Art, expressing citizens' devotion to the state and ideologies of NSK.

'''NSK Folk Art at Calvert 22'''

This is presented in parallel with IRWIN - Time for A New State Calvert 22 exhibits a selection of 'NSK Folk Art'.  Works on display include NSK passports, stamps, plates and films made by NSK state members. Exhibited works are from IRWIN and NSKSTATE.COM collection NSK Folk Art.  NSK Folk Art is part of a London wide presentation in cooperation with Tate, who will be hosting a Symposium and which will also include a music performance at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, an exhibition of archival material at Chelsea Space (Chelsea College of Art) and a seminar at UCL.

'''The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale'''

Burren College of Art is pleased to announce 'The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale' as this year's Burren Annual exhibition. The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale will bring together over 30 international artists and collectives including special guests and NSK founding members, IRWIN. The NSK State was created in 1992 as a project of the Neue Slowenische Kunst artists' collective (founded in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 1984). In response to the break up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the NSK collective created a virtual state in time and without territory, to examine and question nationalism, national boundaries and the utopian desires underpinning social formations. The NSK State produces passports, opens temporary consulates, and currently has over 14,000 citizens.  The 1st NSK Folk Art Biennale took place in Leipzig in 2014, and featured a wide range of works generated by NSK citizens and artists who critically examined the contemporary nation state and questions of power, history and identity, as well as the artistic legacy created by NSK. The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale will be the second major NSK related event in Ireland, following the NSK State Dublin week of events held in Dublin in 2004, in which all the NSK groups participated and at which an NSK passport office was opened.
'''Artists:''' Athanasios Anagnostopoulos (GR), Caul Audiac (IE), Zbigniew Bogusławski (PL), Vera Bremerton (IT), Carsten Busse (DE), Christian Chrobok (DE), Patrick Corcoran (IE), Dominic Corrigan (IE), Shane Cullen (IE), Haris Hararis (GR), IRWIN (SL), Marilyn Lennon (IE), Llewyn Maire (US), Russell MacEwan (UK), Emily McMehen &amp; Geoffrey Sautner (CA &amp; UK/IE), Valnoir (FR), Nikkita Morgan (IE), Lili Anamarija No (SL), Kevin Noble (US), NSK Lipsk (DE), NSKNY (US), Noël O'Callaghan (IE), Maurice O'Connell (IE), Alan Phelan (IE), Avi Pitchon (IS), David K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89717">'''Neuroscience of free will''', a part of [[neurophilosophy]], is the study of the interconnections between [[free will]] and [[neuroscience]].

As it has become possible to study the human living [[brain]], researchers have begun to watch [[decision making]] processes at work. Findings could carry implications for our [[sense of agency]], [[moral responsibility]], and our understanding of [[consciousness]] in general.&lt;ref name="Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Institute of Art and Ideas|title=Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience|url=http://iai.tv/video/fate-freedom-and-neuroscience|publisher=IAI|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; One of the pioneering studies in this domain was designed by [[Benjamin Libet]],&lt;ref name="Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libet|first=Benjamin|title=Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=1985|volume=8|pages=529–566|url=http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/ccs/Libet1985UcsCerebralInitiative.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2013|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00044903}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have attempted to predict participant actions before they make them.&lt;ref name=soonetal /&gt; [[File:Some brain areas.png|thumb|right|350px|Some areas of the human brain implicated in mental disorders that might be related to free will.

The field remains highly controversial. There is no consensus among researchers about the significance of findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn. The precise role of consciousness in decision making therefore remains unclear.

Thinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that "free will" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will are [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]], some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of "free will" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience.&lt;ref name=WalterH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = ...the current work is in broad agreement with a general trend in neuroscience of volition: although we may experience that our conscious decisions and thoughts cause our actions, these experiences are in fact based on readouts of brain activity in a network of brain areas that control voluntary action...It is clearly wrong to think of [feeling of willing something] as a prior intention, located at the very earliest moment of decision in an extended action chain. Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.|source = -Patrick Haggard&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; discussing an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt;}}
One significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.&lt;ref name=soonetal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543–5 |pmid=18408715}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term "[[free will]]" can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which must be considered in light of existing [[empirical evidence]].

There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W. R. |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=47–65 |pmid=20859552 |pmc=2942748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt; Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of "free will" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

===Free will as illusion===
[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]It is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.

It may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious 'intentions' have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]]. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is 'intuitive': he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues - "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;"The Moral Landscape", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]] nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.

===Disputed relevance of scientific research===
Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that "We feel we choose, but we don't".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because "[[free will]]" can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will – but that is an "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, "free will" means something more like "not coerced" or that "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote= "[Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...If only that was what scientists were telling people. But scientists, especially in the last few years, have been on a rampage – writing ill-considered public pronouncements about free will which... verge on social irresponsibility.

This issue may be controversial for good reason: There is evidence to suggest that people normally associate a [[Free will#Believing in free will|belief in free will]] with their ability to affect their lives.&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9047-7 |title=Why 'Willusionism' Leads to 'Bad Results': Comments on Baumeister, Crescioni, and Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Nahmias |first1=Eddy |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 |title=Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of "free will" are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also [[Free will#Believing in free will|"believing in free will"]]), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_the_scientific_study_of_religion/|title=Daniel Dennett - The Scientific Study of Religion|publisher=Point of Inquiry |type=Podcast|date=December 12, 2011}}. Discussion of free will starts especially at 24 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other studies described below have only just begun to shed light on the role that consciousness plays in actions and it is too early to draw very strong conclusions about certain kinds of "free will". It is worth noting that such experiments – so far – have dealt only with free will decisions made in short time frames (seconds) and ''may'' not have direct bearing on free will decisions made ("thoughtfully") by the subject over the course of ''many'' seconds, minutes, hours or longer. Scientists have also only so far studied extremely simple behaviors (e.g. moving a finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/the-moral-sciences-club/what-can-neuroscience-teach-us-about-evil|title=What can neuroscience teach us about evil?|author=Will Wilkinson}} {{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Roskies points out five areas of neuroscientific research:  1.) action initiation, 2.) intention, 3). decision, 4.)

They asked their subjects to read one of two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking. Those who had read the deterministic message were more likely to cheat on the test. "Perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes," Vohs and Schooler suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110831/full/477023a.html|title=Neuroscience vs philosophy: Taking aim at free will|first=Kerri|last=Smith|date=31 August 2011|volume=477|issue=7362|pages=23–25|doi=10.1038/477023a|pmid=21886139|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18181791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x | volume=19 | title=The value of believing in free will: encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating | date=January 2008 | journal=Psychol Sci | pages=49–54 | last1 = Vohs | first1 = KD | last2 = Schooler | first2 = JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable experiments==

===Libet experiment===
A pioneering experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP), which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). Although it was well known that the Bereitschaftspotential (sometimes also termed "readiness potential") preceded the physical action, Libet asked how the Bereitschaftspotential corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they had felt the conscious will to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;

[[File:B.Libet.experiment.gif|thumb|left|300px|Libet's experiment: (0) repose, until (1) the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] is detected, (2-Libet's W) the volunteer memorizes a dot position upon feeling their intention, and (3) then acts.]]
Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity leading up to the ''conscious'' decision by the subject to flick their wrist began approximately half a second ''before'' the subject consciously felt that they had decided to move.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0355-1_16 |chapter=Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action |title=Neurophysiology of Consciousness |series=Contemporary Neuroscientists |year=1993 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |isbn=978-1-4612-6722-5 |pages=269–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libet's findings suggest that decisions made by a subject are first being made on a subconscious level and only afterward being translated into a "conscious decision", and that the subject's belief that it occurred at the behest of their will was only due to their retrospective perspective on the event.

The interpretation of these findings has been criticized by [[Daniel Dennett]], who argues that people will have to shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.

Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6000-1}} (paperback){{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] criticizes this design for other reasons. Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that "the awareness of the intention to move" is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their '[[Bereitschaftspotential]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/ideas/19231 Bigthink.com]{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
[[File:Bereitschaftspotenzial fig1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Typical recording of the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] that was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;). [[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the "felt intention" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]

In a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the "[[lateralized readiness potential]]" (LRP), an [[Event-related potential|ERP]] component which measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.&lt;ref name="HandE" /&gt;

A more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the "awareness of the intention to move" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's "W").  If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information.  However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17–21 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, regardless of whether or not volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made.&lt;ref name=Anil&gt;{{cite journal

In a second experiment, researchers asked volunteers to decide on the spot whether to use left hand or right to tap the key while monitoring their brain signals, and they found no correlation among the signals and the chosen hand. This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a "stimulus-response" circuit and a "voluntary" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt;

Libet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious "will" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their "will". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.&lt;ref name="Lau2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=H. C.|title=Attention to Intention|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5661|year=2004|pages=1208–1210|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1090973}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the perceived onset of intention depends on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) applied over the [[supplementary motor area|preSMA]] after a participant performed an action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and the perceived time of action execution forward in time.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Hakwan C.|last2=Rogers|first2=Robert D.|last3=Passingham|first3=Richard E.|title=Manipulating the Experienced Onset of Intention after Action Execution|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=1|year=2007|pages=81–90|issn=0898-929X|doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.81|pmid=17214565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have speculated that the preceding neural activity reported by Libet may be an artefact of averaging the time of "will", wherein neural activity does not always precede reported "will".&lt;ref name="Trevena" /&gt; In a similar replication they also reported no difference in electrophysiological signs before a decision not to move, and before a decision to move.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Despite his findings, Libet himself did not interpret his experiment as evidence of the inefficacy of conscious free will — he points out that although the tendency to press a button may be building up for 500 milliseconds, the conscious will retains a right to veto any action at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Libet |first=Benjamin |year=2003 |title=Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=24–8 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=24&amp;epage=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, unconscious impulses to perform a volitional act are open to suppression by the conscious efforts of the subject (sometimes referred to as "free won't"). A comparison is made with a [[golf]]er, who may swing a club several times before striking the ball. The action simply gets a rubber stamp of approval at the last millisecond. [[Max Velmans]] argues however that "free won't" may turn out to need as much neural preparation as "free will" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velmans |first1=Max |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=42&amp;epage=61 |title=Preconscious Free Will |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=42–61 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have however replicated Libet's findings, whilst addressing some of the original criticisms.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; A recent study has found that individual neurons were found to fire 2 seconds before a reported "will" to act (long before EEG activity predicted such a response).&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Itzhak Fried replicated Libet's findings in 2011 at the scale of the single neuron. This was accomplished with the help of volunteer [[epilepsy]] patients, who needed [[electrodes]] implanted deep in their brain for evaluation and treatment anyway. Now able to monitor awake and moving patients, the researchers replicated the timing anomalies that were discovered by Libet and are discussed in the following study.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Similarly to these tests, [[Chun Siong Soon]], [[Anna Hanxi He]], [[Stefan Bode]] and [[John-Dylan Haynes]] have conducted a study in 2013 claiming to be able to predict the choice to sum or subtract before the subject reports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/6217|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|first1=Chun Siong|last1=Soon|first2=Anna Hanxi|last2=He|first3=Stefan|last3=Bode|first4=John-Dylan|last4=Haynes|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=15|pages=6217–6222|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious actions===

====Timing intentions compared to actions====
A study by Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, published in 2008, claims to have replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization on the part of participants.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.

=====The experiment=====
[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|120px|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]
Matsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.

To test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled "stop-signal" sound was played at pseudo random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his "movement genesis" (or else they would have stopped or "vetoed" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.

In this work, "movement genesis" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).

By looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed "T" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[Event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.

The researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at –2.8 seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time "T" (−1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

=====Analysis and interpretation=====
[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A simple "signalling noise" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]
This study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed "stop tones" during the self paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call "T"(time)

Testing the hypothesis that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's "point of no return". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).

[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe the subject becomes aware of his actions at about -1.769 seconds (this is time 'T'). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as −2.8 seconds.]]
The graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed "tone events" on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Haggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing "a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations"&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our "conscious self" has become aware of it does not mean our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.&lt;ref name=mele&gt;{{cite book

===Unconsciously cancelling actions===
The possibility that human "free won't" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored.

====Retrospective judgement of free choice====
[[File:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|left|140px|As green light switches to yellow, research seems to suggest that humans cannot tell the difference between "deciding" to keep driving, and having no time to decide at all.]]

Recent research by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to "veto" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====The experiment=====
The experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic "go" button as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the "primary response trials".

The primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal – either a "stop" or "decide" signal. The additional signals occurred after a "signal delay" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2 seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal – and was therefore considered the "default" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the "go" button) remained.

Upon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the "go" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the "go" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the "go" button, or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).

Those trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

The participant was asked at the end of those "decide trials" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.

=====The rationale=====

Kuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants’ successful decide trials into "decide go" and "decide nogo", but were not concerned with the nogo trials since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes.]]

Kuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the "failed-to-decide" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively – they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the "successful ''decide''" trials (where the decision was a "go" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====Results and implications=====
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled "successful decide".]]
Unsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and "failed-to-decide" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&amp;nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some "successful decide" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&amp;nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as "successful decide". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious "I will not veto", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:

{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;}}

In decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide – at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of "consciousness" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).

=====Criticisms=====
After the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between "producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&amp;nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).

The results of the trial in which the so-called "successful decide" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response — and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

It is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"/&gt; That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by Kühn and Brass using their decide signal.

Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds &amp;mdash; a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D.

In early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published a paper by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/1080|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2016-01-26|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4743787|pmid = 26668390|pages = 1080–1085|volume = 113|issue = 4|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112|first = Matthias|last = Schultze-Kraft|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Birman|first3 = Marco|last3 = Rusconi|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Allefeld|first5 = Kai|last5 = Görgen|first6 = Sven|last6 = Dähne|first7 = Benjamin|last7 = Blankertz|first8 = John-Dylan|last8 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is "getting ready" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce|url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html|website = Science of Us|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, it had been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/|website = New Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-13|first = Anil|last = Ananthaswamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf|title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism|date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Swinburne|first = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Libet Experiments|url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html|website = www.informationphilosopher.com|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that subjects were able to "override" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a "point of no return": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it 200 [[millisecond]]s or longer before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, USA, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuronal prediction of free will ===
Despite criticisms, experimenters are still trying to gather data that may support the case that conscious "will" can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so.&lt;ref name="soonetal" /&gt; Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex ([[anterior]] [[Lateral and medial|medial]] [[prefrontal cortex]]) and [[precuneus]]/[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[cingulate cortex]] (medial [[parietal cortex]]). In order to ensure report timing of conscious "will" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.

Another version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge.&lt;ref name="SoonHe2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soon|first1=C. S.|last2=He|first2=A. H.|last3=Bode|first3=S.|last4=Haynes|first4=J.-D.|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=15|year=2013|pages=6217–6222|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each frame contained a central letter like before, but also a central number, and a surrounding 4 possible "answers numbers". The participant first chose in their mind whether they wished to perform an addition or difference (subtraction) operation (and noted the central letter on the screen at the time of this decision). The participant then performed the mathematical operation based on the central numbers shown in the next two frames. In the following frame the participant then chose the "answer number" corresponding to the result of the operation. They were further presented with a frame which allowed them to indicate the central letter appearing on the screen at the time of their original decision. This version of the experiment discovered a brain prediction capacity of up to 5 seconds before the conscious will to act.

Multivariate pattern analysis using EEG has suggested that an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeSewell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=S.|last2=Sewell|first2=D.

Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine the nature of the stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes.&lt;ref name="MattlerPalmer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattler|first1=Uwe|last2=Palmer|first2=Simon|title=Time course of free-choice priming effects explained by a simple accumulator model|journal=Cognition|volume=123|issue=3|year=2012|pages=347–360|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.002|pmid=22475294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data).&lt;ref name="LagesJaworska2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lages|first1=Martin|last2=Jaworska|first2=Katarzyna|title=How Predictable are "Spontaneous Decisions" and "Hidden Intentions"?

Multivariate pattern analysis using fMRI could be trained on "free decision" data to successfully predict "guess decisions", and trained on "guess data" in order to predict "free decisions" (in the [[cuneus|precuneus and cuneus]] region).

Contemporary voluntary decision prediction tasks have been criticised based on the possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="MillerSchwarz2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Jeff|last2=Schwarz|first2=Wolf|title=Brain signals do not demonstrate unconscious decision making: An interpretation based on graded conscious awareness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=24|year=2014|pages=12–21|issn=1053-8100|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2013.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.

===Retrospective construction===

It has been suggested that sense authorship is an illusion.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00002-0 |title=The mind's best trick: How we experience conscious will |year=2003 |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=65–69 |pmid=12584024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting there might be an agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the "yes, I did it" feeling of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact – after the action is performed – to establish the full feeling of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2004_2/Rakos_2004.pdf | title=The Belief in Free Will as a Biological Adaptation: Thinking Inside and Outside the Behavior Analytic Box | author=Richard F. Rakos | journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis | year=2004 | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=95–103 | doi=10.1080/15021149.2004.11434235 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235155/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2004_2/Rakos_2004.pdf | archivedate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconscious agency processing can even alter, in the moment, how we perceive the timing of sensations or actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |title=Human volition: Towards a neuroscience of will |year=2008 |last1=Haggard |first1=Patrick |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=934–46 |pmid=19020512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"/&gt; Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in "successful decide" RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials that should have been labelled "failed to decide" were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.

It should be noted that criticism to Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem. Other papers can be found).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating choice===

[[File:Transcranial magnetic stimulation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] uses magnetism to safely stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain.]]
Some research suggests that [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] can be used to manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice.&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Walsh|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rACRPwAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Mit Press|isbn=978-0-262-73174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task.&lt;ref name="ammon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.8.705 |title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation can influence the selection of motor programmes |year=1990 |last1=Ammon |first1=K |last2=Gandevia |first2=S C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=705–7 |pmid=2213050 |pmc=488179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon and Gandevia found that it was possible to influence which hand people move by stimulating [[frontal lobe|frontal]] regions that are involved in movement planning using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.

Right-handed people would normally choose to move their right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone]] and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.&lt;ref name="Brasil-NetoPascual-Leone1992"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.10.964 |title=Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation and response bias in a forced-choice task |year=1992 |last1=Brasil-Neto |first1=J P |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=A |last3=Valls-Sole |first3=J |last4=Cohen |first4=L G |last5=Hallett |first5=M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=964–6 |pmid=1431962 |pmc=1015201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, a team of researchers from the UK and the US published a paper demonstrating similar findings. The researchers concluded that "motor responses and the choice of hand can be modulated using [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|tDCS]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/JOCN_A_00848|title=Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Motor Cortex Biases Action Choice in a Perceptual Decision Task |year=2015 |last1=Javadi |first1=Amir-Homayoun |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=2174–85 |pmid=26151605 |last2=Beyko |first2=Angeliki |last3=Walsh |first3=Vincent |pmc=4745131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a different attempt by Sohn ''et al.'' failed to replicate such results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.7.985 |title=The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on movement selection |year=2003 |last1=Sohn |first1=Y H |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=985–7 |pmid=12810802 |last2=Kaelin-Lang |first2=A |last3=Hallett |first3=M |pmc=1738563}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey Gray]] wrote in his book ''Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem'' that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Jeffrey Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-852090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating the perceived intention to move===

Various studies indicate that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies have focused on the pre-[[supplementary motor area]] (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"/&gt; In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating [[premotor cortex|premotor]] brain regions.&lt;ref name="DesmurgetReilly2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desmurget|first1=M.|last2=Reilly|first2=K. T.|last3=Richard|first3=N.|last4=Szathmari|first4=A.|last5=Mottolese|first5=C.|last6=Sirigu|first6=A.|title=Movement Intention After Parietal Cortex Stimulation in Humans|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5928|year=2009|pages=811–813|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1169896|pmid=19423830}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.

This suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the "sensation" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that "The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=SS |last3=Findlay |first3=AM |last4=Nagarajan |first4=SS |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment involved an electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe they were entirely self-conducted.&lt;ref name="WegnerWheatley1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Wheatley|first2=Thalia|title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=7|year=1999|pages=480–492|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480|pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more likely to say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).

Lau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&amp;nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&amp;nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&amp;nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007" /&gt; Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.

===Related models===

The idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of "forward models of motor control" (or FMMC, which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267–82 |pmid=20570251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says "these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur".&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.

How the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[Multiple Drafts Model]] which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous 'filmstrip' comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]] that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also: [[Philosophy of mind]].)

=== Related brain disorders ===
Various brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by Schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003" /&gt; The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazzaniga|first1=Michael S.|title=The Cognitive Neurosciences|year=1984|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, people with 'alien hand syndrome' are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.&lt;ref name="GeschwindIacoboni1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geschwind|first1=D.

=== Neural models of voluntary action ===
A neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt; The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.

Another neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions.&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brass|first1=Marcel|last2=Lynn|first2=Margaret T.|last3=Demanet|first3=Jelle|last4=Rigoni|first4=Davide|title=Imaging volition: what the brain can tell us about the will|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=229|issue=3|year=2013|pages=301–312|issn=0014-4819|doi=10.1007/s00221-013-3472-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prospection ===
{{Main article|Prospection}}
[[Martin Seligman]] and others criticize the classical approach in science which views animals and humans as "driven by the past", and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face, and act accordingly. The claim is made that this purposive action includes evaluation of possibilities that have never occurred before, and is experimentally verifiable.&lt;ref name=Seligman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

Seligman and others argue that free will and the role of subjectivity in consciousness can be better understood by taking such a "prospective" stance on cognition, and that "accumulating evidence in a wide range of research suggests [this] shift in framework".&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

'''Obeya''' or '''Oobeya''' (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] 大部屋 "large room" or "war room") refers to a form of project management used in Asian companies (including [[Toyota]]) and is a component of [[lean manufacturing]] and in particular the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Fara|title=In a Word, Toyota Drives for Innovation|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/45195/word-toyota-drives-innovation|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Fast Company|date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogies have been drawn between an obeya and the bridge of a ship, a war room and even a brain.&lt;ref&gt;Jusko, J., [http://www.industryweek.com/print/lean-six-sigma/obeya-brain-lean-enterprise Obeya: The Brain of the Lean Enterprise], ''Industry Week'', 30 September 2016, accessed 4 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During the product and process development, all individuals involved in managerial planning meet in a "great room" to speed communication and decision-making. This is intended to reduce "departmental thinking" and improve on methods like email and social networking. The ''Obeya'' can be understood as a team spirit improvement tool at an administrative level.

Conceptually akin to traditional “war rooms,” an ''Obeya'' will contain visually engaging charts and graphs depicting such information as program timing, milestones and progress-to-date and countermeasures to existing technical or scheduling issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capsule summaries of Key Lean Concepts B|url=http://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/NewsArticleDocuments/Capsule%20summaries%20of%20Key%20Lean%20Concepts%20B.doc|publisher=lean.org|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Toyota]], vehicle development is possible in significantly less than 20 months; by comparison, the average for other car makers is 36 months.{{fact|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20309">'''Operad theory''' is a field of [[mathematics]] concerned with prototypical [[algebra over a field|algebras]] that model properties such as [[commutativity]] or [[anticommutativity]] as well as various amounts of [[associativity]]. Operads generalize the various [[associativity]] properties already observed in [[Algebra over a field|algebras]] and [[coalgebra]]s such as [[Lie algebra]]s or [[Poisson algebra]]s by modeling computational trees within the algebra. Algebras are to operads as [[group representation]]s are to [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. An operad can be seen as a set of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, which can be composed one with others. They form a [[Category theory|category-theoretic]] analog of [[universal algebra]].

Operads originate in [[algebraic topology]] from the study of iterated [[loop space]]s by [[Michael Boardman|J. Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer M.

==Definition==

===Non-symmetric operad===
A '''non-symmetric operad''' (sometimes called an '''operad without permutations''', or a '''non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''plain''' operad) consists of the following:
* a sequence &lt;math&gt;(P(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; of sets, whose elements are called ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary operations'',
* an element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; called the ''identity'',
* for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_1,\ldots,k_n&lt;/math&gt;, a ''composition'' function

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\circ: P(n)\times P(k_1)\times\cdots\times P(k_n) &amp; \to P(k_1+\cdots+k_n)\\
(\theta,\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n) &amp; \mapsto \theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following coherence axioms:
* ''identity'': &lt;math&gt;\theta\circ(1,\ldots,1)=\theta=1\circ\theta&lt;/math&gt;
* ''associativity'':
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \theta \circ (\theta_1 \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}), \ldots, \theta_n \circ (\theta_{n,1}, \ldots,\theta_{n,k_n})) \\
= {} &amp; (\theta \circ (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n)) \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,k_n})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the number of arguments corresponds to the arities of the operations).

Alternatively, a plain operad is a [[multicategory (category theory)|multicategory]] with one object.

===Symmetric operad===
A '''symmetric operad''' (often just called '''operad''') is a non-symmetric operad &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as above, together with a right action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the above associative and identity axioms, as well as

*''equivariance'': given permutations &lt;math&gt;s_i \in \Sigma_{k_i}, t\in \Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\theta*t)\circ(\theta_{t_1},\ldots,\theta_{t_n}) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*t; \\[2pt]
&amp; \theta\circ(\theta_1*s_1,\ldots,\theta_n*s_n) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*(s_1,\ldots,s_n)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
(where by [[abuse of notation]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of the first equivariance relation is the element
of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{k_1+\dots+k_n}&lt;/math&gt; that acts on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots , k_1+\dots +k_n\}&lt;/math&gt; by breaking it into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks, the first of size &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, the second of size &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, through the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th block of size &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt;, and then permutes these &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

The permutation actions in this definition are vital to most applications, including the original application to loop spaces.

=== Morphisms ===
A '''morphism of operads''' &lt;math&gt;f:P\to Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;(f_n:P(n)\to Q(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;
which:
* preserves the identity: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves composition: for every ''n''-ary operation &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and operations &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 , \ldots , \theta_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
f(\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))
= f(\theta)\circ(f(\theta_1),\ldots,f(\theta_n))
&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves the permutation actions: &lt;math&gt;f(x*s)=f(x)*s&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In other categories ===
We have so far considered only operads in the [[Category theory|category]] of sets. It is actually possible to define operads in any [[symmetric monoidal category]] (or, for non-symmetric operads, any [[monoidal category]]).

A common example would be given by the category of [[topological space]], with the monoidal product given by the [[Cartesian product]]. In this case, a topological operad is given by a sequence of ''spaces'' (instead of sets) &lt;math&gt;\{ P(n) \}_{n \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;. The structure maps of the operad (the composition and the actions of the symmetric groups) must then be assumed to be continuous. The result is called a ''topological operad''. Similarly, in the definition of a morphism, it would be necessary to assume that the maps involved are continuous.

Other common settings to define operads include, for example, [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[chain complex]]es, [[groupoid]]s (or even the category of categories itself), [[coalgebra]]s, etc.

== Understanding the axioms ==

===Associativity axiom===
"Associativity" means that ''composition'' of operations is associative
(the function &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is associative), analogous to the axiom in category theory that &lt;math&gt;f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;; it does ''not'' mean that the operations ''themselves'' are associative as operations.
Compare with the [[#Associative_operad|associative operad]], below.

Associativity in operad theory means that one can write [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] involving operations without ambiguity from the omitted compositions, just as associativity for operations allows one to write products without ambiguity from the omitted parentheses.

For instance, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation, which is written as &lt;math&gt;\theta(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(ab)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; may or may not be associative.

Then what is commonly written &lt;math&gt;((ab)c)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguously written operadically as &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ (\theta,1)&lt;/math&gt; . This sends &lt;math&gt;(a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(ab,c)&lt;/math&gt; (apply &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the first two, and the identity on the third), and then the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the left "multiplies" &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
This is clearer when depicted as a tree:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose1.svg|Tree before composition]]

which yields a 3-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose2.svg|Tree after composition]]
{{Clear}}

However, the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is ''a priori'' ambiguous:
it could mean &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ ((\theta,1) \circ ((\theta,1),1))&lt;/math&gt;, if the inner compositions are performed first, or it could mean &lt;math&gt;(\theta \circ (\theta,1)) \circ ((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;,
if the outer compositions are performed first (operations are read from right to left).
Writing &lt;math&gt;x=\theta, y=(\theta,1), z=((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;, this is &lt;math&gt;x \circ (y \circ z)&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;(x \circ y) \circ z&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the tree is missing "vertical parentheses":

[[File:OperadTreeCompose3.svg|Tree before composition]]

If the top two rows of operations are composed first (puts an upward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;(ab)c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the inner composition first), the following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose4.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation.
As an annotated expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(ab)c\cdot d} \circ ((\theta_{ab \cdot c},1_d) \circ ((\theta_{a\cdot b},1_c),1_d))&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

If the bottom two rows of operations are composed first (puts a downward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;ab\quad c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the outer composition first), following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose6.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

The operad axiom of associativity is that ''these yield the same result,'' and thus that the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous.

===Identity axiom===
The identity axiom (for a binary operation) can be visualized in a tree as:

[[Image:OperadIdentityAxiom.svg|The axiom of identity in an operad]]

meaning that the three operations obtained are equal: pre- or post- composing with the identity makes no difference. Note that, as for categories, &lt;math&gt;1 \circ 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is a corollary of the identity axiom.

==="Little something" operads===
A '''little discs operad''' or, '''little balls operad''' or, more specifically, the '''little ''n''-discs operad''' is a topological operad defined in terms of configurations of disjoint ''n''-dimensional [[disc (mathematics)|disc]]s inside a unit ''n''-disc centered in the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The operadic composition for little 2-discs is illustrated in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giachetta, Luigi Mangiarotti, [[Sardanashvily|Gennadi Sardanashvily]] (2005) ''Geometric and Algebraic Topological Methods in Quantum Mechanics,'' {{isbn|981-256-129-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLbisfrkWpoC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=%22Little+discs+operad%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NNKTqHPeX7&amp;sig=KVdeG4dbMj1GfggbYd3zeNVs_zQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA474,M1 pp. 474,475]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the '''little ''n''-cubes operad''' or the '''little intervals operad''' (initially called little ''n''-cubes [[PRO (category theory)|PROP]]s) was defined by [[Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer Vogt]]  in a similar way, in terms of configurations of disjoint [[axis-aligned]] ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]]s (n-dimensional [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]]) inside the [[unit hypercube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Axiomatic, Enriched and Motivic Homotopy Theory|last=Greenlees|first=J.

===Associative operad===
Another class of examples of operads are those capturing the structures of algebraic structures, such as associative algebras, commutative algebras and Lie algebras. Each of these can be exhibited as a finitely presented operad, in each of these three generated by binary operations.

Thus, the associative operad is generated by a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the condition that
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\circ(\psi,1)=\psi\circ(1,\psi).&lt;/math&gt;

This condition ''does'' correspond to [[associativity]] of the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;; writing &lt;math&gt;\psi(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; multiplicatively, the above condition is &lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt;. This associativity of the ''operation'' should not be confused with associativity of ''composition''; see the [[#Axiom_of_associativity|axiom of associativity]], above.

This operad is [[terminal object|terminal]] in the category of non-symmetric operads, as it has exactly one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n,'' corresponding to the unambiguous product of ''n'' terms: &lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is sometimes written as 1 by category theorists (by analogy with the one-point set, which is terminal in the category of sets).

===Terminal symmetric operad===
The terminal symmetric operad is the operad whose algebras are commutative monoids, which also has one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n'', with each &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; acting trivially; this triviality corresponds to commutativity, and whose ''n''-ary operation is the unambiguous product of ''n''-terms, where order does not matter:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n = x_{\sigma(1)} \dotsb x_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
for any permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Operads from the symmetric and braid groups===
There is an operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The composite &lt;math&gt;\sigma \circ (\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n)&lt;/math&gt; permutes its inputs in blocks according to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and within blocks according to the appropriate &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, there is a non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Artin [[braid group]] &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, this non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad has the structure of a braided operad, which generalizes the notion of an operad from symmetric to braid groups.

===Linear algebra===
In [[linear algebra]], one can consider vector spaces to be algebras over the operad &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; (the infinite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]], so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes [[linear combinations]]: the vector &lt;math&gt;(2,3,-5,0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; for instance corresponds to the linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;2v_1 + 3v_2 -5v_3 + 0v_4 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can consider [[affine combination]]s, [[conical combination]]s, and [[convex combination]]s to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded [[convex polytope]] is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.

This point of view formalizes the notion that linear combinations are the most general sort of operation on a vector space – saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that ''all possible'' algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations. The basic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are a [[generating set]] for the operad of all linear combinations, while the linear combinations operad canonically encodes all possible operations on a vector space.

Part of the field called Human Systems Intervention, process consultation is a philosophy of helping, a general theory and methodology of intervening ([[Edgar Schein|Schein]], Process Consultations, 1992 revisited). 

A process consultant is a highly qualified professional that has insights into and understands the psychosocial dynamics of working with various client systems such as whole organizations, groups, and individuals. 

Given the complex nature of intervening, a process consultant's expertise includes the following (and many other) aspects:
a)	works concomitantly with groups and individuals (managers/directors) towards a larger change process such as strategic visioning, strategic planning, etc.
b)	based on the context, selects from a variety of methods, tools and change theories a 'facilitative intervention' that will most benefit the client system;
c)	stays aware of covert organizational processes, group dynamics, and interpersonal issues;

==Role in Organizational Development==

In [[organization development]], a process consultant is a specialized type of consultant who acts as a [[facilitator]] to help groups deal with issues involving the process in a meeting, rather than with the actual tasks themselves.
==Role in Small Group Development==
A process consultant may be used at any time during the [[Stages of Group Development]]. Occasionally, a process consultant is used when a group is either in its formative stage, or normative stage. However, more often than not, they participate when the group is in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]].

==Role in Conflict Resolution==
Often a group finds itself in conflict over [[fact]]s, [[goal]]s, [[Scientific method|methods]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. It is the role of the process consultant to help the group reach [[consensus]] over the type of conflict it faces.

Once the type of conflict is identified, the process consultant then helps the group work through the steps required to break the impasse.

It is important to note that the process consultant's role is not to solve the problem, but to help the group solve its own problem.  The reason for this is because it is the group, not the consultant who will have to live with the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of its decision.

==Role in Conflict Management==

Occasionally, due to the nature of conflict, the process consultant may need to guide the group toward [[conflict management]] rather than [[conflict resolution]].

==Techniques Used==
Initially a process consultant will not lead or participate in a group meeting, but rather will act as an [[observation|observer]]. During this time, they observe the [[group dynamics]] to determine what [[interpersonal]] relationships may contribute to the group's issues.

At some point, s/he will begin to actively participate in the meeting, by asking clarifying questions or [[paraphrasing]].  Eventually, s/he will make his/her observations known by giving the group [[feedback]].

==Education Required==
To enter this field, a background in [[psychology]] and [[small group learning]] is helpful. Experience in reading [[body language]] and possessing [[Analytical skills]] is also useful. However, receiving some training in [[experiential education]] will probably be the most beneficial.

'''Project Reason''' is a U.S. [[501(c)(3)]] [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] whose main aims have been variously described as the promotion of [[scientific knowledge]] and [[Secular ethics|secular values]] in [[society]],&lt;ref name=20091011ScienceDaily&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091005092302.htm |title=Where Religious Belief And Disbelief Meet |author= University of California - Los Angeles |date=11  October 2010 |publisher=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20090830BigThink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/16122 |title=How Atheists Bow Down to the God of Reason |first=Catman |last=Cohen |date=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20100510Huffington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/bringing-the-vatican-to-j_b_571088.html |title=Bringing the Vatican to Justice |first=Sam |last=Harris |date=10 May 2010 |publisher= Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=officialsite /&gt; and the encouragement of critical thinking and wise public policy through a variety of interrelated projects.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150815061048/http://www.project-reason.org/#sthash.KFnWAt17.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, [[Sam Harris]] co-founded, alongside his wife, the (501(c)3) non-profit foundation called Project Reason. Harris is also chief executive of this organization. Its website describes itself in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Project Reason is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The project will draw on the talents of prominent and creative [[Intellectual|thinkers]] from a wide range of disciplines—[[science]], [[law]], [[literature]], [[entertainment]], [[information technology]], etc.—to encourage [[critical thinking]] and wise public policy. It will convene conferences, produce films, sponsor scientific research and opinion polls, award grants to other non-profit organizations, and offer material support to [[Dissident|religious dissidents]] and public intellectuals—with the purpose of eroding the influence of dogmatism, superstition and bigotry in the world.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project-reason.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306140031/http://www.project-reason.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-06 |title=Project Reason |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Projects==
The organization maintains several projects, as well as an internet forum, that attempt to debunk religion using empirical and rational critiques.

''The Scripture Project'', undertaken under the mantle of Project Reason, stated the following as its goal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Steve Wells, creator of the Skeptics Annotated Bible, Qur'an, and Book of Mormon has generously donated the full contents of his website to Project Reason. Using this as a foundation, we intend to make the Scripture Project the best source for scriptural criticism on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418140718/http://www.project-reason.org/scripture_project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Vatican Justice'', another project undertaken by Project Reason, has the following as its mission statement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to announce that Project Reason has joined Hitchens and Dawkins (both of whom sit on our advisory board) in an effort to end the "diplomatic immunity" which the Vatican claims protects the Pope from any responsibility. We would greatly appreciate your support in this cause.  All donations are tax-deductible in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418141200/http://www.project-reason.org/vatican_justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Secular Islam Sub-Project==

One of the most active sub-projects in Project Reason is the ''Secular Islam'' sub-project, with several initiatives falling under it.

One project within Secular Islam is titled "Modern Developments in Koranic Criticism: Christmas in the Koran" with the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This project is being run by foundation advisor Ibn Warraq and takes as its focus the pioneering work in Syriac and Arabic linguistics of Christof Luxenberg. Luxenberg is a native Arab speaker and linguist, living in the West and writing under a pseudonym. Luxenberg's work has given new impetus to the discipline of Koranic studies, largely by revealing that many acknowledged obscurities in the Koran can be clarified by treating certain passages as a poor translations of Syriac into Arabic.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418132933/http://www.project-reason.org/secular_islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Secular Islam sub-project supports other projects, such as ''The Institute for Research on Early Islamic History and the Koran'', having funded their conferences in 2008, 2012, and 2014. It pledges collaboration with the Ayaan Hirsi Ali Foundation, supports the Ex-Muslims of North America, and the Quilliam Foundation.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

'''Qadariyah''' (or '''Qadariya''') is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted that humans possess free will, whose exercise makes them responsible for their actions, justifying divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Qadariyyah|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-1901|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the [[Mu'tazili]]s and rejected by the [[Ash'ari]]s.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah/&gt;

Qadariya was one of the first philosophical schools in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;History of Syria including Lebanon and Palestine, by Philip K. Hitti, pg. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest document associated with the movement is the ''Risala'' by [[Hasan al-Basri]], which was composed between 75/694 and 80/699, though debates about free will in Islam probably predate this text.&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sunni sources, the Qadariyah were censured by [[Muhammad]] himself by being compared to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], who likewise deny [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The vision of Islam|date=1994|publisher=Paragon House|isbn=9781557785169|page=258|author=Sachiko Murata, [[William Chittick]]|edition=illustrated|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported in [[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: 
Narrated [[Abdullah ibn Umar]]: The Prophet said, "The Qadariyyah are the [[Magi|Magians]] of this community. If they are ill, do not pay a sick visit to them, and if they die, do not attend their funerals."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: Model Behavior of the Prophet (Kitab Al-Sunnah): Book 40: Hadith 4674.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic aspects==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
The cultural keyword ''qì'' is analyzable in terms of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]]. Possible [[etymologies]] include the [[logograph]]s 氣, 气, and 気 with various [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] ranging from "vapor" to "anger", and the [[English language|English]] [[loanword]] ''qi'' or ''ch'i''.

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The logograph 氣 is read with two Chinese pronunciations, the usual ''qì'' 氣 "air; vital energy" and the rare archaic ''xì'' 氣 "to present food" (later disambiguated with 餼).

Pronunciations of 氣 in modern [[varieties of Chinese]] with standardized [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents include: [[Standard Chinese]] ''qì''   /t͡ɕʰi⁵¹/, [[Wu Chinese]] ''qi''   /t͡ɕʰi³⁴/, [[Southern Min]] ''khì'' /kʰi²¹/, [[Eastern Min]] ''ké'' /kʰɛi²¹³/, [[Standard Cantonese]] ''hei&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' /hei̯³³/, and [[Hakka Chinese]] ''hi'' /hi⁵⁵/.

Pronunciations of 氣 in Sino-Xenic borrowings include: [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''ki'', [[Korean language|Korean]] ''gi'', and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''khi''.

Reconstructions of the [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /kʰe̯i&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/  ([[Bernard Karlgren]]), /kʰĭəi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]]), /kʰiəi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]]), /kʰɨj&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Edwin Pulleyblank]]), and /kʰɨi&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;/ ([[Zhengzhang Shangfang]]).

Reconstructions of the [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /*kʰɯds/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang) and /*C.qʰəp-s/ ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]]).

The etymology of ''qì'' interconnects with [[Kharia language|Kharia]] ''kʰis'' "anger", [[Sora language|Sora]] ''kissa'' "move with great effort", [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ''kʰɛs'' "strive after; endeavor", and [[Gyalrongic languages|Gyalrongic]] ''kʰɐs'' "anger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuessler|first1=Axel|title=ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824829759|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIvqAC7FNBQC|accessdate=5 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
In the [[East Asian languages]], ''qì'' has three logographs:
*[[wikt:氣|氣]] is the [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese character]], Korean ''[[hanja]]'', and Japanese ''[[kyūjitai]]'' ("old character form") ''[[kanji]]''
*[[wikt:気|気]] is the Japanese ''[[shinjitai]]'' ("new character form") ''kanji''
*[[wikt:气|气]] is the [[simplified Chinese character]].
In addition, ''qì'' [[wikt:炁|炁]] is an uncommon character especially used in writing [[Fulu|Daoist talismans]]. Historically, the word ''qì'' was generally written as 气 until the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), when it was replaced by the 氣 graph clarified with ''mǐ'' [[wikt:米|米]] "rice" indicating "steam (rising from rice as it cooks.)"

This primary logograph 气, the earliest written character for ''qì,'' consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600–1046 BCE) [[oracle bone script]], [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronzeware script]] and [[large seal script]], and [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE) [[small seal script]]. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts logographs 气  were used in ancient times as a [[phonetic loan character]] to write ''qǐ'' 乞 "plead for; beg; ask" which did not have an early character.

The vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as [[Phono-semantic compound|radical-phonetic characters]]. Such characters combine a semantically suggestive "[[radical (Chinese character)|radical characters]]" with a phonetic element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word ''dào'' [[wikt:道|道]] "the [[Tao|Dao]]; the way" graphically combines the [[Radical 162|"walk" radical]] 辶 with a ''shǒu'' 首 "head" phonetic. Although the modern ''dào'' and ''shǒu'' pronunciations are dissimilar, the [[Old Chinese]] ''*lˤuʔ-s'' 道 and ''*l̥uʔ-s'' 首 were alike. The [[regular script]] character ''qì'' [[wikt:氣|氣]] is unusual because ''qì'' [[wikt:气|气]] is both the [[Radical 84|"air radical"]] and the phonetic, with ''mǐ'' 米 "rice" semantically indicating "steam; vapor".

This ''qì'' 气 "air/gas radical" was only used in a few native Chinese characters like ''yīnyūn'' 氤氲 "thick mist/smoke", but was also used to create new scientific [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages#Chinese|characters for gaseous chemical elements]]. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: ''fú'' 氟 (with a ''fú'' 弗 phonetic) "[[fluorine]]" and ''nǎi'' 氖 (with a ''nǎi'' 乃 phonetic) "[[neon]]". Others are based on semantics: ''qīng'' 氫 (with a ''jīng'' 巠 phonetic, abbreviating ''qīng'' 輕 "light-weight") "[[hydrogen]] (the lightest element)" and ''lǜ'' 氯 (with a ''lù'' 彔 phonetic, abbreviating ''lǜ'' 綠 "green") "(greenish-yellow) [[chlorine]]".

''Qì'' 氣 is the phonetic element in a few characters such as ''kài'' 愾 "hate" with the [[Radical 61|"heart-mind radical"]] 忄or 心, ''xì'' 熂 "set fire to weeds" with the [[Radical 86|"fire radical"]] 火, and ''xì'' 餼 "to present food" with the [[Radical 184|"food radical"]] 食.

The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''(121 CE) notes that the primary ''qì'' 气 is a [[Chinese character classification#Pictograms|pictographic character]] depicting 雲气 "cloudy vapors", and that the full 氣 combines 米 "rice" with the phonetic ''qi'' 气, meaning 饋客芻米 "present provisions to guests" (later disambiguated as ''xì'' 餼).

===Meanings===
Qi is a [[polysemous]] word. The unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' defines it as "present food or provisions" for the ''xì'' pronunciation but also lists 23 meanings for the ''qì'' pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mair|first1=Victor H.|title=An Alphabetical Index to the Hanyu Da Cidian|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0824828165|page=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary,'' which enters ''xì'' 餼 "grain; animal feed; make a present of food", and a ''qì'' 氣 entry with seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for [[bound morphemes]], and three equivalents for the verb. &lt;blockquote&gt;'''n.''' ① air; gas ② smell ③ spirit; vigor; morale ④ vital/material energy (in Ch[inese] metaphysics) ⑤ tone; atmosphere; attitude ⑥ anger ⑦ breath; respiration '''b.f.''' ① weather 天氣 ''tiānqì'' ② [linguistics] aspiration 送氣 ''sòngqì'' '''v.''' ① anger ② get angry ③ bully; insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Defrancis|first1=John|last2=Yuqing|first2=Bai|title=ABC Chinese-English Dictionary|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0824821548|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===English borrowing===
Qi was an early [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese loanword]] in English. It was [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as ''k'i'' in [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|Church Romanization]] in the early-19th century, as ''ch'i'' in [[Wade–Giles]] in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled ''chi'' omitting the apostrophe), and as qi in [[Pinyin]] in the mid-20th century. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entry for ''qi'' gives the pronunciation as [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] (tʃi), the etymology from Chinese ''qì'' "air; breath", and a definition of "The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle." It also gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of ''k'í'' in 1850 (''[[The Chinese Repository]]''),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quoting [[Confucius]] that the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' or "Great Extreme is the primordial substance (''k'í'') which, moving along, divided and made two ''k'í''; that which in itself has motion is the ''Yang'', and that which had rest .‥ is the ''Yin''."&lt;/ref&gt; of ''ch'i'' in 1917 (''[[The Encyclopaedia Sinica]]''),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The essence of the ethical principle ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Li]]'' "is absolutely pure and good, but seeing that it is inseparable from the material element ''Ch'i''.‥ it is from Man's birth to a greater or less extent impeded and tainted."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''qi'' in 1971 ([[Felix Mann]]'s ''Acupuncture'')&lt;ref group=note&gt;"To the ancients the cornerstone of the theory of acupuncture, the concept whereby they explained its effects and action, was ''Qi'', the energy of life."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
References to concepts analogous to qi are found in many Asian belief systems. Philosophical conceptions of qi from the earliest records of [[Chinese philosophy]] (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of [[humours]], the ancient Hindu [[yoga|yogic]] concept of ''[[prana]]'', and the traditional Jewish concept of ''[[Animal soul|nefesh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mitzvot of Health and Exercise|url=http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/healthexercise.pdf|website=KoshaTorah.com|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of qi comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher [[Mencius]] (4th century BCE).

{{quotation|Within the framework of Chinese thought, no notion may attain such a degree of abstraction from empirical data as to correspond perfectly to one of our modern universal concepts. Nevertheless, the term ''qi'' comes as close as possible to constituting a generic designation equivalent to our word "energy". When Chinese thinkers are unwilling or unable to fix the quality of an energetic phenomenon, the character ''qi'' (氣) inevitably flows from their brushes.|Manfred Porkert&lt;ref name="Porkert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porkert|first1=Manfred|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine: Systems of Correspondence|date=1974|publisher=M.I.T. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0262160582|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}}}

The ancient Chinese described qi as "life force". They believed it permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. Qi was also linked to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive functioning unit. By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.

Although the concept has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of qi have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, the Chinese had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. Qi and ''li'' (理: "pattern") were 'fundamental' categories similar to matter and energy.

Fairly early on{{when|date=November 2017}}, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of qi—the coarsest and heaviest fractions formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the "lifebreath" that animated living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions and brief historical notes on such concepts can be found in Wei Zhengtong's "Zhong Guo Zhexue Cidian", Da Lin Publishing Company, Taipei, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yuán qì]]'' is a notion of innate or prenatal qi which is distinguished from acquired qi that a person may develop over their lifetime.

==Philosophical roots==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=November 2017}}
}}
The earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed. In the [[Analects]] of [[Confucius]] qi could mean "breath".&lt;ref name="Confucius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Legge|first1=James|title=The Analects of Confucius|date=2010|publisher=Floating Press|location=Auckland|isbn=978-1775417958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining it with the Chinese word for [[blood]] (making 血氣, ''xue''–''qi'', blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics:

{{quotation|The [morally] noble man guards himself against 3 things. When he is young, his ''xue''–''qi'' has not yet stabilized, so he guards himself against sexual passion. When he reaches his prime, his ''xue''–''qi'' is not easily subdued, so he guards himself against combativeness. When he reaches old age, his ''xue''–''qi'' is already depleted, so he guards himself against acquisitiveness.|Confucius|Analects, 16:7}}

The philosopher [[Mozi]] used the word qi to refer to noxious vapors that would in eventually arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth.&lt;ref name="Mozi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Burton|title=Mozi: Basic Writings|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231130011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that troubled them when they lived in caves.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt; He also associated maintaining one's qi with providing oneself with adequate nutrition.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt; In regard to another kind of qi, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing qi (clouds) in the sky.&lt;ref name="Mozi"/&gt;

[[Mencius]] described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual's vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower.&lt;ref name="Mencius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lau|first1=D. C.|title=Mencius|date=2003|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-9622018518|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} When properly nurtured, this qi was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt; It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one's moral capacities.&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt; On the other hand, the qi of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.&lt;ref name="Mencius"/&gt;

Living things were not the only things believed to have qi. [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] indicated that [[wind]] is the ''qi'' of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Burton|title=The Complete Works of Zhuangzi|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231536509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, cosmic [[yin and yang]] "are the greatest of qi{{-"}}.&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt; He described qi as "issuing forth" and creating profound effects.&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt; He also said "Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of ''qi''. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one ''qi'' that connects and pervades everything in the world."&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt;

Another passage traces life to intercourse between Heaven and Earth: "The highest Yin is the most restrained. The highest Yang is the most exuberant. The restrained comes forth from Heaven. The exuberant issues forth from Earth. The two intertwine and penetrate forming a harmony, and [as a result] things are born."&lt;ref name="Zhuangzi"/&gt;

The [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] essay ''[[Neiye]]'' (Inward Training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor ''[qi]'' and [[meditation]] techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loewe|first1=Michael|last2=Shaughnessy|first2=Edward L.|title=The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC.|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521470308|page=880|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&amp;dq=cambridge++history+of+ancient+china&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Zi]], another Confucian scholar of the [[Jixia Academy]], followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, "Fire and water have ''qi'' but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have ''yi'' (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have ''qi'', life, perceptivity, and ''yi''." Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of [[radiant energy]], but they were aware that one can be heated by a [[campfire]] from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming "''qi''" radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses "''qi''" to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.

Among the animals, the [[gibbon]] and the [[crane (bird)|crane]] were considered experts at inhaling the ''qi''. The Confucian scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (ca. 150 BC) wrote in [[Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guilk|first1=Robert van|authorlink=Robert van Gulik|title=The Gibbon in China: An Essay in Chinese Animal Lore|date=2015|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=|isbn=978-7547507391|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing." ("猿似猴。大而黑。長前臂。所以壽八百。好引氣也。")

Later, the [[syncretic]] text assembled under the direction of [[Liu An]], the [[Huainanzi|Huai Nan Zi]], or "Masters of Huainan", has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]]:

{{quote|Heaven (seen here as the ultimate source of all being) falls (''duo'' 墮, i.e., descends into proto-immanence) as the formless. Fleeting, fluttering, penetrating, amorphous it is, and so it is called the Supreme Luminary. The ''dao'' begins in the Void Brightening. The Void Brightening produces the universe (''yu''–''zhou''). The universe produces ''qi''. ''Qi'' has bounds. The clear, yang ''[qi]'' was ethereal and so formed heaven. The heavy, turbid ''[qi]'' was congealed and impeded and so formed earth. The conjunction of the clear, yang ''[qi]'' was fluid and easy. The conjunction of the heavy, turbid ''[qi]'' was strained and difficult. So heaven was formed first and earth was made fast later. The pervading essence (''xi''–''jing'') of heaven and earth becomes yin and yang. The concentrated (''zhuan'') essences of yin and yang become the four seasons. The dispersed (''san'') essences of the four seasons become the myriad creatures. The hot ''qi'' of yang in accumulating produces fire. The essence (''jing'') of the fire-''qi'' becomes the sun. The cold ''qi'' of yin in accumulating produces water. The essence of the water-''qi'' becomes the moon. The essences produced by coitus (yin) of the sun and moon become the stars and celestial markpoints (''chen'', planets).|Huai-nan-zi|3:1a/19}}

==Role in traditional Chinese medicine==
The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' ''(''"The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine", circa 2nd century BCE) is historically credited with first establishing the pathways, called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], through which qi circulates in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Deng|last2=Shuanli|first2=Zhu|last3=Hai|first3=Deng|title=Generalized Quanta Wave with Qi on Traditional Chinese Medecine|journal=Journal of Mathematical Medicine|date=1 January 2002|volume=15|issue=4|url=http://caod.oriprobe.com/articles/4807704/Generalized_Quanta_Wave_with_Qi_on_Traditional_Chinese_Medecine.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veith|first1=Ilza|last2=Rose|first2=Ken|title=Huang ti nei ching su wên = The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520229365|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson-Wood|first1=Denis|last2=Lawson-Wood|first2=Joyce|title=Acupuncture Handbook|date=1983|publisher=Health Science Press|pages=4, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing|date=November 2015}}

In traditional Chinese medicine, [[symptom]]s of various illnesses are believed to be either the product of disrupted, blocked, and unbalanced ''qi'' movement through meridians or deficiencies and imbalances of qi in the [[Zang Fu theory|''Zang Fu'' organs]].&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"/&gt; Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of ''qi'' using a variety of techniques including [[herbology]], [[food therapy]], physical training regimens ([[qigong]], [[t'ai chi ch'uan]], and other [[martial arts]] training),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wu|first=Kung-tsao|title=Wu Family T'ai Chi Ch'uan (吳家太極拳)|publisher=Chien-ch’uan T’ai-chi Ch’uan Association|origyear=1980|year=2006|isbn=978-0978049904|title-link=Jianquan Taijiquan Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} [[moxibustion]], ''[[tui na]]'', or [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name="Lawson-Wood"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

The [[nomenclature]] of Qi in the human body is different depending on its sources, roles, and locations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.orientmama.com/journal/what-is-qi-in-chinese-medicine|title=What is Qi in Chinese medicine?|last=|first=|date=Apr 23, 2018|website=The Journal of Chinese Medicine on Orient Mama|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sources there is a difference between so-called "Primordial Qi" (acquired at birth from one's parents) and Qi acquired throughout one's life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Or again Chinese medicine differentiates between Qi acquired from the air we breathe (so called "Clean Air") and Qi acquired from food and drinks (so-called "Grain Qi"). Looking at roles Qi is divided into "Defensive Qi" and "Nutritive Qi".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Defensive Qi's role is to defend the body against invasions while Nutritive Qi's role is to provide sustenance for the body. Lastly, looking at locations, Qi is also named after the [[Zang-fu|Zang-Fu organ]] or the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|Meridian]] in which it resides:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Liver Qi", "Spleen Qi", etc.

A qi field (''chu-chong'') refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes. A qi field is believed to be produced by visualization and affirmation. They are an important component of [[Wisdom Healing Qigong|Wisdom Healing'Qigong]] (''Zhineng Qigong''), founded by Grandmaster Ming Pang.&lt;ref name="Gu"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gu|first1=Mingtong|title=Wisdom Healing (Zhineng) Qigong: Cultivating Wisdom and Energy for Health, Healing and Happiness|date=2011|location=Petaluma, California|isbn=978-0983504306|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gu2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gu|first1=Mingtong|title=An Introduction to Wisdom Healing Qigong|date=2009|location=Petaluma, California|pages=30, 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing}}&lt;ref name="Ooi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hin|first1=Ooi Kean|title=Zhineng Qigong: The Science, Theory and Practice|date=2010|publisher=CreateSpace|location=North Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=9781453867600}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}

==Comparable concepts==
Concepts similar to qi can be found in many cultures.

===Religious beliefs===
''[[Prana]]'' in [[Hinduism]] and [[Indian culture]], ''[[Odinani#Chi|chi]]'' in the [[Odinani|Igbo]] religion, ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' in [[ancient Greece]], ''[[mana]]'' in [[Hawaiian culture]], ''[[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lüng]]'' in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], ''[[manitou]]'' in the culture of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], ''[[Ruach|ruah]]'' in [[Jewish culture]]. In [[Western philosophy]], notions of ''[[Potentiality and actuality|energeia]]'', ''[[élan vital]]'', or [[vitalism]] are purported to be similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|accessdate=27 January 2018|issn=2161-0002|oclc=956196260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the ''qi'' concept can be found in the term 'energy' when used in the context of various [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] forms of spirituality and [[alternative medicine]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Popular culture===
Elements of the concept of Qi can also be found in Eastern and Western [[popular culture]]:

* In the [[manga]] ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and the video game series ''[[Tekken]]'', Qi is depicted as something that can be visibly seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hillard|first1=Kyle|title=Developers (And Others) Share Their Appreciation And Dream Games For The Dragon Ball Franchise|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/10/20/developers-and-others-share-their-appreciation-for-the-dragon-ball-franchise.aspx|website=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021011253/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/10/20/developers-and-others-share-their-appreciation-for-the-dragon-ball-franchise.aspx|archivedate=21 October 2017|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Parallels with Qi can be seen with the concept of "[[the Force]] " in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=John M.|title=The Tao of Star Wars|date=2002|publisher=Humanics|location=Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=9780893343859|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} and the related [[Jediism]], a religion based on the [[Jedi]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Scientific view==
Qi is a non-scientific, unverifiable concept.&lt;ref name="Lee_SR"/&gt; A 1997 consensus statement on acupuncture by the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] noted that concepts such as qi "are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information".&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: Acupuncture |publisher=Consensus.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 [[Skeptoid|Skeptoid podcast]] episode titled "Your Body's Alleged Energy Fields" related a [[Reiki]] practitioner's report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject's body:

{{quote|text=What we'll be looking for here, within John's auric field, is any areas of intense heat, unusual coldness, a repelling energy, a dense energy, a magnetizing energy, tingling sensations, or actually the body attracting the hands into that area where it needs the reiki energy, and balancing of John's qi.&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;}}

Evaluating these claims,  author and [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptic]] [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] reported:

{{quote|text=...his aura, his qi, his reiki energy. None of these have any counterpart in the physical world. Although she attempted to describe their properties as heat or magnetism, those properties are already taken by – well, heat and magnetism. There are no properties attributable to the mysterious field she describes, thus it cannot be authoritatively said to exist.&lt;ref name = Dunning/&gt;}}

==Practices involving qi==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

===Feng shui===
{{Main|Feng shui}}
The traditional Chinese art of [[geomancy]], the placement and arrangement of space called [[feng shui]], is based on calculating the balance of qi, interactions between the [[Wu Xing|five elements]], [[yin and yang]], and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck, and many other aspects of the occupants. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it. This is said to influence the energy level of the occupants.

One use for a ''[[luopan]]'' is to detect the flow of qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Field|first1=Stephen L.|title=Qimancy, Chinese Divination by Qi|url=http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html|website=Professor Field's Fengshui Gate|accessdate=7 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html|archivedate=23 February 2017|date=12 February 1998|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of qi may rise and fall over time. Feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of [[divination]] that assesses the quality of the local environment.

===Qigong===
{{Main|Qigong}}
Qìgōng (气功 or 氣功) involves coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness. It is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi. With roots in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], ''qigong'' is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a ''qigong'' practice involves rhythmic breathing, slow and stylized movement, a [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindful]] state, and visualization of guiding qi.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Kenneth S.|last2=Dossey|first2=Larry|title=The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healin|date=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345421098|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref name="Liang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liang|first1=Master Shou-Yu|last2=Wu|first2=Wen-Ching|last3=Breiter-Wu|first3=Denise|title=Qigong Empowerment: A Guide to Medical, Taoist, Buddhist, and Wushu Energy Cultivation|date=1997|publisher=Way of the Dragon Publishing|location=East Providence, Rhode Island|isbn=978-1889659022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jwing-Ming"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jwing-Ming|first1=Yang|title=Qigong for Health and Martial Arts: Exercises and Meditation|date=1998|publisher=YMAA Publication Center|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1886969575|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2017}}

===Martial arts===

Demonstrations of ''qi'' or ''ki'' are popular in some [[martial arts]] and may include the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. Some of these feats can alternatively be explained using [[biomechanics]] and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Daniel Arthur|title=Unraisable Body: The Physics of Martial Arts|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29458989|publisher=Sports Medicine Australia|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=27 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acupuncture and moxibustion===
{{Main|Acupuncture|Moxibustion}}

[[Acupuncture]] is a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] that involves insertion of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at [[acupuncture point]]s to balance the flow of qi. This is often accompanied by [[moxibustion]], a treatment that involves burning [[mugwort]] on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9454">In [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitutional law]], '''rational basis review''' is the normal [[standard of review]] that courts apply when considering constitutional questions, including [[Due Process of Law|due process]] or [[Equal Protection|equal protection]] questions under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law  is "rationally related" to a "legitimate"  government interest, whether real or hypothetical.&lt;ref name="law.cornell"&gt;"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis Rational Basis.]" Cornell University Law School. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The higher levels of scrutiny are [[intermediate scrutiny]] and [[strict scrutiny]]. Heightened scrutiny is applied where a [[suspect classification|suspect or quasi-suspect classification]] is involved, or a [[Fundamental right#American Constitutional Law|fundamental right]] is implicated.&lt;ref name="law.cornell" /&gt;

In United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, the nature of the interest at issue determines the level of scrutiny applied by appellate courts. When courts engage in rational basis review, only the most egregious enactments, those not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, are overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured Patients &amp; Families Compensation Fund, 2018 WI 78, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ NW2d ___, |pages=78 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rational+Basis+Test Rational Basis Test.]" The Free Dictionary.

Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Rational basis review tests whether the government's actions are "rationally related" to a "legitimate" government interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 144 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-rubysachs/equal-potection-in-florid_b_147325.html |work=Huffington Post |title=Equal Protection in Florida |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has never set forth standards for determining what constitutes a legitimate government interest.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Nollan v. California Coastal Commission]]'', 483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Under rational basis review, it is "entirely irrelevant" what end the government is actually seeking and statutes can be based on "rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data."&lt;ref&gt;''FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc''. 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a "legitimate" interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kathleen M. &amp; Gunther Gerald. ''Constitutional Law''. Foundation Press, New York, NY. 16th Ed. Chapter 9 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Judges following the Supreme Court's instructions understand themselves to be "obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating" challenged laws if the government is unable to justify its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;''Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto'', 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, "The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law," by Harvard law professor [[James Bradley Thayer]]. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is "so clear that it is not open to rational question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner |first1=Richard A.|title=The Rise and Fall of Judicial Self-Restraint|journal=California Law Review|date=2012|volume=100|issue=3|pages=519, 522|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=californialawreview|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', arguing that "the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law."

However, the court's extensive application of economic substantive due process during [[Lochner era|the years following Lochner]] meant that Holmes' proposed doctrine of judicial deference to state interest was not immediately adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Indest, Miles O. "Walking Dead: The Fifth Circuit Resurrects Rational Basis Review." ''Tulane Law Review'' 88.5 (2014): 993–1005. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until ''[[Nebbia v. New York]]'' that the Court began to formally apply rational basis review, when it stated that "a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose." In ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' the Court in [[Footnote Four]] left open the possibility that laws that seem to be within "a specific prohibition of the Constitution," which restrict the political process, or which burden "[[discrete and insular minorities]]" might receive more exacting review. Today, such laws receive [[strict scrutiny]], whereas laws implicating  [[unenumerated rights]] that the Supreme Court has not recognized as [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] receive rational basis review.

==Applicability==
In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both [[federal law]] and [[state law]] (via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]).  This test also applies to both [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] action whether those actions be of a [[substantive due process|substantive]] or [[procedural due process|procedural]] nature.

The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, &amp; Kenneth R. Thomas, co-eds., ''The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', by [[Congressional Research Service]], [[Library of Congress]] (Senate Document No. 108-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc. 2004) (short title: ''[[Congressional Research Service reports#How to access CRS Reports|Constitution Annotated]]''), pp. 1906–1910 (pp. 242–246 per Adobe Acrobat Reader) ([http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf ''Fourteenth Amendment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810025118/http://www.gpoaccess.gov//constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf |date=2010-08-10 }}, [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/001-Title.pdf title page (p.

Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620 (1996) at 635&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the concept of rational basis review, it is easier to understand what it is not. Rational basis review is ''not'' a genuine effort to determine the legislature's actual reasons for enacting a statute, nor to inquire into whether a statute does in fact further a legitimate end of government. A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical non sequitur. In 2008, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] reaffirmed the lenient nature of rational basis review in a [[concurring opinion]]: "[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, [[Thurgood Marshall]], remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;''New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres'', 552 U.S. 196, ___ (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shanti Sena''' or "Peace army" was made up of [[Gandhi]]'s [[non-violence|non-violent]] followers in India.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;Thomas Weber: Gandhi's Peace Army: The Shanti Sena and Unarmed Peacekeeping, Syracuse Univ Pr.1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Other movements have developed, inspired by this one, sometimes also using the name used by Gandhi's group.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt; These may include [[World Peace Brigade]], [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]], [[Swaraj Peeth]], the organisation [[Peace Brigades International]] and participants in the [[Rainbow Gathering]], and have served as a basis for the practice of [[Third Party Non-violent Intervention]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

"Shanti Sena" is a term first coined by Gandhi when he conceptualized a nonviolent volunteer peacekeeping program dedicated to minimizing communal violence within the Indian populace. The words "Shanti" and "Sena" both come from [[Sanskrit]]. Shanti means peace and Sena means army, or a drilled band of men. The word "Sena" has been criticized for its connection to militarism, but for Gandhi, it had strong metaphorical and spiritual qualities connected to its use in the Hindu [[vedas]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In the aftermath of the Gandhian era, Shanti Sena has appeared in various incarnations. Two Gandhian followers developed separate groups based on their interpretations of it: [[Vinoba Bhave]] established a Shanti Sena that prioritized Gandhi's spiritual approach towards the program, while JP established a program that focused more on the political motivations of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber: The Shanti Sena: Philosophy, History and Action, Orient Blackswan, New Delhi 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanti Sena program also became institutionalized into India's [[Gandhigram Rural University]], where it was incorporated into the university's constitution. Currently Shanti Sena is also very active in Sri Lanka as a part of the organization [[Sarvodaya]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

'''Simulink''', developed by [[MathWorks]], is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain [[dynamical systems]]. Its primary interface is a [[visual modeling|graphical block diagramming tool]] and a customizable set of block [[library (computer science)|libraries]]. It offers tight integration with the rest of the [[MATLAB]] environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in [[automatic control]] and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and [[Model-based design|Model-Based Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | title = The Successful development process with MATLAB Simulink in the framework of ESA's ATV project | format = PDF | publisher = Vega Group PLC | accessdate = 2011-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191512/http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/2010-01-1999/|title=Model Based Design Accelerates the Development of Mechanical Locomotive Controls|work=sae.org|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Add-on products ==
MathWorks and other third-party hardware and software products can be used with Simulink. For example, [[Stateflow]] extends Simulink with a design environment for developing [[state machines]] and [[Flowchart|flow charts]].

[[MathWorks]] claims that, coupled with another of their products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_3|title=Automatic Code Generation - Simulink Coder|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink can [[automatic code generation|automatically generate]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] for [[real-time computing|real-time]] implementation of systems. As the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves, this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1296h/1296%20(Denney).pdf A Software Safety Certification Plug-in for Automated Code Generators: Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/general-motors-developed-twomode-hybrid-powertrain-with-mathworks-modelbased-design-cut-24-months-of.html|title=Green Car Congress: General Motors Developed Two-Mode Hybrid Powertrain With MathWorks Model-Based Design; Cut 24 Months Off Expected Dev Time|author=BioAge Media|work=greencarcongress.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being a tool for [[embedded system]] design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Embedded Coder creates code efficient enough for use in embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techsource.com.sg/eresources/eres_storyDetails.asp?stid=10 Lotus Engineering Develops Control Systems Software to Reduce Diesel Emissions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf A Comparison of Three Code Generators for Models Created in Simulink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811055925/http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018215921/http://automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 2007|title=Multitarget modeling reduces ECU software costs|work=EETimes|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulink Real-Time (formerly known as xPC Target), together with x86-based real-time systems, is an environment for simulating and testing Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.  Another MathWorks product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_5|title=Code Generation - Embedded Coder - Simulink|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supports specific embedded targets.  When used with other generic products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/products/slhdlcoder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_6 HDL Coder]&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink and [[Stateflow]] can automatically generate [[logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Matlab.family.png|300px|left|Matlab product family]] --&gt;

Simulink Verification and Validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking, [[requirements traceability]] and model coverage analysis. Simulink Design Verifier uses [[formal methods]] to identify design errors like [[integer overflow]], [[division by zero]] and dead logic, and generates test case scenarios for [[model checking]] within the Simulink environment.

[[SimEvents]] is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the Simulink environment, and to add an event-based simulation engine to the time-based simulation engine in Simulink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation | last=Cassandras| first=Christos | publisher= Springer US | date=2007-11-27 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g82w56/?v=editorial| accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore in Simulink any type of simulation can be done and the model can be simulated at any point in this environment.

Different type of blocks can be accessed using the Simulink library browser. And therefore the benefit could be taken out from this environment efficiently.

The societal [[Impact of nanotechnology|impact]] of [[nanotechnology]] are the potential benefits and challenges that the introduction of novel nanotechnological devices and materials may hold for [[society]] and human interaction.  The term is sometimes expanded to also include nanotechnology's [[Health impact of nanotechnology|health]] and [[Environmental impact of nanotechnology|environmental impact]], but this article will only consider the social and political impact of nanotechnology.

As nanotechnology is an emerging field and most of its applications are still speculative, there is much debate about what positive and negative effects that nanotechnology might have.

==Overview==
Beyond the toxicity risks to human health and the environment which are associated with first-generation nanomaterials, nanotechnology has broader societal implications and poses broader social challenges. Social scientists have suggested that nanotechnology's social issues should be understood and assessed not simply as "downstream" risks or impacts.  Rather, the challenges should be factored into "upstream" research and decision making in order to ensure technology development that meets social objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Kearnes| first =Matthew| last2 =Grove-White| first2 =Robin| last3 =Macnaghten|first3 =Phil|last4 =Wilsdon|first4 =James|last5 =Wynne|first5=Brian |publication-date = December 2006| title =From Bio to Nano: Learning Lessons from the UK Agricultural Biotechnology Controversy| volume =15| issue= 4| series =Science as Culture| publisher = Routledge| doi =10.1080/09505430601022619| pages= 291–307| url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content?content=10.1080/09505430601022619 |accessdate =2007-10-19| year =2006| journal =Science as Culture| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social scientists and organizations in civil society suggest that [[technology assessment]] and governance should also involve public participation&lt;ref&gt;[http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/docs/nano%20project%20sci%20com%20proofs%20nov05.pdf] Nanotechnology,
Governance, and Public Deliberation: What Role for the Social Sciences? - (Science Communication Volume 27 Number 2 December 2005 1-24 © 2005 Sage Publications 10.1177/1075547005281531)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanolabweb.com/index.cfm/action/main.default.viewArticle/articleID/135/CFID/60255/CFTOKEN/45212442/ Nanotechnology Law &amp; Business]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/CSDBUlletinMohr.pdf] - The Royal Society Report on Nanotechnology and Related Debates in 
the UK: a Participatory Governance Perspective Alison Mohr - Research Fellow )Centre for the Study of Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale Demos | Publications | Governing at the Nanoscale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers suggest that nanotechnology will build incrementally, as did the 18-19th century [[industrial revolution]], until it gathers pace to drive a nanotechnological revolution that will radically reshape our economies, our labor markets, international trade, international relations, social structures, civil liberties, our relationship with the natural world and even what we understand to be human. Others suggest that it may be more accurate to describe change driven by nanotechnology as a “technological [[tsunami]]”. Just like a tsunami, analysts warn that rapid nanotechnology-driven change will necessarily have profound disruptive impacts. As the APEC Center for Technology Foresight observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If nanotechnology is going to revolutionize manufacturing, health care, energy supply, communications and probably defense, then it will transform labour and the workplace, the medical system, the transportation and power infrastructures and the military. None of these latter will be changed without significant social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819180108/http://www.apecforesight.org/php/publication/download1.php?pub_id=5 Publication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those concerned with the negative impact of nanotechnology suggest that it will simply exacerbate problems stemming from existing socio-economic inequity and unequal distributions of power, creating greater inequities between rich and poor through an inevitable nano-divide (the gap between those who control the new nanotechnologies and those whose products, services or labour are displaced by them). Analysts suggest the possibility that nanotechnology has the potential to destabilize international relations through a nano arms race and the increased potential for [[bioweapon]]ry; thus, providing the tools for ubiquitous surveillance with significant implications for [[civil liberties]]. Also, many critics believe it might break down the barriers between life and non-life through [[nanobiotechnology]], redefining even what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcgroup.org/en/materials/publications.html?pub_id=104 ETC Group - Publications - The Little Big Down: A Small Introduction to Nano-scale Technologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nano.foe.org.au/node/168{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanoethicists posit that such a transformative technology could exacerbate the divisions of rich and poor – the so-called “nano divide.” However nanotechnology makes the production of technology, e.g. computers, cellular phones, health technology etcetera, cheaper and therefore accessible to the poor.

In fact, many of the most enthusiastic proponents of nanotechnology, such as transhumanists, see the nascent science as a mechanism to changing human nature itself – going beyond curing disease and enhancing human characteristics.  Discussions on nanoethics have been hosted by the federal government, especially in the context of “converging technologies” – a catch-phrase used to refer to nano, biotech, information technology, and cognitive science.

==Possible military applications==
Possible military applications of nanotechnology have been suggested in the fields of soldier enhancement ([http://web.mit.edu/ISN/]) and chemical weapons amongst others. However, more socially disruptive weapon systems are to be expected from [[molecular manufacturing]], a potential future form of nanotechnology that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045511/http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but its supporters posit that once achieved it could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; If nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Molecular manufacturing might be used to cheaply produce, among many other products, highly advanced, durable weapons. Being equipped with compact computers and motors these might be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the [[Center for Responsible Nanotechnology]] as well as Anders Sandberg from the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] the military uses of molecular manufacturing are the applications of nanotechnology that pose the most significant [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandberg|first1=Anders|title=The five biggest threats to human existence|url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=http://theconversation.com/|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers|url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing might be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION  (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=http://e-drexler.com/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Democracy_trade_and_social_stability|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5) [[wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

==Intellectual property issues==
On the structural level, critics of nanotechnology point to a new world of ownership and [[corporation|corporate]] control opened up by nanotechnology. The claim is that, just as [[biotechnology]]'s ability to manipulate [[gene]]s went hand in hand with the [[patent]]ing of life, so too nanotechnology's ability to manipulate molecules has led to the patenting of matter. The last few years has seen a gold rush to claim patents at the nanoscale. Academics have warned that the resultant [[patent thicket]] is harming progress in the technology &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Open-source nanotechnology: Solutions to a modern intellectual property tragedy | url = | journal = Nano Today | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 339–341 | doi = 10.1016/j.nantod.2013.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Usman Mushtaq and Joshua M.

Corporations are already taking out broad-ranging patents on nanoscale discoveries and inventions. For example, two corporations, [[NEC]] and [[IBM]], hold the basic patents on [[carbon nanotube]]s, one of the current cornerstones of nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of uses, and look set to become crucial to several industries from electronics and computers, to strengthened materials to drug delivery and diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are poised to become a major traded commodity with the potential to replace major conventional raw materials. However, as their use expands, anyone seeking to (legally) manufacture or sell carbon nanotubes, no matter what the application, must first buy a license from NEC or IBM. [http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1383][https://web.archive.org/web/20070929060604/http://www.ipr-nec.com/system/en/infolistcat/120/1/0/]

The United States' [[essential facilities doctrine]] may be of importance as well as other anti-trust laws.

==Potential benefits and risks for developing countries==
Nanotechnologies may provide new solutions for the millions of people in [[developing countries]] who lack access to basic services, such as safe water, reliable energy, health care, and education.  The [[United Nations]] has set [[Millennium Development Goals]] for meeting these needs.  The 2004 [[United Nations|UN]] Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation noted that some of the advantages of nanotechnology include production using little labor, land, or maintenance, high productivity, low cost, and modest requirements for materials and energy.

Many developing countries, for example Costa Rica, Chile, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia, are investing considerable resources in research and development of nanotechnologies.  Emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India and South Africa are spending millions of US dollars annually on R&amp;D, and are rapidly increasing their scientific output as demonstrated by their increasing numbers of publications in peer-reviewed scientific publications.

Potential opportunities of nanotechnologies to help address critical international development priorities include improved [[water purification]] systems, [[energy management systems|energy systems]], [[pharmaceutical technology|medicine and pharmaceuticals]], [[food production]] and nutrition, and [[information technology|information and communications technologies]].  Nanotechnologies are already incorporated in products that are on the market. Other nanotechnologies are still in the research phase, while others are concepts that are years or decades away from development.

Applying nanotechnologies in developing countries raises similar questions about the environmental, health, and societal risks described in the previous section.  Additional challenges have been raised regarding the linkages between nanotechnology and development.

Protection of the environment, human health and worker safety in developing countries often suffers from a combination of factors that can include but are not limited to lack of robust environmental, human health, and worker safety regulations; poorly or unenforced regulation which is linked to a lack of physical (e.g., equipment) and human capacity (i.e., properly trained regulatory staff).  Often, these nations require assistance, particularly financial assistance, to develop the scientific and institutional capacity to adequately assess and manage risks, including the necessary infrastructure such as laboratories and technology for detection.

Very little is known about the risks and broader impacts of nanotechnology.  At a time of great uncertainty over the impacts of nanotechnology it will be challenging for governments, companies, civil society organizations, and the general public in developing countries, as in developed countries, to make decisions about the governance of nanotechnology.

Companies, and to a lesser extent governments and universities, are receiving patents on nanotechnology.  The rapid increase in patenting of nanotechnology is illustrated by the fact that in the US, there were 500 nanotechnology patent applications in 1998 and 1,300 in 2000.  Some patents are very broadly defined, which has raised concern among some groups that the rush to patent could slow innovation and drive up costs of products, thus reducing the potential for innovations that could benefit low income populations in developing countries.

There is a clear link between commodities and poverty. Many least developed countries are dependent on a few commodities for employment, government revenue, and export earnings. Many applications of nanotechnology are being developed that could impact global demand for specific commodities.  For instance, certain nanoscale materials could enhance the strength and durability of [[rubber]], which might eventually lead to a decrease in demand for [[natural rubber]].  Other nanotechnology applications may result in increases in demand for certain commodities. For example, demand for [[titanium]] may increase as a result of new uses for nanoscale [[titanium dioxide|titanium oxides]], such as [[titanium dioxide]] nanotubes that can be used to produce and store hydrogen for use as fuel.  Various organizations have called for international dialogue on mechanisms that will allow developing countries to anticipate and proactively adjust to these changes.

In 2003, [http://www.merid.org/ Meridian Institute] began the [http://www.merid.org/nano Global Dialogue on Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks (GDNP)] to raise awareness of the opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for [[developing countries]], close the gaps within and between sectors of society to catalyze actions that address specific opportunities and risks of nanotechnology for developing countries, and identify ways that science and technology can play an appropriate role in the development process.  The GDNP has released several publicly accessible papers on nanotechnology and development, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110116/http://www.meridian-nano.org/gdnp/paper.php "Nanotechnology and the Poor: Opportunities and Risks - Closing the Gaps Within and Between Sectors of Society"]; [http://www.merid.org/nano/waterpaper/ "Nanotechnology, Water, and Development"]; and [http://www.merid.org/nano/watertechpaper/ "Overview and Comparison of Conventional and Nano-Based Water Treatment Technologies"].

===Social justice and civil liberties===
Concerns are frequently raised that the claimed benefits of nanotechnology will not be evenly distributed, and that any benefits (including technical and/or economic) associated with nanotechnology will only reach affluent nations.&lt;ref name="South"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Invernizzi N, Foladori G and Maclurcan D |title=Nanotechnology's Controversial Role for the South |journal=Science Technology and Society |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=123–148 |year= 2008 |doi=10.1177/097172180701300105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of nanotechnology research and development - and patents for nanomaterials and products - is concentrated in developed countries (including the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada and France). In addition, most patents related to nanotechnology are concentrated amongst few multinational corporations, including IBM, Micron Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=Nanotech's "Second Nature" Patents: Implications for the Global South, Communiques No. 87 and 88, March/April and May June |publisher=ETC Group |year=2005 |url=http://www.etcgroup.org/documents/Com8788SpecialPNanoMar-June05ENG.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to fears that it will be unlikely that developing countries will have access to the infrastructure, funding and human resources required to support nanotechnology research and development, and that this is likely to exacerbate such inequalities.

Producers in developing countries could also be disadvantaged by the replacement of natural products (including rubber, cotton, coffee and tea) by developments in nanotechnology. These natural products are important export crops for developing countries, and many farmers' livelihoods depend on them. It has been argued that their substitution with industrial nano-products could negatively impact the economies of developing countries, that have traditionally relied on these export crops.&lt;ref name="South" /&gt;

It is proposed that nanotechnology can only be effective in alleviating poverty and aid development "when adapted to social, cultural and local institutional contexts, and chosen and designed with the active participation by citizens right from the commencement point" (Invernizzi et al. 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;132).&lt;ref name="South" /&gt;

== Effects on laborers ==
[[Ray Kurzweil]] has speculated in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' that [[Laborer|people who work in unskilled labor jobs for a livelihood]] may become the first human workers to be displaced by the constant use of nanotechnology in the [[Employment|workplace]], noting that layoffs often affect the jobs based around the lowest technology level before attacking jobs with the highest technology level possible.&lt;ref name="raykurzweil"&gt;{{cite book

  |first = Raymond
  |authorlink = Raymond Kurzweil
  |title = The Singularity is Near
  |publisher = [[Penguin Books]]
  |year = 2005
  |isbn = 0-14-303788-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been noted that every major economic era has stimulated a global revolution both in the kinds of jobs that are available to people and the kind of training they need to achieve these jobs, and there is concern that the world's educational systems have lagged behind in preparing students for the "Nanotech Age".&lt;ref name="prweb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/08/prweb426596.htm| title = Learning to Work in the Nanotech Age| publisher = PR Web | date = 2006-08-22| accessdate = 2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been speculated that nanotechnology may give rise to [[Molecular assembler|nanofactories]] which may have superior capabilities to conventional [[factory|factories]] due to their small carbon and physical footprint on the global and regional environment.  The [[miniaturization]] and transformation of the multi-acre conventional factory into the nanofactory may not interfere with their ability to deliver a high quality product; the product may be of even greater quality due to the lack of human errors in the production stages. Nanofactory systems may use precise atomic precisioning and contribute to making superior quality products that the "[[Bulk material handling|bulk]] [[chemistry]]" method used in 20th century and early 21st currently cannot produce.  These advances might shift the computerized workforce in an even more complex direction, requiring skills in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.&lt;ref name="nanofactory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-nanofactory.htm| title = Nanofactory information | publisher = Wise Geek | accessdate = 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crnano.org/products.htm| title = Nanotechnology: Products of Molecular Engineering| publisher = Center for Responsible Nanotechnology | accessdate = 2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

In [[mathematics]], a '''ternary relation''' or '''triadic relation''' is a [[finitary relation]] in which the number of places in the relation is three.  Ternary relations may also be referred to as '''3-adic''', '''3-ary''', '''3-dimensional''', or '''3-place'''.

Just as a [[binary relation]] is formally defined as a set of ''pairs'', i.e. a subset of the [[Cartesian product]] {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} of some sets ''A'' and ''B'', so a ternary relation is a set of triples, forming a subset of the Cartesian product {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B'' × ''C''}} of three sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.

An example of a ternary relation in elementary geometry can be given on triples of points, where a triple is in the relation if the three points are [[Collinearity|collinear]]. Another geometric example can be obtained by considering triples consisting of two points and a line, where a triple is in the ternary relation if the two points determine (are [[Incidence (geometry)|incident]] with) the line.

==Examples==

===Binary functions===
{{further|Graph of a function|Binary function}}

A function {{Nowrap|''ƒ'': ''A'' × ''B'' → ''C''}} in two variables, mapping two values from sets ''A'' and ''B'', respectively, to a value in ''C'' associates to every pair (''a'',''b'') in {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} an element ''ƒ''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') in&amp;nbsp;''C''. Therefore, its graph consists of pairs of the form {{Nowrap|((''a'', ''b''), ''ƒ''(''a'', ''b''))}}. Such pairs in which the first element is itself a pair are often identified with triples. This makes the graph of ''ƒ'' a ternary relation between ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', consisting of all triples {{Nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''ƒ''(''a'', ''b''))}}, satisfying {{nowrap|''a'' in ''A''}}, {{nowrap|''b'' in ''B''}}, and {{nowrap|''ƒ''(''a'', ''b'') in ''C''.}}

Given any set ''A'' whose elements are arranged on a circle, one can define a ternary relation ''R'' on ''A'', i.e. a subset of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = {{Nowrap|''A'' × ''A'' × ''A''}}, by stipulating that {{Nowrap|''R''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} holds if and only if the elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are pairwise different and when going from ''a'' to ''c'' in a clockwise direction one passes through ''b''. For example, if ''A'' = { {{Nowrap|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}} } represents the hours on a [[clock face]], then {{Nowrap|''R''(8, 12, 4)}} holds and {{Nowrap|''R''(12, 8, 4)}} does not hold.

===Betweenness relations===

===Congruence relation===
{{Main article|Congruence modulo m}}

The ordinary congruence of arithmetics
:&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;
which holds for three integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''m'' if and only if ''m'' divides ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b'', formally may be considered as a ternary relation.  However, usually, this instead is considered as a family of [[binary relation]]s between the ''a'' and the ''b'', indexed by the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]] ''m''.  For each fixed ''m'', indeed this binary relation has some natural properties, like being an [[equivalence relation]]; while the combined ternary relation in general is not studied as one relation.

===Typing relation===
{{Main article|Simply typed lambda calculus#Typing rules}}

A ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\!:\!\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and is thus a ternary relation between contexts, terms and types.

===Schröder rules===
A ternary relation &lt;math&gt;(A,\ B,\ C)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in the [[category of relations|category of binary relations]] using [[composition of relations]] ''AB'' and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] ''AB'' ⊆ ''C''. Within the [[calculus of relations]] each relation ''A'' has a [[converse relation]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and a complement relation &lt;math&gt;\bar{A} .&lt;/math&gt; Using these [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s, [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Ernst Schröder]] showed that &lt;math&gt;(A,\ B,\ C)&lt;/math&gt;is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(\bar{C}, B^T, \bar{A})&lt;/math&gt; and also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A^T,\  \bar{C},\  \bar{B}).&lt;/math&gt; The mutual equivalences of these forms, constructed from the ternary {{nowrap|relation (''A, B, C''),}} are called the [[composition of relations#Schröder rules| Schröder rules]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]] &amp; Thomas Ströhlein (1993) ''Relations and Graphs'', pages 15–19, [[Springer books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inspection Panel''' is an independent [[accountability]] mechanism of the [[World Bank]]. It was established in September 1993 by the World Bank [[Board of Directors]], and started operations on August 1, 1994. The Panel provides a forum for people who believe that they may be adversely affected by Bank-financed operations to bring their concerns to the highest decision-making levels of the World Bank. The Panel determines whether the Bank is complying with its own policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure that Bank-financed operations provide social and environmental benefits and avoid harm to people and the environment. The Inspection Panel was the first body to promote accountability among international financial institutions through this community-led, or “bottom-up”, approach which is complementary to the “top-down” forms of accountability, such as evaluation initiated by the World Bank itself. Building on this example, other multilateral and regional financial institutions have established similar accountability mechanisms as part of broader efforts at sustainable and equitable development.

==Mandate==
The Inspection Panel's mandate allows it to investigate projects funded by the [[International Development Association|IDA]] and [[IBRD]], both part of the World Bank Group, and to determine whether they are complying with their policies and procedures in the design, appraisal, and implementation of a project. These policies and procedures are not limited to the Bank’s social and environmental safeguard policies, but include other operational policies, bank procedures, and operational directives, as well as other Bank procedural documents.

==Operation==
[[Image:World Bank building at Washington.jpg|thumb|The World Bank &amp; Inspection Panel's headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

=== Organization===
The Inspection Panel consists of three members who are appointed by the Board of Directors for non-renewable periods of five years. In addition, an Executive Secretariat was established to assist and support all Panel activities. The Panel is independent of Bank management and is provided with independent resources to discharge its functions.

=== Process ===
The Panel process begins when it receives a request for inspection from a party of two or more Requesters, claiming that the Bank has violated its policies and procedures. Most requests concern some of the Bank’s safeguard policies, such as the policies on environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people. 

Once the Panel has received and registered a request for inspection, the eligibility phase of the Inspection Process commences. Beginning on the day of registration the World Bank’s management has 21 days to provide the Panel with evidence that it complied or intended to comply with the Bank’s relevant policies and procedures. After receiving management's response, the Panel has 21 business days to determine the eligibility of the request.

Once it has been determined that the eligibility criteria have been met, and after having reviewed the management response to the request, the Panel may, taking other factors it may have discovered during a field visit into consideration, make a recommendation to investigate. In some cases, the Panel has promoted problem solving between management and the requesters to help mediate less contentious cases and lead to an earlier resolution of community concerns or policy compliance problems.

An investigation is not automatic, and can only be authorized by the Board of Executive Directors. If the Board approves, the next step is the substantive phase of the inspection process when the Panel evaluates the merits of the request. In the investigation phase, the Panel is focused on fact finding and verification. It visits the borrowing country and meets with the requesters and other affected people, as well as with a broad array of people from whom it can learn in detail about the issues, concerns, the project's status, and potential harmful effects. The investigation phase may take a few months, or longer, in complex cases.

Once the investigation phase is complete, the Panel submits its Investigation Report to Bank management. The Board meets to consider both the Panel's Investigation Report and management’s recommendations, before deciding whether to approve the recommendations. The Board may ask the Panel to check whether management has made appropriate consultations about the remedial measures with the affected people.

== History ==

During the 1980s the Bank had begun developing and committing itself to operational policies and procedures, including policies on involuntary resettlement (1980), tribal peoples (1982), and environmental assessment (1988). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, widespread voices of concern and protest from civil society and project-affected communities questioned the social and environmental impacts of Bank-financed operations. A central element of this critique was that the Bank was not complying with its policy commitments which it had adopted to prevent these very types of adverse social and environmental impacts. Serious debates on these issues also took place within the Bank’s member governments and the Bank itself.

In June 1992, the international community gathered at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro to chart a new cooperative approach to addressing interrelated issues of social development, economic development, and environmental protection. The blueprint for the creation of the Inspection Panel was developed in this larger context as a result of efforts from civil society, governments, and members of the Bank’s Board to establish a new and independent mechanism for greater accountability, participation, and transparency at the World Bank.

=== Creation ===
The Panel was officially created by two similar resolutions of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Agency (IDA) signed by the Board of Executive Directors on September 1, 1993 (Resolution IBRD 93–10 and Resolution IDA 93–6). The Resolution specifies that the Panel has jurisdiction with respect to operations supported by the IBRD and the IDA. In 1996 and 1999, clarifications were added to the Resolution.

The four units which concur to the improvement of accountability and [[internal control]] at the World Bank are (in alphabetical order):
* The [[Independent Evaluation Group]] (IEG), whose Director-General reports directly to the Bank Group’s Board of [[Executive director|Executive Directors]].
* The Inspection Panel (IPN). Its three members are appointed by the Board of Directors, and independent of Bank Management.
* The Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency (INT), whose VP reports to the World Bank's President. The Independent Advisory Board provides advice to the [[World Bank Group]] on [[governance]] and [[Corruption|anti-corruption]] measures, helps protect the independence and strengthens the accountability of INT by giving advice on policies and procedures and on the department’s interactions within the World Bank Group. It also provides advice to President [[Robert Zoellick]] and the World Bank Group Audit Committee on the performance of INT.
* The [[Internal Auditing]] Department (IAD), whose VP [[Auditor General]] reports to the World Bank's President and to the [[Audit Committee]] of the Board of Executive Directors.

'''Yaakov Teitel''' ({{lang-he-n|יעקב טייטל}}, born November 1972) is an American-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] religious nationalist, convicted for killing two people in 2009. Teitel, who had immigrated to Israel in 2000, settling in a [[West Bank]] [[Israeli settlement|settlement]],&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3798629,00.html |title=Settler suspected of multiple hate crimes |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date= 1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1125063.html |title=Settler admits to murder, series of bomb attacks |work=[[Haaretz]] |first=Amos |last=Harel |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934103,00.html |title=Accused Jewish Terrorist Jack Teitel |date= 3 November 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Randy |last=James |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confessed to planning and committing various acts of terrorism and hate crimes against [[Palestinians]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wingers]], missionary [[Christians]], and police officers across Israel. Teitel was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], which he is currently serving.

== Early life ==
Yaakov Teitel was born in 1972 in [[Florida]], United States, and moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], when he was a teenager. His father, Mark, was a retired [[dentist]] who had served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and his mother, Dianne, was a medical secretary - both of whom became [[Haredi Jews]] later in life. Commonly known as Jack, Teitel attended [[university]] and received a bachelor's degree in [[psychology]], and in the mid-1990s, he began making regular visits to Israel. He was arrested in August 1997 on suspicion of murdering a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[shepherd]], but was released, and the case was eventually closed due to lack of evidence. Teitel subsequently returned to the United States, where he took a computer course with [[Microsoft]], and began working as a computer technician.

== Emigration to Israel ==
In 1999, Teitel immigrated to Israel and moved to the settlement of [[Shvut Rachel]], becoming an Israeli citizen under the [[Law of Return]] in December 2000. The following year, his parents and sister also emigrated to Israel, and settled in [[Beitar Illit]], an [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews|Ultra-Orthodox]] city in the [[Gush Etzion]] settlement bloc. In 2002, Teitel met Rivka Pepperman, a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born dance teacher originally from [[Broughton Park]], [[Manchester]], whose family had moved to Israel in 1981. They married the following year, and had four children. Teitel was summoned by [[Israel Defense Forces]] for preliminary checks, but was exempted from [[conscription]] due to his advanced age, medical history, and familial state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Gili Cohen6 hours ago |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/who-is-suspected-jewish-terrorist-yaakov-teitel-1.4998 |title=Who Is Suspected Jewish Terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |publisher=Israel News Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/21868/jewish-terrorist-god-proud-me |title=Jewish 'terrorist': God is proud of me |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle Thejc.com |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was considered an outcast in the settlement due to his limited proficiency in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and reclusive behavior. He hardly left his home, and did not regularly participate in services at the local synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5227288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/the-two-faces-of-accused-terrorist-jack-teitel/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrorist acts and arrest ==
Teitel was arrested in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Har Nof]] neighborhood on October 7, 2009, while posting [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s praising the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting]]. He attempted to throw away a bag he was carrying, but it was retrieved, and was found to contain two [[handguns]]. Teitel was then turned over to [[Shin Bet]] for interrogation, while special police units raided his home and the homes of his brother-in-law, parents, and mother-in-law. The search of his property revealed a cache of guns, parts used in [[explosive]] devices, pellets used to maximize the impact of explosives, [[binoculars]], and flyers containing [[anti-gay]] incitement. The explosives were all detonated safely by the police, and a search of his home two days later found a [[bomb]] buried in the backyard.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;

Israeli police revealed that Teitel, acting alone, confessed to a string of terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. Teitel confessed to having carried out a [[Ze'ev Sternhell#Attack|pipe-bomb attack against Ze'ev Sternhell]], as well as the murders of a Palestinian taxi driver and a [[West Bank]] shepherd in 1997, a 2006 attempted bombing near the settlement of [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]], three bombings against police targets and a [[Christian]] monastery in 2007, and sending a [[booby-trapped]] package that injured a teenage boy to the home of a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jewish]] family in [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]].&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=2 November 2009 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1102/1224257903312.html |title=Israeli police arrest West Bank settler over Palestinian killings |first=Mark |last=Weiss |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[CBN News]] |date=6 November 2009 |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2009/November/Suspect-Arrest-Announced-in-Ami-Ortiz-Case/ |title=Suspect Arrest Announced in Ami Ortiz Case |first=Chris |last=Mitchell |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Haaretz |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1125062.html |title=Who is suspected Jewish terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Teitel's confession, his [[DNA]] was found to match DNA retrieved from Sternhell's home after the bombing attack.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt; Teitel also confessed that he had planned to fly a remote-controlled toy plane containing explosives into the [[Tel Aviv]] gay pride parade, and that he planned a bombing against a [[Jerusalem]] gay bar. He also admitted that he planned to fire an improvised [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] against the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], but abandoned the plan over fear of injuring Jewish worshippers on the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=164915 |title=Leaks are prejudicing course of justice, complains Ya'acov Teitel's new attorney |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was also suspected of murdering two police officers in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], and confessed to the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting|gay centre shooting]] in Tel Aviv in 2009, though police stated that they were certain he was not involved in either.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257417385328&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Police clear Yosef Espinoza, suspected Teitel accomplice |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date= 5 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discoveries, Teitel was held by Shin Bet in special custody for 48 hours, without being allowed to see an [[Lawyer|attorney]] or brought before a judge. The [[Petah Tikva]] District Court denied appeals from his attorney to meet with him, and subsequently extended both his remand and the special ordnance banning him from meeting his lawyer. All of Teitel's [[arraignment]]s were held behind closed doors, and a [[gag order]] was imposed on the case.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;

On 10 November 2009, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office declared that Teitel would be charged for the murder of the two Palestinians, incitement to racism, deploying explosive devices, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1127200.html |title=Alleged Jewish terrorist to be charged with murdering two Palestinians |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |work=Haaretz |date= 10 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teitel's legal defense was provided by ''Honenu'', an organization which provides legal defense for Israelis accused of crimes against Arabs or the Israeli security forces. Honenu founder Shmuel Meidad suggested that Teitel may be [[Insanity|mentally unstable]], stating that, "It's my impression that this man is sick, but he's not nearly as sick as the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455202910&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Teitel's defense provided by 'Honenu' |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=The Jerusalem Post |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 2010, Jerusalem's district [[psychiatrist]] ruled Teitel unfit to stand trial. The evaluation was criticized by [[Israeli-Arab]] [[Knesset]] members, with [[Ahmad Tibi]] stating, "An Arab who shoots a Jew in Israel is a terrorist, but a Jew who shoots Arabs is insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jewish-terror-suspect-unfit-to-stand-trial-1.288172 |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |title=Jewish terror suspect 'unfit to stand trial' |work=Haaretz |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a new psychiatric evaluation, the district court overturned the previous ruling, and declared Teitel fit for trial, on 30 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3946310,00.html |first=Aviad |last=Glickman |title=Teitel deemed fit to stand trial |work=Ynetnews |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction ==

In February 2012, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office and Teitel's attorneys reached an agreement under which he would confess to two counts of murder. Teitel's attorneys confessed on his behalf, as Teitel himself announced that did not recognize the court's jurisdiction.
