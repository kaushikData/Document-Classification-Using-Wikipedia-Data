'''Adelino Fontoura Chaves''' (March 30, 1859 – May 2, 1884) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, actor and journalist. He is the patron of the 1st chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Life==
Adelino Fontoura was born in the city of [[Axixá]], in [[Maranhão]], to Antônio Fontoura Chaves and Francisca Dias Fontoura.

Since as a child, he would have a very strong friendship with future author [[Artur Azevedo]].

Moving to [[Recife]], he would work at the satirical journal ''Os Xênios''. Returning to Maranhão, he initiated his artistical career, performing in a play that would make him arrested. After this incident, he moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]].

He tried the artistic and the journalistic career, failing in the first one. He wrote for journals ''Folha Nova'', ''O Combate'' and ''A Gazetinha'', where he published some poems and works in prose — and, in this last one, he would collaborate once more with Azevedo, who was its founder. Alongside [[Ferreira de Menezes]], [[Augusto Ribeiro]], Hugo Leal and [[João de Almeida]], he would work for the journal ''A Gazeta da Tarde'', that was, according to [[Múcio Leão]], "one of the most ill-fated journals ever founded", because its founders would die in the next three years after the journal's existence.

After the ''Gazeta da Tarde'' was bought by [[José do Patrocínio]], Adelino becomes its correspondent in [[Paris]]. Already very sick, his situation got worse due to the harsh French winter, what made him move to [[Lisbon]] in an unsuccessful attempt to get better.

He died with only 25 years, without publishing any book.

==Work==
As mentioned above, Fontoura's work is very sparse, as he did not published anything during his lifetime. Attempts of compiling his poetry were made during the 1940s and 1950s by [[Múcio Leão]].

His most well-known poem is the [[sonnet]] "Celeste".

É tão divina a angélica aparência&lt;br /&gt;
E a graça que ilumina o rosto dela&lt;br /&gt;
Que eu concebera o tipo de inocência&lt;br /&gt;
Nessa criança imaculada e bela.

Peregrina do céu, pálida estrela,&lt;br /&gt;
Exilada na etérea transparência,&lt;br /&gt;
Sua origem não pode ser aquela&lt;br /&gt;
Da nossa triste e mísera existência.

Tem a celeste e ingênua formosura&lt;br /&gt;
E a luminosa auréola sacrossanta&lt;br /&gt;
De uma visão do céu, cândida e pura.

E quando os olhos para o céu levanta,&lt;br /&gt;
Inundados de mística doçura,&lt;br /&gt;
Nem parece mulher — parece santa.

It is so divine her angelic appearance&lt;br /&gt;
And the grace that enlightens her face&lt;br /&gt;
That I conceived the kind of innocence&lt;br /&gt;
On this pure and immaculate child.

Pilgrim of the skies, O pale star,&lt;br /&gt;
Exiled in ethereal transparency,&lt;br /&gt;
Your origin can't be the same&lt;br /&gt;
Of our sad and miserable existence.

She has the celestial and naïve beauty&lt;br /&gt;
And the bright sacrosanct halo&lt;br /&gt;
Of a candid and pure celestial vision.

And when she raises her eyes to the sky,&lt;br /&gt;
Filled of mystic sweetness,&lt;br /&gt;
She doesn't looks like a woman — she looks like a [[saint]].

'''Adjuvilo''' is a [[language]] created in 1910 by [[Claudius Colas]] under the [[pseudonym]] of "Profesoro V. Esperema". Although it was a full language, it may not have been created to be spoken. Many believe that as an [[Esperanto|Esperantist]], Colas created Adjuvilo to help create dissent in the then-growing [[Ido (language)|Ido]] movement. Colas himself called his language ''simplified [[Ido (language)|Ido]]'' and proposed several reforms to Ido.

Colas created a nearly complete grammar, but did not create a new vocabulary. Adjuvilo uses mainly the vocabulary of Ido with modifications according to the grammatical changes of Ido. Colas in some cases reestablishes the Esperanto forms of words and even constructed some new words like ''sulo'' for "sun" (Ido/Esperanto: ''suno'') and ''dago'' for "day" (Ido: ''dio'', Esperanto: ''tago'').

==Phonology and orthography==
Adjuvilo uses the same phonology and orthography as Ido. The only modification is that the stress is always on the penultimate syllable like in [[Esperanto]], whereas in Ido in the [[infinitive]] of the [[verbs]] the last syllable is stressed.

==Grammar==
* The [[definite article]] is in the [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular]] ''la'' and in the [[plural]] ''las''.
* All [[nouns]] end in the [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|singular]] in ''-o'' and in the [[plural]] in ''-s''. Example: ''la lando'' (the land) and ''las landos'' (the lands). Like Ido and Esperanto, Adjuvilo has no [[indefinite article]]
* Adjuvilo does not have grammatical genders. Nouns for females are all derived from the masculine form by using the affix ''-in''. Example: ''filio'' (son) and ''filiino'' (daughter).
* The [[genitive]] and the [[indirect object]] cases are expressed by prepositions. Example: ''Me donin la libro de la patro a mea filio'' (I gave my father's book to my son).
* The [[adjective]] ends on -a, and also receives -s in the plural. It is placed before the noun. Example: un bona viro (a good man), belas juvenilos (beautiful girls), granda monto (a big mountain).
:The [[comparative]] grade is formed by plu (more) and men (less). Example: ''El estan plu bela quam il''. (She is more beautiful than he).
:The [[superlative]] grade is formed by la pley (most). Example: ''Adjuvilo estan la pley facila linguo ex omnas linguos.'' (Adjuvilo is the easiest language of all languages).
* The [[adverb]] is formed from the adjective form by replacing the ending -a by -e. Adverbs are not changed in the plural. Example: ''Elas kantan bone.'' (They sing well).
* The [[personal pronouns]] are
:Singular ''me'' (I), ''tu'' (you), ''il'' (he), ''el'' (she), ''it'' (it), ''lo'' (third person gender not defined)
:Plural ''nos'' (we), ''vos'' (you), ''ilos'' (they, masculine), ''elos'' (they, female), ''itos'' (they, neuter), ''los'' (they, unspecified gender)
:Additional personal pronouns: ''on'' (one, impersonal form), ''su'' ([[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] form)
* The [[possessive pronoun|possessive]] pronouns are formed by adding the adjective ending ''-a'' and in the plural the ''-s'' to the personal pronouns: ''mea'' (my), ''tua'' (your), ''ila'' (his), ''nosas'' (our), ''ilosas'' (their, masculine). The reflexive possessive pronoun ''sua'' (his/her/its) in the singular and ''suas'' in the plural is only used for the third person and can be only used when it refers to the subject of the sentence.
* [[Verbs]] are not conjugated according to singular/plural or person.
:The [[infinitive]] ending is ''-i'' like in [[Esperanto]]: ''diri'' (to say), ''lerni'' (to learn).
:The [[present tense]] is formed by replacing the infinitive ending by ''-an''. Example: ''Me kantan'' (I sing), ''tu kantan'' (you sing).
:The [[past tense]] is formed by ''-in''. Example: Me vidin (I saw).
:The [[future tense]] is formed by ''-on''. Example: Me vidon (I will see).
:The [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]] is formed by adding ''-un''. Example: Me vidun (I would see).
:The [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed by adding ''-en''. Example: ''Lekten la libro!'' (Read the book!)
:The [[active participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-ant'' for the present tense, '''-int''' for the past tense and ''-ont'' for the future tense. Example: ''La ridanta homo'' (The laughing man).
:The [[passive participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-at'' for the present tense, '''-it''' for the past tense and ''-ot'' for the future tense.
:The [[passive voice]] is formed with the forms of the [[auxiliary verb]] '''esti''' (to be). Example: ''La libro estin skriptita de Shakespeare'' (The book was written by Shakespeare).
* [[Tag questions]] are formed with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''num''. ''Num il parolan Adjuvilo?'' (Does he speak Adjuvilo?).
* The most important [[interrogative pronouns]] are ''qua'' (who), ''quo'' (what), ''quale'' (how), ''quare'' (why).
* The [[demonstrative pronoun]]s are ''cia'' (this) and ''tia'' (that). Like other pronouns they also have plural forms. ''Cias floros estan bela ma tias arboros estan plu grandas'' (These flowers are beautiful but that trees are bigger.)
* The [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] are: 1 — un, 2 — du, 3 — tri, 4 — quar, 5 — quin, 6 — sis, 7 — sep, 8 — ok, 9 — nov, 10 — dek. The [[ordinal numbers]] are formed with the suffix -esma: ''unesma'', ''duesma'', ''triesma''.

==Comparison to Ido==
* Adjuvilo completely eliminates a special ending for the [[accusative]] case, whereas in Ido it was still used in sentences beginning with the [[object (grammar)|object]].
* Adjuvilo uses the [[plural]] ending also for [[adjective]]s, the definite article and all [[pronouns]].
* Adjuvilo uses as plural ending ''-s'' and not ''-i'' as Ido.
* Adjuvilo replaces the Ido [[infinitive]] ending -''ar'' by the [[Esperanto]] form ''-i''. The infinitive forms of the different tenses in Ido were completely abolished.
* Adjuvilo completely abolishes the synthetic [[passive voice]] form of the verbs by a compound form of the auxiliary verb "to be" and the corresponding [[participle]].
* Adjuvilo changes the Ido system of [[affixes]] by creating new affixes, omitting some and modifying some existing ones.
* Adjuvilo changes many [[pronouns]] of Ido.
* The accent in Adjuvilo is always on the penultimate syllable, as in Esperanto.
* Colas also announced changes to the vocabulary without elaborating this completely.

All in all the changes to Ido were so great that Adjuvilo in fact is a new constructed language.

==Sample==
A sample of Adjuvilo, the often-translated ''[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Patro nosa, qua estan en cielos, santa esten tua nomo, advenen tua regno, esten tua volo, quale en cielos, tale anke sur la tero; nosa panon omnadaga donen a nos hodie; nosas ofendos pardonen a nos, quale nos pardonan a nosas ofendantos e ne lasen nos fali en tento, ma liberifen nos de malbono.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''"all persons fictitious" disclaimer''' in a work of media is one which states that the persons portrayed in it are not based on real people. This is done to reduce the possibility of [[legal action]] for [[libel]] from any person who believes that he or she has been defamed by their portrayal in the work, whether portrayed under their real name or a different name. The wording of this disclaimer varies, and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as does its legal effectiveness.

The disclaimer for American studio films and TV series is routinely included among disclaimers on other topics, such as copyright, animal welfare, and promotion of tobacco use, such as:&lt;blockquote&gt;This motion picture is protected under the copyright laws of the United States and other countries throughout the world. Country of first publication: United States of America. Any unauthorized exhibition, distribution, or copying of this film or any part thereof (including soundtrack) may result in civil liability and criminal prosecution. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred. No person or entity associated with this film received payment or anything of value, or entered into any agreement, in connection with the depiction of tobacco products. [[No animals were harmed]] in the making of this motion picture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
The disclaimer came as a result of litigation against the 1932 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'', which insinuated that the character Princess Natasha had been raped by Russian mystic [[Rasputin]]. The character of Natasha was supposedly intended to represent [[Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia]], who [[lawsuit|sued]] MGM for [[libel]]. After seeing the film twice, the jury agreed that the princess had been defamed.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/HistoryWired/Davis/DavisAuthenticity.html |title=Any Resemblance to Persons Living or Dead: Film and the Challenge of Authenticity |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=89000&amp;mainArticleId=276063 |title=Rasputin and the Empress |publisher=Tcm.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irina and her husband [[Felix Yusupov]] were reportedly awarded $127,373 in damages by the [[English Court of Appeal]] in 1934 and $1&amp;nbsp;million in an out-of-court [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] with MGM.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As a preventive measure against further [[lawsuit]]s, the film was taken out of distribution for decades.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; 

The film began with a claim that "This concerns the destruction of an empire … A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence." Reportedly, a justice in the case told MGM that not only was this claim damaging to their case, but that their case would be stronger if they had incorporated a directly opposite statement, that the film wasn't intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/08/26/the_bizarre_true_story_behind_the_this_is_a_work_of_fiction_disclaimer.html |title=The Strange Reason Nearly Every Film Ends by Saying It’s Fiction (You Guessed It: Rasputin!) | publisher=Slate.com | accessdate= 3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted by the outcome of this case, many studios began to incorporate an "all persons fictitious" disclaimer in their films, to protect themselves from similar court action.

Although the disclaimer is routinely included as [[Boilerplate contract|boilerplate]], producers sometimes vary from it, sometimes to make a statement about the veracity of their work, for humor, or to satirize the standard disclaimer. 

The disclaimer is sometimes presented with qualifications. In [[Jack Webb]]'s police series ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]'', each episode begins with an announcer intoning, "The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent." The 1969 alternative western comedy ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', based upon real individuals whose lives and exploits already had a place among American legends of the West, opens with the disclaimer "Most of what follows is true." Because of the autobiographical nature of [[Dave Eggers]]' memoir, ''[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]]'', the book features the following play on the usual disclaimer: "Any resemblance to persons living or dead should be plainly apparent to them and those who know them, especially if the author has been kind enough to have provided their real names and, in some cases, their phone numbers. All events described herein actually happened, though on occasion the author has taken certain, very small, liberties with chronology, because that is his right as an American." All episodes of ''[[South Park]]'', which frequently features well-known public figures or parodies of them, open with a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that begins by stating, "All characters and events in this show – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated – poorly." 

Disclaimers can occasionally be used to make political or similar points. One such disclaimer is shown at the end of the industrial/political thriller ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'', signed by the author of [[The Constant Gardener|the original book]], [[John le Carré]]: "Nobody in this story, and no outfit or corporation, thank God, is based upon an actual person or outfit in the real world. But I can tell you this; as my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/trivia?tab=cz The Constant Gardener],'' IMDb.com. Retrieved 31 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 film ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', which is based on the military dictatorship ruling Greece at that time, has this notice: "Any resemblance to actual events, to persons living or dead, is not the result of chance. It is DELIBERATE." &lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065234/trivia?tab=cz&amp;ref_=tt_trv_cc Crazy Credits] ,'' IMDb.com. Retrieved 9 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; German nobel laureate [[Heinrich Böll]]'s novel ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum]]'' was originally preceded by a statement which made the usual disclaimer, but stated that similarities to the journalistic practices of the German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'' "are neither intended nor coincidental but inevitable"; this disclaimer was later removed in the English edition.

The familiar disclaimer is often rewritten for humor. Early examples include [[The Three Stooges]]' parody of Nazi Germany ''[[You Nazty Spy]]'', which stated that "Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and any persons, living or dead, is a miracle," and its sequel ''[[I'll Never Heil Again]]'', which features a disclaimer that states that "The characters in this picture are fictitious. Anyone resembling them is better off dead." In the 1966 film ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', a disclaimer states: 'None of the characters appearing in this photoplay intentionally resemble any persons living or dead…SINCE THEY DO NOT YET EXIST' (the film is set in the year 2068). In the film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'', and in ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]'', the disclaimer refers to "persons living, dead or [[undead]]".  

Variations sometimes employ irony or satire. The film ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]'' features a disclaimer that reads "The events portrayed in this film are all true. The names are real names of real people and real organizations." The novel ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] features a truncated version of the disclaimer: "All persons, living and dead, are purely coincidental, and should not be construed", referring to the novel's [[existentialist]] themes. [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1990 feature film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' ends with "This story was based on fact. Any similarity with fictitious events or characters was purely coincidental."

In response to controversies over cultural appropriation and the use of an indigenous term, Filipino television network [[ABS-CBN]] used a special disclaimer in the 2018 [[fantaserye]] ''[[Bagani]]'', maintaining that the series takes place in an alternate fantasy universe inspired but unrelated to pre-colonial Philippines and is in no way intended to trivialize or misrepresent tribal groups: ''"Ang kuwentong inyong mapapanood ay kathang-isip lamang at kumuha ng inspirasyon mula sa iba’t ibang alamat at mitolohiyang Pilipino. Ito’y hindi tumutukoy o kumakatawan sa kahit anong Indigenous People sa Pilipinas."'' ("The story you're about to watch is a work of fiction and is inspired by Philippine mythology and folk legends. It does not refer to and is not representative of any Indigenous People in the Philippines.")&lt;ref name="Cepeda"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/264615/bagani-teleseryes-misuse-of-term-distorts-misleads-and-confuses-filipino-viewers-says-ip-commission|title='Bagani' teleserye's misuse of term 'distorts, misleads and confuses' Filipino viewers, says IP commission|last=Cepeda|first=Cody|date=6 March 2018|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guno"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/264316/p2fb-bagani-teleserye-under-fire-from-ched-commissioner-for-misuse-of-term|title=‘Bagani’ teleserye under fire from CHED commissioner for misuse of term|last=Guno|first=Niña|date=4 March 2018|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramos"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2018/03/05/ched-commissioner-criticizes-teleserye-bagani/|title=CHED Commissioner criticizes teleserye ‘Bagani’|last=Ramos|first=Marjaleen|date=5 March 2018|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
If a fictitious film is perceived to be too close to actual events, the disclaimer may be ruled null and void in court and the inspiration behind the film may be due compensation. Such was the case with the 1980 film ''[[The Idolmaker]]'', which was based on a fictional talent promoter who discovers a talentless teenage boy and turns him into a manufactured star; [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]], whose career path was very similar to the fictional boy's, took offense at the caricature, and the production company responded with the all persons fictitious disclaimer. As the promoter on which the fictional character was based, [[Bob Marcucci]], was part of the production staff (and thus it could not be plausibly denied that actual events inspired the film), Fabian ultimately received a settlement granting a minority stake in the film's profits.&lt;ref&gt;Film Clips: Paramount's Eisner Can't Find A Booth.

}}

The '''Alor–Pantar languages''' are a family of clearly related [[Papuan languages]] spoken on islands of the [[Alor archipelago]] near [[Timor]] in southern Indonesia. They may be most closely related to the Papuan languages of western Timor, but this is not yet clear. A more distant relationship with the [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] of the Bomberai peninsula has been proposed based on pronominal evidence, but though often cited has never been firmly established.

==Languages==
The family is conventionally divided into two branches, centered on the islands of [[Alor Island|Alor]] and [[Pantar Island|Pantar]].

* Alor branch: [[Woisika language|Wosika]], [[Abui language|Abui]], [[Adang language|Adang–Kabola]], [[Kafoa language|Kafoa]] (Jafoo), [[Kui language (Indonesia)|Kui]], [[Klon language|Klon]], [[Wersing language|Wersing]], [[Sawila language|Sawila]], [[Kula language|Kula]]
* Pantar branch: [[Blagar language|Blagar]], [[Teiwa language|Teiwa]], [[Western Pantar language|Lamma]], [[Nedebang language|Nedebang]], [[Retta language|Retta]]

Tereweng is sometimes considered a separate language from Blagar, and Hamap sometimes separate from Adang. Abui, Kamang, and Kabola may also not be unitary languages. 71940 total speakers.

"Proto-Alor–Pantar" may be synonymous with Proto-[[Timor-Alor-Pantar languages|Timor–Alor–Pantar]], as the languages outside the Alor branch do not seem to form a valid node with it against the [[Oirata–Makasai languages]] of East Timor and [[Bunak language]] on the Timorese border.  However, the relationship is distant.  Ross (2005) postulates a "West Timor" group uniting Alor–Pantar with Bunak.  He reconstructs the pronouns as:

:{|
|+{{nowrap|West Timor pronouns}}
! !!sg!!pl
|-
!1ex
|rowspan=2|*na||*ni
|-
!1in
|*pi
|-
!2
|*[y]a||*i
|-
!3
|*ga||*gi
|}

3pl *gi is not attested from Bunak, and the inclusive is just ''i''.

==Classification==
It has long been recognized that the Papuan languages of the Alor archipelago (including Alor and Pantar, as well as the four small islands of Buaya, Pura, Ternate, and Tereweng in the Pantar Strait) form a well-defined group. Apparent cognates among basic vocabulary are abundant, as demonstrated for example in Stokhof’s (1975) survey of basic vocabulary, and the shape of pronominal systems is almost identical across the group.&lt;ref&gt;Stokhof, W. A. L. 1975. Preliminary notes on the Alor and Pantar languages (East Indonesia). (Pacific Linguistics B-43). Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic relatedness of the Alor–Pantar languages has been confirmed through the reconstruction of the proto-Alor–Pantar language.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Gary, Marian Klamer, František Kratochvíl, Laura Robinson &amp; Antoinette Schapper. 2012. The historical relation of the Papuan languages of Alor and Pantar. Oceanic Linguistics 51(1).87-122.
&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships between the Alor–Pantar languages and at least some (though perhaps not all) of the non-Austronesian languages of Timor Island may justify the positing of a Timor–Alor–Pantar language family, however the relationship between the AP group and the Timor languages is of a second order.

Based on an examination of possessive prefixes, Capell (1944) originally postulated that the AP languages were related to the West Papuan Phylum languages of North Maluku and the Bird’s Head of New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Capell, A. 1944. Peoples and languages of Timor. Oceania 14.191-219.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was later countered by Wurm et al. (1975), who classified these languages as members of the putative Trans–New Guinea Phylum.&lt;ref&gt;Wurm, S.A., C.L. Voorhoeve &amp; K.A. McElhanon. 1975. The Trans–New Guinea Phylum in general. New Guinea Area Languages and Language Study, vol. I, Papuan Languages and the New Guinea Linguistic Scene, ed. by S.A. Wurm, 299-322. (Pacific Linguistics C-38). Canberra: Australian National University.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors offered little evidence for this classification and remained somewhat doubtful, noting, “whichever way they [the Timor–Alor–Pantar languages] are classified, they contain strong substratum elements of the other … phyla involved” (Wurm et al. 1975:318).
Most recently, based on an analysis of pronominal shapes Ross (2005) assigns AP to his West Trans–New Guinea linkage, a subgroup of Trans–New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Malcolm. 2005. Pronouns as a preliminary diagnostic for grouping Papuan languages. Papuan Pasts: Cultural, linguistic and biological histories of Papuan-speaking peoples ed. by A. Pawley, R. Attenborough, J. Golson &amp; R. Hide, 15-66. (Pacific Linguistics PL 572). Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.
&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Ross’ proposal requires that AP pronouns be derived from pTNG via a flip-flop in which second person pronouns trade places with third person. Compare pTNG *ŋga ‘2pro’ and *(y)a ‘3pro’ with Nedebang aŋ and gaŋ, respectively. Bottom-up reconstruction based on regular sound correspondences may shed further light on these issues.

'''Astral projection''' (or '''astral travel''') is a term  used in [[esotericism]] to describe a willful [[out-of-body experience]] (OBE)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Out-Of-Body Experiences (OBE or OOBE)|first=Mario|last=Varvoglis|url=http://archived.parapsych.org/out_of_body_experiences.htm|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Astral Projection|last=Myers|first=Frederic W.H.|year=2014|journal=Journal for Spiritual &amp; Consciousness Studies|volume=37|issue=1|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; that assumes the existence of a soul or consciousness called an "[[astral body]]" that is separate from the [[physical body]] and capable of travelling outside it throughout the universe.&lt;ref name=Crow&gt;{{citation|title=Taming the astral body: the Theosophical Society's ongoing problem of emotion and control|last=Crow|first=John L|year=2012|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=80|issue=3|pages=691–717|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfs042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/astral-projection?&amp;o=100074&amp;s=t|date=n.d.|title=Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.7)|accessdate=9 July 2016|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Astral projection|date=27 October 2015|work=The Skepdic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of 'astral projection' was coined and promoted by 19th century [[Theosophist]]s.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; It is sometimes reported in association with dreams, and forms of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Leonard|last=Zusne|first2=Warren H.|last2=Jones|year=1989|title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8058-0508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals have reported perceptions similar to descriptions of astral projection that were induced through various [[hallucination|hallucinogenic]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] means (including [[self-hypnosis]]). There is no scientific evidence that there is a consciousness or soul which is separate from normal [[Neurotransmission|neural activity]] or that one can consciously leave the body and make observations,&lt;ref name="Regal2009"&gt;[[Brian Regal]].

==Accounts==

===Western===
According to classical, medieval and renaissance [[Hermeticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and later [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophist]] and [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] thought the astral body is an intermediate body of light linking the rational soul to the physical body while the astral plane is an intermediate world of light between Heaven and Earth, composed of the spheres of the planets and stars. These astral spheres were held to be populated by angels, demons and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. R. Dodds|Dodds, E.R.]] ''Proclus: The Elements of Theology''. A revised text with translation, introduction, and commentary, 2nd edition 1963, Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pagel |first=Walter |authorlink= |title=William Harvey's Biological Ideas |publisher=Karger Publishers |year=1967 |pages=147–148 |isbn=3-8055-0962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]], and their associated planes of existence, form an essential part of the esoteric systems that deal with astral phenomena. In the neo-platonism of [[Plotinus]], for example, the individual is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] ("small world") of the universe (the macrocosm or "great world"). "The rational soul...is akin to the great Soul of the World" while "the material universe, like the body, is made as a faded image of the Intelligible". Each succeeding plane of manifestation is causal to the next, a world-view known as [[emanationism]]; "from the One proceeds Intellect, from Intellect Soul, and from Soul - in its lower phase, or that of Nature - the material universe".&lt;ref&gt;John Gregory, The Neoplatonists, Kyle Cathie 1991 pp15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Often these bodies and their [[planes of existence]] are depicted as a series of concentric circles or nested spheres, with a separate body traversing each realm.&lt;ref name="Besant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Besant |first=Annie Wood |authorlink= |title=The Ancient Wisdom: An Outline of Theosophical Teachings |publisher=Theosophical publishing society |year=1897 |pages= |isbn=0-524-02712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the astral figured prominently in the work of the nineteenth-century French occultist [[Eliphas Levi]], whence it was adopted and developed further by Theosophy, and used afterwards by other esoteric movements.

===Biblical===

Carrington, Muldoon, Peterson, and Williams—renowned experts in the field of astral projection—claim that the subtle body is attached to the physical body by means of a psychic [[silver cord]].&lt;ref&gt;''Projection of the Astral Body'' by Carrington and Muldoon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Out of Body Experiences: How to have them and what to expect'' by Robert Peterson (chapters 5, 17, 22)&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapter of the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]] is often cited in this respect: "Before the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain, or the wheel be broken at the cistern."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scherman, however, contends that the context points to this being merely a metaphor, comparing the body to a machine, with the silver cord referring to the [[Vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rabbi Nosson Scherman|title=The ArtScroll English Tanach|edition=First|series=ArtScroll Series|year=2011|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd.|location=Brooklyn, New York|isbn=1-4226-1065-9|page=1150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians is more generally agreed to refer to the astral planes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hankins|first1=James|title=Ficino, Avicenna and the Occult Powers of the Rational Soul|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3223908}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement gave rise to the ''[[Visio Pauli]]'', a tract that offers a vision of heaven and hell, a forerunner of [[The Vision of Adamnán|visions attributed to Adomnan]] and [[Visio Tnugdali|Tnugdalus]] as well as of [[Dante]]'s ''Divine Comedy''.

===Ancient Egypt===
Similar concepts of soul travel appear in various other religious traditions. For example, [[ancient Egypt]]ian teachings present the soul (''ba'') as having the ability to hover outside the physical body via the ''[[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka .28vital spark.29|ka]]'', or subtle body.&lt;ref name="Gale2" /&gt;

===China===

[[Taoism|Taoist]] alchemical practice involves creation of an energy body by breathing meditations, drawing energy into a 'pearl' that is then "circulated".&lt;ref name="Chia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chia |first=Mantak |authorlink= |title=Fusion of the Five Elements |publisher=Destiny Books |origyear=1989|year=2007 |pages=89+ |isbn=1-59477-103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Xiangzi]] ...  with a drum as his pillow fell fast asleep, snoring and motionless. His primordial spirit, however, went straight into the banquet room and said, "My lords, here I am again." When Tuizhi walked with the officials to take a look, there really was a Taoist sleeping on the ground and snoring like thunder. Yet inside, in the side room, there was another Taoist beating a fisher drum and singing Taoist songs. The officials all said, "Although there are two different people, their faces and clothes are exactly alike.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism the ability to do Astral Projection is one of many believed super normal powers for those who reach 4th Jhana.

According to Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life (Digha Nikaya 2.85-87) Buddha said.

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability (reaching 4th Jhana), he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way — with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightbodytravelers.com/discussions/buddhist-path-to-achieving-astral-projection.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

Similar ideas such as the [[Linga sarira|Lin'ga S'ari-ra]] are found in ancient [[Hindu]] scriptures such as the ''[[Yogavashista|YogaVashishta-Maharamayana]] of [[Valmiki]]''.&lt;ref name="Gale2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton |first=J. G. |authorlink= |title=Out-of-the-body Travel. In Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8103-9487-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indians who have vouched for astral projection include [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] who witnessed Swami Pranabananda doing a miracle through a possible astral projection,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described one's use of astral projection:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the advancing stages leading to the beginning of the path, the aspirant becomes spiritually prepared for being entrusted with free use of the forces of the inner world of the astral bodies. He may then undertake astral journeys in his astral body, leaving the physical body in sleep or wakefulness. The astral journeys that are taken unconsciously are much less important than those undertaken with full consciousness and as a result of deliberate volition. This implies conscious use of the astral body. Conscious separation of the astral body from the outer vehicle of the gross body has its own value in making the soul feel its distinction from the gross body and in arriving at fuller control of the gross body. One can, at will, put on and take off the external gross body as if it were a cloak, and use the astral body for experiencing the inner world of the astral and for undertaking journeys through it, if and when necessary....The ability to undertake astral journeys therefore involves considerable expansion of one’s scope for experience. It brings opportunities for promoting one’s own spiritual advancement, which begins with the [[Involution (Meher Baba)|involution]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Baba: 90, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Astral projection is one of the [[Siddhis]] considered achievable by yoga practitioners through self-disciplined practice.
In the epic [[Mahabharata|The Mahabharata]] [[Drona]] leaves his physical body to see if his son is alive.

===Japan===

[[File:SekienIkiryo.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The ''''[[ikiryō]]'''' as illustrated by [[Toriyama Sekien]].]]
In [[Japanese mythology]], an {{Nihongo|'''[[ikiryō]]'''|生霊}} (also read ''shōryō'', ''seirei'', or ''ikisudama'') is a manifestation of the [[soul]] of a living person separately from their body.&lt;ref name=Clarke2000 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Clarke | first=Peter Bernard | year=2000 | title=Japanese new religions: in global perspective, Volume 1999 | edition=annotated | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7007-1185-7  | page=247 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, if someone holds a sufficient grudge against another person, it is believed that a part or the whole of their soul can temporarily leave their body and appear before the target of their hate in order to curse or otherwise harm them, similar to an [[evil eye]]. Souls are also believed to leave a living body when the body is extremely sick or comatose; such ''ikiryō'' are not malevolent.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Chopra ''Academic Dictionary Of Mythology'' 2005, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Drazen ''A Gathering of Spirits: Japan's Ghost Story Tradition: from Folklore and Kabuki to Anime and Manga'' 2011, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit ===

In some [[Inuit]] groups, people with special capabilities are said to travel to (mythological) remote places, and report their experiences and things important to their fellows or the entire community; how to stop bad luck in hunting, cure a sick person etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 7–8, 12, 23–24,26, 27–29, 30, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985: 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; things unavailable to people with normal capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 1975: 228&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazon===

The ''yaskomo'' of the [[Wai-Wai people|Waiwai]] is believed to be able to perform a "soul flight" that can serve several functions such as healing, flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a new-born baby, flying to the cave of ''peccaries' mountains'' to ask the ''father of peccaries''  for abundance of game or flying deep down in a river to get the help of other beings.&lt;ref name="yaskomo soul flight"&gt;Fock 1963: 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Astral" and "etheric"==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Astral body carrington muldoon.jpg|thumb|300px|left| The projection of the [[Astral body]] with the [[Silver cord]].]] --&gt;
The expression "astral projection" came to be used in two different ways. For the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]]&lt;ref&gt;Chic Cicero, Chic C, Sandra Tabatha Cicero The Essential Golden Dawn, Llewellyn Worldwide, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Theosophists]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur A.Powell, ''THE ASTRAL BODY AND OTHER ASTRAL PHENOMENA' most of which is inaccurate ', The Theosophical Publishing House, London, England; Wheaton, Ill, U.S.A.; Adyar, Chennai, India, 1927, reprinted in 1954 and 1965, page 7, online June 2008 at http://hpb.narod.ru/AstralBodyByPowell-A.htm&lt;/ref&gt; it retained the classical and medieval philosophers' meaning of journeying to other worlds, heavens, hells, the astrological spheres and other imaginal&lt;ref&gt;Henri Corbin, Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn Arabi, tr. Ralph Mannheim, Bollingen XCI, Princeton U.P., 1969&lt;/ref&gt; landscapes, but outside these circles the term was increasingly applied to non-physical travel around the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. William Judge, ''The Ocean of Theosophy'' 2nd Ed. TPH, 1893, Chapter 5, book online June 2008 at http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/ocean/oce-hp.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this usage continues to be widespread, the term, "etheric travel", used by some later Theosophists, offers a useful distinction. Some experients say they visit different times and/or places:&lt;ref&gt;Astral-Projections.com"[http://www.astral-projections.com/members/cd/astral-projections-com-guide.pdf Secret Guide To Instant Astral Projection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122172510/http://www.astral-projections.com/members/cd/astral-projections-com-guide.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; "etheric", then, is used to represent the sense of being "out of the body" in the physical world, whereas "astral" may connote some alteration in time-perception. [[Robert Monroe]] describes the former type of projection as "Locale I" or the "Here-Now", involving people and places that actually exist:&lt;ref name="Body' p 60" /&gt;  Robert Bruce calls it the "Real Time Zone" (RTZ) and describes it as the non-physical dimension-level closest to the physical.&lt;ref&gt;''Astral Dynamics'' by Robert Bruce Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc, 1999. p 25-27, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; This [[etheric body]] is usually, though not always, invisible but is often perceived by the experient as connected to the physical body during separation by a "silver cord". Some link "falling" dreams with projection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Astral Dynamics'' by Robert Bruce. Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc, 1999 {{ISBN|1-57174-143-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Max Heindel]], the etheric "double" serves as a medium between the astral and physical realms. In his system the ether, also called ''[[prana]]'', is the "vital force" that empowers the physical forms to change. From his descriptions it can be inferred that, to him, when one views the physical during an out-of-body experience, one is not technically "in" the astral realm at all.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng02.htm#Chapter_IV The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experients may describe a domain that has no parallel to any known physical setting. Environments may be populated or unpopulated, artificial, natural or abstract, and the experience may be beatific, horrific or neutral. A common Theosophical belief is that one may access a compendium of mystical knowledge called the ''[[Akashic records]]''. In many accounts the experiencer correlates the astral world with the world of dreams. Some even report seeing other dreamers enacting dream scenarios unaware of their wider environment.&lt;ref name="FarJourneys" /&gt;

The astral environment may also be divided into ''levels'' or ''sub-planes'' by theorists, but there are many different views in various traditions concerning the overall structure of the astral planes: they may include heavens and hells and other after-death spheres, transcendent environments, or other less-easily characterized states.&lt;ref name="Body' p 60"&gt;''Journeys Out of the Body'' by Robert A. Monroe, p 60. Anchor Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FarJourneys"&gt;Monroe, Robert. ''Far Journeys''. {{ISBN|0-385-23182-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable practitioners ==
[[File:Astral Body from Carrington and Muldoon.png|thumb|Astral projection according to [[Hereward Carrington|Carrington]] and [[Sylvan Muldoon|Muldoon]], 1929]][[Emanuel Swedenborg]] was one of the first practitioners to write extensively about the out-of-body experience, in his Spiritual Diary (1747–65). French philosopher and novelist [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s fictional work "Louis Lambert" suggests he may have had some astral or out-of-body experience.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Lawton ''Balzac'' The Echo Library, 2007, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many twentieth century publications on astral projection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://obebibliography.info/general.htm Substantial bibliography of general OBE and astral projection literature]&lt;/ref&gt; although only a few authors remain widely cited. These include Robert Monroe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywww.com/asc/obe/whois_mo.html A biography of Robert Monroe] by [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Fox]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywww.com/asc/obe/whois_fo.html A biography of Oliver Fox] by [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvan Muldoon]], and [[Hereward Carrington]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywww.com/asc/obe/whois_mu.html A biography of Sylvan Muldoon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122150341/http://www.psywww.com/asc/obe/whois_mu.html |date=22 January 2009 }} by [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Yram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywww.com/asc/obe/whois_yr.html A biography of Yram] by [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Monroe]]'s accounts of journeys to other realms (1971–1994) popularized the term "OBE" and were translated into a large number of languages. Though his books themselves only placed secondary importance on descriptions of method, Monroe also founded [[Monroe Institute|an institute]] dedicated to research, exploration and non-profit dissemination of auditory technology for assisting others in achieving projection and related [[altered states of consciousness]].

Robert Bruce,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/bruce-robert/5840 Coast To Coast archives of shows featuring Robert Bruce]&lt;/ref&gt; William Buhlman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/buhlman-william/6028 Coast To Coast archives of shows featuring William Buhlman]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilynn Hughes]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/hughes-marilynn/7330 Coast To Coast archives of shows featuring Marilynn Hughes]&lt;/ref&gt; and Albert Taylor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/taylor-albert/6187 Coast To Coast archives of shows featuring Albert Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; have discussed their theories and findings on the syndicated show [[Coast to Coast AM]] several times. [[Michael Crichton]] gives lengthy and detailed explanations and experience of astral projection in his non-fiction book ''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]''.

In her book, [[Light in My Darkness|''My Religion'']], [[Helen Keller]] tells of her beliefs in [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|Swedenborgianism]] and how she once "traveled" to Athens: {{quote|"I have been far away all this time, and I haven't left the room...It was clear to me that it was because I was a spirit that I had so vividly 'seen' and felt a place a thousand miles away. Space was nothing to spirit!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keller|first1=Helen|title=My Religion|date=1927|publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company|location=Garden City|page=33|edition=First|url=https://archive.org/details/myreligion00hele|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The soul's ability to leave the body at will or while sleeping and visit the various planes of [[heaven]] is also known as "soul travel". The practice is taught in [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], where the experience is achieved mostly by meditation techniques and mantra repetition. All [[Sant Mat]] [[Guru]]s widely spoke about this kind of out of body experience, such as [[Kirpal Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;See chapter V of the book Crown of Life by Kirpal Singh available online at [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/col/title.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eckankar]] describes Soul Travel broadly as movement of the true, spiritual self (Soul) closer to the heart of God. While the contemplative may perceive the experience as travel, Soul itself is said not to move but to "come into an agreement with fixed states and conditions that already exist in some world of time and space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eckankar.org/soultravel.html |title=Soul Travel |website=www.eckankar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Harold Klemp, the current Spiritual Leader of Eckankar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eckankar.org/Harold/index.html |title=Sri Harold Klemp, Spiritual Leader of Eckankar |website=www.eckankar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; practices and teaches Soul Travel, as did his predecessors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eckankar.org/Masters/index.html |title=ECKANKAR: ECK Masters |website=www.eckankar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; through contemplative techniques known as the ''Spiritual Exercises of ECK'' (Divine Spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eckankar.org/spex.html |title=ECKANKAR: The Spiritual Exercises of ECK |website=www.eckankar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[occult]] traditions, practices range from inducing [[trance|trance states]] to the [[mental image|mental]] construction of a second body, called the ''[[Body of Light]]'' in [[Aleister Crowley]]'s writings, through visualization and controlled breathing, followed by the transfer of consciousness to the secondary body by a mental act of will.&lt;ref name="Greer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greer |first=John |authorlink= |title=Astral Projection. In The New Encyclopedia of the Occult |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=1967 |pages=|isbn=1-56718-336-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific reception==
There is no known scientific evidence that astral projection as an objective phenomenon exists.&lt;ref name="Regal2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park2008"/&gt;

There are cases of patients having experiences suggestive of astral projection from [[Deep brain stimulation|brain stimulation]] treatments and [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic drugs]], such as [[ketamine]], [[phencyclidine]], and [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="Park2008"/&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] writes that the main evidence to support claims of astral travel is anecdotal and comes "in the form of testimonials of those who claim to have experienced being out of their bodies when they may have been out of their minds."&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Todd Carroll|title=The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=24 December 2011|date=31 July 2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27242-7|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects in parapsychological experiments have attempted to project their astral bodies to distant rooms and see what was happening. However, such experiments haven't produced clear results.&lt;ref name=Blackmore&gt;{{cite web |last=Blackmore |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Blackmore |title=Near-Death Experiences: In or out of the body? |work=Skeptical Inquirer 1991, 16, 34-45 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |year=1991 |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/si91nde.html|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bob Bruce of the Queensland Skeptics Association, astral projection is "just imagining", or "a dream state". Bruce writes that the existence of an astral plane is contrary to the limits of science. "We know how many possibilities there are for dimensions and we know what the dimensions do. None of it correlates with things like astral projection." Bruce attributes astral experiences such as "meetings" alleged by practitioners to [[confirmation bias]] and coincidences.&lt;ref name="Brisbane Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frazer|first=Peter|title=Astral projection? In your dreams, say sceptics|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/astral-projection-in-your-dreams-say-sceptics-20100929-15x6n.html|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Donovan Rawcliffe]] has written that astral projection can be explained by delusion, [[hallucination]] and vivid dreams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donovan Rawcliffe|Rawcliffe, Donovan]]. (1988). ''Occult and Supernatural phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur W. Wiggins, writing in ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins'', said that purported evidence of the ability to astral travel great distances and give descriptions of places visited is predominantly anecdotal. In 1978, [[Ingo Swann]] provided a test of his alleged ability to astral travel to [[Jupiter]] and observe details of the planet. Actual findings and information were later compared to Swann's claimed observations; according to an evaluation by [[James Randi]], Swann's accuracy was "unconvincing and unimpressive" with an overall score of 37 percent. Wiggins considers astral travel an illusion, and looks to neuroanatomy, human belief, imagination and prior knowledge to provide prosaic explanations for those claiming to experience it.&lt;ref name="WynnWiggins2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles M. Wynn|author2=Arthur W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6563">Filming '''"back-to-back"''' refers to the practice of filming two or more movies as one production, reducing costs and time.

Trilogies are common in the film industry, particularly in science fiction, fantasy, action, horror, thriller, and adventure genres. Production companies may choose, if the first film is a financial success, to [[green-light]] a second and a third film at the same time and film them back-to-back. In a case where a lengthy novel is split into multiple installments for its film adaptation, those installments will usually be filmed back-to-back.

==Rationale==
In modern [[filmmaking]], the entire [[Casting (performing arts)|cast]] and [[Film crew|crew]] for each film is assembled from scratch for each project, and each of them is laid off as soon as they complete their assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Bingen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingen|first1=Steven|title=Warner Bros.: Hollywood's Ultimate Backlot|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9781589799622|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjGPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all participants in the industry are [[freelancer]]s, who move easily from one project to the next and do not have much loyalty to any particular studio, as long as they get paid.

This differs from the old [[studio system]] in which studios carried large numbers of cast and crew on their payrolls under long-term contracts.  To borrow a factory analogy, studios transitioned from using a single assembly line with an integrated staff to continuously churn out one film after another to building and disassembling separate assembly lines (each with its own unique staff) for every single film.&lt;ref name="Bingen" /&gt;

The advantage of the latter system is that film studios no longer have to bother either with paying people who are not involved in a current film production, or with green-lighting films very frequently so as to efficiently exploit [[sunk costs]] in their human resources. However, this also means that when they want a particular person for a film, that person may be unavailable because they are already committed to another film for another production company for that particular time slot. In turn, for every single film, studios (and ultimately their investors, shareholders, or backers) end up bearing massive [[transaction costs]] because they not only have to get the right person at the right price, but at the right time, and if they cannot get that person, they have to scramble to locate a satisfactory substitute.  All successful directors and producers have certain favorite cast and crew members whom they prefer to work with, but that is of no help to the studio if that perfect character actor, costume designer, or music composer is already fully booked.

Therefore, if a film does well at the box office and appears to have established a winning formula with a particular cast, crew and storyline, one way to minimize these transaction costs on sequels is to reassemble as much of the team as soon as possible (before anyone dies, retires, or does something else that allows them to command an even higher fee) and sign them to a single production that will be edited, released, and promoted as multiple films. This also minimizes the problem of stars visibly aging between sequels that do not have significant time gaps written in between them.

==Examples==
*''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' were filmed simultaneously in 1977 to be a two-part epic. However, due to off-screen difficulties between the producers and director [[Richard Donner]], production on the sequel was stopped in order to finish the first film for a December 1978 release. Filming on ''Superman II'' resumed in 1979 with a new director ([[Richard Lester]]), and was released in Australia in December 1980 and in the UK and US in 1981. 
*After the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' was a success, the two sequels ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' were in production from February 1989 until March 1990 with only a three-week break in principal photography between films and some of the filming of the third film overlapping with the second.
*[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] was [[Principal photography of The Lord of the Rings film series|filmed entirely over 438 days]] in [[New Zealand]] from October 1999 until December 2000 with [[pick-up (filmmaking)|pickup shots]] done prior to each film's theatrical release from 2001 to 2003. Likewise, [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' trilogy]] was shot back-to-back in New Zealand from March 2011 until July 2012.
*''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' were filmed back-to-back and released six months apart, in May 2003 and November 2003.
*''[[Kill Bill]]'' was filmed as one film and split into two "volumes", released six months apart in 2003 and 2004.
*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' were filmed back-to-back from February 2005 until January 2007, and released a year apart in July 2006 and May 2007.
*''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2|Part 2]]'' were [[Production of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|filmed]] entirely from February 2009 to June 2010.
*''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed (film)|Fifty Shades Freed]]'' were filmed back to back from February 2016 to July 2016. The two films were released a year apart, in February 2017 and February 2018 respectively. 
*The four as-yet-untitled [[Avatar (2009 film)#Sequels|sequels to ''Avatar'']] are being filmed back-to-back in two two-film blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalglish|first=Sean|title=Avatar Films To Be Filmed Back-to-back|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/04/rupert-murdoch-says-there-may-be-multiple-avatar-sequels-fortune/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and [[untitled Avengers sequel|its sequel]] were filmed back-to-back from January 2017 to January 2018, with reshoots for the second film concluding in October 2018, with the first film released in 2018 and the second scheduled for 2019.

Besides [[Maithili language|Maithili]], he also wrote few books in Hindi and Sanskrit covering a range of subjects related to [[mathematics]], [[astrology]], [[philosophy]] and [[history]].

==Early life and education==

Baldev Mishra was born in 1890 in [[Bangaon, Bihar]] in northern [[India]]. His father died when he was just five years old. He was raised by his maternal grandfather in Bangaon. Due to his exceptional memory and ability to recite Durgasaptshati at a very young age, he was given a scholarship by the queen of the Baniali state to pursue further studies. In  1910, he went to [[Benaras]] to study [[astrology]] under the tutelage of pandit [[Sudhakar Dwivedi]]. During his [[Benaras]] stay, he met with Acharya [[Narendra Deva]] whose intellect inspired him to study in English medium. This led him to appear in a combined Bengal-Bihar-Orissa matriculation board exam which he passed in the first division  in 1916.&lt;ref name="makers"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1922 he was appointed as a mathematics teacher at the [[Kashi Vidyapeeth]]. He worked at the Kashi Vidyapeeth until 1930. After that, he wrote a few books in [[Sanskrit]] for high school students on [[Trigonometry]] and [[Algebra]]. He also edited books on [[Ellipse]] and [[Calculus]] written by [[Sudhakar Dwivedi]].

In 1933, he started to work as an editor of "Pandit Patra". In 1939, he started working in "Saraswati Bhawan" library in [[Benaras]] where he worked on listing the manuscripts of many old articles there. He worked there until 1951. He then returned to his native state of [[Bihar]] in 1952 to work as [[decipherment]] research scholar in the newly formed [[K.P. Jayaswal]] Research Institute, [[Patna]]. Here, he worked on deciphering many articles related to [[Pali]] and [[Prakrit]] languages found during the excavations in [[Bodh Gaya]].  His work is published in 27 books in Tibbati-Pali-Prakrit series published by the Bihar Research society.&lt;ref name=makers/&gt;

'''Bi-curious''' is a phenomenon in which people of a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] identity who, while showing some curiosity for sexual activity with a person of the [[sex]] they do not favor, distinguish themselves from the [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] label. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363460708091743 |last=Frank |first=Katherine |title='Not Gay, but Not Homophobic': Male Sexuality and Homophobia in the 'Lifestyle' |year=2008 |journal=Sexualities |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=435–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self identified without identifying as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savin-Williams|first1=Ritch C.|last2=Joyner|first2=Kara|last3=Rieger|first3=Gerulf|title=Prevalence and Stability of Self-Reported Sexual Orientation Identity During Young Adulthood|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=2012|volume=41|issue=1|pages=103–110|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-9913-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[heteroflexible]]'' and ''homoflexible'' are also applied to bi-curiosity, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility (or homoflexibility) as lacking the "wish to experiment with ... sexuality" implied by the bi-curious label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smorag |first=Pascale |date=14 May 2008 |title=From Closet Talk to PC Terminology: Gay Speech and the Politics of Visibility |journal=Transatlantica |url=http://transatlantica.revues.org/index3503.html |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bi-curious'' implies that the individual has either no or limited homosexual experience in the case of heterosexual individuals or, no or limited heterosexual experience in the case of homosexual people, but may continue to self-identify as bi-curious if they do not feel they have adequately explored these feelings, or if they do not wish to identify as bisexual.

{{Expand Italian|Chiara Matraini|date=April 2012}}
'''Chiara Matraini''' (1515–1604) was an Italian [[Renaissance]] writer from [[Lucca]]. Primarily known for her love poetry, composed in the style of [[Petrarch]], she also authored a number of spiritual prose and verse texts. Matraini wrote throughout her long life, publishing her last text, the ''Dialoghi spirituali'' (1602), when she was well into her 80s. Her many projects included genres that were uncommon for women writers of her time, such as an oration on the art of war, a translation from Latin to vernacular, and several didactic religious texts. Matraini's writing demonstrates an eagerness to compose in an authoritative voice.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Virginia. ''Lyric Poetry by Women of the Italian Renaissance''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to Vincenzo Cantarini, with whom she had one son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/textdbs/iww/authoridx.pl?auth_code=A0029&amp;showfullrecord=ON /about/ University of Chicago Italian Women Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband's early death apparently facilitated  her active literary life. Her literary contacts included [[Benedetto Varchi]] and [[Lodovico Domenichi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9239">'''Chronic care''' refers to [[health care|medical care]] which addresses pre-existing or long term illness, as opposed to [[acute care]] which is concerned with short term or severe illness of brief duration. [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic medical conditions]] include [[asthma]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[emphysema]], chronic [[bronchitis]], congestive heart disease, [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[hypertension]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Without effective treatment chronic conditions may lead to [[disability]].

The incidence of chronic disease has increased as [[mortality rate]]s have decreased.&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  It is estimated that by 2030 half of the population of the USA will have one or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;

Conditions, injuries and diseases which were previously fatal can now be treated with chronic care. Chronic care aims to maintain wellness by keeping [[symptom]]s in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] while balancing treatment regimes and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  Many of the core functions of [[primary health care]] are central to chronic care.&lt;ref name="mtcoci"&gt;{{cite book |title=Meeting the Challenge of Chronic Illness |last=Kane |first=Robert L. |author2=Reinhard Priester |author3=Annette M.

==Policy making==
According to 2008 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chronic medical care accounts for more than 75% of health care spending in the US.&lt;ref name="chroncity"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronicity |title=Chronic Illness: Impact and Intervention |last=Larsen |first=Pamala D. |editor1-last=Lubkin |editor1-first=Ilene Morof |editor2-last=Larsen |editor2-first=Pamala D. |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=0763799661 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMCb5PeHXbcC |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the increased government expenditure in dealing with chronic care policy makers are searching for effective interventions and strategies.  These strategies can broadly be described within four categories.  These are [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]] and early detection, new providers, settings and qualifications, [[Disease management (health)|disease management programs]] and [[Clinical pathway|integrated care models]].&lt;ref name="tackcdie"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tackling Chronic Disease in Europe: Strategies, Interventions and Challenges |last=Busse |first=Reinhard |author2=Miriam Blümel |author3=David Scheller-Kreinsen |author4=Annette Zentner  |year=2010 |publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe |isbn=9289041927 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfyyrC7Q_j4C |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
One of the major problems from a health care system which is poorly coordinated for sufferers of chronic conditions is the incidence of patients receiving conflicting advice from different providers.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt; Patients will often be given prescriptions for medication that adversely interact with
one another.  One recent study estimated that more than 20% of older patients in the USA took at least one medication which could negatively impact another condition.&lt;ref name="ptc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089447#pone.0089447-Anderson1 |title=Potential Therapeutic Competition in Community-Living Older Adults in the U.S.: Use of Medications That May Adversely Affect a Coexisting Condition |date=February 25, 2014 |work=PLOS ONE |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as therapeutic competition.

Effective chronic care requires an information platform to track patients' status and ensure appropriate treatments are given.&lt;ref name="kpiiltc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Key Policy Issues in Long-term Care |last=Brodsky |first=Jenny |author2=Jack Habib |author3=Miriam Hirschfeld  |year=2003 |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=9241562250 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8DXL147v_MC |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a recognised gap between treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Caring For People With Chronic Conditions: A Health System Perspective: A Health System Perspective |last=Nolte |first=Ellen |author2=Martin McKee |year=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335233708 |pages=2, 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV3id1wQIcsC |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because patients will place varying important on health outcomes.  For example, some patients will fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes at the expense of quality of life.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

===Multiple conditions===
One of the greatest challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders,&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt; which is called multi-morbidity.  There are few incentives within current [[health system|health care systems]] to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/reports/2010/rwjf54583 |title=Chronic Care: Making the Case for Ongoing Care |date=2010 |author=Gerard Anderson |publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2001 survey by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions.  An increase in the number of chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;  Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

==Approaches==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
{{original research section|date=March 2014}}
A nurse has to be qualified to handle all the needs of a chronic client and has to be an advocate to put the case of the chronically ill across to the health administration, hospital board or their families.

A variety of specialists such as surgeons, dietitians, nutritionists, and occupational therapists have to be in attendance for the maximum benefit of the client. Someone suffering from chronic pain for a long time may need the help of a psychiatrist. Everyday activities that the physically fit see as normal may be a Herculean feat for the chronically ill and they need all the support that they can get. The nurse may be privy to some of these help that the chronically ill can benefit from. They need to be proactive and put these patients in contact with these help but also sensitive enough to give their client the freedom to decline any help if they think that they do not need it.

Chronic pain might also get the person to start questioning their faith and/or wanting to have a deeper spiritual experience because of their pain and suffering.

The patient also needs to take time to participate in some fun activities. They may need to check out of the facility/hospital or get out of the house occasionally preventing an association of hospitals with pain. This further helps the patients keep their sanity and keeps them psychologically sound.

They may need a nurse who is qualified in palliative care. Some may be dying and they need respect and dignity as they die in pain. They also need a nurse who is non-judgmental and one who is also compassionate and caring. The family has to be involved to help the client better manage the pain. One very important quality is co-ordinating the best care for the client and some amount of diplomacy and empathy.

In some cases, such as with [[diabetes]] or [[sleep apnea]], the treatment is long term and difficult for patients to understand and comply with. In these cases [[chronic care management]] is highly recommended to help the patient learn about the consequences of refusing treatment and how to best follow treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">The term '''course of dealing''' is defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303 UCC § 1-303(b)]. "Course of dealing," as defined in subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a "[[course of performance]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cmt. 2, UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, according to the [[parol evidence rule]], words and terms in a writing intended to be the final expression of the agreement of the parties may not be contradicted by extrinsic evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement, extrinsic evidence in the form of course of dealing nonetheless may be used to explain or supplement the writing. An [[integration clause]] in a contract, stating that the parties intend the writing to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement does not suffice to negate the importance of course of dealing, "because these are such an integral part of the contract that they are not normally disclaimed by general language in the [[merger clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Allapattah Servs. v. Exxon Corp.'', 61 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1314 (S.D. Fla. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the common law, extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing could be considered only the written contract was ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;See, e,g, ''Pepcol Mfg. v. Denver Union Corp.'', 687 P.2d 1310, 1314 (Colo. 1984) ("It is only where the terms of an agreement are ambiguous or used in some special or technical sense not apparent from the contractual document itself that the court may look beyond the four corners of the agreement in order to determine the meaning intended by the parties.").&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, "Under the UCC, the lack of facial ambiguity in the contract language is basically irrelevant to whether extrinsic evidence ought to be considered by the court as an initial matter."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Amoco Prod. Co. v. W. Slope Gas Co.'', 754 F.2d 303, 307-08 (10th Cir. 1985). See also Cmt. 1(c), UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303: "This section definitely rejects the requirement that a condition precedent to the admissibility of the type of evidence specified in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the court that the language used is ambiguous.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of course of dealing will be disallowed, however, if it is "carefully negated" in the parties' contract by "specific and unequivocal" language.&lt;ref&gt;''Precision Fitness Equip., Inc. v. Nautilus, Inc.'', Civil Action No. 08-cv-01228-CMA-KLM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13576, at *25 (D. Colo. Feb. 2, 2011) (collecting cases). In that case the parties carefully negated course of dealing by including the following sentence in the Agreement: "Past practice and terms of dealing between [Nautilus] and [Precision], or in the industry generally, shall not be used to .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. interpret the terms of this Agreement."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term is usually used in US contract law, where the parties' course of dealing helps the court to understand the intention of the contracting parties, it is also used elsewhere in the law. In US patent law the term is used to help interpret the meaning of words used in patent claims by examining the prosecution history of a patent to determine what meaning the applicant and patent examiner understood claim words to have. It has been observed in the [[Federal Circuit]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The prosecution history often proves useful in determining a patent's scope, for it reveals the course of dealing with the Patent Office, which may show a particular meaning attached to the terms, or a position taken by the applicant to ensure that the patent would issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 52 F.3d 967, 991 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (concurring opinion of Mayer, J).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Datooga''' is a [[Nilotic language]] or [[dialect cluster]] of the [[Southern Nilotic]] group. It is spoken by the [[Datooga people]] of the [[East African Rift|Great Rift Valley]] of [[Tanzania]]. The name is variously spelled ''Datog'', ''Datoga'', ''Tatoga'' or ''Tatog.'' The [[Sukuma language|Sukuma]] name ''Taturu'' is also sometimes used in English; the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name ''Mang'ati'' comes from [[Maasai language|Maasai]], where it means "enemy". However, it is not considered offensive to the Datooga, as there is a degree of pride in being the historic enemy of the Maasai, and ''Mang'ati'' has become the standard name for the group in Swahili. In addition, numerous tribal and dialectal names may be found for the people or language as a whole. 

The Datooga have been claimed to be one of the least educated peoples in Tanzania, and there is almost no literacy in the language; literacy in Swahili has been reported to be very low in some communities. However, the Barabaig and Gisamjang dialects have been written, and some work is being done on Asimjeeg.

==Varieties==
Dialect diversity is great enough to make [[mutual intelligibility]] difficult, and Blench (2000) lists East Datooga and West Datooga as distinct languages. Dialects are often assumed to correspond to the seven Datooga tribes, but the speech of the Gisamjanga (Kisamajeng, Gisamjang) and the [[Barabaig]], for example, are very close, and can be considered a single dialect. The other dialects, with alternate spellings, are: 

*Bajuta
*Barabayiiga (Barabaig, Barabayga, Barabaik, Barbaig)
*Asimjeeg (Tsimajeega, Isimijeega)
*Rootigaanga (Rotigenga, Rotigeenga)
*Buraadiiga (Buradiga, Bureadiga)
*Bianjiida (Biyanjiida, Utatu)

''Ethnologue'' 16 mentions several other varieties of uncertain nature: ''Darorajega, Gidang'odiga, Bisiyeda, Daragwajega, Salawajega, Ghumbiega, Mangatiga,'' the last presumably just the Maasai and Swahili name. The suffixes ''-da'' and ''-ga'' on these names and many Datooga nouns are equivalent to English ''the'' .

==Grammar==
Datooga has been strongly influenced by [[South Cushitic languages]] previously spoken in the area where Datooga has taken over. In turn, Datooga has strongly influenced the [[Iraqw language]] which has occupied much former Datooga territory and has absorbed Datooga through intermarriage; for example, the Iraqw use Datooga vocabulary for poetic language. 

Some varieties of Datooga have a verb-initial [[word order]], but the relative order of subject and object reflects pragmatic concerns. [[Grammatical case]] in the Gisamjanga variety is marked by [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] in a [[marked nominative]] system. Numbers follow nouns, and question words come at the end of a clause. The [[numeral system]] is [[vigesimal]], but domestic animals are counted in pairs, so that the word used for 'five' when counting other objects means 'ten' when referring to goats or cattle. 

Final vowels are often [[devoiced]] in Gisamjanga and Barabaig, as may be the consonants which proceed them, which is why ''Barabayiiga'' for example is commonly transcribed as ''Barabaik.''

==Phonology==
Bajuta Datooga is typical. The consonants are as follows: 

{|class="wikitable IPA"
!nasal 
|m||n||ɲ||ŋ|| ||
|-
!plosive
|b||d||ɟ||k||ɢ||ʔ
|-
!fricative
|(f)||s||ʃ||x|| ||
|-
!sonorant
| ||l, r||j||w|| ||
|}

Plosives are [[voiceless consonant|devoiced]] word-finally and when adjacent to another plosive or a fricative. ''Datooga'' {{IPA|[dɑtˑɔːkɑ̥]}} is underlyingly {{IPA|/tattooka/}} (or equivalently {{IPA|/daddooɡa/}}); the voiceless [t] is longer than a voiced [d]. There is also no distinction between [h] and a [[zero onset]] to a syllable.&lt;!--not clear if the /x/ in the chart, which is written {{angbr|h}}, is this sound.--&gt;

The '''''Durham Plant-Name Glossary''''' (MS Durham, Cathedral Library, Hunter 100) is an glossary translating Latin and Greek plant-names into [[Old English language|Old English]]/[[Middle English language|Middle English]]. It was copied in Durham in the early twelfth century. Its principal sources were Greek-Latin-Old English plant-name glossary whose lemmata come from [[Dioscorides]]’s ''[[De materia medica]]'', which also contributed lemmata and glosses to the [[Épinal-Erfurt glossaries]], and those entries in the ''[[Old English Herbarium]]'' which translate Latin plant-names with vernacular plant-names.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beiträge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941), esp. pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; A text very like the ''Durham Plant-Name Glossary'' was one major source of the more extensive ''[[Laud Herbal Glossary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rusche, Philip Guthrie. 2008. ‘The sources for plant names in Anglo-Saxon England and the Laud Herbal Glossary’, in ''Health and Healing in the Medieval Garden'', ed. by Peter Dendle and Alan Touwaide, 128–44.

== What differentiates them from other bacterial pathogens? ==
ESKAPE pathogens are differentiated from other pathogens due to their increased resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as [[penicillin]], [[vancomycin]], [[methicillin]], [[carbapenem]]s, and more. This increased resistance, combined with the clinical significance of these bacteria in the medical field, results in a necessity to understand their mechanisms of resistance and combat them with novel antibiotics. Common mechanisms for resistance include the production of enzymes that attack the structure of antibiotics (for example, [[Beta-lactamase|β-lactamases]] inactivating [[Beta-lactam|β-lactam]] antibiotics), modification of the target site that the antibiotic targets so that it can no longer bind properly, efflux pumps, and biofilm production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santajit|first=Sirijan|last2=Indrawattana|first2=Nitaya|date=2016|title=Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance in ESKAPE Pathogens|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2475067|journal=BioMed Research International|language=en|volume=2016|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2016/2475067|issn=2314-6133|pmc=4871955|pmid=27274985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efflux pumps are a feature of the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that allows them to constantly pump out foreign material, including antibiotics, so that the inside of the cell never contains a high enough concentration of the drug to have an effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Biofilms are a mixture of diverse microbial communities and polymers that protect the bacteria from antibiotic treatment by acting as a physical barrier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Clinical Threats ==
Due to their heightened resistance to frequently used antibiotics, these pathogens pose an additional threat to the safety of the general population, particularly those who frequently interact with hospital environments, as they most commonly contribute to [[Hospital-acquired infection|hospital-acquired infections (HAI)]]. The increased antimicrobial resistance profile of these pathogens varies, however they arise from similar causes. One common cause of antibiotic resistance due to incorrect dosing. When a sub-therapeutic dose is prescribed, or a patient chooses to use less of their prescribed antibiotic, bacteria are given the opportunity to adapt to the treatment. At lower doses, or when a course of antibiotics is not completed, certain strains of the bacteria develop drug-resistant strains through the process of natural selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to the random genetic mutations that are constantly occurring in many forms of living organisms, bacteria and humans included. Natural selection supports the persistence of strains of bacteria that have developed a certain mutation that allows them to survive. Some strains are also able to participate in inter-strain [[horizontal gene transfer]], allowing them to pass resistance genes from one pathogen to another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be particularly problematic in [[Hospital-acquired infection|nosocomial]] infections, where bacteria are constantly exposed to antibiotics and those benefiting from resistance as a result of random genetic mutations can share this resistance with bacteria in the area that have not yet developed this resistance on their own. [[Gram-negative bacteria]] seem to be particularly able to adapt to certain disinfectants, such as [[Benzalkonium chloride|benzalkonium chloride (BAC)]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kampf|first=G.|date=2018|title=Adaptive microbial response to low-level benzalkonium chloride exposure|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2018.05.019|journal=Journal of Hospital Infection|volume=100|issue=3|pages=e1–e22|doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2018.05.019|issn=0195-6701|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacterial profiles ==

=== ''Enterococcus faecium'' ===
''Enterococcus faecium'' is a [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] rod-shaped ([[bacillus]]) bacteria, most commonly involved in HAI in immunocompromised patients. It often exhibits a resistance to [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s including penicillin and other last resort antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There has also been a rise in [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE)]] strains, including an increase in ''E. faecium'' resistance to vancomycin, particularly vancomycin-A.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These vancomycin-resistant strains display a profound ability to develop and share their resistance through horizontal gene transfer, as well as code for virulence factors that control phenotypes. These virulence phenotypes range from thicker [[biofilm]]s to allowing them to grow in a variety of environments including medical devices such as urinary catheters and prosthetic heart valves within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Philip S|last2=William Costerton|first2=J|date=2001|title=Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05321-1|journal=The Lancet|volume=358|issue=9276|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)05321-1|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thicker biofilms act as a “mechanical and biochemical shield” that protects the bacteria from the antibiotics and are the most effective protective mechanism that bacteria have against treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ===
''S. aureus'' is a [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] round-shaped ([[coccus]]) bacteria that is commonly found as a part of the human skin [[microbiota]] and is typically not harmful in humans with non-compromised immune systems in these environments. However, ''S. aureus'' has the ability to cause infections when it enters parts of the body that it does not typically inhabit, such as wounds. Similar to ''E. faecium'', ''S. aureus'' can also cause infections on implanted medical devices and form biofilms that make treatment with antibiotics more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, approximately 25% of ''S. aureus'' strains secrete the [[Toxic shock syndrome toxin|TSST-1]] [[exotoxin]] responsible for causing [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'', or [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], includes strains distinct from other strains of ''S. aureus'' in the fact that they have developed resistance to [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s. Some also express an [[exotoxin]] that has been known to cause “necrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia” in those who suffer from infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Vancomycin]] and similar antibiotics are typically the first choices for treatment of MRSA infections, however from this vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'', or [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|VRSA]] (VISA for those with intermediate resistance) strains have emerged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' ===
''K. pneumoniae'' is a [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] rod-shaped ([[bacillus]]) bacteria that is particularly adept to accepting resistance genes in horizontal gene transfer. It is commonly also resistant to [[phagocyte]] treatment due to its thick biofilm with strong adhesion to neighboring cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain strains have also developed [[Beta-lactamase|β-lactamases]] that allow them to be resistant many of the commonly used antibiotics, including [[carbapenem]]s, which has lead to the creation of carbapenem-resistant ''K. pneumoniae'' (CRKP), for which there are very few antibiotics in development that can treat infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' ===
''Acinetobacter baumannii'' is most common in hospitals, which has allowed for the development of resistance to all known antimicrobials. The Gram-negative short-rod-shaped ([[coccobacillus]]) ''A. baumannii'' thrives in a number of unaccommodating environments due to its tolerance to a variety of temperatures, [[pH]]s, nutrient levels, as well as dry environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Gram-negative aspects of the membrane surface of ''A. baumannii,'' including the [[Efflux (microbiology)#Bacterial efflux pumps|efflux pump]] and outer membrane, affords it a wider range of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, some problematic ''A. baumannii'' strains are able to acquire families of efflux pumps from other species, and commonly first to develop new β-lactamases to improve β-lactam resistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas'' ''aeruginosa'' ===
The Gram-negative, rod-shaped ([[bacillus]]) bacteria ''P. aeurginosa'' is ubiquitous hydrocarbon degrader that is able to survive in extreme environments as well as in soil and many more common environments. Because of this versatility, it survives quite well in the lungs of patients suffering from late-stage [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also benefits from the same previously mentioned Gram-negative resistance factors as ''A. baumannii.'' Mutants of ''P. aeurginosa'' with upregulated efflux pumps also exist that make finding an effective antibiotic or detergent incredibly difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are also some [[Multiple drug resistance|multi-drug resistant (MDR)]] strains of ''P. aeruginosa'' that express β-lactamases as well as upregulated efflux pumps which can make treatment particularly difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Enterobacter ===
''Enterobacter'' encompasses a family of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]], rod-shaped ([[bacillus]]) species of bacteria. Some strains cause [[Urinary tract infection|urinary tract (UTI)]] and blood infections and are resistant to multiple drug therapies, which therefore puts the human population in critical need for the development of novel and effective antibiotic treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronald|first=Allan|date=July 2002|title=The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01055-0|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=113|issue=1|pages=14–19|doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(02)01055-0|issn=0002-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colistin]] and [[tigecycline]] are two of the only antibiotics currently used for treatment, and there are seemingly no other viable antibiotics in development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some ''Enterobacter'' species, a 5- 300 fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration was observed when exposed to several gradually increasing concentrations of [[Benzalkonium chloride|benzalkonium chloride (BAC)]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other Gram-negative bacterias (including ''Enterobacter'', but also ''Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella'' species, and more) also displayed a similar ability to adapt to the disinfectant BAC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the [[Dutch language]], the '''gender''' of a noun determines the articles, adjective forms and pronouns that are used in reference to that noun. Gender is a complicated topic in Dutch, because depending on the geographical area or each individual speaker, there are either three genders in a regular structure or a two genders in a dichotomous structure (neuter/common with vestiges of a three-gender structure). Both are identified and maintained in formal language.

==Overview==

Traditionally, nouns in Dutch, like in [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], have retained the three [[grammatical gender]]s found in the older forms of all Germanic languages: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Almost all Dutch speakers maintain the neuter gender, which has distinct adjective inflection, definite article and some pronouns. The picture is less clear for the masculine and feminine gender, because in the standard language the adjective inflection of both is identical, and both share the same article and the same demonstrative pronouns. The standard language mostly distinguishes masculine and feminine genders by the use of the personal pronoun, which is ''hij'' for masculine nouns and ''zij'' for feminine nouns. It is also distinguished in the case forms of the definite article and some pronouns, but those have fallen out of use and are only retained in literary or archaic usage and fixed expressions.

In Belgium and southern dialects of the Netherlands, the distinction between the three genders is usually, but not always, maintained. Words that were traditionally feminine are still referred to with ''zij'', whereas traditionally masculine words retain the use of ''hij''. However, in the case of persons and animals of known sex the pronouns used are generally determined by the biological sex rather than by the grammatical gender of the word.

In most remaining parts of the Netherlands and in Suriname, the distinction between masculine and feminine nouns has disappeared, producing a common gender that uses the same inflections and pronouns as the original masculine. The pronouns ''hij'' and ''zij'' are used when the referent has a natural gender, so ''hij'' is used for a male person, ''zij'' for a female person. However, when the noun is inanimate and has no natural gender, the pronoun ''hij'' is used not only for traditionally masculine nouns, but for traditionally feminine nouns as well. Thus, the situation in these areas resembles that of English, although there is still a distinction among inanimate nouns between common ''hij'' and neuter ''het'' (English uses ''it'' for both, having lost all gender distinctions in inanimate nouns).

==The standard language==

In the written tradition, which forms the base for the (prescribed) standard language, there are some remains of the traditional three genders. The following table shows the use of various articles and pronouns in the standard form of Dutch, as well as how the use of gender in the two language areas aligns with this. In areas maintaining the three genders, there is no common gender. In areas with only two genders, only nouns referring to people have a distinction between masculine and feminine, all other nouns that are not neuter are common.

The standard as prescribed by the [[Dutch Language Union]] categorises most nouns into one of four categories:

* neuter, marked ''o'' (for ''onzijdig'') in Dutch or ''n'' in English;
* masculine, marked ''m'';
* feminine, marked ''v'' (for ''vrouwelijk'') in Dutch or ''f'' in English; and
* feminine but optionally masculine, marked ''v/m'' in Dutch or ''f/m'' in English.

Thus, the standard only mandates the feminine gender for a subset of all historically feminine nouns. These are nouns with an overtly recognizable feminine suffix. However, this distinction is maintained only in formal or written standard Dutch, whereas many speakers do not make such a distinction in informal speech; they use only the common gender. Such speakers must therefore remember which endings are feminine, because they cannot rely on their own language intuition. Although some speakers do follow the standard in this respect, others do not and simply use the genders the way they are accustomed to them in their own everyday speech (either masculine/feminine/neuter or common/neuter).

In more formal, poetic or archaic language, a stronger distinction exists between the masculine and feminine genders, especially in the genitive forms as shown in the table below (although the distinctions in the bottom row are still commonly applied in informal speech):

The trend so far is towards the increasing use of the common gender, at the expense of the masculine/feminine distinction. Although this process has long been completed in the spoken language of the north, the three gender structure is still widespread in the south, though some suggest it is slowly losing ground due to the increase of language contact through mass media like [[television]] and the [[Internet]]. Some dictionaries have dropped the distinction between the two genders entirely, preferring to mark words with their definite article ''de'' (common) or ''het'' (neuter), whereas others like the [[Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal]]—the largest Dutch dictionary—retain it. Because the feminine gender of nouns tends to be respected in formal or written language, which tends to follow the standard more strictly, this sometimes also results in [[hypercorrection]], caused by the perceived formality of the feminine gender, with feminine pronouns occasionally used for nouns that are historically masculine, and even for nouns that are neuter.

The following list reflects the use of gender that is prescribed for standard Dutch and used by the Language Union and educational material for teaching gender. It is not exhaustive, and covers only cases that follow some recognizable pattern. Many words have unpredictable gender and simply have to be memorized (and will be ''f/m'' in the standard, if not neuter).

===Masculine nouns===

Words referring to animate entities whose natural gender is masculine:
* ''oom'' "uncle"
* ''hengst'' "stallion"

However, diminutives such as ''jongetje'' "little boy" are neuter nouns. Nouns for professions (which are often historically masculine) may also be treated as gender-neutral, and are then either masculine or feminine depending on the referent.

Words ending in the following suffixes, which mostly form [[agent noun]]s, are masculine:
* '''-aar''' – ''handel'''aar''''' "merchant"
* '''-aard''' – ''dronk'''aard''''' "drunkard"
* '''-er''' – ''bakk'''er''''' "baker"
* '''-erd''' – ''eng'''erd''''' "creep"
* '''-eur''' – ''direct'''eur''''' "manager"
* '''-or''' – ''kolonisat'''or''''' "colonizer"
* '''-us''' – ''politic'''us''''' "politician"

There are a few exceptions, such as:
* ''moed'''er''''' "mother", fem.
* ''bak'''er''''' "midwife", fem.
* ''off'''er''''' "sacrifice", neuter

Abstract [[deverbal noun]]s are normally masculine:
* ''bloei'' "blossoming", from ''bloeien'' "to blossom"
* ''dank'' "thanks", from ''danken'' "to thank"
* ''groei'' "growth", from ''groeien'' "to grow"
* ''schrik'' "fear", from ''schrikken'' "to be frightened"
* ''slaap'' "sleep", from ''slapen'' "to sleep"

New abstract nouns formed in this way are always masculine. However, some may be feminine, particularly if they are older words.

===Feminine nouns===

Words referring to animate objects whose natural gender is feminine:
* ''tante'' "aunt"
* ''merrie'' "mare"

This includes words ending in a suffix that derives a noun for a female person from either a masculine noun or from another word:
* '''-a''' – ''politic'''a''''' "female politician" and ''theoretic'''a''''' "female theoretician" - this suffix can only be used on masculine loan words of Latin origin ending on -us, like ''politicus'' "male politician" or ''theoreticus'' "male theoretician".
* '''-e''' – ''advocat'''e''''' "female lawyer"
* '''-ege/-egge''' – ''diev'''egge''''' "female thief" - this suffix is no longer productive; it can also be encountered in its contracted form -'''ei''', e.g., ''klapp'''ei''''' and ''labb'''ei''''' &lt;ref&gt;http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=WNT&amp;id=M015718&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/dievegge&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''-es''' – ''zanger'''es''''' "female singer"
* '''-in''' – ''god'''in''''' "goddess"
* '''-ster''' – ''verpleeg'''ster''''' "nurse"

The Dutch language leaves in many cases some liberty to individual users on how to derive the female form of a noun; for example ''apotheker'''es''''', ''apotheker'''in''''' and ''apotheek'''ster''''' would all be considered correct forms for "female apothecarian".

However, diminutives such as ''meisje'' "girl" are neuter (but see below).

Words for abstract concepts ending with the following suffixes are feminine:
* '''-de''' – ''lief'''de''''' "love"
* '''-erij''' – ''brouw'''erij''' "brewery"
* '''-heid''' – ''waar'''heid''''' "truth"
* '''-ij''' – ''voogd'''ij''''' "custody"
* '''-ing''' – ''opleid'''ing''''' "education"
* '''-nis''' – ''ken'''nis''''' "knowledge"
* '''-schap''' – ''vriend'''schap''''' "friendship"
* '''-st''' – ''win'''st''''' "profit"
* '''-te''' – ''ziek'''te''''' "illness"

There are a few exceptions, e.g. ''dien'''st''''' "service", which is masculine, or ''von'''nis''''' "verdict", which is neuter. There are also many nouns ending in ''-schap'' that are neuter, such as ''gereedschap'' "tool", ''landschap'' "landscape". These usually refer to concrete objects rather than abstract concepts, but the distinction is not always clear. For example, ''ouderschap'' "parenthood" is neuter but abstract, whereas ''gemeenschap'' "community" is feminine but concrete.

Suffixes that are borrowed from Latin or Greek often retain their feminine gender from those languages. This includes:
* '''-ade''' – ''tir'''ade''''' "tirade"
* '''-age''' – ''tuig'''age''''' "rigging"
* '''-ica''' – ''log'''ica''''' "logic"
* '''-ide''' – ''astero'''ïde''''' "asteroid"
* '''-ie''' – ''filosof'''ie''''' "philosophy"
* '''-iek''' – ''muz'''iek''''' "music"
* '''-ine''' – ''discipl'''ine''''' "discipline"
* '''-logie''' – ''zoö'''logie''''' "zoology"
* '''-ode''' – ''peri'''ode''''' "period"
* '''-se''' – ''analy'''se''''' "analysis"
* '''-sis''' – ''cri'''sis''''' "crisis"
* '''-suur''' – ''cen'''suur''''' "censorship"
* '''-teit''' – ''kwali'''teit''''' "quality"
* '''-theek''' – ''biblio'''theek''''' "library"
* '''-tis''' – ''bronchi'''tis''''' "bronchitis"
* '''-tuur''' – ''na'''tuur''''' "nature"
* '''-ude''' – ''amplit'''ude''''' "amplitude"
* '''-xis''' – ''synta'''xis''''' "syntax"

There are, as always, a few exceptions. For example, ''kanar'''ie''''' "canary" is masculine and ''minister'''ie''''' "ministry" is neuter.

===Neuter nouns===

[[Diminutive]]s are always neuter. They end in ''-je'' in the standard language, but the suffix ''-ke'' is also used in many dialects.
* ''bloempje'' "little flower"
* ''lammetje'' "little lamb"
* ''meisje'' "girl" (etymological translation "little maid"), counterintuitive as clearly feminine (same matter as in German ''Mädchen'')

When a diminutive refers to a person, masculine or feminine pronouns may be used to refer to the person instead of the neuter ''het''. However, the definite article, demonstrative pronouns, and adjective inflection remain neuter. The exception is ''meisje'', of whose gender (neuter) hardly anyone is aware of this even in formal speech, using feminine pronouns to refer to the word. Whilst this is officially incorrect, the proper usage, e.g. ''kijk dat meisje, het kamt zijn haar'' (look at that girl, "it" is combing "its" hair), is often perceived as queer especially in speech. Almost everyone treats ''meisje'' as a feminine word, with the exception of its article. The same applies to ''jongetje'', ''mannetje'' ("little man"), ''vrouwtje'' ("little woman"), etc.

Nouns prefixed with ''ge-'' with no suffix are neuter, especially if they are collectives derived from a verb stem:
* '''''ge'''zicht'' "face"
* '''''ge'''slacht'' "gender, sex"
* '''''ge'''luid'' "sound"
* '''''ge'''loop'' "walking"
* '''''ge'''zeur'' "whining"

Collective nouns prefixed with ''ge-'' and suffixed with ''-te'' are neuter:
* '''''ge'''berg'''te''''' "mountain range"
* '''''ge'''raam'''te''''' "frame (of person), skeleton"
* '''''ge'''steen'''te''''' "stones, minerals"

Nouns prefixed with ''ge-'' and suffixed with ''-te'' are feminine if they are abstract concepts, such as ''gedachte'' "thought".

Names of towns, countries and languages are always neuter, even if they are clearly derived from a masculine, feminine or even plural noun:
* ''Brussel'' "Brussels"
* ''Nederland'' "the Netherlands" (''land'' is also neuter)
* ''Frans'' "French"
* ''Denemarken'' "Denmark" (''marken'' is plural)
* ''Roermond'' (''mond'' is masculine)
The exceptions are formed by countries or regions that contain a masculine or feminine article as part of their name: ''de [[Randstad]]'' (''stad'' is feminine), ''de [[Sudan|Soedan]]'', ''de [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]'', etc.

The following suffixes that are borrowed from Latin or Greek are neuter:
* '''-isme''' – ''social'''isme''''' "socialism"
* '''-ma''' – ''the'''ma''''' "theme"
* '''-um''' – ''muse'''um''''' "museum"

There is one notable exception, ''dat'''um''''' (date), which is masculine, and has both a "regular" plural in ''datums'' (perceived as wrong by most speakers) and the original Latin neuter plural in ''data''.

==The Southern Dutch regiolect==
Southern Dutch consists roughly of all dialects south of the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. In these dialects, there was a tendency towards ''accusativism'' in early modern Dutch (16th and 17th centuries). This was the tendency to use the accusative case in the role of the nominative. When cases fell out of use later, the nominative was the one that survived, but in areas with accusativism these forms historically belonged to the accusative case. Unlike the old nominative, the accusative had a clear distinction between masculine and feminine forms. As it was these forms that survived in southern Dutch, the genders remained naturally distinct, and remain so up to the present day.

In addition, Southern Dutch developed a separate indefinite article for neuter words—"e" or "ee(n)"—which is pronounced as a schwa (IPA: ə).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6067703/Variatie_en_verandering_in_het_Nederlandse_genus_een_multidisciplinair_perspectief|title=Variatie en verandering in het Nederlandse genus: een multidisciplinair perspectief|first1=Cornips|last1=Leonie|first2=Gunther|last2=De Vogelaer|page=1|publisher=|journal=Taal en tongval|volume=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=82XOJ-q1b1sC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=brabants+dialect+lidwoord+e&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U0VOVbvMLa6P7AbCpYDQCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=brabants+dialect+lidwoord+e&amp;f=false|title=Vlaams-Brabants en Antwerps|first1=Miet|last1=Ooms|first2=Jacques van|last2=Keymeulen|date=29 July 2017|publisher=Lannoo Uitgeverij|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbnl.org/tekst/_taa011193601_01/_taa011193601_01_0066.php#66|title=Onze Taaltuin.

The following table shows the points where the southern dialects differ from the standard language. As the dialects themselves are not standardised, different forms may be found in different areas, although differences have lessened in the [[Tussentaal]], the Dutch regiolect in the Region of Flanders.

* Standard: ''Ik heb mijn auto onder die boom geparkeerd.''
* English: ''I parked my car beneath that tree.''

Example 3: (''appartement'' and ''dorp'' are neuter)
* Southern ''Ik woon in een appartement in '''e''' klein dorp.''

* English: ''I live in an apartment in a small village.''

==Gender-neutral language==
{{see also|Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender}}
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
Unlike English (with the use of "[[singular they|they]]" as the singular gender-neutral pronoun) or Swedish (which developed the new gender-neutral pronoun "[[hen (pronoun)|hen]]"), Dutch did not develop a gender-neutral pronoun. As a consequence, Dutch employs a variety of means to accommodate cases where the gender of a person is not known. Standard solutions include the use of [[wikt:degene#Dutch|''degene'']] ("the one"; unstressed) and [[wikt:diegene#Dutch|''diegene'']] ("that one"; stressed). More formally, the word ''alwie'' ("any(one) who") may be employed.

'''Glyphosate-based herbicides''' are usually made of a [[glyphosate]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] that is combined with other ingredients that are needed to [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilize]] the [[herbicide]] formula and allow penetration into plants. The glyphosate-based herbicide [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] was first developed by [[Monsanto]] in the 1970s. It is used most heavily on [[corn]], [[soy]], and [[cotton]] crops that have been  [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] to be resistant to the herbicide. Some products include two active ingredients, such as [[Enlist Duo]] which includes [[2,4-D]] as well as glyphosate. As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market. The names of inert ingredients used in glyphosate formulations are usually not listed on the [[Label#Products|product labels]].

Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides have low [[acute toxicity]] in [[mammal]]s. They likewise have not been shown to pose a significant risk to human health during normal use, although human deaths have been reported from deliberate ingestion of [[The dose makes the poison|concentrated]] RoundUp. It is difficult to determine how much [[surfactant]]s contribute to the overall toxicity of each formulation. Glyphosate formulations containing the surfactant [[polyethoxylated tallow amine]] (POEA) are sometimes used terrestrially, but are not approved for aquatic use in the US due to their toxicity to aquatic organisms.

The [[scientific consensus|consensus]] among national [[pesticide]] regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that there is no evidence that the active ingredient glyphosate is [[carcinogenicity|carcinogenic]] for humans. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has classified glyphosate as a Group E chemical, meaning the agency has determined there is "evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans". The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) is the only agency that has classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic".

There have been multiple lawsuits against Monsanto asserting that exposure to glyphosate herbicides is carcinogenic and that the company did not adequately disclose the risk to consumers. In 2018 a California jury awarded $289 million in damages to a groundskeeper who argued that Monsanto failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicides.&lt;ref name="ABC-11Aug2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monsanto ordered to pay $289 million to man who claims Roundup weed killer caused cancer |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-11/monsanto-ordered-to-pay-289-million-to-school-groundskeeper/10109352 |accessdate=7 October 2018 |agency=AP |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=abc.net.au |date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The glyphosate-based herbicide RoundUp (styled: Round''up'') was first developed in the 1970s by Monsanto. Glyphosate-based herbicides were initially used in a similar way to [[paraquat]] and [[diquat]], as non-selective herbicides. Attempts were made to apply them to row crops, but problems with crop damage kept glyphosate-based herbicides from being widely used for this purpose. In the USA, use of glyphosate experienced rapid growth following the commercial introduction of a [[Genetically modified soybean#Roundup Ready Soybean|glyphosate-resistant soybean]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duke |first1=Stephen O. |title=The history and current status of glyphosate |journal=Pest Management Science |date=June 2017 |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=1027–1034 |doi=10.1002/ps.4652 |pmid=28643882 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdaarsfacpub/1766/ |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1996 sales of RoundUp increased around 20% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Top-selling herbicide not close to withering| work = Wall Street Journal| accessdate = 2018-08-12| date = 1996-01-08| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22746669/topselling_herbicide_not_close_to/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180813111128/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22746669/topselling_herbicide_not_close_to/| archive-date = 2018-08-13| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}} it is used in over 160 countries.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{Cite web| title = What Do We Really Know About Roundup Weed Killer?| work = National Geographic News| accessdate = 2018-08-13| date = 2015-04-23| url = https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150422-glyphosate-roundup-herbicide-weeds/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180813111122/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150422-glyphosate-roundup-herbicide-weeds/| archive-date = 2018-08-13| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; RoundUp is used most heavily on corn, soy, and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to withstand the chemical, but since 2012 glyphosate was used in [[California]] to treat other crops like [[almond]], [[peach]], [[cantaloupe]], [[onion]], [[cherry]], [[sweet corn]], and [[citrus]].&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;

==Inert ingredients==
Surfactants, [[solvent]]s, and [[preservative]]s are inert ingredients, or [[Agricultural spray adjuvant|adjuvants]], that are commonly added to glyphosate-based herbicide formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.9374| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 114| issue = 12| pages = 1803–1806| last1 = Cox| first1 = Caroline| last2 = Surgan| first2 = Michael| title = Unidentified Inert Ingredients in Pesticides: Implications for Human and Environmental Health| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2006| pmid = 17185266| pmc = 1764160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some products contain all the necessary adjuvants, including surfactant; some contain no adjuvant system, while other products contain only a limited amount of adjuvant.

[[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]] (POEA) is a surfactant added to Roundup and other herbicides as a [[wetting]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 61| last = Bakke| first = David| title = Analysis of Issues Surrounding the Use of Spray Adjuvants With Herbicides}}&lt;/ref&gt; POEA is not a single surfactant, but a complex mixture. The composition of each POEA surfactant is a proprietary [[trade secret]]. Monsanto's RoundUp, for example, contains a proprietary POEA surfactant called MON 0818 at a 15% concentration.&lt;ref name=SERA2003&gt;{{Cite| title = Glyphosate: Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment |  publisher= Syracuse Environmental Research Associates, Inc.(SERA) |accessdate = 2018-08-20| url = https://www.fs.fed.us/r5/hfqlg/publications/herbicide_info/2003_glyphosate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory history==

===European Union===
As part of the process to renew glyphosate's license under [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], a 2013 systematic review by the German [[Federal Institute for Risk Assessment]] (Bfr) of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological studies]] of workers exposed to glyphosate formulations found no significant risk,{{Vague|date=August 2018}} stating that "the available data are contradictory and far from being convincing".&lt;ref name=BFR2014&gt;Renewal Assessment Report: Glyphosate. Volume 1. Report and Proposed Decision. December 18, 2013. German Institute for Risk Assessment, pages 64-65. Downloaded from http://dar.efsa.europa.eu/dar-web/provision {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130105523/http://dar.efsa.europa.eu/dar-web/provision |date=2009-01-30 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, as part of the ongoing renewal process, the  [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) published a final risk assessment on 12 November 2015 stating that glyphosate met EU-level regulatory standards. Despite classifying glyphosate as non-carcinogenic, this report also acknowledged that some of the co-formulants added to glyphosate based pesticides "appeared to have toxic effects higher than the glyphosate itself", noting POEA in particular. The conclusion of the final EFSA assessment was that the active ingredient glyphosate met EU-level regulatory standards, but individual formulations would have to be evaluated by member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-3-319-52736-9| last = Bozzini| first = Emanuela| title = Pesticide Policy and Politics in the European Union: Regulatory Assessment, Implementation and Enforcement| date = 2017-03-23 |pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was insufficient support among the Member States for a 2016 [[European Commission]] proposal to renew the approval of glyphosate. Because the 2015 EFSA and IARC assessments had reached contradictory conclusions regarding the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate, the [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) was asked to assess the [[hazard]] properties of the substance. Though no majority of Member States voted either for or against the renewal proposal, in July 2016 they voted to amend the conditions of glyphosate's existing approval. The new conditions require Member States to minimize the pre-harvest use of glyphosate products, as well as use in certain public places. Formulations that include the surfactant POEA were banned. These conditions were later included in the [[implementing act]] for the 5-year renewal that was approved on 12 December 2017.&lt;ref name=ecc&gt;{{Cite web| title = Glyphosate - Food Safety - European Commission| work = Food Safety| accessdate = 2018-08-19| url = https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/glyphosate_en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2014 the EPA approved Enlist Duo, which was developed by [[Dow AgroSciences]]. This herbicide combined two active ingredients: [[2,4-D]] and glyphosate. Enlist Duo is intended for use with [[genetically modified crops]] that have also been developed by the [[Dow Chemical]] subsidiary. The initial approval was limited to the states of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = EPA Approves Dow's Enlist Herbicide for GMOs| work = Scientific American| accessdate = 2018-08-15| url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epa-approves-dow-s-enlist-herbicide-for-gmos/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160524094923/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epa-approves-dow-s-enlist-herbicide-for-gmos/| archive-date = 2016-05-24| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of litigation in 2015, the EPA found out that Dow had told the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] that Enlist Duo offers "synergistic herbicidal weed control", and requested additional clarification about the "synergistic effects" and sought to reverse its approval pending a full review of the new information provided by Dow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Busted: EPA Discovers Dow Weedkiller Claim, Wants It Off The Market| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2018-08-15| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/11/25/457393114/busted-epa-discovers-dow-weedkiller-claim-wants-it-off-the-market| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170825081925/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/11/25/457393114/busted-epa-discovers-dow-weedkiller-claim-wants-it-off-the-market| archive-date = 2017-08-25| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=callahan&gt;{{Cite web| last = Callahan| first = Patricia| title = Court clears way for revival of worrisome weedkiller| work = chicagotribune.com| accessdate = 2018-08-15| url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dow-enlist-duo-court-ruling-20160127-story.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180611090912/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dow-enlist-duo-court-ruling-20160127-story.html| archive-date = 2018-06-11| dead-url = no| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[9th Circuit]] rejected the EPA's petition to vacate its approval of the herbicide.&lt;ref name=callahan/&gt;

Severe skin burns are very rare.&lt;ref name="Bradberry_2004"/&gt; In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: "There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to glyphosate or co-formulants in glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations." The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/2f8b5c7f-030f-5d3a-e87e-0262fb392f38 Committee of Risk Assessment Opinion proposing harmonised classification and labelling at EU level of glyphosate (ISO); N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.&lt;ref name="Bradberry_2004"/&gt;

===Aquatic===
Glyphosate products for aquatic use generally do not use surfactants, and formulations with POEA are not approved for aquatic use due to aquatic organism toxicity.&lt;ref name="Langeland"&gt;{{cite web |title=SS-AGR-104 Safe Use of Glyphosate-Containing Products in Aquatic  and Upland Natural Areas |url= https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/AG/AG24800.pdf |publisher= University of Florida |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of POEA, glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone.&lt;ref name="Langeland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fs.fed.us"&gt;Gary L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34722">{{anchor|Fontpage|Display|Printer|Default}}In computing, a '''hardware code page''' ('''HWCP''') refers to a [[code page]] supported natively by a hardware device such as a [[display adapter]] or [[printer (computing)|printer]]. The [[glyph]]s to present the characters are stored in the [[alphanumeric character generator]]'s resident read-only memory (like [[Read-only memory|ROM]] or flash) and are thus not user-changeable.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XyWrite_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phoenix_1991_BIOS"/&gt; They are available for use by the system without having to load any [[computer font|font]] definitions into the device first. Startup messages issued by a [[Personal computer|PC]]'s [[System BIOS]] or displayed by an [[operating system]] before initializing its own code page switching logic and font management and before switching to [[graphics mode]] are displayed in a computer's '''default hardware code page'''.

==Code page assignments==
In North American [[IBM-compatible PC]]s, the hardware code page of the display adapter is typically [[code page 437]].&lt;ref name="Elliott_2005_MDA"/&gt; However, various portable machines&lt;ref name="HP_1985_PP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_1986_PP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_1991_95LXUG"/&gt; as well as (Eastern) European, Arabic, Middle Eastern and Asian PCs used a number of other code pages as their hardware code page,&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt; including [[code page 100]] ("Hebrew"),&lt;ref name="Paul_2002-09-05"/&gt; [[code page 151|151]] ("Nafitha Arabic"),&lt;ref name="Paul_2002-12-04"/&gt; [[code page 667|667]] ("[[Mazovia encoding|Mazovia]]"),&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt; [[code page 737|737]] ("Greek"), [[code page 850|850]] ("Multilingual"),&lt;ref name="HP_1991_95LXUG"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_OmniGo_300"/&gt; encodings like "[[HP Roman-8|Roman-8]]",&lt;ref name="HP_1985_PP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_1986_PP"/&gt; "[[Kamenický encoding|Kamenický]]",&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1992_Flyer"/&gt; "[[KOI-8]]", "[[MIK code page|MIK]]",&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt; and others. Most display adapters support a single 8-bit hardware code page only.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt; The [[bitmap]]s were often stored in an [[EPROM]]&lt;ref name="RBIL_61_INT15h_AX67C3h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott_2005_MDA"/&gt; in a [[DIP socket]].&lt;ref name="Elliott_2005_MDA"/&gt; At most, the hardware code page to be activated was user-selectable via [[jumper (computing)|jumper]]s,&lt;ref name="Derfler_1985"/&gt; configuration [[EEPROM]]s&lt;ref name="HP_1985_PP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_1986_PP"/&gt; or [[CMOS setup]].&lt;ref name="HP_1996_200LXUG"/&gt; However, some of the display adapters designed for Eastern European, Arabic and Hebrew PCs supported multiple software-''switchable'' hardware code pages, also named '''font pages''',&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt; selectable via I/O ports&lt;ref name="Elliott_2005_MDA"/&gt; or additional BIOS functions.&lt;ref name="RBIL_61_INT15h_AX67C3h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt;

In contrast to this, printers frequently support several user-switchable character sets, often including various variants of the 7-bit [[ISO/IEC 646]] character sets such as [[code page 367]] ("[[ISO/IEC 646-US]] / [[ASCII]]"&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;), sometimes also a couple of 8-bit code pages like [[code page 437]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1990_P90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; [[code page 850|850]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1990_P90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; [[code page 851|851]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt; [[code page 852|852]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1993_EPROMs"/&gt; [[code page 853|853]],&lt;ref name="Epson_1992_EPL-4300"/&gt; [[code page 855|855]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1993_EPROMs"/&gt; [[code page 857|857]],&lt;ref name="Epson_1992_EPL-4300"/&gt; [[code page 860|860]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1990_P90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; [[code page 861|861]],&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; [[code page 863|863]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1990_P90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; [[code page 865|865]],&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1990_P90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epson_1991_GQ"/&gt; and [[code page 866|866]].&lt;ref name="Fujitsu_1994_DL6400_DL6600"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEC_1993_EPROMs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FreeBSD_2016_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FreeBSD_2016_2"/&gt; Printers for the Eastern European or Middle Eastern markets sometimes support other locale-specific hardware code pages to choose from. They can be selected via [[DIP switch]]es or configuration menus on the printer, or via specific [[escape sequence]]s.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Escape_sequence_Epson_NEC"/&gt;

==Support in operating systems==
When operating systems initialize their code page switching logic, they need to know but have no means to determine the previously active hardware code page by themselves. Therefore, for code page switching to work correctly, the hardware code page needs to be specified.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;

Under [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] this is accomplished by specifying the hardware code page as a parameter (hwcp) to the [[device driver]]s [[DISPLAY.SYS]] and [[PRINTER.SYS]] in [[CONFIG.SYS]]:

: &lt;tt&gt;[[DEVICE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|DEVICE]]=…\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,hwcp,n|(n,m))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XyWrite_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosise_1990"/&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;DEVICE=…\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,hwcp,n)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosise_1990"/&gt;

If multiple hardware code pages are supported in OEM issues, the first hardware code page (hwcp1) in the list specifies the default hardware code page:

: &lt;tt&gt;DEVICE=…\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n|(n,m))&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002-12-04"/&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;DEVICE=…\PRINTER.SYS PRN=(type,(hwcp1,hwcp2,…),n)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2002-12-04"/&gt;

If no hardware code page(s) are specified, these drivers default either to a dummy code page number 999&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_NWDOSTIP"/&gt; or assume the hardware code page to be equal to the [[primary code page]] (the first code page listed in [[COUNTRY.SYS]] files for a particular country&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_COUNTRY"/&gt; with the country code either specified in the CONFIG.SYS [[COUNTRY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|COUNTRY]] directive or assumed to be the operating system's internal default, usually 1 (US) in Western issues of DOS).&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;
In many English-speaking countries, the primary code page is either 437 (f.e. in the US) or 850 (f.e. in the UK, Ireland and Canada),&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_NWDOSTIP"/&gt; so that, without specifying a different code page, the system would often assume one of these to be the corresponding device's default hardware code page as well.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPSwitchFD"/&gt;

If a hardware code page does not match one of those with official code page assignments, an arbitrary number from the range 57344–61439 (E000h–EFFFh) for [[user-definable code page]]s or 65280–65533 (FF00h–FFFDh) for [[private use code page]]s could be specified per [[IBM CDRA]] to give the operating system a non-conflictive "handle" to select that code page.

[[Arabic MS-DOS|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew MS-DOS]] do not use DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS, but provide similar facilities using [[ARABIC.COM]], [[HEBREW.COM]], and [[&lt;!-- Filename written with underscore: "SK_HGC.COM" --&gt;SK{{text|_|HGC.COM}}]].&lt;ref name="Paul_2002-12-04"/&gt;

==OEM code pages==
Hardware code pages are also [[OEM code page]]s. The designation "OEM", for "[[original equipment manufacturer]]", indicates that the character set could be changed by the manufacturer to meet different markets.&lt;ref name="Chen_2005_CP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen_2005_OEM"/&gt;

However, OEM code pages do not necessarily reside in ROM, but include so called [[prepared code page]]s,&lt;ref name="XyWrite_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_USER-17"/&gt; (aka [[downloadable character set]]s&lt;!-- aka "down-line loadable character set", term used by DEC --&gt; or [[downloadable font]]s), character sets loaded as [[raster font]]s into the font RAM of suitable display adapters (like [[Sirius 1]]/[[Victor 9000]],&lt;ref name="Sargent_1988_Sirius"/&gt; [[NEC APC]],&lt;ref name="NEC_1983_APC"/&gt; [[HP 100LX]]/[[HP 200LX|200LX]]/[[HP OmniGo 700LX|700LX]],&lt;ref name="HP_1996_200LXUG"/&gt; [[Persyst]]'s [[Persyst BoB Color Adapter|BoB Color Adapter]],&lt;ref name="Hart_1985"/&gt; [[Hercules Computer Technology|Hercules]]' [[HGC+]],&lt;ref name="Wilton_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott_2012_HGCPlus"/&gt; [[Hercules InColor Card|InColor]]&lt;ref name="Wilton_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott_2012_InColor"/&gt; and [[Hercules Network Card Plus|Network Plus]]&lt;ref name="CW_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hercules_1988"/&gt; with [[RAMFONT]], and IBM's [[Multi-Color Graphics Array|MCGA]],&lt;ref name="Wilton_1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferraro_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt; [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]],&lt;ref name="Ferraro_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt; [[VGA]],&lt;ref name="Ferraro_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_2000_RBIL"/&gt; etc.) and printers as well.&lt;ref name="Paul_2001_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott_2006_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AEB_2001_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haralambous_2007_CPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS_1991_PR"/&gt; Hence, the group of OEM code pages is a superset of hardware code pages.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="Escape_sequence_Epson_NEC"&gt;On [[Epson]], [[NEC]] and [[Fujitsu]] [[ESC/P]] compatible printers, the [[escape sequence]] to switch to various hardware code pages is &lt;code&gt;ESC R (n)&lt;/code&gt; with (n) = 0..254 being a code associated with specific character sets. The range of supported codes depends on the printer model and installed font options.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_OmniGo_300"&gt;The "International English" version of the [[HP OmniBook 300]] uses [[code page 850]] (rather than the more common [[code page 437]]) as hardware code page.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in most cases the system codepage reflects the codepage used for devices such as console ([[DISPLAY.SYS]]), printers ([[PRINTER.SYS]]), and keyboard ([[KEYB.COM]]), this is not a requirement as there are means to switch the individual device codepages without changing the system codepage (for example using [[MODE (DOS command)|MODE]]). Further, in dealing with [[National Language Support|NLS]] issues, it is important to distinguish between the currently active, the hardware, and the [[primary code page|primary codepage]]s for any device and/or the system. The hardware codepage is the default codepage supported by a device after initialization of the hardware. It normally defaults to [[Code page 437|437]] for the console, but some European clones have [[Code page 850|850]] stored in the video font ROMs, and I have been told that some Czech [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] cards had [[Kamenický encoding|Kamenicky]] codepage 867 (aka [[Wordperfect]] codepage 895) stored in their ROMs. Most printers default to [[Code page 367|367]] ([[ISO-646-US]] 7-bit) or 437 on power up, and the default system, or global, codepage for the system is always 437 under [[DR-DOS]] […] but under [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS]] it reflects the codepage entry in [[COUNTRY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|COUNTRY]]=country,codepage,filespec where it must be one of the codepages valid for the given country as per [[COUNTRY.SYS]] filespec - this is 437 (or 850 on newer systems) in most cases, but not necessarily. The default country is 1 (USA), the default filespec is "\COUNTRY.SYS", and if no filespec is found the system will work with the statically pre-initialized data in the kernel which is the data for the USA in most cases. If no codepage is given with COUNTRY, the [[DOS BIOS]] will search for the first codepage entry for a given country (or 1), this is called the primary codepage. The codepage value of 0 is used internally to retrieve this codepage, and for the COUNTRY.SYS file parsers in the DOS BIOS and [[NLSFUNC]], a codepage value of zero means "match any codepage, whatever comes first for the given country code". So, it depends on the order of codepage entries in the COUNTRY.SYS file if the system will default to 437, 850, or something else. […] However, some Arabic and Hebrew [[Hercules Graphics Card|HGC]] and CGA cards have multiple hardware fonts, so called fontpages, […] so that a device may support multiple hardware codepages at the same time. The corresponding fontpage functions are INT 2Fh/AD41h and INT 2Fh/AD42h. […] COUNTRY.SYS and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In [[Arabic MS-DOS|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew MS-DOS|Hebrew]] issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country […]) […] When you specify a line like: [[DEVICE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|DEVICE]]=…\display.sys con=(ega,437,1) […] DISPLAY.SYS is told that 437 should be assumed to be the hardware codepage of the display adapter. This is necessary to be known by DISPLAY.SYS because it will use different mechanisms to switch to the software [[prepared code page|prepared codepage]]s and the hardware codepage, and there is no way to retrieve the info about the hardware codepage by itself. When the requested codepage is equal to the hardware codepage declared here, DISPLAY.SYS will use the method to switch to the hardware codepage, otherwise it will attempt to look up the font info in its internal buffer.

'''Insufflation''' ({{lang-la|insufflare|lit=to blow into}}) is the act of blowing something (such as a gas, powder, or vapor) into a body cavity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/insufflation{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufflation has many medical uses, most notably as a route of administration for various drugs.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Recreational drugs==
Nasal inhalation of [[Recreational_drug_use|recreational drugs]] ("snorting") is often considered an example of insufflation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=164649|title=Snorting - insufflation tips - Drugs Forum|website=drugs-forum.com|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/routes-of-drug-administration/|title=Ways of Taking Drugs|website=Alcohol Rehab|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://taimapedia.org/index.php?title=Insufflation|title=Insufflation - Taimapedia|website=taimapedia.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluebelly.org.au/reducingrisk/article7d7c.html?aid=181|title=Reducing risk wiki articles|website=www.bluebelly.org.au|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the etymology and scientific understanding of the term does not include inhalation of any kind,{{cn|date=January 2017}} as blowing requires the application of positive pressure to push the substance into the nose, whereas inhaling refers to drawing or sucking in, which requires the generation of negative pressure in the thorax.

==Medical uses==

===Surgery===

Gases are often insufflated into a body cavity to inflate the cavity for more workroom, e.g. during [[laparoscopic surgery]]. The most common gas used in this manner is [[carbon dioxide]], because it is non-flammable, colorless and dissolves readily in blood. It is, however, not an [[inert gas]].

=== Diagnostics ===
Gases can be insufflated into parts of the body to enhance [[radiological imaging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiology.181.2.1924785 |pmid=1924785 |title=Esophageal insufflation and videofluoroscopy for evaluation of esophageal speech in laryngectomy patients: Clinical implications |journal=Radiology |volume=181 |issue=2 |pages=433–7 |year=1991 |last1=Sloane |first1=P M |last2=Griffin |first2=J F |last3=O'Dwyer |first3=T P |last4=Griffin |first4=J M }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to gain access to areas for visual inspection (e.g. during [[colonoscopy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/gut.2011.239301.421 |title=Comparison of carbon dioxide (CO2) to air insufflation in colonoscopy |journal=Gut |volume=60 |pages=A200 |year=2011 |last1=Ramaraj |first1=R |last2=Sugumaran |first2=A |last3=Khan |first3=H |last4=Mathialahan |first4=T |last5=George |first5=P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respiratory assistance ===
Oxygen can be insufflated into the nose by [[nasal cannula]]e to assist in respiration.

[[Inhaler|Pump inhalers]] for [[asthma]]tics deliver aerosolized drugs into the lungs via the mouth. However, the insufflation by the pump is not adequate for delivery to the lungs, necessitating an active inhalation by the patient.

=== Anesthesia and critical care ===
Insufflated gases and vapors are used to ventilate and oxygenate patients ([[oxygen]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]], [[helium]]), and to induce, assist in or maintain [[general anaesthesia]] ([[nitrous oxide]], [[xenon]], [[Inhalational anaesthetic|volatile anesthetic agents]]).

=== Nasal drug administration ===

[[File:Cocaine lines 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cocaine]] is a drug that is commonly taken into the body via nasal inhalation]]

Nasal insufflation is the most common method of [[nasal administration]]. Other methods are nasal inhalation (common in recreational use) and nasal instillation. Drugs administered in this way can have a local effect or a systemic effect. The time of onset for systemic drugs delivered via nasal administration is generally only marginally slower than if given intravenously. The [[bioavailability]] of drugs administered nasally is generally significantly higher than drugs taken orally.

==== Examples of drugs given ====

* Steroids (local effect) and anti-asthma medication
* Hormone replacement
* Decongestants (local effect)
* Nicotine replacement
* Migraine medication
* Vaccines
* ADHD medications such as methylphenidate 
Nasal administration can also be used for treatment of [[paediatric|children]] or patients who are otherwise alarmed or frightened by needles, or where [[intravenous]] (IV) access is unavailable.

=== Alternative medicine ===
As an [[alternative medicine]] treatment, [[ozone therapy]] is claimed to increase the amount of oxygen in the body through rectal and vaginal insufflation.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==History==
In the 18th century, the [[tobacco smoke enema]], an insufflation of tobacco smoke into the rectum, was a common method of reviving drowning victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08339-3 |title=Tobacco smoke enemas |journal=The Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9315 |pages=1442 |year=2002 |last1=Lawrence |first1=Ghislaine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John de Beauchesne''', also known as '''John de Beau Chesne''', '''Jean de Beauchesne''' and '''Jehan de Beauchesne''' (c.1538 in Paris – May 1620 in London) was a French Hugenot writing master (that is, a teacher of [[penmanship]]) and [[calligraphy|calligrapher]].  He relocated to London around 1565, in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. In 1570 he co-authored ''A Booke containing divers sortes of hands'', the first writing manual published in English. He travelled to Italy and France, where he published additional writing manuals, returning to England by 1583. In his later years he was appointed writing master to two of the children of [[James I of England|James I]], [[Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles]] (later King Charles I).  Beauchesne died in London in May 1620.

== Life and career ==

John de Beauchense was born in Paris around 1538, and was probably raised a [[Huguenot]]. He is likely related to a group of printers and booksellers active in Paris in the 16th century named Beauchesne: Abraham Beauchesne (active around 1532), Julien Beauchesne (1545) and Jeanne Beauchesne, wife of the Parisian printer Jean Plumyon, killed In 1572 during the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]].&lt;ref name="Wolpe"&gt;[[Berthold Wolpe|Wolpe, Berthold]], "John de Beauchesne and the First English Writing-books", in Osley (1980), pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

He emigrated to London around 1565 (perhaps to find a more favourable environment for Protestant opinions); in 1567 he had been living in the ward of [[Farringdon Without]], home to [[Chancery Lane]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], for two years. That year he was working as a scribe for [[William Bowyer (Keeper of the Records)|William Bowyer]], Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London. [[Berthold Wolpe]] identified Beauchesne as the creator of the calligraphic pages in Bowyer's ''Heroica Eulogia'', a manuscript dedicated (but perhaps never presented) to [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] combining  "paintings, coats of arms, Latin poems, 14 distinctive styles of handwriting, and historical documents".&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Verso"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Norman|title=Empowering the Earl of Leicester|url=http://huntingtonblogs.org/2016/05/empowering-the-earl-of-leicester/|website=Verso|publisher=Huntington Library|accessdate=2017-02-04|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1570, the French Huguenot printer [[Thomas Vautrollier]] published Beauchesne's ''A Booke containing divers sortes of hands'', the first book of "copies" or sample alphabets for students to be printed in English.  Its full title was {{blockquote|''A Booke containing divers sortes of hands, as well the English as French secretarie with the Italian, Roman, Chancelrie and court hands. Also the true and just proportion of the capitall Rom(an)ae set forth by John de Beau Chesne. P(arisien) and M. John Baildon. Imprinted at London by Thomas Vautrouillier, dwelling in the blackefrieres''}} As Vautrollier had registered two books of "copies" of hands with the [[Stationers' Company]] in 1569, it is possible that this volume combined originally separate works by Beauchesne and by Master John Baildon, a curate of [[St Mildred, Poultry|St Mildred in the Poultry]].&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt; The book contains 42 [[Woodcut|woodblocks]] of sample alphabets and texts, covering the range of styles common in the day. ''A Book containing divers sortes of handes'' must have been a success – it was reissued by Vautrollier and his successor, [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]], in 1571, 1590, 1591, 1602, and 1615 (all within Beauchesne's lifetime).&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey (1763) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press Archive| last1 = Watson| first1 = George| last2 = Willison| first2 = Ian R.| title = The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature| date = 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1706|page=1706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the appearance of his ''Booke'', Beauchesne travelled to Italy, studying under several masters. By 1579 he was resident in Lyon, where he published a second treatise in 1580, ''Le Tresor d' Escriture, au que I est contenu tout ce qui est requis et necessaire a taus amateurs dudict art. Par jehan de Beauchesne Parisien, Avec privilege du Roi'', which displays a sensitive Italian influence.&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt;

He returned to England by 1583 and about 1595 published a third treatise on handwriting, ''La Clef de l'Escriture'', dedicated to the three daughters of [[Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. Taxpayer records of 1599 place him in the parish of [[St Ann Blackfriars]]. He was appointed writing master to the new King James I's daughter [[Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] (to whom he dedicated a collection of manuscript examples around 1610), and her brother [[Charles I of England|Charles]], later King Charles I. Beauchesne was buried at Blackfriars 20 May 1620.&lt;ref name="Wolpe" /&gt;

The novel is considered to be unique in its detailed portrayal of the colourful life of [[Varanasi]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bihardays.com/kashinath-singh-wins-sahitya-akademi-award-rehan-par-ragghu Kashinath Singh wins the Sahitya Akademi award for 'Rehan par Ragghu' | BiharDays&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashinath Singh is also known for his unique style of writing biographies of literary personalities.&lt;ref name=kashi /&gt; His memoirs are compiled into the volume ''Yaad Ho Ki Na Yaad Ho'', which won the Sharad Joshi Award. Parts of ''Kashi ka Assi'' have been adapted to theatre by eminent director Usha Ganguly and the novel is also being adapted into a feature film, [[Mohalla Assi]], by [[Chandraprakash Dwivedi]].

[[File:Kashubian language and nationality.png|thumb|right|Kashubian language (2011 census)]]

==Origin==
Kashubian is assumed to have evolved from the language spoken by some tribes of [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]] called [[Kashubians]], in the region of [[Pomerania]], on the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] between the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder River|Oder]] rivers. The Pomeranians were said to have arrived before the Poles, and certain tribes managed to maintain their language and traditions despite German and Polish settlements. It first began to evolve separately in the period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century as the Polish-Pomeranian linguistic area began to divide based around important linguistic developments centred in the western (Kashubian) part of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A historical phonology of the Kashubian dialects of Polish|last=Topolinska|first=Zuzanna|publisher=Mouton|year=1974|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Florian Ceynowa]] became Kashubian's first known activist. He undertook tremendous efforts to awaken Kashubian self-identity through the establishment of Kashubian language, customs, and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Historical Dictionary of Poland |last=Lerski |first=Jerzy Jan |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1996 |isbn=0-313-26007-9 |location= |pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt strongly that Poles were born brothers and that [[Kashubia]] was a separate nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia Polski 1795-1918|last=Chwalba|first=Andrzej|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Kashubian movement followed in 1912, led by author and doctor [[Aleksander Majkowski]], who wrote for the paper "Zrzësz Kaszëbskô" as part of the "Zrzëszincë" group. The group contributed significantly to the development of the Kashubian literary language.

The earliest printed documents in Kashubian date from the end of the 16th century. The modern orthography was first proposed in 1879.

===Related languages===
Many scholars and linguists debate whether Kashubian should be recognized as a Polish dialect or separate language. From the diachronic view it is a [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]]  but from the synchronic point of view it is a Polish dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Barbour |editor-first1=Stephen |editor-last2=Carmichael |editor-first2=Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199250851 |page=199 |edition= Repr. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashubian is closely related to [[Slovincian]], while both of them are dialects of [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]]. Many [[linguistics|linguists]], in Poland and elsewhere, consider it a divergent dialect of [[Polish language|Polish]]. Dialectal diversity is so great within Kashubian that a speaker of southern dialects has considerable difficulty in understanding a speaker of northern dialects. The spelling and the grammar of Polish words written in Kashubian, which is most of its vocabulary, is highly unusual, making it difficult to comprehend also written text by native Polish speakers.&lt;ref name="Finstytut"&gt;[http://Finstytutkaszubski.republika.pl/pdfy_acta/Facta_2008_X_01-240.pdf Biuletin Radzëznë Kaszëbsczégò Jazëka rok 2007, Gduńsk.] Bibiografiô.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Polish, Kashubian includes about 5% [[loanword]]s from [[German language|German]] (such as ''{{lang|csb|kùńszt}}'' "art"). Unlike Polish, these are mostly from [[Low German]] and only occasionally from [[High German]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Gliszczyńska.

Kraków: Uniwersytet Jagielloński. {{ISSN|1896-2122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of loanwords include the [[Baltic languages]].

==Speakers==
The number of speakers of Kashubian varies widely from source to source, ranging from as low as 4,500 to the upper 366,000. In the 2011 census, over 108,000&lt;ref name="Kaszubi w statystyce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaszebsko.com/uploads/historia/Historiô%20Kaszëbów%20%2819%29III.pdf |title= Kaszubi w statystyce (cz.

A number of schools in Poland use Kashubian as a teaching language. It is an official alternative language for local administration purposes in [[Gmina Sierakowice]], [[Gmina Linia]], [[Gmina Parchowo]], [[Gmina Luzino]] and [[Gmina Żukowo]] in the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]]. Most respondents say that Kashubian is used in informal speech among family members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilkuer.de/forschung/191-204_stanulewicz_final_js_wk_js.rtf|title=The Use of the Kashubian Language from the Perspective of Young People Aged 16–19:  Settings and Participants|last=Stanulewicz|first=Danuta|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most likely because Polish is the official language and spoken in formal settings.

===In the Americas===
During the [[Kashubian diaspora]] of 1855-1900, 115,700 Kashubians emigrated to [[North America]], with around 15,000 emigrating to [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statystyka ludności kaszubskiej|last=Ramułt|first=Stefan|year=1899|isbn=|location=Krakow|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "Polish" community of [[Renfrew County, Ontario]], Kashubian is widely spoken to this day, despite generations of Polonization at the hands of Polish parish priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kashub.com/canada.html|title=Kashubians in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Winona, Minnesota]], which Ramułt termed the "Kashubian Capital of America",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bambenek.org/winona-2/kashubian-capital-of-america/|title=Kashubian Capital of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashubian was regarded as "poor Polish," as opposed to the "good Polish" of the parish priests and teaching sisters. Consequently, Kashubian failed to survive Polonization and died out shortly after the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bambenek.org/winona-2/congregational-history-of-st-stans/|title=A Congregational History of Saint Stan's|last=Stolpa|first=James|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important for Kashubian literature was ''Xążeczka dlo Kaszebov'' by Doctor [[Florian Ceynowa]] (1817–1881).&lt;ref&gt;http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/slavic_eurasia_papers/no3/06_Treder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hieronim Derdowski]] (1852–1902 in [[Winona, Minnesota]]) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Dr. [[Aleksander Majkowski]] (1876–1938) from [[Kościerzyna]], who wrote the Kashubian national epic [[The Life and Adventures of Remus]]. [[Jan Trepczyk]] was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was [[Stanisław Pestka]]. Kashubian literature has been translated into [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Aleksander Majkowski and [[Alojzy Nagel]] belong to the most commonly translated Kashubian authors of the 20th century. A considerable body of [[Christianity|Christian]] literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the [[New Testament]], much of it by Fr. Adam Ryszard Sikora ([[Franciscan|OFM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.franciszkanie.net/artykul/156,291,o_prof_uam_dr_hab_adam_sikora_ofm/ |deadurl= |title=o. prof. dr hab.

Franciszek Grucza&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hauptmann, Günther Schulz, Kirche im Osten: Studien zur osteuropäischen Kirchengeschichte und Kirchenkunde, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2000, pp.44ff, {{ISBN|3-525-56393-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qHL3-GAJE-YC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=slowinzen&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA44,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from a Catholic seminary in [[Pelplin]]. He was the first priest to introduce [[Catholic liturgy]] in Kashubian.

=== Works ===
The earliest recorded artifacts of Kashubian date back to the 15th century and include a book of spiritual psalms that were used to introduce Kashubian to the Lutheran church: 
* 1586  ''Duchowne piesnie (Spiritual songs) D. Marcina Luthera y ynßich naboznich męzow. Zniemieckiego w Slawięsky ięzik wilozone Przes Szymana Krofea... w Gdainsku: przes Jacuba Rhode'', Tetzner 1896: translated from pastorks. [[Szymon Krofej|S. Krofeja]], Słowińca (?) rodem z Dąbia. 
The next few texts are also religious catechisms but this time from the Catholic Church, because the majority of Kashubians were Roman Catholic and these texts helped them become more unified in faith:
* 1643 ''Mały Catechism (Little Catechism) D. Marciná Lutherá Niemiecko-Wándalski ábo Slowięski to jestá z Niemieckiego języká w Słowięski wystáwiony na jáwnosc wydan..., w Gdaińsku przes Jerzego Rhetá'', Gdansk 1643. Pastor smołdziński ks. Mostnik, rodem ze Slupska.
* ''Perykopy smołdzinskie (Smoldzinski Pericope)'', published by Friedhelm Hinze, Berlin (East), 1967
* ''Śpiewnik starokaszubski (Old Kashubian songbook)'', published by Friedhelm Hinze, Berlin (East), 1967

==Education==
Throughout the communist regime in Poland, Kashubian and Polish greatly suffered in its spread and education. Kashubian was represented as folklore and prevented from being taught in schools. Following the collapse of communism, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/grabowska.pdf |title=The Institute for European Studies, Ethnological institute of UW |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been included in the program of school education in [[Kashubia]] although not as a language of teaching or as a required subject for every child, but as a foreign language taught 3 hours per week at parents' explicit request. Since 1991, it is estimated that there have been around 17,000 students in over 400 schools who have learned Kashubian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pl.languagesindanger.eu/book-of-knowledge/pakiet-dla-szkol-o-jezykach-mniejszosciowych/jezykowa-mozaika-ziem-polskich/jezyk-kaszubski/|title=język kaszubski {{!}} pl.languagesindanger.eu|website=pl.languagesindanger.eu|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashubian has some limited usage on public radio and had on public television. Since 2005, Kashubian has enjoyed legal protection in Poland as an official [[regional language]]. It is the only language in Poland with that status, which was granted by the ''Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Language'' of the [[Polish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20050170141|title=Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych|first=Kancelaria Sejmu|last=RP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provides for its use in official contexts in ten communes in which speakers are at least 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;G. Stone: Slav outposts in Central European history : the Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs, London, UK : Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2016, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition means that heavily- populated Kashubian localities have been able to have road signs and other amenities with Polish and Kashubian translations on them.

==Dialects==
[[File:Kaszuby - dialekty wg F.Lorentza.png|thumb|right|220px|Kashubian dialects area in the early 20th century]]
[[Friedrich Lorentz]] wrote in the early 20th century that there were three Kashubian dialects. These include the
* Northern Kashubian dialect 
* Middle Kashubian dialect
* Southern Kashubian dialect

Other researches would argue that each tiny region of the [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]] has its own dialect, as in ''Dialects and Slang of Poland'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dialekty i gwary polskie|last=Dubisz|first=Stanisław|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|year=1995|isbn=978-8321409894|location=Warszawa|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Bylacki dialect
* Slowinski dialect 
* Kabatkow dialect
* Zaborski dialect 
* Tucholski and Krajniacki dialect (although both dialects would be considered a transitional form of the Wielkopolski dialect and are included as official Wielkopolskie dialects)

==Features==
A "standard" Kashubian language does not exist despite several attempts to create one; rather a diverse range of dialects takes its place. The vocabulary is heavily influenced by German and Polish and uses the Latin alphabet.

There are several similarities between Kashubian and Polish. For some linguists they consider this a sign that Kashubian is a dialect of Polish but others believe that this is just a sign that the two originate from the same location. They are nevertheless related to a certain degree and their proximity has made Kashubian influenced by Polish and its various dialects, specifically its northern ones.

Some examples of similarities between languages:
* softening of the consonant ''{{lang|csb|ar}}'' inflections of northern Kashubian dialects: ex: Northern Kashubian: ''{{wikt-lang|csb|cwiardi}}'', ''{{wikt-lang|csb|czwiôrtk}}''; Polish: ''{{wikt-lang|pl|twardy}}'', ''{{wikt-lang|pl|czwartek}}''
* the disappearance of a movable ''{{lang|csb|e}}'' in the nominative case: ex: ''{{wikt-lang|csb|pòrénk}}'', ''{{wikt-lang|csb|kùńc}}''; ''{{wikt-lang|pl|poranek}}'', ''{{wikt-lang|pl|koniec}}''
* vowel '''{{lang|csb|ô}}''' takes the place of long ''{{lang|csb|a}}'' as it did for Early Slavs, similar changes took place in early dialects of Polish
* transition of ''{{lang|csb|-jd-}}'' to ''{{lang|csb|-ńd-}}'' just like the [[Masurian dialect]]: ex: ''{{wikt-lang|csb|przińdą}}''; ''{{wikt-lang|pl|przyjdą}}''

===Phonology and morphology===
Kashubian makes use of simplex and complex phonemes with secondary place articulation {{IPA|/pʲ/}}, {{IPA|/bʲ/}}, {{IPA|/fʲ/}}, {{IPA|/vʲ/}} and {{IPA|/mʲ/}}. They follow the Clements and Hume (1995) constriction model, where sounds are represented in terms of constriction. They are then organized according to particular features like anterior, implying the activation of features dominating it. Due to this model, the phonemes above are treated differently from the phonemes {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. The vocalic place node would be placed under the C-place node and V-place nodes interpolated to preserve well-forwardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/NQ58570.pdf |title=Phonological Structure of the Kashubian Word |last=Hopkins |first=Paul Stanley |date=2001 |publisher=University of Victoria |access-date=April 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Usmm-license.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A United States Merchant Marine license. Note that this sample licence predates the creation of the [[Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] as the [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] is listed as being under [[United States Department of Transportation|DOT]].]]
A '''licensed mariner''' is a person who holds a license issued by one or more countries to hold senior positions aboard ships, boats, and similar vessels.
The [[STCW Convention|International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers]] sets qualification standards for masters, officers and watch personnel on seagoing merchant ships.   Member states of the [[International Maritime Organization]] differ in the details of the implementation including the national government agency or department responsible for licensing and the local names of ranks and qualifications. In the USA for example the [[United States Coast Guard]] grants licenses to members of the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in five categories: deck officers,&lt;ref name="USCFR4610D10.403"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and pilots.&lt;ref name="USCFR4610D10.403" /&gt;  The United States Coast Guard has replaced paper licenses with the Merchant Mariners Credential which is a combination of the former Merchant Marine Officers license and Merchant Mariners Document in a small book that looks similar to a passport.

In the UK the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] issue licenses, known as Certificates of Competency, in a similar fashion under the amended STCW convention.

Mariners that do not have a license are referred to as '''unlicensed mariners''' or '''ratings.'''

Several States within the United States issue a state mariners license for use upon non-federal inland waters. Most of these states honor USCG Merchant Marine licenses as an alternative to state licensing. State licensing programs closely follow the federal guidelines for issuance of  these licenses, including the requirements concerning professional maritime training and experience.

==Deck officers==
There are a wide variety of licenses for deck officers, with restrictions of geography and tonnage.  Licenses without such restrictions are called ''unlimited'' as in ''Third Mate'' or ''Officer of the Watch, Unlimited''.  The grades of unlimited licenses are:
* Master's License for [[Captain (nautical)|masters]] and lower grades.
* Chief Mate's License for [[Chief Mate|chief mate]]s and lower grades.
* Second Mate's License qualifies the holder as [[second mate]] or [[third mate]].
* Third Mate's License qualifies the holder as [[third mate]].

Mariner licenses range from large to small vessels.  Smaller charter boat operators may have a [[United States Coast Guard Charter Boat Captain's license|charter boat license]] or a certificate under the Large Yacht Code.

==Engineers==
Licenses are issued in the grades of:
*[[Chief Engineer]]
*[[First Assistant Engineer]]
*[[Second Assistant Engineer]]
*[[Third Assistant Engineer]]
*[[Chief Engineer]] (limited)
*[[First Assistant Engineer|Assistant Engineer]] (limited)
*[[First Assistant Engineer|Designated duty engineer]]
*[[Chief Engineer]] (uninspected fishing industry vessels)
*[[First Assistant Engineer|Assistant Engineer]] (uninspected fishing industry vessels)

==Staff officers==
Staff officers are issued a [[Certificate of Registry]] in the following grades:
* Chief [[purser]]
* Purser
* Senior assistant purser
* Junior assistant purser
* [[Medical doctor]]
* Professional [[nurse]]
* Marine Physician Assistant (MPA)
* Hospital Corpsman

==Radio officers==
* Radio officer

==Pilots==
[[Maritime pilot|Pilot]] licenses vary with tonnage and geography.  Types of pilot's licenses are:
* General routes (routes not restricted to rivers, canals and small lakes)
* River routes
* Canal and small lakes routes

'''Madathil Vasudevan''', popularly known as '''M. V. Devan''' (15 January 1928 &amp;ndash; 29 April 2014), was an [[India]]n [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[writer]], [[art critic]] and [[orator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalakeralam.com/artistd/mvdevan.htm Artist Directory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Panniyannur]] village in [[Tellicherry]] in northern [[Kerala]]. After completing high school in 1946, he left for [[Madras]] to study painting. He learned the basics of painting at the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Government School of Arts and Crafts, Madras]] under the likes of Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury and [[K. C. S. Paniker]].

These stalwarts influenced his life and painting to a large extent. At this time, he came into contact with M. Govindan, who helped in changing his perspective on life and thinking.

After coming back from Madras, he joined as staff artist at the ''[[Mathrubhumi]]'' daily in [[Calicut]]. From 1952 to 1961 he worked there. Apart from illustrations, he had contributed reviews, articles and features on art and paintings to the weekly. Again, he went back to Madras and soon joined the 'Southern Languages Book Trust' as art consultant. He worked there from 1961 to 1962.

He continued his pursuit of art with Madras [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] from 1962 to 1968, [[New Delhi]] Lalit Kala Akademi (66 to 68), [[Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore]] (FACT) (as art consultant from 1968 to 1972). He was made the Chairman of [[Kerala Lalithakala Akademi]] from 1974 to 1977.

During this time, he established an organization called ''Perunthachan'', which dealt with the consultancy in the housing sector.

He was the founder member of the famous theatre drama organization "Nadaka Kalari" centered at [[Vaikom]]. He was also the founder member and present Chairman of ''Kerala Kalapeedom'', where he tutored and encouraged many young painters such as T. Kaladaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Razi Rahman |url=http://www.kalakeralam.com/artistd/kaladharan.htm |title=Artist Directory |publisher=Kalakeralam.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a major role in establishing ''Malayala Kalagramam'' at [[Mahé, India|Mahé]]. He was associated with literary publications such as ''Navashakti'', ''Gopuram'', ''Sameeksha'', ''Kerala Kavita'' and ''Jwala''. A collection of critical essays titled ''Devaspandanam'' is considered his magnum opus.

He died of age-related ailments on 29 April 2014 at his residence in [[Aluva]], Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8914">'''Martin Kenneth Tytell''' (December 20, 1913 &amp;ndash; September 11, 2008) was an expert in manual [[typewriter]]s described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as having an "unmatched knowledge of typewriters".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The postal service would deliver to his store letters addressed simply to "Mr. Typewriter, New York".&lt;ref name=NYT1994&gt;Hays. Constance L. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E1DF103AF931A25755C0A962958260 "New Yorkers &amp; Co.; 'Mr. Typewriter, New York'"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 12, 1994. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His customers included many notable authors and reporters, many of whom had clung to their manual typewriters long after personal computers became standard.

Tytell was born on December 20, 1913 to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, and grew up in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He worked in a hardware store in his youth and first learned about typewriters at age 15 after disassembling an Underwood 5 typewriter on his gym teacher's desk at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn and watching it being repaired.&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1980/&gt; He had obtained a contract to maintain typewriters for [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital|Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital]] before graduating from high school. He received his bachelor's from [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]] in [[Queens]] and earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[New York University]], attending college primarily at night.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/nyregion/12tytell.html "Martin K. Tytell, Typewriter Wizard, Dies at 94 "], ''The New York Times'', September 12, 2008. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell met his wife, Pearl, in 1938 after he sold her a typewriter at an office she managed. He died in the Bronx of cancer on September 11, 2008 while also suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Tytell Typewriter Company==
The Tytell Typewriter Company opened in 1938 at 123 [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]].&lt;ref name=NYT1980&gt;Ferretti, Fred. [https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/24/archives/key-source-for-esoteric-typewriters-a-key-source-for-esoteric.html "Key Source For Esoteric Typewriters; A Key Source for Esoteric Typewriters"], ''The New York Times'', September 24, 1980. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1941, Tytell created a patented process that allowed him to sell Remington and Underwood Noiseless typewriters that listed for as much as $135 and offer them for sale for $24.95 with a one-year guarantee, and aimed to sell 500 of these typewriters each week.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A1EF8355F167B93CAA9178FD85F458485F9 "Advertising News and Notes"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 8, 1941. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Tytell developed a coin-operated typewriter that would be available for use in hotel lobbies and train stations for 10 cents per half-hour, modeled on a similar device used in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EFD3F5E167B93C5A9178ED85F458485F9 "Advertising News and Notes"], ''The New York Times'', May 7, 1941. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during World War II, but was kept out of action due to his flat feet and knowledge of typewriters. In the military he created foreign language typewriters, including French language typewriters for paratroopers who were air-dropped as part of the [[Invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt;

He was in the typewriter repair business for some 70 years, most of which was spent in his Tytell Typewriter Company, located on the second-floor store at 116 Fulton Street since 1963, which advertised itself as offering "Psychoanalysis for Your Typewriter." He worked in a white lab coat and handled typewriters that could produce 145 different languages and dialects and claimed that he had 2 million typefaces in stock. He created typewriters that could print hieroglyphics or musical notes and invented models with carriages that operated in reverse for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew that are written right-to-left. An erroneously inverted character he placed on a [[Burmese language]] typewriter became the standard in Burma{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Customers included [[David Brinkley]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[Andy Rooney]], as well as both [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; In 1980, when [[David Brinkley]] needed a Great Primer&lt;ref&gt;"Great Primer" refers to the [[typeface]] size and character spacing. Normally, Great Primer typewriters used 18-point type, 50 percent larger than Pica at 10 characters per inch.  Two-line Great Primer machines were also built, using 36-point type.  These would have been useful to a radio or television newsreader, as material typed on them would be easier to see.&lt;/ref&gt; discontinued by Royal a decade earlier, he was able to find two at Tytell. "How many do you want?" was Tytell's response after Brinkley called. Brinkley bought two, what he described as a lifetime supply.&lt;ref name=NYT1980/&gt;

==Forensic analysis==
[[Alger Hiss]] was convicted of perjury in 1950 based on evidence that extensively relied on claims that documents passed to Soviet agent [[Whittaker Chambers]] had been created on a typewriter Hiss and his wife had owned, after the prosecution showed that the typewriter's unique combination of printing pattern and flaws matched those on the documents in question. Hiss's lawyers then hired Tytell to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hiss's owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter, which was used as one of the primary justifications for an unsuccessful appeal of the verdict in the case.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squier, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/1952/02/03/archives/typewriter-evidence-alger-hiss-appeal-in-court-may-depend-on-the.html "Typewriter Evidence; Alger Hiss' appeal in court may depend on the credibility of a mute witness."], ''The New York Times'', February 3, 1952. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The senior Tytell retired from the typewriter business in 2000, and his son closed the repair shop in 2001, converting the Fulton Street space for use by the forensic document research business that the family operated.&lt;ref name=NYT2001&gt;Collins, Glenn. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E6D71E30F93AA25751C0A9679C8B63 "One Fewer Place to Unstick a -inicky 'F' Key"], ''The New York Times'', February 19, 2001. Accessed September 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell's son Peter is a [[Questioned document examination|forensic document examiner]], a practice that father and son developed to trace anonymous letters and documents such as wills to their source, using the unique "fingerprint" of each particular typewriter.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt; Peter testified for the prosecution to help gain a conviction in a case that involved documents that were said to connect President [[John F. Kennedy]] to [[Marilyn Monroe]] and mobster [[Sam Giancana]], and made use of typewriters owned by the Tytell's repair store.&lt;ref name=NYT2001/&gt; His son's expertise was utilized in the investigation of the [[Killian documents controversy]], which involved six documents critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s service in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] and the use of four of these documents which were presented as authentic in a ''[[60 Minutes II|60 Minutes Wednesday]]'' broadcast aired by [[CBS]] on September 8, 2004.

Martin Tytell's daughter, Pamela, earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University in New York City. She lives in Paris, France where she publishes and teaches.  Author of numerous articles on psychoanalysis which have appeared in ''Encyclopaedia Universalis'', ''Magazine Littéraire'', etc., her book ''La Plume sur le Divan: psychanalyse et littérature en France'' [Paris: Aubier-Montaigne, 1982] was translated into Japanese and Italian. She is Maître de Conférences in the French University system &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-lille3.fr Univ-lille3.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Grandes Ecoles".

'''Mohan Chopra''' (10 September 1921&amp;nbsp;– 11 December 1969) was a [[Hindi]] intellectual and author.

==Life==
Mohan Chopra was born at [[Gurdaspur]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]]. He received his education at [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]], Gurdaspur, and [[Lahore]]. He earned an M.A. in English and taught in colleges at Lahore, [[Ludhiana]], [[Ferozepur]], and [[Hisar, India|Hissar]].

==Works==
===Short stories===
Chopra's first short story was published in 1953 in a [[Kolkata|Calcuttan]] magazine called ''Ranee''. He wrote about a hundred short stories in his life. Most of them were published in a magazine from [[Allahabad]] called ''Kahani''. These stories are included in several collections of short stories titled ''Aadha Kata Hua Surya'', ''Peele Patte'', ''Sham Aur Akela Aadmi'', ''Band Darwaza'', ''Intezaar Aur Terah Anya Kahaniyan'' and ''Mohan Chopra ki Shresth Kahaniyan''. A  number of these short stories have been translated in other Indian languages.

====Novels====
Mohan Chopra's novel, ''Bahein'', was published in 1956. Thereafter, five other novels were published: ''Needh Se Aage'', ''Ek Chhaya Aur Main'', ''Subah Se Pahle'', ''Ye Naye Log'', and ''Tuta Hua Aadmi''. ''Ek Chhaya Aur Main'' was translated into the [[Kannada]] language and  published under the name ''Bhranti Samar''.

====Drama====
In the field of drama, three of Mohan Chopra's works were published: ''Samay Ke Swar'', a collection of one-act plays; ''Chattan Ka Phool'', a collection of radio plays; and ''Aandhi Aur Ghar'', a full-length play. ''Aandhi Aur Ghar'' was written along the lines of a Greek drama, keeping in view the unity of time, place, and action.

====Travelogue====

====Poetry====

===Subject of Ph.D research===
His works were the subject of extensive research by [[Kurukshetra University]]. In 2000, a Ph.D degree was awarded to Promila Anand for research work entitled ''Mohan Chopra Ka Vyaktitava Aur Krititava''. In 2009, another Ph.D degree was awarded to Seema Devi for her research work entitled ''Mohan Chopra Ke Sahitya Mein Vyakt Jeewan Darshan''. His works were also the subject of many M. Phil degrees awarded by [[Kurukshetra]] and [[Guru Nanak Dev]] Universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">'''Muireadhach Albanach Ó Dálaigh''' ("Scottish Muireadhach") was a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[poet]] and [[crusade]]r and member of the [[Ó Dálaigh]] bardic family.

==Early career==
''[[Annals of the Four Masters|The Annals of the Four Masters of Ireland]]'', s.a. 1213, tells us that he was the [[ollamh]] (high poet) of Domhnall Ó Domhnaill (died 1241). Muireadhach lived in [[Lissadell]] in [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]], now [[County Sligo]] and fled from [[Ireland]] after killing King Domhnall's tax-collector Fionn Ó Brolacháin, whom Muireadhach considered had been insolent, with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Annals of the Four Masters'', s.a. 1213.8-9, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100005C/text005.html text] and [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005C/text005.html translation]; see also McLeod, ''op. cit.'', pp. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poem, Ó Dálaigh dismisses his murder as his victim was a mere commoner and therefore of no account, a telling indication of the rigid stratification of traditional Irish society:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
Trifling  is our difference with the man,
A shepherd was affronting me;
And I killed that clown;
O God! Is this a cause for enmity?&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Career in Scotland==
Nevertheless, it was in Scotland that Muireadhach made his name. He served as the court bard to the [[Mormaer of Lennox]]. The specific [[mormaer]] who patronized him is often thought to have been [[Ailín II, Earl of Lennox|Ailín II]] (died  1217), but as the mormaer is called "Mac Muireadhach", son of Muireadhach, it was almost certainly in fact his predecessor and father, [[Ailín I, Earl of Lennox|Ailín I]] (died c. 1200).&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, ''op. cit.'', p. 86; , Thomas Owen (ed.) Clancy''The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550&amp;ndash;1350'', (Edinburgh, 1998), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Muireadhach Albanach is important for the cultural history of Scotland because he is the alleged founder of the family of hereditary Scottish bards known to history as the ''[[MacMhuirich bardic family|Mac Mhuireadhaich]]'' or "MacVurich" family.&lt;ref&gt;MacQuarrie, ''Scotland and the Crusades'', (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fifth Crusade==
Muireadhach, like his fellow Gaelic poet [[Gillebrìghde Albanach]], went on the [[Fifth Crusade]] and travelled to [[Acre (city)|Acre]] and [[Damietta]] (as well as other places, like [[Rome]]). In 1228 he was apparently allowed to re-enter [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;MacQuarrie, ''op. cit.'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nigga''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|ɡ|ə}}) is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] term used in [[African-American Vernacular English]] that began as an [[eye dialect]] form of the word ''[[nigger]]'', an [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slur]] against [[black people]]. In some dialects of English, the word is pronounced the same as ''nigger'' in [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] speech.

== Usage ==
In practice, its use and meaning are heavily dependent on context.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Randall Kennedy. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/nigger.htm Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word], ''Pantheon''. 256 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the word ''nigga'' is used more liberally among younger members of all [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name =BBC&gt;Jeremy Cooke.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6406625.stm Racial slur banned in New York,] ''BBC News'', 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[African Americans|African America]], other ethnic groups have adopted the term as part of their vernacular.&lt;ref name=ENQ&gt;Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston. "[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_1the_n-word.html The evolving N-word]." ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LCM&gt;Kendra Pierre. [http://www.lcmeridian.com/media/storage/paper806/news/2006/05/01/News/nigger.nigga.Or.Neither-1876412.shtml?norewrite200610170024&amp;sourcedomain=www.lcmeridian.com 'Nigger,' 'Nigga' or Neither?], ''Meridia'', May 1, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309080959/http://www.lcmeridian.com/media/storage/paper806/news/2006/05/01/News/nigger.nigga.Or.Neither-1876412.shtml?norewrite200610170024&amp;sourcedomain=www.lcmeridian.com |date=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is conflicting popular opinion on whether there is any meaningful difference between ''nigga'' and ''nigger'' as a spoken term.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;J. Douglas Allen-Taylor. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.09.98/cover/nigger-9814.html New Word Order], ''Metro'',  April 9, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people consider the terms to be equally [[pejorative]], and the use of ''nigga'' both in and outside black communities remains controversial.&lt;ref name=SGM&gt;Alex Alonso. [https://archive.is/20130104234128/http://www.streetgangs.com/magazine/053003niggas.php Won’t You Please Be My Nigga: Double Standards with a Taboo Word], May 30, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; H. Lewis Smith, author of ''Bury that Sucka: A Scandalous Affair with the N-word'', believes that "replacing the 'er' with an 'a' changes nothing other than the pronunciation"&lt;ref&gt;Smith. H. Lewis.[http://www.blackcommentator.com/214/214_n_word_not_just_another_smith_guest.html "Why The N-word Is Not Just Another Word]."  ''The Black Commentator.'' January 25, 2007.  Issue 214. Retrieved 01-26-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''African American Registry'' notes, "Brother (Brotha) and Sister (Sistah or Sista) are terms of endearment. Nigger was and still is a word of disrespect."&lt;ref&gt;Phil Middleton and David Pilgrim, [http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/nigger-word-brief-history "Nigger (the word), a brief history!]."  ''African American Registry.'' 2001.  Retrieved 03-14-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], a civil rights group, condemns use of both ''nigga'' and ''nigger''.&lt;ref name=Metro /&gt;

Some African-Americans only consider ''nigga'' offensive when used by people of other races,&lt;ref name=Metro/&gt; seeing its use outside a [[speech community|defined social group]] as an unwelcome [[cultural appropriation]]. Used by blacks, the term may indicate "solidarity or affection",&lt;ref name=ENQ2&gt;Kevin Aldridge. [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_2slurs_often_adopted.html Slurs often adopted by those they insult], ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'',  August 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the usage of the words ''[[dude]]'', ''[[Homie|homeboy]]'', and ''bro''. Others consider "nigga" non-offensive except when directed from a non-African-American towards an African-American. Yet others have derided this as hypocritical and harmful, enabling white racists to use the word and confusing the issue over ''nigger''.&lt;ref name=ENQ/&gt;

== Cultural influence ==
The term "nigga, please", used in the 1970s by comics such as [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]] as "a funny punctuation in jokes about Blacks",&lt;ref name=Mooney&gt;Darryl Fears. [http://www.bet.com/Entertainment/jacksonmooneynwordboycott.htm?Referrer=%7B03CE5360-2620-42CB-AD7E-77E4249C5FB7%7D Jesse Jackson, Paul Mooney Call for End of N-Word], ''BET.com'',  November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{nicg|date=January 2018}} is now heard routinely in comedy routines by African Americans. The growing use of the term is often attributed to its ubiquity in modern American [[hip hop music]].&lt;ref name=WASH&gt;Darryl Fears. "Patent offense: Wayans's hip-hop line", ''The Washington Post'',  March 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;Rogers Cadenhead. "[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70259-0.html Actor Tries to Trademark 'N' Word]", ''Wired'', 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:
*[[N.W.A|Niggaz Wit Attitudes]] (N.W.A)
*[[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s "Sucka Nigga"
*[[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s "The Realest Niggaz"
*[[Jay-Z]]'s "[[Jigga That Nigga]]" and "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)]]"
*Jay-Z and [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Niggas in Paris]]"
*[[DJ Khaled]]'s "[[I Wish You Would (DJ Khaled song)|I Wish You Would]]"
*[[Snoop Dogg]]'s "For All My Niggaz and Bitches"
*[[Nicki Minaj]]'s "[[Lookin Ass]]"
*Kanye West's "[[All Day (Kanye West song)|All Day]]"
*[[YG (rapper)|YG's]] "[[My Nigga]]"
*[[Bobby Shmurda]]'s "[[Hot Nigga]]"

One of the earliest uses of the term in a popular song was the 1983 song ''[[New York New York (Grandmaster Flash song)|New York New York]]'' by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], although it had featured in some very early hip hop recordings such as ''Scoopy Rap'' and ''Family Rap'', both from 1979. [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] uses the term 76 times in his ''[[Nigga Please]]'' album (not including repetitions in choruses).&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Comedian [[Chris Rock]]'s routine "[[Niggas vs. Black People]]" distinguishes a ''nigga'', which he defined as a "low-expectation-having [[motherfucker]]", from a "black person". In contrast, [[Tupac Shakur]] distinguished between ''nigger'' and ''nigga'': "Niggers was the [[lynching|ones on the rope]], hanging off the thing; niggas is the ones with [[Bling-bling|gold ropes]], hanging out at clubs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Tabitha Soren | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljSCZyv97FY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupac, who has been credited with legitimizing the term, said his song N.I.G.G.A. stood for "Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Racial slur takes center stage at Stillman |author=Desiree Hunter |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |date=24 February 2007 |url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20070224/NEWS/702240362?p=3&amp;tc=pg |quote=Rapper Tupac Shakur was credited with legitimizing the term 'nigga' when he came out with the song 'N.I.G.G.A.', which he said stood for 'Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in trademarks or brand names ==
Until a 2017 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Matal v. Tam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Mullin |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/supreme-court-rules-offensive-trademarks-must-be-allowed/ |title=Supreme Court rules: Offensive trademarks must be allowed |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=19 June 2017 |access-date=19 June 2017 |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lanham Act]] did not permit registration of [[trademark]]s containing terms that may [[Disparagement|disparage]] persons or bring them into disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Registration by the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO) of terms that are historically considered disparaging to groups of people has been allowed in some circumstances. Self-disparaging trademarks have been allowed in some cases where the applicant has shown that the mark as-used is not considered by the relevant group to be disparaging.&lt;ref name="Anten"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anten |first=Todd |title=Self-Disparaging Trademarks and Social Change: Factoring the Reappropriation of Slurs into Section 2(A) of the Lanham Act |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |volume=106 |page=338 |date=1 March 2006 |format=PDF |url=http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/106/2/Anten-Web.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034928/http://www.columbialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/106/2/Anten-Web.pdf |archive-date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, two [[Houston]], [[Texas]] men filed a trademark application with the PTO for the words "Naturally Intelligent God Gifted Africans", and its [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]]. The application was rejected, as were numerous subsequent applications for variations of the word "nigga". Most recently, comedian [[Damon Wayans]] twice attempted to trademark a [[brand name]] called Nigga, "featuring clothing, books, music and general merchandise".&lt;ref name=WASH/&gt; The PTO refused the application, stating "the very fact that debate is ongoing regarding in-[ethnic]-group usage, shows that a substantial composite of African Americans find the term 'nigga' to be offensive".&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

The couple had two sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; In 1914, he joined [[SMV High School, Thiruvananthapuram]] as language teacher. He also bought a house at [[Kaithamukku]] and settled in Thiruvananthapuram. During this period, he along with [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]] learnt grammar and rhetorical figures under the guidance of Thuravoor Narayana Shastri.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; He was appointed a member on the expert panel of the [[Maharaja of Travancore]] by the then king [[Moolam Thirunal|Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] and was granted 10 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] as salary.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; He was conferred "Kavi Thilakan" honour by the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin]].

Kerala Varma used to visit [[Thiruvananthapuram]] every year during [[Navratri]] festival time and engage in literary discussions with [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Varma Devan: Biography|year=1944|page=255|author=M. R. Balakrishna Warrier}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last journey with Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer was to [[Kochi]] to receive the "Kavi Thilakan" honour.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Kerala Varma was friends with Kodungallur Kochunni Thampuran, Kochi Parikshith Thampuran, and Sahridaya Thilakan Rama Pisharody.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

Kerala Varma was disturbed by the unexpected deaths of his relatives and close associates in a short period. His guru Avittomnal Rama Varma Thampuran, mother, father, and brother Veera Kerala Varma Thampuran died in a span of six years.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Kerala Varma died in 1919 from fever known at that time as Bombay Fever.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; In 1979, a collection of his writings were reprinted and published in two volumes as 'selected works'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ayyappa.com/LiteratureAndArt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==

===Earlier works===
Kerala Varma's initial works were ''Sreekrishna Sthothram'', an [[astakam|ashtakam]] on [[Lord Ayyappa|Dharmasastha]], ''Kesadipada Sathakam'', and ''Rasavilasambhanam''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; His first work was published in ''Subhashini'' newspaper, [[Changanassery]] in 1898. It was the completion of a poetic puzzle ''Kunnennu Cholvathinu Kuttamaseshamundo'' by Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Later he published his poems in ''Malayala Manorama'', ''Rasika Ranjini'', ''Kavitha Vilasini'', ''Dakshina Deepam'', ''Vijnana Ratnakaram'', ''Kerala Varma'', ''Kerala Kesari'', ''Bhasha Sarada'', ''Sumangala'', ''Aryakesari'', ''Mahila Ratnam'', ''Kerala Vyasan'', ''Mangalodayam'', and ''Vani Vilasam''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; He used to engage two writers to note down his recitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatcharithamaala|year=1984|page=59|author=Perunna K. N. Nair}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never wanted to monetise his poems.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Once he quipped that he did not want to publish poems immediately after writing, but wanted to review and correct it later before sending for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pandalathu Kerala Varma Thampuran|year=1932|page=110|author=A. D. Hari Sarma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahakavyas===
Kerala Varma authored 16 major works, including two mahakavyas ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' and ''Vijayodayam''.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Academi|isbn=81-260-1194-7|page=1185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' is considered his masterpiece.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; It was widely respected as an example of a typical mahakavya before Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer published ''Umakeralam''.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; Revealing Varma's command over the language and the medium of expression, ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' was meant for a scholarly audience.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; The book was first published in 1913 although it was completed five years before its publication.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; It contains 19 chapters.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt;

Both mahakavyas are considered as representations of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Madasseri Madhava Warrier observed that ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' was a complete mahakavya in the old style and those who were familiar with that style would like it best.&lt;ref name=KS&gt;{{cite book|title=Kunchante Sesham|year=1973|page=70|author=Madasseri Madhava Warrier}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[N. Krishna Pillai]], Kerala Varma's mahakavyas would astonish everybody with their word control and effortless beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kairaliyude Katha|year=1986|page=279|author=N. Krishna Pillai}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kumaran Asan]] reviewed ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' in ''Vivekodayam'' magazine and described it as a great work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Bhasha Sahitya Charithram: Volume 6|year=1957|page=21|author=R. Narayana Panicker}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his review contained praises and criticism alike.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; In the preface to the book, Kerala Varma wrote that he never felt any sense of pride in writing a mahakavya, but wanted to give a place to the mythological story in Kerala literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pandalathinte Thiranjedutha Krithikal: Volume 1|year=1979|page=1|author=Pandalam Kerala Varma}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vijayodayam'' is Kerala Varma's second mahakavya. It is a relatively smaller work as it contained only eight chapters which is the minimum requirement for a mahakavya.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; It deals with the story of Kirata and Arjuna.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt; While some critics do not consider it as a mahakavya,&lt;ref name=KSC_Ulloor_4&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Sahitya Charithram: Volume 4|year=1974|page=721|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; some others, most notably [[M. Leelavathy]], T. P. Balakrishnan Nair, and T. G. Madhavan Kutty rate it as a mahakavya.&lt;ref name=Leelavathy&gt;{{cite book|title=Malayala Kavitha Sahitya Charithram|year=1991|page=71|author=M. Leelavathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TPB&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahakavya Prasthanam|year=1985|page=182|author=T. P. Balakrishnan Nair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TGM&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahakavya Prasthanam|year=1982|page=63|author=T. G. Madhavan Kutty}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that [[Bharavi]]'s ''[[Kirātārjunīya]]'' was Kerala Varma's inspiration to write ''Vijayodayam''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer opined that the poem was quite enchanting.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSC_Ulloor_4-728&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Sahitya Charithram: Volume 4|year=1974|page=728|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative poems===
Kerala Varma's narrative poems were based on either history, mythology, or pure imagination.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; ''Marthanda Devodayam'', ''Vancheesa Sathakam'', ''Sreemoola Prakasika'', and ''Sreemoolaraja Vijayam'' fall into the history based category.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; ''Saubhadra Niryanam'', ''Urmila'', ''Bheema Prabhavam'', ''Lakshmana Pravasam'', ''Ghatolkkachan'', ''Subhadra'', ''Marthya Vaibhavam'', ''Barbareekan'', ''Sayoojyam'', and ''Vibheeshaabhishekam'' can be categorised as mythology based.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;  ''Bhageerathi'', ''Oru Kadha'', ''Lakshmi'', ''Oru Puravriththam'', ''Naanikkutty'', ''Chelapparambu'' are based on pure imagination.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

===Children's poetry===
Kerala Varma wrote 35 poems for children.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Kerala Varma wrote the widely popular Malayalam prayer song for children ''Daivame Kai Thozham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Books – Daivame Kai Thozham|url=http://onlinestore.dcbooks.com/author/pandalam-kerala-varma|work=DC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his other poetry for children include ''Kalikkutty'', ''Maasangal'', ''Neram Veluthu'', ''Thathammayum Penkuttiyum'', ''Aana'', ''Ponnu Thampuran'', ''Nakshathrangal'', ''Nazhikamani'', ''Sundara Viddi'', ''Ammepaksham'', ''Kanduvo Nee'', ''Kadannalum Theneechayum'', ''Arivu'', ''Manthan Chanthayil Poyathu'', ''Jalam'', ''Oru Tharkkam'', ''Chinthikkaran'', ''Payyeppayye'', ''Kallane Killan Pidikkum'', ''Vaayu'', ''Oru Vanchippattu'', ''Kallanaya Eli'', ''Dinacharya'', ''Kakkayum Kurukkanum'', ''Pasu'', ''Palliyunarthal'', ''Prarthana'', ''Vallamkali'', and ''Ambili Ammavan''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; His poems ''Kaliyum Karyavum'', ''Payyethinnal Panayum Thinnam'', and ''Othoruma'' contain advice for children.

===Translations===
Kerala Varma translated a drama and a vyayogam from Sanskrit to Malayalam. These are ''Veni Samharam'' by Bhatta Narayana and ''Dootha Vakyam'' by [[Bhasa]]. Kerala Varma later commented that he had only respected the original authors in his translations although he never translated the works word by word.&lt;ref name=SelectedWorks1&gt;{{cite book|title=Pandalathinte Thiranjedutha Krithikal: Volume 1|year=1979|pages=279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, the translations were excellent and were comparable to [[Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran]]'s translation of ''Ascharya Choodamani''.&lt;ref name=KeralaSahityaCharithram&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Sahitya Charithram|year=1974|page=728|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further added that it required remarkable skills to translate the works of Bhatta Narayana at the same quality.&lt;ref name=KeralaSahityaCharithram1&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Sahitya Charithram|year=1974|page=729|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymns and essays===
Although his ancestral deity is [[Lord Ayyappa]], Kerala Varma wrote majority of [[hymn]]s in praise of [[Devi]].&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; ''Vani Panchakam'', ''Gauristhavam'', ''Devi Dasakam'', and ''Aryashtakam'' are such works. He also wrote hymns such as ''Ramesa Dasakam'' in praise of [[Lord Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Kerala Varma wrote essays rarely. Two of his essays are ''Loka Vaichithyam'' and ''Iravan'', which are noted for their humour content and the writer's observation. ''Loka Vaichithryam'' explains the strange aspects of the world and poetry. ''Iravan'' discusses the mythological story of the tactical self-sacrifice of [[Iravan]] planned by [[Sree Krishna]] to sustain the fame of [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Generally, Kerala Varma's works uplhold moral values.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

===Other works===
Kerala Varma's narrative poem ''Sreemoolaraja Vijayam'' is essentially lyrics for an [[Ottamthullal]], although it did not have the ease and rhythm of traditional thullal lyrics.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; This contains the chronological life events of Sree Moolam Thirunal, from birth to his 60th birthday.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; His ''Yathra Kavyam'' is a neoclassical work which narrates his personal experience of visiting Sabarimala along traditional route, following traditional custom and rituals.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; This is an incomplete work.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

===Critical reception===
Kerala Varma had a vast vocabulary. According to his biographer A. D. Hari Sarma, Kerala Varma never faced an issue in finding the right choice of word and that once he started writing, apt words used to appear as the flow of river [[Ganges]].&lt;ref name=HariSarma&gt;{{cite book|title=Pandalathu Kerala Varma Thampuran|year=1932|pages=43–44|author=A. D. Hari Sarma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallathol described him as "Padam kondu panthaadunna Pandalam" (One who juggles with words).&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahakavyas of Pandalam Kerala Varma: A Study|year=2013|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/7532|author=A. Mohanakshan Nair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerala Varma was severely criticised by Kumaran Asan in the literary periodical ''Vivekodayam''.&lt;ref name=Vivekodayam&gt;{{cite book|title=Kumaranasante Gadyalekhanangal: Volume 1|year=1981|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Mundassery]] also criticised Kerala Varma for his poetic style.&lt;ref name=RajarajanMundasseri&gt;{{cite book|title=Rajarajante Mattoli|year=1984|pages=57–58|author=Joseph Mundasseri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MundasseriNanayathe&gt;{{cite book|title=Nanayathe Meen Pidikkamo|year=1981|pages=52|author=Joseph Mundasseri}}&lt;/ref&gt; P. V. Krishna Warrier criticised Kerala Varma in a special issue of ''Kavana Kaumudi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aadhunika Bhasha|journal=Kavana Kaumudi Special Issue|author=P. V. Krishna Warrier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer called Kerala Varma "Prithveesan" for his uncanny ability to write poems in Prithvi [[metre (poetry)|metre]].&lt;ref name=Vijnanodayam&gt;{{cite book|title=Vijnana Deepika: Moonnam Bhagam|year=1973|page=12|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also remarked that Kerala Varma had absolute control over all words in Malayalam and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=Vijnanodayam/&gt; [[Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker]] compared Kerala Varma to [[Garuda]] in his ''Kaviramayanam''.&lt;ref name=Mooloor&gt;{{cite book|title=Muloorinte Padyakrithikal|year=1980|page=102|author=Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing career==
Kerala Varma used to publish a fortnightly periodical ''Kavana Kaumudi'', which contained poetry and contemporary issues. The periodical was published from Pandalam.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; It was the first Malayalam periodical.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; The first issue of ''Kavana Kaumudi'' was published on 4 November 1904,&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kerala Sahitya Charithram: Volume 4|year=1974|page=718|author=Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was 1 [[Vrischikam]] 1080 as per the [[Malayalam calendar]].&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; Kerala Varma was the owner and Chief Editor of the periodical and P. K. Narayanan Namboothiri was the publisher and manager.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The editorials in the periodical discussed social, political, and contemporary issues. These were mainly targeted at corruption and inefficiency of administration. The periodical contained advertisements also.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi&gt;{{cite web|title=100 years of Kavana Kaumudi|url=http://www.old.kerala.gov.in/keralcalnov04/p33.pdf|work=Official Web Portal of Government of Kerala|author=Ajith Nair}}&lt;/ref&gt; All contents in the periodical including advertisements were in poetic form.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The periodical also contained a column ''Balopadesam'' for children.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Poets like Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer opposed the idea of such a periodical initially, but later praised it and wrote in it.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

''Kavana Kaumudi'' was printed on a [[broadsheet]] with eight pages and four columns on each page.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; It was published on the 1st and 15th of all [[Malayalam calendar|Malayalam months]].&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; The earlier issues of the periodical were printed at Suvarnaratnaprabha Press, [[Kayamkulam]].&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; After the first three years, ''Kavana Kaumudi'' became a monthly publication. In 1905, the printing of the periodical was shifted to Kerala Kalpadrumam
Press in [[Thrissur]], which was managed by [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]].&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; In March 1910, the printing was further shifted to Lakshmisahayam Press at [[Kottakkal]].&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; The running of ''Kavana Kaumudi'' put Kerala Varma into financial crisis.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Later, P. V. Krishna Warrier joined as the co-editor of ''Kavana Kaumudi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of media in Kerala|url=http://pressacademy.org/content/history-media-kerala|work=Kerala Press Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Kerala Varma, Warrier became the Chief Editor of the periodical.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; Warrier introduced a book review column in the periodical by the name ''Njangalude Vayanamuri''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Later, advertisements and book reviews started appearing in prose. Several poems from Vallathol's ''Sahitya Manjari'' and [[G. Sankara Kurup]]'s ''Sahitya Kauthukam'' were first published in ''Kavana Kaumudi''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The periodical also carried several translations of English romantic poems.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

Kerala Varma used to write poetic editorials in ''Kavana Kaumudi''. Among those who wrote on ''Kavana Kaumudi'' were Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran, [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma]], [[Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma]], [[Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran]], [[K. C. Kesava Pillai]], Vallathol Narayana Menon, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker, Kuttippuram, and Kochunni Thampuran.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The earlier poems of Nalappattu Narayana Menon, G. Sankara Kurup, and [[V.C. Balakrishna Panicker|V. C. Balakrishna Panicker]] were also published in this periodical.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; Among the famous poets of that time, only Kumaran Asan had not written in the periodical.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;

Beside the regular issues, ''Kavana Kaumudi'' introduced special issues on nine different occasions.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; It was the first time a special issue was being printed for a Malayalam publication.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; The special issues were titled ''Bhasha Vilasam''.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The first special issue was published in 1914 and the last in 1930.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The special issues contained both poems and prose.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The first special issue contained ashtakams by famous poets based on the subject train.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt; The periodical was in print for 11 more years after the death of Kerala Varma, until it stopped in 1930.&lt;ref name=MohanakshanNair /&gt;&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt;

''Kavana Kaumudi'' is considered to have served as a unifying factor, surpassing the regional differences and parochial discriminations that existed in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=KavanaKaumudi /&gt; Poet [[O. N. V. Kurup]] observed that ''Kavana Kaumudi'' ushered the poets of Kerala who were split into three regions, to a single platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kavana Kaumudi: Navotdhanathinte Navarasmi|journal=Pandalam Janmasathabdi Smaranika|year=1979|page=30|author=O. N. V. Kurup}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Kumaran Asan who was reluctant to publish his poems through the periodical, wrote that it would not be a mistake to consider ''Kavana Kaumudi'' as a standard for understanding the prosperity of poetic skills in Malayalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manmaranjan Masikakal|year=1971|page=62|author=G. Priyadarsanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the souvenir published during the birth centenary of Kerala Varma, poet Cherukunnam Purushothaman observed that none of the obstacles such as the complexity of the topic, demand for fast completion, or lack of time for revision or correction marred Kerala Varma's priceless editorials.&lt;ref name=Cherukunnam&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kavana Kaumudiyile Mughalekhanangal|journal=Pandalam Janmasathabdi Smaranika|year=1979|page=68|author=Cherukunnam Purushothaman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi has published a Monograph of Pandalam Kerala Varma ( by P. Ravi Varma) in 2013

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1296">The '''Pentecostal Oath''' was an oath which the [[Knight]]s of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]] swore, according to [[Thomas Malory|Sir Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. It embodied the code of [[Chivalry]].

According to Malory's text:
&lt;blockquote style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:1.2em;"&gt;«&amp;nbsp;The king stablished all his knights, and gave them that were of lands not rich, he gave them lands, and charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee treason; also, by no mean to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that asketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen succor upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, ne for no world’s goods. Unto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and young. And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.&amp;nbsp;»&lt;br&gt;— ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Book III, Chapter XV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7326">'''Proto-Basque''' ({{lang-eu|Aitzineuskara}}; {{lang-es|protoeuskera, protovasco}}; {{lang-fr|proto-basque}}) is a reconstructed predecessor of the [[Basque language]], before the Roman conquests in the Western [[Pyrenees]].

==Background==
The first linguist to scientifically approach the question of the historical changes that the Basque language had undergone over the centuries was [[Koldo Mitxelena]]. His work on Proto-Basque focused mainly on the period between the 5th century BCE and the 1st century CE, the period just before and after initial contact with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

The main method he employed was that of [[internal reconstruction]] as Basque has no known genetic relatives, rendering [[comparative method]]s unworkable. By comparing variants of the same word in the [[Basque dialects|modern dialects]] and the changes [[Latin]] loanwords had undergone, ancestral forms and the rules for historical sound changes were deduced.

Koldo Mitxelena's groundbreaking work, which culminated with the publication of his book ''Fonética histórica vasca'' (1961) was mostly carried out before the [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] inscriptions were found, which fully backed up Mitxelena's proposed Proto-Basque forms.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a number of other prominent linguists such as [[Larry Trask]], [[Alfonso Irigoien]], [[Henri Gavel]] and most recently [[Joseba Lakarra]], [[Joaquín Gorrotxategi]] and Ricardo Gómez have made further contributions to the field. Some of them, such as Lakarra, have focused their attention on even older layers of the language (Pre-Proto-Basque) preceding the [[Celts|Celtic]] invasion of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].

==Vocabulary==
Studying the behaviour of Latin and early Romance loanwords in Basque, Koldo Mitxelena discovered that proto-Basque *n became lost between vowels, and similarly that proto-Basque had no *m. Both are relatively unusual changes cross-linguistically, although /n/ was also partially deleted between vowels in the history of the nearby [[Portuguese language]].

One of the puzzles of Basque is the large number of words that begin with vowels, where the initial and second vowels are the same. Joseba Lakarra proposes that in pre-proto-Basque there was extensive [[reduplication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{eu}} {{cite journal|last1=Lakarra|first1=Joseba|title=Aitzineuskara berreraikiaz: zergatik ezkerra?|journal=Euskera|date=2009|issue=54, 1|page=52|url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.eus/dok/euskera/74555.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that later certain initial consonants were deleted, leaving the VCV pattern in proto-Basque:

'''Proto-Min''' is a [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] group of [[varieties of Chinese]].
Min varieties developed in the relative isolation of the Chinese province of [[Fujian]] and eastern [[Guangdong]], and have since spread to [[Taiwan]], southeast Asia and other parts of the world.
They contain reflexes of distinctions not found in [[Middle Chinese]] or most other modern varieties, and thus provide additional data for the reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]].

[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] reconstructed the sound system of proto-Min from popular vocabulary in a range of Min varieties, including new data on varieties from inland Fujian.
The system has a six-way manner contrast in [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s, compared with the three-way contrast in Middle Chinese and modern [[Wu Chinese|Wu varieties]] and the two-way contrast in most modern Chinese varieties.
A two-way contrast in [[sonorant]]s is also reconstructed, compared with the single series of Middle Chinese and all modern varieties. Evidence from early loans into other languages suggests that the additional contrasts may reflect consonant clusters or [[minor syllable]]s.

The Min homeland consists of most of the province of [[Fujian]], and the adjacent eastern part of [[Guangdong]].
The area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the [[South China Sea]].
After the area was first settled by Chinese during the [[Han dynasty]], most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the [[Xiang River|Xiang]] and [[Gan River (Jiangxi)|Gan]] rivers to the west.
Min varieties have thus developed in relative isolation.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=210, 228}}

===Separation from common Chinese===
As described in [[rime dictionary|rhyme dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Qieyun]]'' (601 AD), [[Middle Chinese]] initial [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate consonant]]s showed a three-way contrast between voiceless unaspirated, voiceless [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[voice (phonetics)|voice]]d consonants. There were four tones, with the fourth, the"entering tone", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in stops (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k'').

This syllable structure was also found in neighbouring languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] – [[proto-Hmong–Mien language|Proto-Hmong–Mien]], [[proto-Tai language|Proto-Tai]] and early [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] – and is largely preserved by early loans between the languages.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=54–55}} Towards the end of the first millennium AD, all of these languages experienced a tone split conditioned by initial consonants. Each tone split into an upper (''yīn'' 阴/陰) register consisting of words with voiceless initials and a lower (''yáng'' 阳/陽) register of words with voiced initials. When voicing was lost in most varieties, the register distinction became phonemic, yielding up to eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=52–54}}

The traditional classification of [[varieties of Chinese]] distinguished seven groups according to the reflexes of Middle Chinese voiced initials in various tonal categories.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}}
For example, voiced stops are preserved in the [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] and [[Old Xiang]] groups, have merged with aspirated or unaspirated stops depending on the tone in Mandarin, and have uniformly become aspirated stops in [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=191, 199–200, 204–205}} The distinguishing characteristic of Min varieties is that voiced stops yield both aspirated and unaspirated stops in all tonal categories. Further, the distribution is consistent across Min varieties, suggesting a common ancestor in which two types of voiced stop were distinguished.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–229}}

Min must have diverged before two changes in other Chinese varieties (including Middle Chinese) that are not reflected in Min:
* The [[Old Chinese]] finals *-jaj and *-je merged after velar initials.  This merger is reflected in a change in poetic rhyme between the [[Western Han]] (206 BC to 9 AD) and Eastern Han (25–220 AD) periods.{{sfnp|Ting|1983|pp=9–10}}
* Old Chinese velars [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] in certain environments during the Western Han period.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=33, 79}}
However, the palatalization of dental stops, which had occurred in some dialects by the Eastern Han period, is common to Middle Chinese and Min.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=76}}
Baxter and Sagart suggest that the later part of the Proto-Min period may have overlapped with [[Early Middle Chinese]].{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=388}}

Pointing to features of Min varieties that are also found in Hakka and Yue varieties, [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] suggests that the three groups are descended from a variety spoken in the lower [[Yangtze]] region during the Han period, which he calls Old Southern Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=211–214}}
He argues that this dialect belonged to the group of dialects known as Wu (吳) or Jiangdong (江東) in the [[Western Jin]] period, when the writer [[Guo Pu]] (early 4th century AD) described them as quite distinct from other Chinese varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|pp=334–336}}
Some of the distinctive Jiangdong words mentioned by Guo Pu appear to be preserved in modern Min varieties, including Proto-Min *gi&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; "leech" and *lhɑn&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; "young fowl".{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|pp=335–336}}
This language entered Fujian after the area was opened to Chinese settlement by the defeat of the [[Minyue]] state by the armies of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 110 BC.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|p=328}}
Norman argues that Hakka and Yue have resulted from overlays of this language by successive waves of influence from northern China.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=214}}

When Chinese soldiers and settlers moved south from their homeland in the [[North China Plain]], they came into contact with speakers of [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and [[Austroasiatic languages]]. Early loans from Chinese into these languages date from around Han times and thus contain evidence of the sounds of Chinese as spoken in the south at that time.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=34–37}}

=== Strata ===
Norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:
# A non-Chinese [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] from the original languages of [[Minyue]], which Norman believes were [[Austroasiatic]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|pp=331–332}}  These etymologies have been disputed by [[Laurent Sagart]], and there is no other evidence for an early Austroasiatic presence in southeast China.{{sfnp|Sagart|2008|pp=141–143}}
# The earliest Chinese layer, brought to Fujian by settlers from Zhejiang to the north during the Han dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|pp=334–336}}
# A layer from the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, largely consistent with the phonology of the ''[[Qieyun]]'' dictionary, which was published in 601 AD but based on earlier dictionaries that are now lost.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|p=336}}
# A [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary layer]] based on the [[koiné language|koiné]] of [[Chang'an]], the capital of the [[Tang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|p=337}}
Since the two later layers can largely be derived from the ''Qieyun'', Norman sought to focus on the earlier layers.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|p=336}}

Early classifications, such as those of [[Li Fang-Kuei]] in 1937 and [[Yuan Jiahua]] in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=49}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}
However, in a 1963 report on a survey of Fujian, Pan Maoding and colleagues argued that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=121}}
The inland varieties are distinguished by consistently having two distinct reflexes of Middle Chinese /l/.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}
The two groups also have differences in their vocabulary, including their pronoun systems.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=233–234}}

The coastal dialects are divided into three subgroups:{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=52}}
;[[Eastern Min]]
:including [[Fuzhou]], [[Ningde]] and [[Fu'an]] in northeast Fujian
;[[Pu-Xian Min]]
:including [[Putian]] and [[Xianyou County|Xianyou]] on the central Fujian coast
;[[Southern Min]]
:including [[Xiamen]], [[Zhangzhou]] and [[Quanzhou]] in southern Fujian, and [[Chaozhou]], [[Jieyang]] and [[Shantou]] in eastern Guangdong
They divided the inland dialects into two subgroups:
;[[Northern Min]]
:including [[Jianyang District|Jianyang]], [[Jian'ou]], [[Chong'an]], [[Zhenghe County|Zhenghe]] and [[Shibei]]
;[[Central Min]]
:including [[Sanming]] and [[Yong'an]] in western Fujian
Several varieties in the far west of Fujian include features of Min and the neighbouring Gan and Hakka groups, making them difficult to classify.
In the [[Shao-Jiang Min|Shaojiang]] dialects, spoken in the northwestern Fujian counties of [[Shaowu]] and [[Jiangle]], the reflexes of Middle Chinese voiced stops are uniformly aspirated, as in Gan and Hakka, leading some workers to assign them to one of these groups.
Pan et al. described them as intermediate between Min and Hakka.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=122}}
However, Norman showed that their tonal development could only be explained in terms of the same two classes of voiced initial assumed for Min dialects.  He suggested that they were inland Min dialects that had been subject to heavy Gan or Hakka influence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=235, 241}}
Norman's student David Prager Branner argued that the varieties of [[Longyan]] and the township of Wan'an, in the southwestern part of the province, were coastal Min varieties, but outside of the three subgroups identified by Pan.{{sfnp|Branner|1999|pp=37, 78}}{{sfnp|Branner|2000|pp=115–116}}

==Initials ==
In a series of papers from 1973, Jerry Norman sought to reconstruct the initial consonants of proto-Min by applying the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] to pronunciations in modern Min varieties.
For this purpose, rather that the traditional approach of soliciting readings of character lists, he focussed on everyday vocabulary and excluded words of literary origin.{{sfnp|Handel|2010b|pp=28–29}}

The inventory of proto-Min initials differs from that of [[Middle Chinese]] (as deduced from the ''[[Qieyun]]'' rhyme book and its successors) in several ways:
* Middle Chinese has two series of [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] initials that are not found in proto-Min.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=231}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=102, 104, 108}}
* Whereas Middle Chinese obstruents have a three-way manner distinction, proto-Min has a six-way distinction: both voiced and voiceless stops may be aspirated or unaspirated, and also have an additional series that Norman called "softened".{{sfnp|Norman|1974|p=28}}
* Proto-Min has two series of sonorants.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|p=231}}
* Proto-Min distinguishes voiced fricatives *ɣ and *ɦ.{{sfnp|Norman|1974|p=28}}

The most controversial have been the "softened" stops and affricates, so named because they have lateral or fricative reflexes in some Northern Min varieties centred on Jianyang.
These initials also have distinct tonal reflexes in the Northern Min and Shaojiang groups, but have merged with unaspirated stops and affricates in coastal varieties.
Other scholars have suggested that the patterns observed in northwest Fujian can be explained as a mixture of forms from neighbouring Wu, Gan and Hakka varieties, though this does not explain the regularity of the correspondences.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|pp=49–50}}
In addition, the forms of many of the words in the proposed donor varieties do not match the Min reflexes, and some of the words occur only in Min.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=89}}

Since the pioneering reconstruction of [[Bernhard Karlgren]], Old Chinese has been reconstructed by projecting the categories of Middle Chinese back onto the rhyming patterns of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and the shared phonetic components of [[Chinese characters]]. Thus Old Chinese is usually reconstructed with the same three-way manner distinction in obstruent initials found in Middle Chinese.  However this does not preclude additional manner distinctions that merged in Middle Chinese, because rhyme gives no information about initials and sharing of phonetic components indicates initials with the same [[place of articulation]] but not necessarily the same manner.{{sfnp|Handel|2010a}}
Several scholars have attempted to incorporate proto-Min data into their reconstructions of Old Chinese.
The most systematic attempt to date is the reconstruction of Baxter and Sagart, who derive the additional initials from a number of initial consonant clusters and [[minor syllable]]s.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=84–93}}

=== Voiceless stops and affricates ===
All modern Min varieties have a two-way contrast between unaspirated and aspirated voiceless stops and affricates.{{efn|Southern Min varieties also have voiced stops and affricates, which are derived from earlier nasal initials.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}}}
Where these initials occur with upper register tones, they are projected back into proto-Min, and correspond to unaspirated and aspirated voiceless initials in Middle Chinese.
However, some Middle Chinese voiceless unaspirated initials correspond to fricatives or laterals in Northern Min, and also have a special tonal development in Northern Min and Shao–Jiang.
Norman called these initials voiceless "softened" stops and affricates.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|pp=228–231}}

In loans from southern Chinese into proto-Hmong–Mien, softened obstruents are often represented by [[prenasalized consonant]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1986|pp=381–383}}
Norman suggests the proto-Min initials were also prenasalized,{{sfnp|Norman|1986|p=381}} whereas Baxter and Sagart derive them from stops preceded by [[minor syllable]]s, arguing that the intervocalic environment caused the stops to weaken to fricatives in some dialects.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=88–89}}

=== Voiced stops and affricates ===

In most varieties of Chinese that have lost the voicing of Middle Chinese initials, the aspiration of the resulting initials is conditioned by tone, though the relationship varies between dialect groups.
In Min varieties however, both aspirated and unaspirated voiceless initials are found in lower register tones.
These initials must therefore be distinguished in proto-Min as aspirated and unaspirated voiced consonants.
In Shao–Jiang these initials are uniformly aspirated, but the same distinction is reflected in the tonal development.
As with the voiceless initials, there is a third group of formerly voiced initials with fricative or lateral reflexes in some Northern Min varieties, which Norman called "softened" voiced initials.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|pp=224–227}}
In Eastern Min varieties, voiced unaspirated affricates typically yielded plain /s/.{{sfnp|Branner|1999|p=40}}

There are several cases where an adjective or intransitive verb beginning with an unaspirated voiced stop is paired with a transitive verb differing only in aspiration of the voiced stop, suggesting that the contrast reflects an early morphological process.{{sfnp|Norman|1991b|pp=340–341}}

Early loans from southern Chinese into proto-Hmong–Mien have prenasalized stops corresponding to both aspirated and softened voiced stops in proto-Min.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=88}}
Baxter and Sagart derive aspirated voiced stops from tightly bound nasal preinitials in Old Chinese, and softened voiced stops from voiced stops preceded by minor syllables.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=88}}

=== Sonorants ===

Inland Min varieties are characterized by having two distinct reflexes of Middle Chinese /l/, which Norman labels as proto-Min *l and *lh.
The two have merged in coastal varieties.
In modern Southern Min varieties such as [[Hokkien]], /l/ and /n/ comprise a single phoneme, realized as /n/ before nasalized vowels and as /l/ in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|p=231}}
Two series of nasals can also be distinguished based on their tonal reflexes in Eastern Min and Shao-Jiang.
They generally produce a single series of nasal initials in modern varieties except in Southern Min.
In those varieties, the proto-Min initials *nh and *ŋh have become /h/ before high front vowels, *m, *n and *ŋ denasalized to *b, *l and *g respectively before oral vowels, but *mh and other occurrences of *nh and *ŋh often yield nasals in that context.{{sfnp|Norman|1991a|pp=207–208}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}

As the initials *lh, *nh, etc. follow the same tonal development as voiced aspirated initials throughout Min, Norman suggests that they were characterized by [[breathy voice]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991a|p=212}}
In Hakka dialects, nasals appear in both lower and upper register tones, suggesting a protolanguage with both voiced and voiceless nasals.
Moreover, the occurrence of these initials corresponds to the plain and aspirated nasals of proto-Min.{{sfnp|Norman|1991a|p=208}}
Norman suggests that they derive from voiced and voiceless nasals in Old Southern Chinese.
Further evidence for a voicing distinction comes from early loans into [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and the [[Mienic languages|Mienic]] and [[Tai languages]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991a|pp=211–212}}
Norman later abandoned the *ń initial, treating the dz-/z- initials in some Southern Min varieties as arising from *n followed by a high front vowel *i or *y.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=16}}{{sfnp|Zheng|2016|pp=84–92}}

A different set of voiceless resonant initials is proposed in most recent reconstructions of [[Old Chinese]], with fricative reflexes in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=46}}
Norman suggests that Old Southern Chinese voiceless sonorants derive from sonorants preceded by voiceless consonants.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|p=233}}
[[William H. Baxter|William Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]] have incorporated this proposal into their reconstruction of Old Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=171–173}}

=== Fricatives and others ===

Fricatives in upper and lower registers are assumed to derive from voiceless and voiced fricatives respectively, broadly corresponding to the voiceless and voiced fricatives of Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|1974|p=28}}
Zero initials show three distinct patterns of tonal development, reconstructed as initials *ɦ, *ʔ and a proto-Min zero initial.
The latter occurs only before the high front vowels *i and *y.{{sfnp|Norman|1974|pp=28–29}}

In Central Min, *s and *x merged as /ʃ/ before high front vowels.{{sfnp|Zheng|2016|p=119}}

== Tones ==
Proto-Min had four tone classes, corresponding to the [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones of Middle Chinese]]: syllables with vocalic or nasal endings belonged to class *A, *B or *C, whereas class *D consisted of the syllables ending in a stop (/p/, /t/ or /k/).{{sfnp|Norman|1973|p=223}} As with Middle Chinese and other languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, each of these classes split into upper and lower registers, depending on whether the original initial was voiceless or voiced.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=49}} When voicing was lost,{{efn|The voiced initials in modern Southern Min varieties are derived from proto-Min nasal initials.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=235–236}}}} the register distinction became phonemic, yielding tone classes conventionally numbered 1 to 8, with tones 1 and 2 naming the upper and lower registers of proto-Min class A*, and so on.{{sfnp|Norman|1973|p=223}} All 8 classes are retained by the Chaozhou dialect, but some have merged in other varieties. Some northern varieties, including the Jianyang dialect, have an additional tone class (tone 9), reflecting a partial merger of tone classes that cannot be predicted from Middle Chinese forms.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|pp=55, 68–72}}

Stop and affricate initials at other points of articulation produce the same tonal reflexes as the dental examples in the above table.
Voiceless fricatives have the same tonal reflexes as voiceless aspirated and unaspirated stops.
Voiced fricatives are more varied:{{sfnp|Norman|1974|pp=29–30}}
* The initials *z and *ɣ have the same tonal reflexes as aspirated nasals and voiced aspirated stops.
* The initial *ž follows voiced unaspirated stops.
* The initial *ɦ follows softened voiced stops.
The zero initial has the same tonal development as plain sonorants.{{sfnp|Norman|1974|p=30}}

== Finals ==
Norman reconstructs proto-Min finals as consisting of:
* an optional medial *i, *u or *y,
* a nuclear vowel *i, *u, *y, *e, *ə, *o, *a or *ɑ, and
* an optional coda *i, *u, *m, *n, *ŋ, *p, *t or *k.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=35}}

The close vowels *i, *u, *y, *e and *ə were short, with stronger following consonants, whereas the open vowels *o, *a and *ɑ were longer, with weaker following consonants.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=36}}{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}

Proto-Min also had a single word with a syllabic nasal, the usual negator *m&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (cognate with Middle Chinese ''mjɨjH'' {{linktext|未}} "not have").{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=56}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=234}}

== Sound changes leading to modern varieties ==
Most inland varieties have reduced the nasal codas to a single category.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}
Coastal varieties went through a series of changes that each affected part of the area, and interacted with nasal initials:
* In [[Southern Min]], [[Pu-Xian Min|Pu-Xian]] and [[Hainanese|Hainan]] varieties, nasal codas disappeared after open vowels, leaving [[nasalized vowel]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=36}}{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}
* In Southern Min, Pu–Xian and Hainanese, nasal initials became voiced stops or flaps except before nasalized vowels or nasal codas.  In Hokkien, denasalization also occurred before nasal codas, but not before nasalized vowels.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|pp=5–9}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=235–236}}  In Pu-Xian, these initials later devoiced, merging with the voiceless unaspirated stops.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=7}}
* Vowels subsequently lost their nasalization in Putian and Hainan.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=136}}
* A later merger of nasal codas as /ŋ/ occurred in Pu–Xian and some Eastern Min dialects, including Fuzhou, Fuding and Gutian, but not Fu'an and Ningde.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=138}} A partial merger occurred in Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shantou, where -n merged with -ŋ.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=7}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}

In most inland varieties stop codas have disappeared, but are marked with separate tonal categories.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}
In coastal varieties, stop codas underwent changes corresponding to those affecting nasal codas:
* Final stops following open vowels merged as a [[glottal stop]] in Southern Min, Pu–Xian and Hainanese.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=36}}{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}} In Eastern Min, only final *k changed to a glottal stop in this environment.
* This glottal stop then disappeared in Pu–Xian.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}
* Stop codas merged as /k/ in Pu–Xian, Fuzhou, Fuding and Gutian, but not Fu'an and Ningde,{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=5}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=138}} and -t merged with -k in Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shantou.{{sfnp|Bodman|1985|p=7}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=237}}

== Vocabulary ==
Most Min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other Chinese varieties, but there is also a significant number of distinctively Min words that may be traced back to proto-Min.
In some cases a semantic shift has occurred in Min or the rest of Chinese:

* *tiaŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 鼎 "wok".  The Min form preserves the original meaning "cooking pot", but in other Chinese varieties this word (MC ''tengX'' &gt; ''dǐng'') has become specialized to refer to ancient ceremonial tripods.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=231}}
* *dzhən&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; "rice field".  In Min this form has displaced the common Chinese term ''tián'' 田.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=58}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=231–232}}  Many scholars identify the Min word with ''chéng'' 塍 (MC ''zying'') "raised path between fields", but Norman argues that it is cognate with ''céng'' 層 (MC ''dzong'') "additional layer or floor", reflecting the [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]d fields commonly found in Fujian.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=59–60}}
* *tšhio&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 厝 "house".{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=47}}  Norman argues that the Min word is cognate with ''shù'' 戍 (MC ''syuH'') "to guard".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=232}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=33}}
* *tshyi&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 喙 "mouth".  In Min this form has displaced the common Chinese term ''kǒu'' 口.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=41}}  It is believed to be cognate with ''huì'' 喙 (MC ''xjwojH'') "beak, bill, snout; to pant".{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=33}}

Norman and Mei Tsu-lin have suggested an [[Austroasiatic]] origin for some Min words:

* *-dəŋ&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; "shaman" may be compared with [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''đồng'' (/ɗoŋ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/) "to shamanize, to communicate with spirits" and [[Mon language|Mon]] doŋ "to dance (as if) under demonic possession".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=18–19}}{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976|pp=296–297}}  However, [[Laurent Sagart]] argues that this word is cognate with Chinese ''tóng'' 童 (MC ''duwng'') "child, servant".{{sfnp|Sagart|2008|p=142}}
* *kiɑn&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 囝 "son" appears to be related to Vietnamese ''con'' (/kɔn/) and Mon kon "child".{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=63}}{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976|pp=297–298}}

In other cases, the origin of the Min word is obscure.  Such words include *khau&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; 骹 "foot",{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=44}} *-tsiɑm&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 䭕 "insipid"{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=56}} and *dzyŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 𧚔 "to wear".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=232}}

A '''rafter''' is one of a series of sloped [[structural member]]s that extend from the ridge or hip to the [[wall plate]], downslope perimeter or [[eave]], and that are designed to support the roof deck and its associated loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/rafter.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125214318/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/rafter.html|archivedate=January 25, 2007|deadurl=yes|title=rafter (1)|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=July 4, 2017|website=[[encarta]].[[msn]].com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of rafters is called a ''couple''. In home construction, rafters are normally made of [[wood]]. Exposed rafters are a feature of some traditional roof styles.

==Applications==
In recent buildings there is a preference for [[truss]]ed rafters on the grounds of cost, economy of materials, off-site manufacture, and ease of construction, as well as design considerations including span limitations and roof loads (weight from above).{{fact|date=July 2017}}

==Types in traditional timber framing==
There are many names for rafters depending on their location, shape, or size (see below). The earliest surviving roofs in Europe are of common rafters on a tie beam, this assembly is technically called a "closed couple". Later principal rafters and common rafters were mixed which is called a major/minor or primary/secondary roof system.
Historically many rafters, including hip rafters, often taper in height 1/5 to 1/6 of their width, the larger end at the foot. Architect George Woodward discusses the purpose of this in 1860: "The same amount of strength can be had with a less amount of lumber. There is an additional labor in sawing such rafters, as well as a different calculation to be made in using up a log to the best advantage. It is necessary always to order this special bill of rafters direct from the mill, and the result will be that the extra cost will, nine times out of ten, overbalance the amount saved."&lt;ref&gt;Geo. E. Woodward, " 'Balloon Frames' - 9th Article", The Cultivator third series, Vol. IX no. 1, January 1861)&lt;/ref&gt; John Muller also discusses a one-sixth taper for rafters.&lt;ref&gt;A Treatise Containing the Practical Part of Fortification (London 1755)&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces added at the feet to create an overhang or change the roof pitch are called a sprocket or coyau in French. (The projecting piece on the gable of a building forming an overhang is called a [[Lookout (architecture)|lookout]]. A rafter can be reinforced with a strut, principal purlin, collar beam, or rarely an auxiliary rafter (see below).

Rafter types include:
* Principal rafter (major rafter, rarely a chief rafter): A larger rafter. Usually land directly on a tie beam. Usually the purpose of having a larger rafter is to carry a [[purlin]] which supports the rafters in each bay. Sometimes the top cord (uppermost member) of a [[truss]] looks like a principal rafter. Principal rafters are sometimes simply called "principals".
* Common rafter (minor rafter): being smaller than a principal rafter. A "principal/common rafter roof" or "double roof" has both principals and commons. (Also called major/minor, primary/secondary).
* Auxiliary (cushon, compound, secondary, sub-) rafter: A secondary rafter below and supporting a principal rafter. A rare type of rafter.
* Compass rafter: A rafter curved or bowed on the top (the top surface of a rafter is called its "back") or both the top and bottom surfaces.
* Curb rafter: The upper rafters in a curb (kerb, [[gambrel]], [[Mansard roof]]) roof.
* Hip rafter (angle rafter): The rafter in the corners of a [[hip roof]]. The foot of a hip rafter lands on a [[dragon beam]].
* King rafter: the longest rafter on the side of a hip roof in line with the ridge.
* Valley rafter (historically also called a sleeper): A rafter forming a [[Hip roof|valley (look for illustration showing a valley)]].
* Intermediate rafter: "one between principal or common rafters to strengthen a given place" (rare).
* Jack rafter, cripple rafter, cripple-jack rafter: A shortened rafter such as landing on a hip rafter or interrupted by a [[dormer]].
* Arched rafter: Of segmental form in an arched roof.
* [[Knee (construction)|Knee]] (crook, kneeling, cranked) rafter: A rafter with a bend typically a few feet from the foot used to gain attic space like adding a kneewall. Rare in America.
* Barge rafter: The outermost rafter on a gable end, sometimes forming a roof overhang.
* Butt rafter: A smaller rafter interrupted by and joined to a butt [[purlin]]. Common rafters pass over and are supported by a principal purlin, if present.
* A "binding rafter" is not a rafter but an obsolete name for a purlin or support.
* Part of a [[cruck]] frame may function as a rafter but they are called a cruck blade.
*Rafters are usually made of [[Pine]] or Cedar. For longer span rafters, building materials manufacturers have created LVL (Laminated veneer lumber) rafters that can be 2–5 times longer than typical wood rafter.  
*In US, most wood rafters have maximum length of 20 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roofcalc.org/roof-rafter-calculator/|title=Rafter Calculator – Estimate Length And Cost To Replace Roof Rafters {{!}} RoofCalc.org|date=2018-01-11|work=RoofCalc.org|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a longer rafter is needed, LVL is the ideal combination alternative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31002">'''Referring expression generation''' ('''REG''') is the subtask of [[natural language generation]] (NLG) that received most scholarly attention. While NLG is concerned with the conversion of non-linguistic information into natural language, '''REG''' focuses only on the creation of [[referring expression]]s (noun phrases) that identify specific entities called ''targets''.

This task can be split into two sections. The ''content selection'' part determines which set of properties distinguish the intended target and the ''linguistic realization'' part defines how these properties are translated into natural language.
A variety of algorithms have been developed in the NLG community to generate different types of referring expressions.

==Types of referring expressions==
A [[referring expression]] (RE), in linguistics, is any [[noun phrase]], or surrogate for a noun phrase, whose function in discourse is to ''identify'' some individual object (thing, being, event...) The [[technical terminology]] for ''identify'' differs a great deal from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably ''refer'', and a thing identified is a ''referent'', as for example in the work of [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]]. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to [[pragmatics]], the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to understand the nature of [[knowledge]], [[perception]] and [[cognition]] more generally.

Various devices can be used for reference: [[determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[proper name]]s... Reference relations can be of different kinds; referents can be in a "real" or imaginary world, in discourse itself, and they may be singular, plural, or collective.

===Pronouns===
The simplest type of referring expressions are [[pronouns|pronoun]] such as ''he'' and ''it''.  The linguistics and natural language processing communities have developed various models for predicting anaphor referents, such as centering theory,&lt;ref name="Poesio et al."&gt;M Poesio, R Stevenson, B di Eugenio, J Hitzeman (2004). Centering: A Parametric Theory and Its Instantiations.  ''Computational Linguistics'' 30:309-363 [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J04-3003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and ideally referring-expression generation would be based on such models.  However most NLG systems use much simpler algorithms, for example using a pronoun if the referent was mentioned in the previous sentence (or sentential clause), and no other entity of the same gender was mentioned in this sentence.

===Definite noun phrases===
There has been a considerable amount of research on generating definite noun phrases, such as ''the big red book''.  Much of this builds on the model proposed by Dale and Reiter.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; This has been extended in various ways, for example Krahmer ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Erk,Verleg"&gt;E Krahmer, S van Erk, A Verleg (2003).  Graph-Based Generation of Referring Expressions. Computational Linguistics 23:53-72 [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J03-1003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; present a graph-theoretic model of definite NP generation with many nice properties.  In recent years a shared-task event has compared different algorithms for definite NP generation, using the TUNA&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/corpus-496.php]&lt;/ref&gt; corpus.

===Spatial and temporal reference===
Recently there has been more research on generating referring expressions for time and space.  Such references tend to be imprecise (what is the exact meaning of ''tonight''?), and also to be interpreted in different ways by different people.&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter, S Sripada, J Hunter, J Yu, and I Davy (2005). Choosing Words in Computer-Generated Weather Forecasts. ''Artificial Intelligence'' 167:137-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence it may be necessary to explicitly reason about false positive vs false negative tradeoffs, and even calculate the utility of different possible referring expressions in a particular task context.&lt;ref name="Turner et al."&gt;R Turner, Y Sripada, E Reiter (2009) Generating Approximate Geographic Descriptions. ''Proceedings of the 12th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG)'', pages 42–49, Athens. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-0607.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for good expressions===
Ideally, a good referring expression should satisfy a number of criteria:
* ''Referential success'': It should unambiguously identify the referent to the reader.
* ''Ease of comprehension'': The reader should be able to quickly read and understand it.
* ''Computational complexity'': The generation algorithm should be fast
* ''No false inferences'': The expression should not confuse or mislead the reader by suggesting false [[implicature]]s or other pragmatic inferences.  For example, a reader may be confused if he is told ''Sit by the brown wooden table'' in a context where there is only one table.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"&gt;R Dale, E Reiter (1995). Computational interpretations of the Gricean maxims in the generation of referring expressions. ''Cognitive Science'', 18:233–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-2000 era===
REG goes back to the early days of NLG. One of the first approaches was done by Winograd&lt;ref&gt;T Winograd (1972). Understanding Natural Language. ''Academic Press'', New York. Section 8.3.3, Naming Objects and Events&lt;/ref&gt; in 1972 who developed an "[[incremental algorithm|incremental]]" REG algorithm for his [[SHRDLU]] program. Afterwards researchers started to model the human abilities to create referring expressions in the 1980s. This new approach to the topic was influenced by the researchers Appelt and Kronfeld who created the programs KAMP and BERTRAND&lt;ref name="Appelt"&gt;D Appelt (1985). Planning English referring expressions. ''Artificial Intelligence'', 26:1–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelt&amp;Kronfeld"&gt;D Appelt, A Kronfeld (1987). A computational model of referring. ''In Proceedings of the 10th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)'', pages 640–647, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Kronfeld (1990). Reference and Computation: An Essay in Applied Philosophy of Language. ''Cambridge University Press'', Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and considered referring expressions as parts of bigger speech acts.

Some of their most interesting findings were the fact that referring expressions can be used to add information beyond the identification of the referent&lt;ref name="Appelt&amp;Kronfeld" /&gt; as well as the influence of communicative context and the [[Gricean maxim]]s on referring expressions.&lt;ref name="Appelt" /&gt; Furthermore, its skepticism concerning the naturalness of minimal descriptions made Appelt and Kronfeld's research a foundation of later work on REG.

The search for simple, well-defined problems changed the direction of research in the early 1990s. This new approach was led by Dale and Reiter who stressed the identification of the referent as the central goal.&lt;ref name="Dale1989"&gt;R Dale (1989). Cooking up referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 68–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dale1992"&gt;R Dale (1992). Generating Referring Expressions: Constructing Descriptions in a Domain of Objects and Processes. ''TheMIT Press'', Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter (1990). The computational complexity of avoiding conversational implicatures. ''In Proceedings of the 28th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 97–104, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Reiter, R Dale (1992). A fast algorithm for the generation of referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)'', pages 232–238, Nantes.&lt;/ref&gt;
Like Appelt&lt;ref name="Appelt" /&gt; they discuss the connection between the [[Gricean maxim]]s and referring expressions in their culminant paper&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; in which they also propose a formal [[#Problem definition|problem definition]]. Furthermore, Reiter and Dale discuss the [[#Full Brevity|Full Brevity]] and [[#Greedy Heuristics|Greedy Heuristics]] algorithms as well as their [[#Incremental Algorithm|Incremental Algorithm]](IA) which became one of the most important algorithms in REG.
&lt;ref group="note" name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter"&gt;This section is an excerpt of the following paper. For more details see: E Krahmer, K van Deemter (2012). Computational Generation of Referring Expressions: A Survey. ''Computational Linguistics'' 38:173-218 [https://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J12/J12-1006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
After 2000 the research began to lift some of the simplifying assumptions, that had been made in early REG research in order to create more simple algorithms. Different research groups concentrated on different limitations creating several expanded algorithms. Often these extend the IA in a single perspective for example in relation to:

Many simplifying assumptions are still in place or have just begun to be worked on. Also a combination of the different extensions has yet to be done and is called a "non-trivial enterprise" by Krahmer and van Deemter.&lt;ref name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter"&gt;E Krahmer, K van Deemter (2012). Computational Generation of Referring Expressions: A Survey. ''Computational Linguistics'' 38:173-218 [https://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J12/J12-1006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important change after 2000 was the increasing use of [[#Evaluation of REG systems|empirical studies]] in order to evaluate algorithms. This development took place due to the emergence of transparent [[#Corpus-based Evaluation|corpora]]. Although there are still discussions about what the best evaluation metrics are, the use of experimental evaluation has already led to a better comparability of algorithms, a discussion about the goals of REG and more task-oriented research.

Furthermore, research has extended its range to related topics such as the choice of ''[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Knowledge Representation]](KR) Frameworks''. In this area the main question, which KR framework is most suitable for the use in REG remains open. The answer to this question depends on how well descriptions can be expressed or found. A lot of the potential of KR frameworks has been left unused so far.

Some of the different approaches are the usage of:

* ''[[Graph search]]'' which treats relations between targets in the same way as properties.&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Erk,Verleg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Viethen&amp;Dale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krahmer,Goudbeek,Theune"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Krahmer, M Theune, J Viethen, I Hendrickx (2008).

&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

==Problem definition==
Dale and Reiter (1995) think about referring expressions as distinguishing descriptions.

They define:
* The ''referent'' as the entity that should be described
* The ''context set'' as set of salient entities
* The ''contrast set'' or ''potential distractors'' as all elements of the context set except the referent
* A ''property'' as a reference to a single [[attribute-value pair]]
Each entity in the domain can be characterised as a set of [[attribute-value pair]]s for example &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;type, dog&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;gender, female&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\langle&lt;/math&gt;age, 10 years&lt;math&gt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The problem then is defined as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be the intended referent, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the contrast set. Then, a set &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of attribute–value pairs will represent a distinguishing description if the following two conditions hold:
# Every attribute–value pair in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; applies to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: that is, every element of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; specifies an attribute–value that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; possesses.
# For every member &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, there is at least one element &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that does not apply to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:  that is, there is an &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that specifies an attribute–value that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; does not  possess. &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is said to rule out &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, to generate a referring expression one is looking for a set of properties that apply to the referent but not to the distractors.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter" /&gt;

The problem could be easily solved by conjoining all the properties of the referent which often leads to long descriptions violating the second [[Gricean maxim#Maxim of Quantity|Gricean Maxim of Quantity]]. Another approach would be to find the shortest distinguishing description like the [[#Full Brevity|Full Brevity algorithm]] does.
Yet in practice it is most common to instead include the condition that referring expressions produced by an algorithm should be as similar to human-produced ones as possible although this is often not explicitly mentioned.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

==Basic algorithms==

===Full Brevity===
The Full Brevity algorithm always finds a minimal distinguishing description meaning there is no shorter distinguishing description in regard to properties used.

Therefore, it iterates over &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,4,...&lt;/math&gt; and checks every description of a length of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; properties until a distinguishing description is found.

Two problems arise from this way of creating referring expressions. Firstly the algorithm has a high complexity meaning it is [[NP-hard]] which makes it impractical to use.&lt;ref&gt;M R Garey, D S. Johnson (1979). ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP–Completeness''. W. H. Freeman, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly human speakers produce descriptions that are not minimal in many situations.&lt;ref&gt;D R Olson (1970). Language and thought: Aspects of a cognitive theory of semantics. ''Psychological Review'', 77:257–273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Sonnenschein (1984). The effect of redundant communication on listeners: Why different types may have different effects. ''Journal of Psycholinguistic Research'', 13:147–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Pechmann (1989). Incremental speech production and referential overspecification. ''Linguistics'', 27:98–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P E Engelhardt, K G.D Bailey, F Ferreira (2006). Do speakers and listeners observe the Gricean Maxim of Quantity?. ''Journal of Memory and Language'', 54:554–573.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Greedy Heuristics===
The Greedy Heuristics algorithm&lt;ref name="Dale1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dale1992"/&gt; approximates the Full Brevity algorithm by iteratively adding the most distinguishing property to the description. The most distinguishing property means the property that rules out most of the remaining distractors. The Greedy Heuristics algorithm is more efficient than the Full Brevity algorithm.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

Dale and Reiter(1995)&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; present the following algorithm for the Greedy Heuristic:

Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the set of properties to be realised in our description; let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the set of properties known to be true of our intended referent &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (we assume that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty); and let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the set of distractors (the contrast set). The initial conditions are thus as follows:
 &lt;math&gt;C = \{ \langle &lt;/math&gt;all distractors&lt;math&gt;\rangle \}&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;math&gt;P = \{ \langle &lt;/math&gt;all properties true of &lt;math&gt;r\rangle \}&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;math&gt;L = \{\}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to describe the intended referent &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the contrast set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, we do the
following:
 1. Check Success:
    '''if''' &lt;math&gt;|C| = 0&lt;/math&gt; '''then''' return &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as a distinguishing description
    '''elseif''' &lt;math&gt;P = \empty&lt;/math&gt; '''then''' fail
    '''else''' '''goto''' Step 2.
 2. Choose Property:
    '''for each''' &lt;math&gt;p_i \in P&lt;/math&gt; '''do''': &lt;math&gt;C_i \leftarrow C \cap \{x|p_i(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
    Chosen property is &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest set.
    '''goto''' Step 3.
 3. Extend Description (wrt the chosen &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;):
    &lt;math&gt;L \leftarrow L \cup \{p_j\}&lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt;C \leftarrow C_j&lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt;P \leftarrow P - \{p_j\}&lt;/math&gt;
    '''goto''' Step 1.

===Incremental Algorithm===
The Incremental Algorithm (IA) by Dale and Reiter&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; was the most influential algorithm before 2000. It is based on the idea of a ''preferential'' order of attributes or properties that speakers go by. So in order to run the Incremental Algorithm, first a preference order of attributes has to be given. Now the algorithm follows that order and adds those properties to the description which rule out any remaining distractors. Furthermore, Dale and Reiter&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; stress the attribute type which is always included in their descriptions even if it does not rule out any distractors.

Also the type values are part of a ''subsumption hierarchy'' including some ''basic level values''. For example, in the ''pet'' domain ''chihuahua'' is subsumed by ''dog'' and ''dog'' by ''animal''. Because ''dog'' is defined as a basic level ''dog'' would be preferred by the algorithms, if ''chihuahua'' does not rule out any distractors.

The Incremental Algorithm is easy to implement and also computationally efficient running in [[polynomial time]]. The description generated by the IA can contain redundant properties that are superfluous because of later added properties. The creators do not consider this as a weakness, but rather as making the expressions less "psycholinguistically implausible".&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter" /&gt;

The following algorithm is a simplified version of Dale and Reiter’s Incremental Algorithm&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; by Krahmer and van Deemter&lt;ref name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter"/&gt; that takes as input the referent ''r'', the ''D'' containing a collection of domain objects and a domain-specific ordered list ''Pref'' of preferred attributes. In the notation ''L'' is the description, ''C'' the context set of distractors and the function RulesOut({{angbr|A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, V}}) returns the set of objects which have a value different to V for attribute A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
 IncrementalAlgorithm ({r}, D, Pref){
  L ← ∅
  C ← D - {r}
  '''for each''' A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in list Pref '''do'''
     V = Value(r, A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)
     '''if''' C ∩ RulesOut({{angbr|A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, V}}) ≠ ∅
     '''then''' L ← L ∪ &amp;#123;{{angbr|A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, V}}&amp;#125;
          C ← C - RulesOut({{angbr|A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, V}})
     '''endif'''
     '''if''' C ≠ ∅
     '''then''' '''return''' L
     '''endif'''
  '''return''' failure }&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

==Evaluation of REG systems==
Before 2000 evaluation of REG systems has been of theoretical nature like the one done by Dale and Reiter.&lt;ref name="Dale&amp;Reiter"/&gt; More recently, empirical studies have become popular which are mostly based on the assumption that the generated expressions should be similar to human-produced ones. [[Corpus linguistics|Corpus]]-based evaluation began quite late in REG due to a lack of suitable data sets. Still corpus-based evaluation is the most dominant method at the moment though there is also evaluation by human judgement.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Corpus-based evaluation===
First the distinction between [[text corpora]] and experimental corpora has to be made. [[Text corpora]] like the GNOME corpus&lt;ref name="Poesio et al."/&gt; can contain texts from all kind of domains. In REG they are used to evaluate the ''realization'' part of algorithms. The ''content selection'' part of REG on the other hand requires a corpus that contains the properties of all domain objects as well as the properties used in references. Typically those fully "semantically transparent"&lt;ref&gt;K van Deemter, I van der Sluis, A Gatt (2006). Building a semantically transparent corpus for the generation of referring expressions. ''In Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 130–132, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; created in experiments using simple and controlled settings.

These experimental corpora once again can be separated into ''General-Purpose Corpora'' that were collected for another purpose but have been analysed for referring expressions and ''Dedicated Corpora'' that focus specifically on referring expressions. Examples of General-Purpose Corpora are the Pear Stories,&lt;ref&gt;W W Chafe (1980). ''The Pear Stories: Cognitive, Cultural, and Linguistic Aspects of Narrative Production.'' Ablex, Norwood, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; the Map Task corpus&lt;ref&gt;A A Anderson, M Bader, E Gurman Bard, E Boyle, G Doherty, S Garrod, S Isard, J Kowtko, J McAllister, J Miller, C Sotillo, H Thompson, R Weinert (1991). The HCRC map task corpus. ''Language and Speech'', 34:351–366.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Coconut corpus&lt;ref&gt;B Di Eugenio, P W Jordan, R H Thomason, J D Moore (2000). The agreement process: an empirical investigation of human–human computer-mediated collaborative dialogs. ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'', 53:1017–1076.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bishop corpus,&lt;ref&gt;P Gorniak, D Roy (2004). Grounded semantic composition for visual scenes. ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research'', 21:429–470.&lt;/ref&gt; the Drawer corpus&lt;ref&gt;J Viethen, R Dale (2006). Algorithms for generating referring expressions: Do they do what people do?. ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 63–70, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; and the TUNA corpus&lt;ref name="Gatt Sluis Deemter"&gt;A Gatt, I van der Sluis, K van Deemter (2007). Evaluating algorithms for the generation of referring expressions using a balanced corpus. ''Proceedings of the 11th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG)'', pages 49–56, Schloss Dagstuhl.&lt;/ref&gt; count to the Dedicated Corpora. 
The TUNA corpus which contains web-collected data on the two domains furniture and people has been used in three shared REG challenges already.&lt;ref group=note name="Krahmer&amp;van Deemter" /&gt;

===Evaluation metrics===
To measure the correspondence between corpora and the results of REG algorithms several Metrics have been developed.

To measure the ''content selection'' part the [[Sørensen–Dice coefficient|Dice coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;L R Dice (1945). Measures of the amount of ecologic association between species. ''Ecology'', 26:297–302.&lt;/ref&gt; or the MASI (Measuring Agreement on Set-valued Items)&lt;ref&gt;R Passonneau (2006). Measuring agreement on set-valued items (MASI) for semantic and pragmatic annotation. ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)'', pages 831–836, Genoa.&lt;/ref&gt; metric are used. These measure the overlap of properties in two descriptions. In an evaluation the scores are usually averaged over references made by different human participants in the corpus. Also sometimes a measure called Perfect Recall Percentage (PRP)&lt;ref name="Gatt Sluis Deemter"/&gt; or Accuracy&lt;ref&gt;A Gatt, A Belz, E Kow (2008). The TUNA challenge 2008: Overview and evaluation results. ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG)'', pages 198–206, Salt Fork, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; is used which calculates the percentage of perfect matches between an algorithm-produced and a human-produced reference.

For the ''linguistic realization'' part of REG the overlap between strings has been measured using metrics like [[BLEU]]&lt;ref&gt;K Papineni, S Roukos, T Ward, W Zhu (2002). BLEU: A method for automatic evaluation of machine translation. ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', pages 311–318, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[NIST (metric)|NIST]].&lt;ref&gt;G Doddington (2002). Automatic evaluation of machine translation quality using n-gram co-occurrence statistics. ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Human Language Technology Research (HLT)'', pages 138–145, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem that occurs with string-based metrics is that for example "The small monkey" is measured closer to "The small donkey" than to "The little monkey".

A more time consuming way to evaluate REG algorithms is by letting humans judge the ''Adequacy'' (How clear is the description?) and ''Fluency'' (Is the description given in good and clear English?) of the generated expression. Also Belz and Gatt&lt;ref&gt;A Belz, A Gatt (2008). Intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation measures for referring expression generation. ''Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)'', Columbus, OH.&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated referring expressions using an experimental setup. The participants get a generated description and then have to click on the target. Here the extrinsic metrics reading time, identification time and error rate could be evaluated.

The '''Sinclair Coefficients''' are a method to compare different [[weight class]]es in [[olympic weightlifting]]. It replaced Hoffman's formula, which was the first statistical analysis of this type.

The method provides the answer to the question "What would be the total of an athlete weighing ''x'' kg if he/she
were an athlete in the heaviest class of the same level of ability?", given by the formula:
ACTUAL TOTAL × SINCLAIR COEFFICIENT = SINCLAIR TOTAL.

There are eight bodyweight categories for men: 56&amp;nbsp;kg, 62&amp;nbsp;kg, 69&amp;nbsp;kg, 77&amp;nbsp;kg, 85&amp;nbsp;kg, 94&amp;nbsp;kg, 105&amp;nbsp;kg and +105&amp;nbsp;kg, and eight for women: 48&amp;nbsp;kg, 53&amp;nbsp;kg, 58&amp;nbsp;kg, 63&amp;nbsp;kg, 69&amp;nbsp;kg, 75&amp;nbsp;kg, 90&amp;nbsp;kg and +90&amp;nbsp;kg.

There are two types of lifts: [[Snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]], and [[clean and jerk]]. However, at most championships, medals are presented for both lifts and the total (the combined result of the best snatch and the best clean and jerk).

To compare and rank the results, especially between bodyweight categories, the [[International Weightlifting Federation]] uses the Sinclair Coefficients which are derived statistically and calculated for one Olympic cycle (for four years, starting in the Spring of each Olympic year).

The total for each bodyweight category is a projection of the Total for that weightlifter if he/she were a competitor in the heaviest bodyweight category with the same level of ability.

The Sinclair Coefficient is &lt;math&gt;10^{A({\log_{10}{(x/b)}})^2}&lt;/math&gt; if ''x''&amp;lt;''b'' where ''x'' is the weightlifter's bodyweight, ''b'' is the world record holder's bodyweight (in the heaviest category) and ''A'' is the coefficient for this Olympic cycle, or 1.0 if ''x''≥''b''.

Then, the Sinclair Total is simply the obtained total multiplied by the Sinclair Coefficient.

For example, from 2017 to 2020, a calculation of the Sinclair Coefficient is as follows, given A=0.751945030 and b=175.508 kg for men, with A=0.783497476 and b=153.655 kg for women.

Assume that we are assessing a male weightlifter weighing 61.9 kg with a total of 320 kg.

&lt;pre&gt;
Then, x=61.9 kg, and we have
X=log10(x/b)=log10(61.9/175.508)=−0.4526062683
A(X^2)=0.751945030*(-0.4526062683)^2=0.751945030*0.204852431=0.1540377697
10^(A(X^2))=10^0.1540377697=1.4257315812

Sinclair Total = Actual Total x S.C. = 320 kg x 1.4257315812 = 456.234
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Men's Sinclair chart==


To understand the whole idea, here is the chart with the men's bodyweight categories (in kg) and its world record Totals, Sinclair Coefficients, and Sinclair Total.  By looking at the Sinclair Total we can determine the RANK.

==Notable Sinclair Totals throughout the history of modern weightlifting==

[[Naim Süleymanoğlu]] achieved a Sinclair Total of 500.705 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, an all-time world record.&lt;ref&gt;Ledder, Glenn (2013). "Mathematics for the Life Sciences" p. 16. https://books.google.com/books?id=0VeRAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;ots=QfYf6PjYmn&amp;dq=Sinclair%20Coefficients%20naim%20suleymanoglu&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=Sinclair%20Coefficients%20naim%20suleymanoglu&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yurik Vardanyan]] set a 489.643 Sinclair Total in 1984 in [[Varna]], Bulgaria.

[[Yury Zakharevich]] set a 489.232 Sinclair Total at the 1988 Olympics in [[Seoul]], South Korea.

The highest women's Sinclair total is 352.622, set by Natalia Zabolotnaya at the 2011 President's Cup in Belgrod, Russia.

In [[biology]], a '''substrate''' is the surface on which an [[organism]] (such as a [[plant]], [[fungus]], or [[animal]]) lives. A substrate can include biotic or abiotic materials and animals. For example, encrusting algae that lives on a [[rock (geology)|rock]] (its substrate) can be itself a substrate for an animal that lives on top of the algae. 

==Abiotic==

==In animal biotechnology==
{{underlinked|section|date=September 2013}}
=== Requirements for animal cell and tissue culture ===
Requirements for animal cell and tissue culture are the same as described for plant cell, tissue and organ culture (In Vitro Culture Techniques: The Biotechnological Principles). Desirable requirements are (i) air conditioning of a room, (ii) hot room with temperature recorder, (iii) microscope room for carrying out microscopic work where different types of [[Microscope|microscopes]] should be installed, (iv) dark room, (v) service room, (vi) sterilization room for sterilization of glassware and culture media, and (vii) preparation room for media preparation, etc. In addition the storage areas should be such where following should be kept properly : (i) liquids-ambient (4-20°C), (ii) glassware-shelving, (iii) plastics-shelving, (iv) small items-drawers, (v) specialized equipments-cupboard, slow turnover, (vi) chemicals-sidled containers.
=== For cell growth ===
There are many types of vertebrate [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that require support for their growth in vitro otherwise they will not grow properly. Such cells are called anchorage-dependent cells. Therefore, a large number of substrates which may be adhesive (e.g. plastic, glass, palladium, metallic surfaces, etc.) or non-adhesive (e.g. agar, agarose, etc.) types may be used as discussed below:
*[[Plastic]] as a substrate. Disposable plastics are cheaper substrate as they are commonly made up of polystyrene. After use they should be disposed of properly. Before use they are treated with [[Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]] or [[electric arc]] simply to develop charges on the surface of substrate. After cell growth its rate of proliferation should be measured. In addition, the other plastic materials used as substrate are [[teflon]] or [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), [[Thermalox|thermamox]] (TPX), [[Polyvinyl chloride|polyvinylchloride]] (PVC), [[polycarbonate]], etc. [[Monolayer]] of cell must be grown. Moreover, plastic beads of polystyrene, sephadex and polyacrylamide are also available for cell growth in suspension culture.
*[[Glass]] as a substrate. Glass is an important substrate used in laboratory in several forms such as test tubes, slides, coverslips, pipettes, flasks, rods, bottles, Petri dishes, several apparatus, etc. These are sterilized by using chemicals, radiations, dry heat (in oven) and moist heat (in autoclave).
*[[Palladium]] as a substrate. For the first time palladium deposited on [[agarose]] was used as a substrate for growth of [[fibroblast]] and [[glia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biocyclopedia.com/index/biotechnology/animal_biotechnology/animal_cell_tissue_and_organ_culture/biotech_requirements_animal_cell_tissue_organ.php|title=Requirements for Animal Cell and Tissue Culture - Animal Biotech|last=Biocyclopedia.com|website=biocyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tocodede''' (also known as '''Tukude''', '''Tokodede''', '''Tokodé''', and '''Tocod''') is one of the languages of [[East Timor]], spoken by about 39,000 people in the district of [[Liquiçá (district)|Liquiçá]], especially the subdistricts of [[Maubara]] and [[Liquiçá]] along the northern bench of [[Lois River]] system. The number has declined in recent years. It is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] in the [[Timor–Babar languages|Timor group]].

The first significant text published in Tocodede was '''Peneer meselo laa Literatura kidia-laa Timór''', translated by [[João Paulo T. Esperança]], [[Fernanda Correia]], and [[Cesaltina Campos]] from an article by João Paulo T. Esperança entitled "A Brief Look at the Literature of Timor". The Tocodede version was published in the literary supplement [[Várzea de Letras]], published by the Department of Portuguese Language of the [[National University of Timor-Leste]], in [[Dili]], in December 2005.

'''Tshangla''' (pronounced {{IPA|tsʰaŋla}}), also called '''Sharchop''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] of the [[Bodish languages|Bodish branch]] closely related to the [[Tibetic languages]] and much of its vocabulary derives from [[Classical Tibetan]]. Tshangla is primarily spoken in Eastern [[Bhutan]] and acts as a lingua franca in the country particularly among [[Sharchop people|Sharchop]]/Tshangla communities; it is also spoken in Arunachal Pradesh, India, and Tibet. Tshangla is the principal pre-Tibetan (pre-[[Dzongkha]]) language of Bhutan.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem1/&gt;

==Classification==
Tshangla is frequently assumed to be close to the [[Tibetic languages]]. Bradley (2002) includes in among the [[East Bodish languages]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bradley (2002), "The Subgrouping of Tibeto-Burman", in Beckwith &amp; Blezer, ''Medieval Tibeto-Burman languages,'' BRILL, pp. 73–112&lt;/ref&gt; Van Driem (2011), however, leaves it unclassified within Sino-Tibetan, pending further research.&lt;ref&gt;George van Driem (2011), "Tibeto-Burman subgroups and historical grammar", ''Himalayan Linguistics Journal'' 10(1):31–39&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--It shares many similarities with the [[Tibetic languages]] and is closely associated with [[Classical Tibetan]], with many conservative features in pronunciation that have changes in modern Tibetic languages. --&gt;

Bodt (2012:188-189)&lt;ref&gt;Bodt, Timotheus A. 2012. ''The New Lamp Clarifying the History, Peoples, Languages and Traditions of Eastern Bhutan and Eastern Mon''. Wageningen: Monpasang Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; classifies Tshangla as a [[Bodish language]], but notes that Tshangla (like [[East Bodish]]) is related to, but not directly descended, from [[Classical Tibetan]].

==Varieties==
Tshangla is a [[dialect cluster]] consisting of a few mutually unintelligible language varieties, including (Gerber 2018):&lt;ref name="Gerber2018"&gt;Gerber, Pascal. 2018. ''[https://www.academia.edu/36564118/Areal_features_in_Gongduk_Bjokapakha_and_Black_Mountain_M%C3%B6npa_phonology_Draft_ Areal features in Gongduk, Bjokapakha and Black Mountain Mönpa phonology]''. Unpublished draft.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trashigang
*Dungsam
*Dirang
*Bjokapakha (Bjoka)

The Tshangla variety of [[Trashigang]] town is used as a [[lingua franca]]. Dungsam is conservative, while Dirang and Bjokapakha are divergent.&lt;ref name="Gerber2018"/&gt;

==Number of Speakers and Status of the Language ==
Tshangla is primarily spoken in East and Southeast Bhutan, especially in the Trashigang district. The language is referred to as “Sharchopka” meaning 'the people in the east'&lt;ref name="Andvik" /&gt; in Dzongkha, the national language Bhutan. 

It is also spoken in the Arunachal Pradesh of India, where it is sometimes referred to as “Central Monpa”, and in Southeast Tibet, where it is referred to as “Cangluo” (Andvik 2010: 4-6)

There are approximately 170,000 speakers of Tshangla, living in Bhutan (157,000), India (11,000) and Tibet (7000). It is not reported to be endangered in any way, as there are still many children learning it as their first language. Indeed, it is often described as being the majority language of eastern Bhutan, where it functions as something of a lingua franca. Andvic (2010: 4) reports that “most Bhutanese have at least some rudimentary knowledge of Tshangla”. In addition, it’s common for Western Bhutanese to learn some Tshangla through classmates in the school system (Yang Gyeltshen, p.c.). 
 
Despite its predominance in eastern Bhutan, Tshangla is described by Andvik (2010: 4) as “an unwritten language”, meaning that it “is not in any country standardized by governing fiat, taught in the schools, recognized as an official language, or even given status as a minority language.” However, Ethnologue reports that 47% of L1 speakers are literate, mainly using Uchen Tibtean script. Though there are no official publications in Tshangla, the language is used in radio and television broadcasts. (It remains undetermined what kind of orthography is used for writing copy for those broadcasts; Yang Gyeltshen, p.c.)

The official national language of Bhutan is Dzongkha, which is derived from the Tibetan spoken by Lama Shabdrung and his followers, who left Tibet to found the nation of Bhutan in the 1600s. Tshangla, however, is one of Bhutan’s many indigenous languages, and is the most widely spoken of the indigenous Sino-Tibetan languages.

Tshangla is found scattered throughout eastern Himalayan ridges as well as the southern regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Grammar of Tshangla|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sc9XZ2jJGgC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9004178279|first = Erik E.|last = Andvik}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken by around 175,000 people. Most of the Tshangla populace live in Eastern Bhutan ([[Trashigang District|Trashigang]], eastern [[Pemagatshel District|Pemagatshel]], [[Samdrup Jongkhar District|Samdrup Jongkhar]], eastern [[Mongar District|Mongar]], and [[Trashiyangtse District|Trashiyangtse]] districts), where they formed an overwhelming major ethic group of the country probably accounting for 25-30% of the total population. Scatterred Tshangla speakers can also be found in neighbouring countries with different names.

In the Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], they are called Kalaktang Monpa (and are lexically distinct). whereas about 7,000 Tshangla speaking people also live in [[Pemako]] ([[Bomê County|Bomê]] and [[Mêdog County]]) in southeastern [[Tibet]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem1&gt;{{cite book|first=George |last=van Driem |year=2001 |title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |page=915 ''et seq.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIL2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tsj |title=Tshangla |work=[[Ethnologue]] Online |publisher=[[SIL International]] |location=[[Dallas]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 8,000 Kalaktang Monpa speakers in Khalaktang, Balimu, and Tomko villages, Kalaktang administrative center, [[West Kameng district]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India (''[[Ethnologue]]''). Good number of about 1000 to 15000 Tsangla speakers are also live in Tuting Town, Kopu, Bona, Gelling, Bishing along the Tsangpo (Siang) river and Nyering, Payingdem, Nyukong, Yortong, Mankota, Tashigong, Singa along the Yangsang Chu river, [[Upper Siang District]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India.

The distantly related [['Olekha]] language of the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]], also called "Monpa" and predating Dzongkha, belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] [[East Bodish languages]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem1/&gt; [['Olekha]] is most closely related to the [[Bumthang language]]; both are [[East Bodish languages]]. Tshangla and related languages form a sister branch not to the East Bodish group, but to its parent [[Bodish languages|Bodish branch]]. Thus the ambiguous term "Monpa" risks separating languages that should be grouped together, while grouping languages together that are quite separate.&lt;ref name=Andvik&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sc9XZ2jJGgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Grammar of Tshangla |volume=10 |publisher=Brill |series=Tibetan Studies Library |first=Erik E. |last=Andvik |year=2010 |isbn=90-04-17827-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–7}}&lt;ref name=Blench&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blench |first1=Roger |last2=Post |first2=Mark |title=(De)Classifying Arunachal Languages: Reconsidering the Evidence |chapter=10.

==Writing system==
Tshangla is traditionally an unwritten language and has no official status in any country. When written by native speakers, it is most often rendered in [[Tibetan script]], however grammarians have devised a [[romanization|romanized]] [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] system.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

==Phonology==
Below appears a table of Tshangla consonants according to Andvik (2010). Non-native phonemes, in parentheses, are contrasted only marginally with native sounds: /ɬ/ is often nativized to /l/; /dz/ becomes /z/; and /ʑ/ becomes /y/.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|8–12}}

Consonant clusters in the onset position are limited to consonant plus /r/, with the exception of the syllable /pɕi/, used on only two contexts.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The cluster /pɕi/ is used only in the words for "four" (/pɕi/) and "to [[flatulence|fart]]" (/pɕi pʰule/).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Intervocalic positioning of aspirated onsets /pʰ/ /tʰ/, and /kʰ/ results in [[lenition]] to /ɸ/, /θ/, and /x/ or /h/, respectively, with some exceptions.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|10}} Syllable-final consonants are limited to /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/, /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|16}}

Tshangla vowels appear in the chart below, following Andvik (2010). Vowels in parentheses appear in non-native words inherited from [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Dzongkha]], and the latter's archaic liturgical form, [[Classical Tibetan|Chöke]]. Non-native front rounded vowels may be nativized as front unrounded vowels.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|12–14}}

Vowel clusters native to the Tshangla lexicon are /ai/ and /au/, and in derived contexts /oi/ and /ui/ also appear (e.g. a verbal ending: /bu-i/, take&lt;small&gt;-IMP&lt;/small&gt;). In these native contexts, final /i/ and /u/ are pronounced as if they were /y/ or /w/, respectively. In loanwords /iu/ and /eu/ rarely appear, and tend to be realized as /iwu/ and /ewu/, respectively.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

==Tone==
Most dialects of Tshangla do not make lexical distinctions according to [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], however the language overall may be in the process of [[tonogenesis]]. Some dialects such as those of Central Monpa and Padma-bkod have replaced voiceless-voiced contrasts with a high-low tone distinction, respectively.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;{{rp|20}}

==Grammar==
Tshangla grammar features [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[verb]]s. Word order is generally [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV). Its morphology is generally [[agglutination|agglutinative]], though most unmarked Tshangla lexicon comprises one or two syllables. Nouns are arranged into either head-first or head-last noun phrases. Demonstratives, relative clauses, and genitive phrases precede nouns, whereas markers for definiteness, number, topic, focus, case, and other particles follow the noun.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

While adjectives comprise a lexically distinct category in their own right, some adjectival words are grammatically nouns. This dichotomy is complicated by equally common relative clauses that function as adjectives. For example, ''&lt;u&gt;dukpu&lt;/u&gt; waktsa'' means "(the) &lt;u&gt;badly poor&lt;/u&gt; child," and ''waktsa &lt;u&gt;dukpu&lt;/u&gt;'' means "(the) child &lt;u&gt;who is badly poor&lt;/u&gt;." Some combinations are strictly noun-adjective, however.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

Tshangla is a [[pro-drop language]], with two otherwise notable features. First, multi-[[Valency (linguistics)|valent]] verbs drop objects even though they are not recoverable from context, through which verbs reduce their valency (i.e. become [[intransitive]]). In other situations where the argument is topically important, and where confusion is impossible, a "zero" (impersonal) pronoun is used. Otherwise, personal pronouns are extensively used. They appear below:&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

{|  class="wikitable"
|+Tshangla [[personal pronoun]]s

! Dual
! Plural
|- align="center"

! 2p
| ''nan''
| ''na-ching''
| ''nai''
|- align="center"
! 3p
| ''ro''
| ''da-ching''
| ''rokte''
|}

When pronouns are followed by numbers, plurals is not used (e.g. ''ro nyiktsing'', "the two of them").

Noun cases include [[absolutive]] ([[nominative]]), [[agentive case|agentive]] ([[ergative case|ergative]])/[[instrumental]] (-''gi''), [[genitive]] (-''ga-''), [[ablative]] (-''gai''), and [[dative]]/[[locative]] (-''ga''). These suffices undergo devoicing in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

Verbs are generally [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive]]. The transitivity of some verbs corresponds to lexical distinctions: ''yekpa'' means "to speak" in a transitive sense, but "to be called" in an intransitive sense. Similarly, ''lekpe'' means "to lick" in a transitive sense, but "to be licked" in an intransitive sense, with the agent suppressed.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;
 
The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which has many forms, is used extensively in marking Tshangla verbs. Verbs are marked differently depending on whether they are [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (finite), or [[relative clause|relative]] or [[participle|participial]] (non-finite). Only finite verbs take personal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s, while various non-finite forms take different suffices. Adverbs appear as suffices on non-final and participial verb forms.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

Negation of adjectives, nouns, and verbs take different forms. Sentence-final particles include interrogatory and non-declarative [[grammatical mood|mood]] markers.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

==Dialects==
Tshangla dialects represent a continuum centered around the town of [[Trashigang]], whose dialect is considered by Tshangla speakers to be the prestige dialect. Differences between dialects do not prevent mutual intelligibility, and many loanwords have come through [[Classical Tibetan]] (Chöke).&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

In [[Arunachal Pradesh]], Tshangla is spoken in the Dirang area of [[West Kameng]]. The dialect there, called "Central Monpa", is spoken by some 6,000 people. More speakers of Tshangla dialects live in [[Kathmandu]], [[Darjeeling]] and [[Assam]].&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], Tshangla is virtually identical to Cāngluò ({{zh|仓洛}}) of southeastern Tibet, also called "Mòtuō (Bomê) Monpa". The [[Bomê County]] region of Tibet, formerly known as Padma-bkod or [[Pemako]], contains remnants of these Tshangla communities separated by hundreds of miles.&lt;ref name=Andvik/&gt;

The '''Tuscan gorgia''' ({{lang-it|gorgia toscana}} {{IPA-it|ˈɡɔrdʒa toˈskaːna|}}, {{IPA-itdia|ˈɡɔɾdʒa θoˈskaːna|tusc}}; "Tuscan throat") is a [[phonetics|phonetic]] phenomenon governed by a complex of [[allophony|allophonic]] rules characteristic of the [[Tuscan dialect]]s, in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], especially the central ones, with [[Florence]] traditionally viewed as the center.

==Description==

The ''gorgia'' affects the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] stops {{IPAslink|k}} {{IPAslink|t̪|t}} and {{IPAslink|p}}, which are pronounced as [[fricative consonant]]s in post-vocalic position (when not blocked by the competing phenomenon of [[syntactic gemination]]):

* {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPAblink|h}}
* {{IPA|/t/}} → {{IPAblink|θ}}
* {{IPA|/p/}} → {{IPAblink|ɸ}}

An example: the word {{lang|it|identificare}} ("to identify") {{IPA|/identifiˈkare/}} is pronounced by a Tuscan speaker as {{IPA-itdia|ˌidentifiˈhaːɾe|}}, not as {{IPA-it|identifiˈkaːre|}}, as standard [[Italian phonology]] would require. The rule is sensitive to pause, but not word boundary, so that {{IPA|/la ˈkasa/}} ("the house") is realized as {{IPA-itdia|la ˈhaːsa|}}.

(In some areas the voiced counterparts {{IPAslink|ɡ}} {{IPAslink|d̪|d}} {{IPAslink|b}} can also appear as fricative approximants {{IPAblink|ɣ}} {{IPAblink|ð}} {{IPAblink|β}}, especially in fast or unguarded speech. This, however, appears more widespread elsewhere in the Mediterranean, being standard in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].)

In a stressed syllable, {{IPA|/k t p/}}, preceded by another stop, can occasionally be realized as true [[aspirated consonant|aspirate]]s {{IPA|[kʰ tʰ pʰ]}}, especially if the stop is the same, for example {{IPA-itdia|apˈpʰuːnto|}} ({{lang|it|appunto}}, "note"), {{IPA-itdia|a kˈkʰaːsa|}} (''a casa'', "at home", with [[syntactic gemination|phonosyntactic strengthening]] due to the preposition).

==Geographical distribution==

Establishing a hierarchy of weakening within the class {{IPA|/k t p/}} is not an easy task. Recent studies have called into question the traditional view that mutation of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} is less widespread geographically than {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|[h]}}, and in areas where the rule is not automatic, {{IPA|/p/}} is often more likely to weaken than {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}.

On the other hand, deletion in rapid speech always affects {{IPA|/k/}} first and foremost wherever it occurs, but {{IPA|/t/}} reduces less often to {{IPA|[h]}}, especially in the most common forms such as participles ({{IPA-itdia|anˈdaːho|}} {{lang|it|andato}} "gone"). Fricativisation of {{IPA|/k/}} is by far the most perceptually salient of the three, however, and so it has become a stereotype of Tuscan dialects.

The phenomenon is more evident and finds its irradiation point in the city of [[Florence]]. From there, the gorgia spreads its influence along the entire [[Arno]] valley, losing strength nearer the coast. On the coast, {{IPA|/p/}} and usually {{IPA|/t/}} are not affected. The weakening of {{IPA|/k/}} is a linguistic continuum in the entire Arno valley, in the cities of [[Prato]], [[Pistoia]], [[Montecatini Terme]], [[Lucca]], [[Pisa]], [[Livorno]].

In the northwest, it is present to some extent in [[Versilia]]. In the east, it extends over the Pratomagno to include Bibbiena and its outlying areas, where {{IPA|/k t p/}} are sometimes affected, both fully occlusive {{IPA|[k], [t], [p]}} and [[lenition|lenited]] (lax, unvoiced) allophones being the major alternates.

The [[Apennine Mountains]] are the northern border of the phenomenon, and while a definite southern border has not been established, it is present in [[Siena]] and further south to at least [[San Quirico d'Orcia]]. In the far south of Tuscany, it gives way to the lenition (laxing) typical of northern and coastal [[Lazio]].

==History==

The ''Tuscan gorgia'' arose perhaps as late as the [[Middle Ages]], as a natural phonetic phenomenon, much like the consonant voicing that affected [[Northern Italian dialects]] and the rest of Western Romance (now phonemicised as in {{IPA|/aˈmika/}} "friend" (f.) &gt; {{IPA|/aˈmiɡa/}}), but it remained allophonic in Tuscany, as laxing or voicing generally does elsewhere in Central Italy and in [[Corsica]].

Although it was once hypothesised that the ''gorgia'' phenomena are the continuation of similar features in the language that predated Romanization of the area, [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], that view is no longer held by most specialists. Instead, it is increasingly accepted as being a local form of the same consonant weakening that affects other speech in Central Italy, extending far beyond, to Western Romance. Support for that hypothesis can be found in several facts:
* The phonetic details of Etruscan are unknown and so it is impossible to identify their continuance.
* There is no mention of the phenomenon until the 16th century, and no trace in older writing (since the ''gorgia'' is a phonetic phenomenon, not [[phonemic]], its appearance in writing might not be expected, but it appears in writing in the 19th century).
* The ''gorgia'' is less evident in [[Lucca]] and does not exist in the far south of Tuscany or in Lazio, where Etruscan settlement was quite concentrated.
* Sociolinguistic studies in Eastern Tuscany (such as Cravens and Giannelli 1995, Pacini 1998) show that the ''gorgia'' competes with traditional laxing in the same postvocalic position, suggesting that the two results are phonetically different resolutions of the same phonological rule.
* The ''gorgia'' shows all the characteristics of a naturally-developed allophonic rule in its alternations with full [[plosive]]s ({{IPA-itdia|ˈkaːsa|}} "house", {{IPA-itdia|la ˈhaːsa|}} "the house", {{IPA-itdia|ˌtre kˈkaːse|}} "three houses").
* Fricativisation of {{IPA|/k t p/}} is common in the languages of the world. Similar processes have happened such as in [[Proto-Germanic]] (which is why in [[Germanic languages]] there are words such as '''''f'''ather'', '''''h'''orn'', ''too'''th''''' as opposed to Italian '''''p'''adre'', '''''c'''orno'', ''den'''t'''e'', from [[Grimm's Law]]) and during the development of the [[Hungarian language]]. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the [[Tamil language]].

'''Weert dialect''' or '''Weert Limburgish''' (natively ''Wieërts'', [[Dutch language|Standard Dutch]]: ''Weerts'' {{IPA-nl|ʋeːrts|}}) is the [[dialect|city dialect]] and variant of [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] spoken in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Weert]] alongside [[Dutch language|the Dutch language]] (with which it is not mutually intelligible). All of its speakers are bilingual with standard Dutch.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=107}}

It has two varieties: ''Stadsweerts'', spoken in the city centre, and the more rural dialect.{{fix|text=what is its name?|date=September 2015}}{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=107}}

* {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is a voiced fricative trill, either uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}} or pre-uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ̝|ʀ̝˖}}. The fricative component is particularly audible in the syllable [[Syllable#Coda|coda]], where a partial devoicing to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʀ̝̊}} ~ {{IPA link|ʀ̝̊|ʀ̝̊˖}}]}} also occurs.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=108}}

* Most of the non-central vowels are more or less centralized, but only {{IPA|/ə/}} is phonetically central. The most strongly centralized vowel is {{IPA|/ʏ/}}, whereas the least strongly centralized vowels are {{IPA|/i, iː/}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
* Among back vowels, {{IPA|/u, uː, ʊ, oː, ɔ, ɔː/}} are rounded, whereas {{IPA|/ɑ, ɑː/}} are unrounded.
** {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is used only by older speakers.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=109}}
* Phonetically, the tense close-mid monophthongs {{IPA|/eː, øː, oː/}} are centering diphthongs {{IPA|[ëə, øə, öə]}},{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|pp=109–110}} and that is the reason for which they are illustrated on diphthong charts below.
** The first elements of {{IPA|/øː, oː/}} are centralized, but are not central enough to be labelled as central.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
** The second elements of {{IPA|/eː/}} and especially {{IPA|/oː/}} are less central ({{IPA|[e̽, ɤ̽]}}, respectively) than it is the case with other centering diphthongs, of which the second element is more like {{IPA|[ə]}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
** Before nasal consonants, {{IPA|/eː, øː/}} are monophthongized to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪː}}, {{IPA link|ʏː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=109}}
* The {{IPA|/ʏ/-/œ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/-/æ/}} contrasts seem to have begun to collapse.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=109}}{{fix|text=what about the {{IPA|/ɛː/-/æː/}} contrast?|date=October 2015}}
* {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is similar to the schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}; besides rounding, practically the only difference between those is that {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is somewhat more front and slightly higher than {{IPA|/ə/}}. Phonetically, it can be described as close-mid central rounded {{IPAblink|ɵ}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
* {{IPA|/ə/}} is mid {{IPAblink|ə}}. It occurs only in unstressed syllables.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|pp=108, 110}}
* The open-mid front vowels {{IPA|/ɛ, ɛː, œ, œː/}} are somewhat higher than open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ|ɛ̝}}, {{IPA link|ɛ|ɛ̝ː}}, {{IPA link|œ|œ̝}}, {{IPA link|œ|œ̝ː}}]}}, but the back open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɔ, ɔː/}} are actually open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɔ}}, {{IPA link|ɔː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
** {{IPA|/œ/}} is realized as much more open {{IPAblink|ɶ}} when it occurs before {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
* {{IPA|/æ, æː/}} are best described as somewhat lowered open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ|ɛ̞}}, {{IPA link|æ|ɛ̞ː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=110}}
