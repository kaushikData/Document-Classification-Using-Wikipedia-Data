=== Almaty School of Management ===
In the autumn of 1988 the Alma-Ata City Executive Committee initiated creation of "Union" Republican Cooperative Association, Leonid Solomin was invited to be head of the association. Together with Bazhangali Kozhshibayev, he decided to create the first business school in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=10let&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1998 |title= 10 лет на рынке бизнес-образования — это много или мало?| journal= АльПари | issue=4 |pages = 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 1988 the Alma-Ata School of Managers (ASM) has been organized in Alma-Ata on the basis of "Union" Republican Cooperative Association, its first listeners were engaged in assembly hall of the Soviet district committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] exactly during a month.&lt;ref name=10let/&gt; During the first period of existence of the school education was conducted in the form of short-term courses which were listened by  the top and medium-level managers, people with higher education.&lt;ref name=neizbezhno&gt;{{cite journal | author= Эльмира Пашина | title = Асылбек Кожахметов: "Учиться и учить бизнесу трудно.

Rotmistrovsky | title = Opening of the World of Entrepreneurship | journal = Kazakhstan| page=5| issue =6| date= February 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of six western organizations participating in the tender (the [[European Foundation for Management Development]], [[École de management de Lyon]], the [[Maastricht School of Management]] and others) named ASM as the most preferable partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Не создавайте выгодную школу бизнеса, создавайте выдающуюся! | journal = Караван| page =2| issue = |date=October 7, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the educational institution has been renamed into Almaty School of Management (ASM).&lt;ref name=stanovlenie/&gt;

In October 1995, the competence, reliability and actual success of the Almaty School of Management was highly appreciated by the [[People to People International]], which awarded the “Torch of Birmingham” for successful economic survival and development under conditions of the emerging market relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Алматинская школа менеджмента.

In September 2017 Almaty Management University (AlmaU) opened the Knowledge Building - a new intellectual innovation building.

The new building of AlmaU, built using the latest technology, is probably the most ambitious project in the field of education. Modern infrastructure, including coworking centers, food courts, places for relaxation, conference rooms, modern laboratories, classrooms; beautiful design, versatility, innovation and convenience in everything are the main criteria which  the developers of this building of the southern capital were guided by.

On the 1st floor there is Atrium Grand Hall for 600 seats with a huge LED display and professional acoustic and lighting equipment, and a reading room with a book-crossing sector and a cafe with flavorous coffee.

On the 2nd floor there are student classrooms, a relaxation room and 4 laboratories:

“'''Petroleum Transportation Lab'''” Laboratory of  ''School of Economics and Logistics'' (General sponsor - Petroleum LLP). Creation of “PetroleumTransportLab” laboratory is one of the key steps towards implementation of a number of projects: creation of a transport hub, logistics outsourcing, development of transport services, operator and forwarding business, etc.

'''Neuromarketing''' Laboratory of ''Graduate School of Management'' (Magnum Cash and Carry helped to purchase equipment for this laboratory) is equipped with a video camera, microphone and Tobii Glasses 2 mobile eye tracking system, which provides objective data on consumers' perceptions of various trademarks and brands and reveals hidden factors affecting decision making process. Using this technology, it is possible to study the visual perception of consumers when making a purchase decision. The laboratory allows to conduct applied research using neurobiological analysis tools and expert opinions for business. This project has no analogues in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

'''Simulation room''' of ''Center for Mediation'' ''and Center of Excellence'' is equipped with four video cameras, microphones and voice recorders. It is used to resolve disputable situations and conflicts that may arise in the educational process, for example, between a student and a teacher (student and management, employee and manager, etc.). Situations are played in the simulation room, audio and video recording is conducted, which makes it possible to analyze the process. The room is also used for conducting research with participation of focus groups, and conducting in-depth interviews with possibility to observe the process from the adjacent sector: whether the methodology is not violated, whether there is no pressure on respondents.

The '''oratory workshop''' of ''Graduate School of State and Public Administration and Law'' is a mirror room equipped with a video camera for recording and analyzing the speaker’s speeches. A photograph of a listening audience on the wall creates an atmosphere of real-life performance. In the course of trainings, the psychological barrier is overcome, communication and oratorical skills are developed. The workshop is aimed at shaping the culture of public speaking: the conceptual apparatus, wide vocabulary range, techniques of verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as presentation and self-presentation skills.

On the 3rd floor of Knowledge Building there are classrooms of Graduate School of Business equipped with a smart system, in particular, MBA programs and doctoral programs, as well as the classroom of MBA Association, whose accreditation is got by Almaty Management University (AlmaU), the only university in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, in the list of the top 200 best universities in the world.

On the 4th floor there are 3 laboratories:

'''DesignLab Laboratory''' of ''Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation Development'', is equipped with a sound system and a projector, glass boards for design processes, as well as tools and accessories for creating and modeling prototypes. In the process of working in the laboratory, students and trainees perform dozens of practical tasks, simulating prototypes of business processes on their own - this is how fast experience is formed, practicing thinking and various methods of working with the project are applied in order to find their own ways of solving creative problems. The ''value of design thinking for business'' is that this technique allows to work with “implicit knowledge” of the consumer, which he cannot recognize and tell on his own. That, ultimately, allows you to get products and services that are focused on people.

'''Cyber-Polygon "EngEkon"''' Laboratory of the ''School of Economics and Logistics'' (general sponsor is Kazakhstan GIS Center JSC, Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan) is considered to be the brightest laboratory. Its walls are painted in three different colors: red, green and blue, the laboratory is equipped with 4 displays, 7 computers, a projector, an audio system. As planned by the authors of the project, two opposing forces are involved in the simulation: the attacker, occupying the red corner, is trying to make a hole in the system; defenders, sitting opposite the screen in the green zone, use preventive methods to isolate the attack. Each side has 3 computers. The blue zone is the zone of observers, where the overall picture of the unfolding battle between “hackers” and “Information Security” (IS) is visible on the display. The purpose of the cyber-test site is to teach students to counteract cyber-terrorism, preventing hacking of databases and data leakage.

'''MediaLab Center for Multimedia Journalism''' of  ''Graduate'' ''School of State and Public Administration'' ''and Law'' is equipped with a projector, computers and a voice recorder. It is an open working media space operating on the principle of dual education. A feature of the project is the working format of the center: students under the supervision of mentors initiate their own topics independently and in project groups and experiment with the production of various content, as well as learn how to work in social networks and how to create and maintain their own brand. It is important: MediaLab helps not only to students-journalists and PR specialists, but works “at the junction”, teaching economists, financiers, and logisticians to create media content. 

On the 5th floor there are administration offices, equipped with smart systems, student classrooms, meeting room of AlmaU Board of Trustees.

On the 6th floor, visitors will see “SMART-conference hall”, where it is possible to control light, sound, air conditioning, a projector, roll-up curtains from the iPad; Also, guests can view the magnificent panorama of the mountains from the windows of Panorama Hall.

All the laboratories of the new building, whose construction was financed by '''Capital Bank Kazakhstan''', are equipped with innovative technologies and work together with the partners of the university - government agencies, business structures, media companies. It is this format that allows the university to implement the principle of Win-Win-Win, according to which any mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties (Win-Win) should be of benefit to a third party - society (Win). It is also an excellent example of successful implementation of the “triple spiral” theory, the essence of which is in dynamic development of relations between the state, universities and business for effective development of new industries and solving existing problems.

It is worth noting that the new building will be managed in a new way. It is facilitated by the knowledge management system launched at AlmaU. Created to improve university management efficiency, the Knowledge Management System processes large streams of information (BIG DATA), integrates various information systems, and automates business processes.

[[File:PetőAndrás Stollár4.jpg|alt=Plaque at a former residence|thumb|Plaque at a former residence]]
'''András Pető''' (11 September 1893 in [[Szombathely]], [[Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 11 September 1967 in [[Budapest]], Hungary) was a practitioner of [[Physiotherapy|physical rehabilitation]] whose work provided the foundation for [[conductive education]].

==Early life and career==
András Pető was born in 1893 in Szombathely, Hungary, as an elder of three sons. His father fell ill in 1907 with [[Parkinson's disease]], which compelled András to support the family financially. He worked as a tutor and a newspaper editor.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

After graduation, he studied from 1911 in Vienna. Originally he to be a journalist, but in Vienna decided to study medicine. During his studies he met [[Jacob L. Moreno]], doctor, playwright and psychotherapist, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship - and also came into contact with the various psychological schools of Vienna centered around [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Alfred Adler|Adler]] and [[Viktor Frankl|Frankl]].

Between 1930 and 1938, Pető published many literary, philosophical and medical works. He was the editor-in-chief of the periodical ''Biologische Heilkunst'' (''Biological Healing'') and was better known as a journalist than a physician.

The [[Anchschluss|forced incorporation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] into [[Nazi Germany]] March 1938 made life difficult and dangerous for Jews, so he moved to Paris where he stayed briefly and worked as a journalist, then he returned to Hungary. Very little is known about Peto's life during the time of World War II but it is assumed that he was in hiding in Budapest during the German occupation. His mother was killed in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conductive-world.info/2013/12/a-story-from-history.html "A story from history"], 2013, Andrew Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institute==
His institute, the [[National Institute of Motor Therapy]], officially opened in 1952. Although nominally under the Ministry of Health, instead of following the medical model of providing therapies, Pető created a framework for an educational model, in which children with disabilities could have an education that met their particular physical and intellectual needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orvostortenet.hu/tankonyvek/tk-05/pdf/2.15/2007_200_201_forrai_judit_history_of.pdf "History of a Special Healing Method..."], Judit Forrai, MD, PhD, Lecturer Semmelweis University&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in the early 1960s his institute moved into the Ministry of Education.

==Conductive education==
Conductive education (CE) entered the wider public consciousness in the mid-1980s, as a result of two television documentaries —"Standing Up For Joe" (1986), and "To Hungary with Love" (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/24/guardianobituaries.schools "Maria Hari"], 2001 obituary at The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, CE has gained more and more acceptance in the education of children with motor disorders. While developed first for children who had [[cerebral palsy]] or brain injury, it has also been used with adults with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and after-[[stroke]] conditions.

This '''National Conference''' is the biennial [[Academic conference|conference]] of the [[Australian Council for Computers in Education]] (ACCE). The conference brings together educators from across [[Australia]] and around the world who are interested in the use of information and communication technologies to support and enhance teaching and learning in school classrooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan|first=Ryan|title=THE DIGITAL CLASSROOM|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/the-digital-classroom/3105332|work=Future Tense|publisher=ABC Radio National|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to a focus on its use in higher education, or school administration.

Affiliate member organisations of ACCE take turns to host the national conference, in place of their own state conference.  The affiliates are:
* [[TASITE]] - Tasmanian society for IT in Education
* [https://dltv.vic.edu.au DLTV] - ICT in Education Victoria

* [[QSITE]] - Queensland Society for IT in Education
* [[ITEANT]] - IT Educators Association of the Northern Territory
* [[EdTEchSA]] - South Australia
* [[ECAWA]] - Educational Computing Association of Western Australia

==History==
The first conference (labelled as ACEC) took place in Melbourne in 1983. Since that time it has continued to provide teachers around the country a forum to exchange information on classroom activity, make connections with each other, and learn from experts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDougall|first=Anne|author2=Barry McCrae|title=From CEGV 1979 to ACEC2000: Australian computers in education conferences come of age.|journal=Australian Educational Computing|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–6|url=http://acce.edu.au/journal/15/1/cegv-1979-acec-2000-australian-computers-education-conferences-come-age|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference proceedings provide an insight into the nature of educational computing practice since the early 1980s and the papers are widely cited in the research field literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google Scholar|title=Australian Computers in Education|url=https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=australian+computers+in+education+conference|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008 the conference was held in Canberra and the then Education Minister [[Julia Gillard]] delivered the opening Keynote Address, highlighting the importance of digital technologies in her education reform agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillard|first=Julia|title=Address To The Australian Computers In Education Conference|url=http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/gillard/address-australian-computers-education-conference|publisher=Dept of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23004">The '''Bachelor of Engineering''',  abbreviated as '''B.E.''', '''B.Eng.''' or '''B.A.I.''' (in Latin form) is a first professional [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] awarded to a student after four to five years of studying [[engineering]] at an accredited university. In the UK, a B.Eng. degree will be accredited by one of the Engineering Council's professional engineering institutions as suitable for registration as a [[incorporated engineer]] or [[chartered engineer]] with further study to masters level. In Canada the degree from a Canadian university can be accredited by the CEAB. Alternatively, it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution, such as the US-based [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The B.Eng. contributes to the route to [[chartered engineer (UK)]], registered engineer or licensed [[professional engineer]] and has been approved by representatives of the profession.

A B.E. has a greater emphasis on math and science, to allow the engineers to move from one discipline to another. Multi-discipline is required in certain fields, like Marine Engineering. The marine engineer is required to know mechanical, chemical and electric engineering. If an engineer is strictly staying in a single discipline she would probably be better served with a B.Sc. A typical B.Sc. is 128 credits. SUNY Maritime B.E. is 172 credits.

Most universities in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Europe]] award the Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Engineering Science (B.Eng.Sc.), Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.) or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) degree to undergraduate students of engineering study. For example, [[Canada]] is the only country that awards the B.A.Sc. degree for graduating engineers. Other institutions award engineering degrees specific to the area of study, such as B.S.E.E. ([[Bachelor of Science]] in Electrical Engineering) and BSME (Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/programs/ |title=Example Degrees  |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the English-speaking world, is ''Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria'' (B.A.I.), a [[Latin]] name meaning ''Bachelor in the Art of Engineering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/welcome/index.php|title=School of Engineering - Trinity College Dublin|author=|date=|website=www.tcd.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria'' implies an excellence in carrying out the 'art' or 'function' of an engineer. The degree is awarded by the [[University of Dublin]] (its [[Trinity College Dublin]] has had a School of Engineering since 1841) and also by the constituent universities of the [[National University of Ireland]] (N.U.I.){{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, but in everyday speech it is more commonly referred to as ''Bachelor of Engineering'' and the N.U.I. graduates also use the post-nomials translated into English, B.E., even though the actual degree and its parchment is in Latin{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

Some South African Universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (''Baccalaureus Ingenieurswese'' - Afrikaans).

==International variations==

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' (BEng) is a four-year undergraduate degree course and a professional qualification. It is also available as a six-year sandwich course (where students are required to undertake a period of professional placement as part of the degree) or an eight-year part-time course through some universities. The Institution of Engineers, Australia ([[Engineers Australia]]) accredits degree courses and graduates of accredited courses are eligible for membership of the Institution. Bachelor of Engineering graduates may commence work as a graduate professional engineer upon graduation, although some may elect to undertake further study such as a [[Master's]] or [[Doctoral]] degree. Chartered Professional Engineer (CPEng) status or the various State registration requirements are usually obtained in later years. Graduates with formal engineering qualifications in Australia are often referred to as Professional Engineers to distinguish them from other professions where the term "Engineer" is used loosely.

=== Bangladesh ===
In [[Bangladesh]], ''Bachelor of Science in Engineering'' B.Sc. (Engineering) is a four year under-graduate university degree. Eligibility for entry is 12 years of school education under science background. Generally the first year (first two semesters) is common to all branches and has the same subjects of study. Courses divert after first year. The medium of instruction and examination is English. Generally, universities in Bangladesh offer engineering degree in the following branches: [[Computer Science and Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Electrical and Electronics Engineering]], [[Industrial and Production Engineering]], Information and Communication Engineering, [[Material Science and Engineering]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Textile Engineering]], [[Aeronautical Engineering]], [[Electronics and Communication Engineering]], [[Biomedical Engineering]], [[Food engineering]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]]. The [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)]], [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|UGC]] and [[Government of Bangladesh]] are responsible for approving engineering colleges and branches/courses. Only those universities which have been approved by these bodies can award degrees which are legally valid and are accepted as qualifiers for jobs in the government and private sector.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], degrees awarded for undergraduate engineering studies include: the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' (B.Eng. or B.E., depending on the institution); the ''Bachelor of Applied Science'' (B.A.Sc.); and the ''Bachelor of Science in Engineering'' (B.Sc.Eng.).

The [[Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board]] (CEAB), a division of the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers|Engineers Canada]], sets out and maintains the standards of accreditation among Canadian undergraduate engineering programs. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_accreditation.cfm|title=About accreditation - Engineers Canada|author=|date=8 April 2014|website=engineerscanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is intended to maintain standards of education and allow mobility of engineers in different provinces of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/canadian-engineering-accreditation-board|title=Accreditation Board - Engineers Canada|author=|date=8 August 2013|website=engineerscanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CEAB-accredited degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a professional engineer anywhere in the country and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.&lt;ref name="apegm1"&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board
  |url=http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html
  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202014748/http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html
  |archivedate=2014-02-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduation from an accredited program, which normally involves four years of study, is a required first step to becoming a [[Professional Engineer]]. Regulation and accreditation are accomplished through a self-governing body (the name of which varies from province to province), which is given the power by statute to register and discipline engineers, as well as regulate the field of engineering in the individual provinces.

Graduates of non-CEAB-accredited programs must demonstrate that their education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.&lt;ref name="apegm1"/&gt;

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' was introduced as part of implementation of the [[Bologna process]]. However, this degree is in fact mostly offered by German [[Fachhochschule]]-institutions [[Universities of Applied Sciences]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. German technical universities award a [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering rather than the BEng degree.

=== Finland ===
The situation is similar in [[Finland]] as in Germany. Universities of applied sciences ([[ammattikorkeakoulu]]) grant professional bachelor's degrees (''insinööri (amk)''). The degree does not traditionally prepare for further study, but due to the Bologna process, a completely new degree of ''ylempi insinööri (yamk)'' has been introduced for engineers who wish to continue studying after some work experience. Before 2005, academic universities (see [[Education in Finland]]) did not make an administrative distinction between studies on the Bachelor's and Master's level and the Master's level [[diplomi-insinööri]] was the first degree to be received. Due to the [[Bologna process]] an intermediate "Bachelor of Science in Engineering" (''tekniikan kandidaatti'') has been introduced.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, Bachelor of Engineering (BE) or Bachelor of science in Engineering (BS/BSc Engineering) is a four years undergraduate professional university degree. The prerequisite for this program is a two years FSc pre-engineering or a three years Diploma of Associate Engineer (DAE) in specific fields e.g. Chemical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering etc. [[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession in Pakistan. PEC is a full signatory of [[Washington Accord]] and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) is a four-year undergraduate course. The pre-requisite for this course is either Higher Secondary Level(10+2 Science) with Physics Major or Proficiency Certificate Level (PCL) in Engineering or Science. Institute of Engineering under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University offers B.E. degree in several disciplines such as Electronics and Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Geomatics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Agricultural Engineering etc. Likewise other universities in Nepal such as Kathmandu University, Pokhara University and Purbanchal University, Mid Western University offers B.E. degree in most of aforementioned engineering disciplines. The normal duration for the completion of the course is 4 years. However, the maximum time to complete the course is 8 years from the time of registration or 4 years after the normal duration.
Graduates of B.E. degrees can apply for the Engineer title (Er.) or certification as registered engineer to a governing body called Nepal Engineering Council (NEC). After the scrutiny examination of the application/applicants, Nepal Engineering Council provides the Certificate of Registration as a General Engineer which is a must for practicing engineering profession in Nepal. For example: If a student called XYZ graduate with B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from one of the accredited universities, he/she is registered as a General Electronics and Communication Engineer with Er. title written in front of name as Er. XYZ

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]] the ''Bachelor of Engineering'' was also introduced as part of implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], the same as in Germany. The degree is only offered by Dutch [[Hogeschool]]-institutions and is equivalent to the Dutch engineer's degree "ingenieur" (ing.). A Dutch BEng involves a rigorous study of four years and is only awarded in the field of [[aeronautical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[industrial engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. Completion of a Dutch engineer's study in the field [[biochemical engineering]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], [[material engineering]] is however awarded with a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] degree. Dutch technical universities award a [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering (BSc) instead of the BEng degree.

=== India ===
In India, Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree is a professional undergraduate degree awarded after completion of four years of engineering study. [[Institute of national importance]], like [[Indian Institute of Technology]] (IIT) and [[National Institute of Technology]] (NIT) offer [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) degree instead of BE in engineering disciplines. Some Indian universities offer engineering degree under the name of Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and some universities offer engineering degree under the name of [[B.Tech]] but whichever name is used, the degree course follows the standard curriculum laid down by the [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). There is no difference in the program objectives and learning outcomes of BE and [[B.Tech.]] except nomenclature. Eligibility for entry is 12 years of school education. Generally the first year (first two semesters) is common to all branches and has the same subjects of study. Courses divert after first year. The medium of instruction and examination is English. Generally, universities in India offer engineering degree in the following branches: [[Civil Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Electrical and Electronics Engineering]], [[Electronics and Communications Engineering]], [[Instrumentation and Control Engineering]], [[Computer Science and Engineering]], [[Information Technology]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Metallurgical Engineering]], [[Aerospace Engineering]], [[Production Engineering]], [[Biochemical Engineering]], [[Biomedical Engineering]] and [[Agricultural Engineering]]. The [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA) are responsible government authorities for approving engineering colleges and branches/courses. Only those universities which have been approved by these bodies can award degrees which are legally valid and are accepted as qualifiers for jobs in the central/state government and private sector.

[[File:Bürgerkinder zur Biedermeierzeit (um 1820).jpg|thumb|The ''Bildungsbürger'' class defined itself more on the basis of education than material possessions and thus great emphasis was laid upon the education of the children.]]
'''''Bildungsbürgertum''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋsˌbʏʁɡɐtuːm|lang}}) is a [[social class]] that initially emerged in mid-18th century [[Germany]] as an educated class of the [[bourgeoisie]] with an educational ideal based on idealistic values and [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lp/prj/mtg/typ/bil/en4278538.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Bildungsbuergertum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Bildungsbürgertum'' could be described as the intellectual and economic upper bourgeoisie in contrast to the ''Kleinbürgertum'' ([[petite bourgeoisie]]).

== Term ==
The term itself was coined in the 1920s by the right wing and had an anti-bourgeois sentiment, which was perceived by the incompatible idea of being a 'genuine' intellectual and a bourgeois (Bürger).

The term ''Bildungsbürgertum'' is a concept difficult to translate into the English language. The notion of the word "''[[Bildung]]''" has broader meaning than that of "culture", or "education", and is deeply rooted in the idea of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIcAAJfYEocC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Bildungsbürgertum+translate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=beTsrI3Xe8&amp;sig=A4siNZRkSVh9KVg6ftn3VSvGz_Q&amp;hl=fi&amp;ei=52usTuvfHOTm4QTEn5zaDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CHIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bildungsbürgertum%20translate&amp;f=false] – The future of market transition, Kevin T. Leicht&lt;/ref&gt; The term also corresponds to the ideal of education in the work of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].  Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development; rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills, education is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in a process of continual expansion and growth. (See ''[[Bildung]]'', [[General knowledge]])

== Formation ==

''Bildungsbürgertum'' was the term for a new social class that initially emerged in Germany in the mid-18th century. This group distinguished themselves through education in the humanities, literature, and science, and involvement in the state affairs.  As a class of wealthy non-noble people, emerging first in the [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]], they gained material wealth, social position and a better education, which was based on Humboldt's educational ideal. The idea of ''[[Bildung]]'' (i.e. culture, education) was shaped by a belief in human perfectibility, specifically that an individual's potential could be realized through a classical education. 

In the late [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] management state there existed a need for a large number of educated officials to implement reforms.  To avoid a violent revolution, as in France, a national class was formed that had access to cultural education and thus to political positions. As a result, many educational institutions were established, significantly more in Germany. The universities established in Germany, including the [[Humboldt University]], became a model for modern universities in other countries. This new class was not primarily defined politically or economically, but mainly culturally. It is often argued that Germany owes its reputation in technical expertise, scholarship and administration to the ''Bildungsbürgertum''.

[[Nationalism]] at its origin was a liberal ideal, and as the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' were often represented in the liberal factions of society, they were often in the forefront of the quest for the founding of a sovereign [[nation state]]. By the 1870s, the bulk of the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' had lost its forward-driving liberal orientation. 

According to professor [[Klaus Vondung]], the following characteristics could be applied to the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' at the end of the 19th century: 

*academic education
*[[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] behaviour, self-isolation from other social classes and establishment of neo-aristocratic thinking, especially concerning stature and pedigree.
*high self-recruitment
*social prestige being perceived as more important than material wealth
*predominantly Protestant
*considered the "cultural elite"
*dominated certain professions

In the 18th century, academic occupations such as professors, [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (grammar school) teachers, physicians, pharmacists, attorneys, judges, Protestant ministers, engineers and leading officials were strongly represented among the ''Bildungsbürger''. 

In Germany the ''Bildungsbürgertum'' exercised first influence before the bourgeoisie as the commercial class gained more influence during industrialization from 1850 onwards. In France and Britain, it developed mainly as a commercial class and could, by virtue of its economic strength, claim political power. In Germany the formation of the bourgeoisie occurred only in the first half of the 1800s, to be politically active. It played a crucial role in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], which nevertheless failed.

Well-known examples of individuals associated with the term ''Bildungsbürgertum'' are the 20th-century writer [[Thomas Mann]] or the [[Weizsäcker family]].

'''CORE''' (COnnecting REpositories) is a service provided by the [[Knowledge Media Institute]], based at [[The Open University]], [[United Kingdom]]. The goal of the project is to aggregate all [[open access]] content distributed across different systems, such as [[Institutional repository|repositories]] and [[open access journal]]s, enrich this content using [[text mining]] and [[data mining]], and provide free access to it through a set of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = OU’s full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=24452| date = 24 October 2012| accessdate = 19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CORE project also aims to promote open access to scholarly outputs. It fully supports the [[taxpayer]]'s entitlement to the research they have funded and facilitates the wide dissemination of the [[open access]] content. CORE works closely with [[Digital Library|digital libraries]] and [[Institutional repository|institutional repositories]].

Based on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]], the open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. Thus the CORE project started with the goal of connecting [[metadata]] and full-text outputs offering, via the content aggregation, value-added services, and opening new opportunities in the research process.

Currently there are existing commercial academic search systems, such as [[Google Scholar]], which provide search and access level services, but do not support programmable machine access to the content, for example with the use of an [[Application programming interface|API]] or data dumps. This limits the further reuse of the open access content, for example, with regards to [[Text mining|text and data mining]]. Taking into consideration that there are three access levels to content: 1. access at the granularity of papers, 2. analytical access and granularity of collections and 3. programmable machine access to data&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Knoth| first = Petr | title = CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access | journal = D-Lib Magazine| url = http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html| volume = 1 | number = 11/12 | date = December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the programmable machine access is the main feature that distinguishes CORE from [[Google Scholar]] and [[Microsoft Academic Search]].

==History==
The first version of CORE was created in 2011 by [[Petr Knoth]] with the aim to make it easier to access and [[text mining|text mine]] very large amounts of research publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = OUs full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://news.kmi.open.ac.uk/rostra/news.php?r=11&amp;t=2&amp;id=18463=KMi| date = 24 October 2012| accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a [[recommender system|content recommendation system]] for research papers, following the ideas of literature-based discovery introduced by [[Don R. Swanson]]. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including [[Jisc]] and the [[European Commission]]. Although CORE aggregates from across the world, it has the status of the UK's national aggregator of [[open access]] content, aggregating [[metadata]] and full-text outputs from both UK publishers' databases as well as institutional and subject repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CORE melds UK repositories| newspaper= Times of Higher Education | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/417751.article| date = 13 October 2011| accessdate = 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = UK’s first open access full-text search engine to aid research| publisher=The Research Centre | url = http://www.theresearchcentre.co.uk/feedstory/uk-s-open-access-full-text-search-engine-aid-research| date = 3 October 2011| accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service operates as a one step search tool for UK's [[open access]] research outputs, facilitating easy discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by [[Jisc]], which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Neil | last = Jacobs | first2 = Nicky| last2 = Ferguson | title = Bringing the UK's open access research together: Barriers on the Berlin road to open access| year = 2014| publisher= Jisc | url = http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5570/1/JISC_REPORT_open_mirror_090514_FINAL_WEB.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
CORE is now one of the Repository Shared Services projects, along with [[SHERPA (organisation)|Sherpa Services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/| title= SHERPA Services | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRUS-UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/| title= IRUS UK| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jisc Publications Router&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url        = http://broker.edina.ac.uk/| title = Jisc Publications Router| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[OpenDOAR]].

==Programmable access to CORE data==
CORE data can be accessed through an [[API]] or downloaded as a pre-processed and semantically enriched [https://core.ac.uk/services data dump].

==Searching CORE==
CORE provides searchable access to a collection of over 125 millions of [[open access]] harvested research outputs. All outputs can be accessed and downloaded free of cost and have limited re-use restrictions. One can search the CORE content using a [[faceted search]]. CORE also provides a cross-repository content [[Recommender system|recommendation system]] based on full-texts. The collection of the harvested outputs is available either by looking at the latest additions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse/latest| title= CORE Latest Additions| accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by browsing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse| title= CORE Browsing | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection at the date of harvesting.
The CORE search engine has been selected as one of the top 10 search engines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ten Search Engines for researchers that go beyond Google| series= Jisc Inform| url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/inform/inform37/SearchingBeyondGoogle.html| date = Summer 2013 | accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for open access research, facilitating access to academic papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OU widens access to academic papers| url = http://www.openuniversity.edu/news-blog/news/ou-widens-access-to-academic-papers| accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Else	| first = Holly | title = ‘Dismal’ start for Access to Research initiative | newspaper = Times Higher Education | date = 14 August 2014  | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/dismal-start-for-access-to-research-initiative/2015157.article| accessdate = 15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CORE ranks second among the most useful databases of searching electronic [[thesis]] and dissertations (ETDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Top 100 Thesis and Dissertations on the Web| publisher= OnlinePhDProgram | url = http://onlinephdprogram.org/thesis-dissertation/| accessdate = 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical use of CORE data==
The availability of data aggregated and enriched by CORE provides opportunities for the development of new analytical services for research literature. These can be used, for example, to monitor growth and trends in research, validate compliance with [[open access mandate]]s and to develop new automatic metrics for evaluating research excellence.

==Applications==
CORE offers eight applications:
*CORE API, provides an access point for those who want to develop applications making use of CORE's large collection of Open Access content. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#api| title= CORE API|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Dataset, enables the accessibility of the data aggregated from repositories by CORE and allows their further manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#dataset | title= CORE Dataset|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Recommender, can link the institutional repository with the CORE service and it will recommend semantically related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#recommender| title= CORE Recommender|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Repository Dashboard, is a tool designed specifically for repository managers or research output administrators. The aim of the Repository Dashboard is to provide control over the aggregated content and help in the management and validation of the repository collections and services. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#dashboard | title= CORE Repository Dashboard|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CORE Analytics Dashboard, helps institutions to understand and monitor the impact of their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#dashboard | title= CORE Analytics Dashboard|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CORE Search, enables users to search and access research papers via a faceted search interface. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/| title= CORE Search|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CORE Publisher Connector, is a software providing seamless access to Gold and [[Hybrid open access journal |Hybrid Gold Open Access articles]] aggregated from non-standard systems of major publishers. Data is exposed via the ResourceSync protocol. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://core.ac.uk/services#connector| title= CORE Publisher Connector|accessdate = 6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Chang-sik bullied Joon-seok relentlessly during high school. And his girlfriend was raped by Chang-sik in front of him and committed suicide on the next day. Fifteen years later, the two encounter each other again. Chang-sik is working for a [[chaebol|conglomerate]], and preparing for his wedding. On the other hand, because of his traumatic experience, Joon-seok has a difficult time getting a decent job even though he graduated from a prestigious university; he works part-time as a valet park attendant and frequents a convenience store nearby. Unable to forget, Joon-seok prepares for revenge to make Chang-sik pay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">[[File:EVS EURO26 card.jpg|thumbnail|The back of a European Youth Card of an EVS volunteer]]
'''European Voluntary Service''' (EVS) is the [[European Commission]]'s project that allows a young person (17–30 years) to become a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] in another country for a specified period, normally between 2–12 months. The [[Community service|service]] activities can be, for example, in the field of [[Natural environment|environment]], arts and [[culture]], activities with children, [[young people]] or the [[elderly]], heritage or sports and leisure activities. Each project has three partners, a volunteer, a sending [[organisation]] and a host organisation. The project has to take place in a country other than where the volunteers lives, is non-profit-making and unpaid and lasts for a limited period (maximum 12 months).

An EVS project involves a triangular partnership: a volunteer, a sending organisation, and a host organisation. One of the countries involved in a project must be an [[European Union|EU]] [[European Union member state|Member State]] or an [[accession country]].

==Financial aspect==
[[File:EVS volunteer project within Nevitsky Castle reconstruction.jpg|thumbnail|Volunteers doing reconstruction works on [[Nevytsky Castle]], western Ukraine]]
* The volunteer's international travel covers reasonable travel costs from the volunteer's home to the host organisation, and the costs are paid to the sending organisation in full when the volunteer uses the cheapest available train or plane ticket (e.g. discount air ticket, or equivalent). A copy of the ticket(s) must be attached to the final report.  	
* Contribution to the sending activities (recruitment, preparation, contact, assessment, follow-up) is a lump sum payment depending on the length of the project and is determined for each country.	
* Exceptional volunteer costs related to the special needs of the volunteer (medical attendance, additional preparation, etc.) are paid in full, provided they are reasonable and justifiable.	
* The volunteer's allowance is fixed per host country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthinaction.nl/youthinaction/download/schema/zakgeldbedragenEVS2008.pdf EVS Pocketmoney overview 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and is paid in full to the host organisation to be given to the volunteer weekly or monthly.
* On 9 May 2012 [[Fraternité 2020]] was registered as Europe's first [[European Citizens' Initiative]]. Its goal is to get 3% of the EU budget for EU exchange programmes like the EVS from 2014 (the share currently is 1.2%). To be successful it needs to collect 1 million signatures by 1 November 2013.	

All volunteers are [[Insurance|insured]] for [[Illness|sickness]], [[accident]]s, permanent invalidity, and repatriation in case of serious [[illness]], accident, and [[death]] through [[AXA]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080913212113/http://www.europeanbenefits.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=197]. The insurance also covers civil liability. This insurance complements the protection provided by the national social security (if applicable) which is proven by the E111 (or similar) form of the volunteer. All insurance costs are paid directly by the [[European Commission]] and they are not included in project budgets.

== Procedure ==
The first step of a prospective volunteer is to find and contact a sending organisation and together with them consult the database of approved hosts.

All volunteers who have completed their EVS project are entitled to a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] called a Youthpass signed by the Head of the Youth Agency. This certificate validates their period of voluntary service and provides details of the activities in which they were involved. Volunteers from the countries involved also have the possibility to benefit from the [[wikt:Youth initiative action|Youth initiative action]], and get involved in other Community programmes in general.

In [[Austria]], due to the [[conscription]] regulations, the EVS is recognized as an alternative service to mandatory [[national service]] in the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] or the regular alternative service called ''[[Zivildienst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugendinaktion.at/images/doku/infoblatt_efdalszivildienstersatz_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of Brexit ==
British residents will continue to have access to the programme until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivsgb.org/european-voluntary-service/|title=Implications of Brexit|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive education''' (ExEd or Exec. Ed) refers to academic programs at graduate-level [[business school]]s worldwide for executives, business leaders and functional managers. These programs are generally non-credit and non-degree-granting, but sometimes lead to [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s and some offer [[Continuing education unit|continuing education units]] accepted by professional bodies and institutes. Estimates by ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine suggest that executive education in the United States is approximately an $800 million annual business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914060629/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |archive-date=2011-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 80 percent provided by university-based business schools. Key players in university-based executive education span elite{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} universities, as well as many regional and mid-sized universities and business schools around the world.

Customized programs, which are tailored for and offered to executives of a single company, represent the fastest growing segment of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership by Design, Albert A. Vicere, Robert M. Fulmer, (1998) {{ISBN|0875848311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customized programs help organizations increase management capability by combining the science of business and performance management into specialized programs that enable executives to develop new knowledge, skills and attitudes. Knowledge translates into the capability an organization applies to the products and services it brings to the marketplace. Research shows that a firm with a clearly articulated and understood business and capability strategy will have a higher market-to-book value than a firm that does not.&lt;ref&gt;Maritan C. and Schnatterly K. (2004) [http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/42582.pdf Intangible Assets as Drivers of Value: Technology, Capabilities and Management Systems].&lt;/ref&gt;

Open enrollment programs also are available as part of university-based executive education offerings, which occur throughout the year on selected dates, and are available to participants from different companies and organizations.

Shorter executive education programs tend to focus on specific roles or industries, or on improving specific [[leadership skills]], such as persuasion, negotiation, [[teambuilding]] or communication.

Some executive education providers offer more comprehensive management training options, such as the modular "Advanced Management Program" (AMP) offered independently by several business schools.

University-based executive education programs, and customized programs in particular, include serious engagement among executives, senior business faculty and researchers who are on the leading edge of business thought and management theory development. It has been noted that “executive education is the toughest classroom there is”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acu.edu.au/staff/our_university/publications/acu_update/2012/issue_1/new_directorate_at_acu|title=New Directorate at ACU|first=|last=Unknown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides other academic fields such as the hard sciences or engineering) because time-pressed and demanding executives challenge each other in the classroom as much or more as their professors. The programs are credited{{By whom|date=March 2012}} with offering unique networking and personal career development opportunities for participants, as well as opportunities for universities to build stronger [[alumni network]]s that also benefit younger, traditional MBA program graduates through networking, internships and job opportunities.

Not all observers of university-based executive education are positive. There is some debate about the nature of business school education as a form of professional development. Some believe that university-based executive education has caused some business schools to "lose track of their professional mission." This argument is made by [[Rakesh Khurana]] among others.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Khurana, R. (2007) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html From higher aims to hired hands: The social transformation of American business schools and the unfulfilled promise of management as a profession]. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The genesis of executive education can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and his 1911 treatise [[Principles of Scientific Management]]. This book described how the application of the scientific method to the management of workers could improve productivity. Taylor's ideas, also known as "Taylorism"&lt;ref name=t&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Anthro/Anth101/taylorism_and_fordism.htm Taylorism and Fordism]. Vanderbilt.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; would become the standard for businesses worldwide.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

On the heels of Taylorism came The [[Alfred P. Sloan]] School of Management, which in 1914 began offering Course XV, Engineering Administration, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. At that time, the concept of providing business training in the academic environment was gaining popularity, thus MIT created a program “specially designed to train men to be competent managers of businesses that have much to do with engineering problems.” Harvard also began offering short five-week selections of standard MBA material in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

In 1930 Course XV at [http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php MIT] became an independent department and was named the Department of Business and Engineering Administration. In 1931 an innovative program for executive development was initiated with the backing of several industrialists. This one-year program — offering graduate study in the fundamentals of management and decision-making — was aimed at young managers who were nominated by their employers and was highly competitive. In 1938 the program received full funding by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was formally named the MIT Sloan Fellowship Program for Executive Development at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php History of MIT Sloan – MIT Sloan Newsroom]. Mitsloan.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Education in the United States developed critical mass after World War II. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 — commonly known as the [[GI Bill of Rights]] — allowed veterans to take advantage of education benefits.  Many studied business in college, a privilege previously only enjoyed by the wealthy.&lt;ref name=gibill&gt;[http://www.gibill.va.gov/gi_bill_info/history.htm GI Bill History – U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs]. Gibill.va.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent executive education programs, including the 13-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and the four-week Institute for Management at Northwestern University’s School of Commerce (now the Kellogg School of Management), developed in response to the need to rapidly train line executives for general management in the post World War II era.

By the late 1970s nearly 20 business schools in the United States were offering some form of executive education. The science of business also was developing at a rapid pace as faculty, such as [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard ) and [[C. K. Prahalad]] (University of Michigan), published academic papers that changed the way people thought and acted within companies.

Prahalad&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/authors/prahalad C.K. Prahalad – Harvard Business Review]. Hbr.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; is most notably remembered for developing the concepts of “core competencies” and “strategic intent”. These and other respected academic business thinkers — Don Hambrick, Ram Charan, David Ulrich, Michael Hammer, Gary Hamel and many others — are the true pioneers of executive education and the ongoing effort to facilitate wealth creation and other new concepts aimed at making stronger businesses while improving the welfare of the world.

Throughout the 1970s university-based executive education continued to evolve as an industry. Several on-campus residential facilities were constructed at several universities, demonstrating the value of a standalone facility dedicated to executive education programs. This spurred the development of such facilities at schools nationwide and the subsequent expansion of short open enrollment programs. The industry’s exclusive professional association, The International University Consortium for Executive Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniconexed.org|title=Global Consortium for University-Based Executive Education - Unicon|website=UNICON}}&lt;/ref&gt; also came into existence during this period. UNICON began sponsoring a tradeshow in the 1970s for companies interested in learning about university-based executive education and an annual conference for members. UNICON has since grown into a consortium of nearly 100 universities with executive education programs around the globe. It sponsors three annual conferences that allow members to share best practices, conducts research into topics of concern and provides benchmarking data for members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniconexed.org Welcome to UNICON, the International University Consortium for Executive Education]. Uniconexed.org (2007-01-31). Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive education further developed in the 1980s and 1990s as the increasing pace and scope of global business demanded higher levels of education among employees. The [[dot-com bubble|dot-com]] boom further changed the scope of the business landscape by favoring employees and organizations that were quick to adapt to change. As longstanding business concepts became obsolete, continual training was necessary – but earning a degree was not.

In a 1999 survey of 63 programs, the [[University of Michigan Business School]] topped the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/929014|title=University of Michigan Business School|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next survey in 2001, the number of programs had doubled to 121, with a doubling of revenues to $800M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-10-14/a-mid-career-boost|title=A Mid-Career Boost|date=15 October 2001|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the survey, Executive education growth was dramatically impacted by travel restrictions and economic impact of the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Current situation==

The participation of many of the most prestigious universities around the world has enhanced the value of university-based executive education. Ongoing business challenges and opportunities – a dynamic economy, developing technologies, new business models and [[globalization]] – has made the emphasis on learning new concepts throughout ones career a necessity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Despite the growing popularity of university-based executive education around the world, the global economic recession has slowed the industry’s growth during the past few years. According to a 2011 study conducted by the [[Manchester Business School]] in partnership with [[Dubai International Academic City]] and [[Dubai Knowledge Village]], the global economic downturn has had a negative impact on learning and development spending within the Middle East. More than half the respondents noted that spending on executive education had been “significantly” affected, while other organizations agreed that spending had been “somewhat” affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110228112046?q=TECOM%20Research Significant Number of GCC Companies Yet to Engage in Executive Education, Reveals Manchester Business School-TECOM Research], 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A return to higher participation appears to be coming as the economy shows more signs of improvement.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A substantial portion of the organizations surveyed by Manchester Business School said they anticipate executive education spending to moderately increase during the next three years.

The situation is similar in other parts of the world according to a late 2010 state of the industry survey conducted by UNICON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411000713/http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |archive-date=2011-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that many prestigious universities with executive education programs around the world expect notably higher enrollment during 2011. Sixty-five percent of UNICON survey participants predicted increased participation in their open enrollment programs this year. Additionally, 78 percent of schools projected an increase in customized executive education programs during 2011. Nearly half of the schools surveyed indicated an increase in their number of programming days, now offering up to 39 weeks in open enrollment programs and an average of 49 weeks in custom programs. Slightly more than half also reported increasing the number of days that educational programs for executives are offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html Executive Education in the News – March 4, 2011 – Executive Education Momentum Sign of Economic Recovery, Cindy Bielke, C-change Strategies].

==Rankings==

Executive education rankings are carried out annually by the [[Financial Times]] and by [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]].

Ranking may be based on aims achieved, % of women, average rank, country, course design, fac. diversity, facilities, faculty, follow-up, food, growth, intl. location, intl. participants, revenues, participants, partner schools, preparation, skills, teaching, and other criteria.

'''Exploring''' is an interactive, worksite-based career education program of [[Learning for Life]], an affiliate of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Participants in the program are called '''Explorers''' and previously '''Explorer Scouts'''. The program serves youth in 6th-8th grades (Exploring clubs), and young men and women who are 14 through 20 years old (Exploring posts). Exploring units (clubs or posts), are sponsored by local businesses, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations, and usually focus on a single career field, but can also introduce youth to a variety of career fields within a single unit.

Prior to 1998, the Exploring program was the main BSA program for older youth and included posts with an emphasis on outdoor activities, which are now part of the [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] program.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2018/02/09/20-facts-about-venturing-on-the-programs-20th-birthday/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date= April 2014}}
The '''filmstrip''' was a common form of [[still image]] instructional [[multimedia]], once commonly used by educators in primary and secondary schools (K-12), overtaken at the end of the 1980s by newer and increasingly lower-cost full-motion [[videocassette]]s and later on by [[DVD]]s. From the 1940s to 1980s, filmstrips provided an easy and inexpensive alternative to [[16 mm film|16 mm]] educational films, requiring very little storage space and being very quick to rewind for the next use.  Filmstrips were large and durable, and rarely needed splicing. They are still used in some areas.

== Technology ==
[[File:Filmstrip S-J-Bosco 3.jpg|thumb|Filmstrip from S. Juan Bosco Editorial]]
A filmstrip is a spooled roll of [[35 mm film|35 mm positive film]] with approximately thirty to fifty images arranged in sequential order. Like 16&amp;nbsp;mm film, a filmstrip was inserted vertically down in front of the projector aperture, rather than horizontally as in a slide projector. Therefore, the frame size is smaller than normal 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. Two image frames of a filmstrip take up the same amount of space as a single 35mm frame, including its guard band, so that a 25 exposure 35mm film can contain 50 filmstrip images.  Early [[celluloid]] filmstrips had a habit of [[melting]] or [[combustion|combusting]] from the intense and sustained heat of the projection lamp.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} These were called pictural filmstrips, the first filmstrips that were produced in a complete set{{clarify|date=September 2012}}.

Typically, a filmstrip's running time was between ten and twenty minutes. Depending on how they were narrated or produced, filmstrips (which often came with an instructor's guide) were flexible enough to be used in both self-paced learning formats or a full classroom. In addition to a standard classroom wall or screen projector, personal film display units were available with a screen size of approximately eight inches diagonal for up-close viewing by one or two people.

The instructor would turn on a [[filmstrip projector]] that would show the first frame (image) of the filmstrip. The instructor then turned on a 33 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] record or [[cassette tape]] containing the audio material for the filmstrip which included narration. At the appropriate point, a tone would sound, signaling the instructor to turn a knob, advancing to the next frame. Later, technical improvements allowed the projector to advance the film automatically.

== Film production ==
By the later part of the 1960s, such firms as [[Warren Schloat Productions]], [[CBS]], [[The New York Times Company]], [[Scott Education]], [[Coronet Films]], [[Sunburst Media]], and [[Guidance Associates]] were producing titles featuring photographs by famous artists and of notable events with a synchronized audio track. The music and narration for the filmstrip originally came on a [[gramophone record|vinyl record]].

In the 1970s, audio technology advanced, and vinyl records gave way to [[compact audio cassette|audio cassettes]] and became useful in providing individualized instruction. Students could now watch and listen to a filmstrip over and over at their own pace. Filmstrips also moved beyond traditional arts and humanities courses, branching into the science, career, vocational and technical subject areas led by such firms as Bergwall Productions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bergwall.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Prentice Hall Media (Formerly Warren Schloat Productions.) There were filmstrips produced in many different subject areas including music, art, [[language arts]], math, business and even [[home economics]].

=== Home entertainment ===
In the early 1950s production companies started producing filmstrips for home entertainment. There were a number of films from Disney, and also from the Society for Visual Education Inc.(Chicago),&lt;ref name="SVE"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvard University|title=Society for Visual Education Inc|url=http://dssmhi1.fas.harvard.edu/emuseumdev/code/emuseum.asp?action=advsearch&amp;newsearch=1&amp;profile=people&amp;rawsearch=constituentid/,/is/,/950/,/false/,/true&amp;style=single&amp;searchdesc=Society%20for%20Visual%20Education,%20Inc |accessdate=7 April 2013|year=1|publisher=Harvard University|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other manufacturers.

=== Eastern Europe production ===
{{Confusing|section|date=October 2013}}
Film strips were popular in the USSR because movie projectors and VCRs were not in common use until the early 1990s. A great number of films were produced by the "Diafilm" studio. Many filmstrips were produced by "cinematographic studios" in former Soviet bloc countries such as Poland and Hungary during the 1950s–1960s.
 
In Greece they were known and sold by the name "tainies Argo Film" (ARGO FILM movies) from the name of the company (ARGO FILM) that translated the scripts into Greek and organized the productions' distribution in Greece. The titles included children's stories, fairy tales, Greek history, Christianity, adventure, science fiction and war stories.

== Automatic film advance ==
During the 1970s, advanced projectors became available, and these projectors would automatically advance the film by means of a 50 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[subaudible tone]] recorded on the cassette that would be detected by the projector, and automatically advance the frame. Most cassettes accompanying filmstrips in the 1970s and 1980s would have the same audio material on both sides of the tape. One side would have audible tones for the older projectors, and the other side would have the subaudible tones for the newer automatic projectors. Some select filmstrip releases had both audible and subaudible tones combined, making the filmstrip and its companion cassette compatible with any filmstrip projector. If improperly set up, the narration and film would not be synchronized.

From the late 1970s to the beginning of 1980, because most filmstrip publishers stopped making their sound filmstrip sets with [[LP record]]s, audiovisual companies started producing automatic filmstrip projectors with built-in cassette players to better meet the audiovisual needs of teachers and school librarians. In 1979-1980 the [[DuKane Corporation]] in [[St. Charles, Illinois]] began to produce a cassette automatic filmstrip projector called the DuKane Micromatic II. This automatic filmstrip projector was easier to use by loading the filmstrip in the projector backward when the plastic upper film spring was flipped back{{clarify|date=September 2012}}. Loading the cassettes into the projector's cassette compartment was also easier with a control panel for the filmstrip and accompanying cassette. This filmstrip projector also had 50&amp;nbsp;Hz synchronization and could also be operated by remote control when set on manual mode. It was very popular with classroom and music teachers and school librarians. DuKane also produced their new line of silent filmstrip projectors which were also popular in schools. The La Belle Commpak system always use 1000 Hz tone to advance to the next slide. It will be embedded on to the Commpak 8track cartridge. Then it will be played on to la belle tutor 16/la belle duo 16 system. The [[general electric]] show 'n' tell record system use 16mm for film and record for audio and cool thing is the 16mm played upside down advance to the next frame. Simelar to la belle commpak system and dukane filmstrip projector the [[general electric]] show 'n' tell system contains any story on 1 16mm film format.

== Decline and obsolescence ==
The 1980s brought the advent of the [[video cassette recorder]] (VCR), and advancing technology meant increasingly affordable VCRs. When VCRs became within reach for most schools' budgets, this marked beginning of a decline in filmstrip use. Video instruction combined the ease of the filmstrip with automatically synchronized audio and [[full motion video]]. By the early 1990s, the vast majority of filmstrip producers that were not equipped to compete with video either closed or sold their businesses.

In the late 1990s to early 2000s, some audiovisual companies (such as [[Society for Visual Education Inc.]],&lt;ref name="SVE"/&gt; [[Educational Audio Visual]], and [[Metro Audio Visual]]) were still producing filmstrips for schools and libraries. When VHS, DVD, multimedia projectors and computers became popular in schools and libraries, however, filmstrips ceased to be used in schools, and many public libraries no longer had filmstrips in their catalogs. By the mid-2000s many schools no longer wanted to purchase filmstrips, and audiovisual companies stopped producing them.

The company then moved to small-scale private [[beta testing]] in 27 classes.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chris. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/09/open-source-tex/ "Open Source Textbooks Challenge a Paradigm."] Wired.com. September 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on results from these studies, the business model was determined viable and the company moved toward preparing for a public beta launch in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, John Levi III, and David A. Wiley. [http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2800/2578 "A Sustainable Future for Open Textbooks?"] The Flat World Knowledge Story. ''First Monday.'' Vol 15, No 8. August 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
During spring of 2009, 30 colleges adopted Flat World open textbooks in public beta bringing the company their first 1,000 users. Eight textbooks were published at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, John C. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/open-source-textbook-company-now-bmoc-at-400-colleges/ "Open Source Textbook Company Now BMOC at 400 Colleges."] Wired.com.

The company also published a graphic novel, ''[[Atlas Black: Managing to Succeed]]'' in August.

===2010===
Flat World Knowledge moved from Nyack, New York to [[Irvington, New York]] to accommodate company growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Marc.

October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat World Knowledge entered into a unique licensing agreement with Virginia State University in 2010. For eight core business courses, students gained access to all electronic formats of select textbooks including study aids. Unlike traditional licensing models, students retain access to course materials and study aids indefinitely through their Flat World student account. Audio textbook versions and [[ePub]] files similarly do not expire. The price for this universal digital access license is cited as $20 per student by the ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''.&lt;ref&gt;Llovio, Luis.

August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia State University program is featured in the ''BizEd'' article "Digital at the Core." Virginia State University is using the agreement as part of a university effort to "save money, save the environment, improve student retention, and prepare business graduates for the complex working world."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Mirta M. [http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/40-43%20F-Digital%20at%20Core.pdf "Digital at the Core."] ''BizEd'' 9, no. 6 November 2010 pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2010, the number of colleges and universities using Flat World open textbooks doubled to 800 higher education institutions. Student users more than tripled with 150,000 students using 24 published titles.

During fall semester 2010, 50 additional titles were announced as in the publication pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Biba, Paul.

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 also marked crossing the threshold of having 100 authors signed to write open textbooks for publication by Flat World Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Mary. [http://assett.colorado.edu/post/1284 "Open Textbooks Offer Instructors More Control, Customizability."] ''ASSETT.'' September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat World Knowledge claimed that in its second full academic year of operation, they would save&lt;ref&gt;Kolowich, Steve.

August 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Outsell Inc. named Flat World Knowledge as one of "30 to Watch" for 2011 among innovators and disruptors who were selected for "shaking up their respective marketplaces."&lt;ref&gt;Stratigos, Anthea, Leigh Watson Healy, and Marc Strohlein.

Flat World Knowledge. January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 - 2015===

In November 2012, FlatWorld  announced that it will no longer provide free access to their textbook content citing financial concerns as the reason for this change.&lt;ref name="Chron_drop" /&gt; Unable to continue to operate without a way to generate greater revenue, it instituted a paywall and moved away from the open model.   Over the next three years, the company pivoted focus, investing in developing a new, competency-based learning platform and line of business.

===2016===
In late 2016, the core textbook publishing business, Flat World Knowledge, was spun off and acquired by Alastair Adam and John Eielson and rebranded as FlatWorld. The remaining competency-based learning business was rebranded as Sagence Learning.  Adam and Eielson saw an opportunity to disrupt the higher-education publishing market, where fewer and fewer students were able to afford a new textbook and were increasingly reliant on used, rented or outdated editions of titles. They wanted to refocus FlatWorld on low-cost, high-quality textbooks, available in whatever format the student preferred. They believed that by offering high-quality textbooks at affordable prices, they could put a new, current edition textbook in every student’s hands on the first day of class.

Flat World Knowledge secured $11.5 million in investments through 2010, including an initial $700k angel investment.&lt;ref&gt;Business Headlines.

===International===
A [[Canada|Canadian]] representation agreement was announced in March 2011 with Northrose Associates of [[Whitby, Ontario]], Canada. The Canadian higher education system faces challenges similar to U.S. higher education providers from the ever escalating costs of traditional college textbooks. [[Open textbooks]] from Flat World Knowledge will be actively marketed by the firm to educators and higher education administrators across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;CARL ABRC.

In December 2010, the [[American Library Association]]'s Business Reference Sources Committee of RUSA's Business Reference and Services Section (BRASS) selected Flat World Knowledge's Business and Economics [[open textbooks]] for their 2010 list of "outstanding business reference sources."&lt;ref&gt;BRASS Business Reference Sources Committee, [[American Library Association]].

Vol. 50:2, Winter 2010. December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific criteria used by the American Library Association BRASS when evaluating texts for selection were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A resource compiled specifically to supply information on a certain subject or group of subjects in a form that will facilitate its ease of use. The works are examined for authority and reputation of the publisher, author, or editor; accuracy; appropriate bibliography; organization, comprehensiveness, and value of the content; currency and unique addition to the field; ease of use for intended purpose; quality and accuracy of indexing; and quality and usefulness of graphics and illustrations. Each year more electronic reference titles are published, and additional criteria by which these resources are evaluated include search features, stability of content, graphic design quality, and accuracy of links. Works selected are intended to be suitable for medium to large academic and public libraries."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accessibility and regulatory issues==

===Accessibility===
Flat World Knowledge textbooks are developed for [[accessible publishing]] natively to facilitate compliance with expectations placed on educators for assuring student accessibility to course materials set forth in [[Section 504]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] and Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA). For students with text, vision, vision and hearing, or physical disabilities, Flat World Knowledge has partnered with Bookshare to provide no-charge accessible digital books including an electronic [[Braille]] format. Bookshare members with qualifying disabilities have immediate access to course and reference materials online as opposed to having to request materials direct from the publisher by mail or through another intermediary. According to [[Jim Fruchterman]], CEO of [[Benetech]], the non-profit organization that operates Bookshare, "Without the cooperation of a publisher such as Flat World, students often wait for weeks to get textbooks in accessible formats and, in some cases, are forced to drop courses&lt;ref&gt;Kerscher, George, and Jim Fruchterman. [http://data.daisy.org/publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html?q=publications/docs/soundproof/sound_proof_book.html "The Soundproof Book:] Exploration of Rights conflict and Access to Commercial EBooks for People with Disabilities." [[DAISY]] Consortium. Accessed January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of accessible books. Flat World is the first postsecondary textbook publisher to recognize and alleviate this problem."&lt;ref&gt;Bookshare.

December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price disclosure and edition availability===
Flat World Knowledge claims to make compliance with the recent Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) simple as the basic price for their textbooks is free and once published, any edition number remains available online at no charge or available for order in print by students, educators, and bookstores on-demand; educators change versions only when they wish and book versions are never "out of print."&lt;ref&gt;Edu1world.org. [http://www.edu1world.org/index/pages/page/?pgid=85 "Flat World Knowledge Makes HEOA Compliance Quick and Easy."] ''The Week in Review.'' May 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinshteyn, Mikhail.

==Sustainability==
Digital textbook and course material formats offer [[sustainability]] advantages over traditional paper textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Bryce. [http://earth911.com/news/2007/08/31/dead-trees-in-a-backpack/ "Textbooks: Dead Trees in a Backpack."] Earth911.com. August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury, Gobinda. "Carbon Footprint of the Knowledge Sector: What's the Future?." ''Journal of Documentation'' 66, no. 6 December 2010 pp. 934-946.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a publishing industry study, an estimated "net [carbon] emission of 8.85 pounds per book [is created for each paper book] sold to consumers."&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;Milliot, Jim [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080310/15955-toward-a-greener-future-.html "Toward a Greener Future.

In 2010-2011, approximately 57.5% of students using Flat World texts opted for entirely digital delivery. As of fall 2011, 70% of students opt for digital formats,&lt;ref&gt;Outsell, Inc.

For the approximately 30% of students who choose a print version over a digital one, Flat World Knowledge uses just-in-time centralized and local [[print on demand]] in their [[business model]].&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jane. [https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21634 "Flat World Knowledge partners with Barnes &amp; Noble and NACS Media Solutions."] ''Creative Commons News.'' April 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local [[print on demand]] of licensed content offers environmental benefits by saving the need to produce, store, and ship books from a central location — saving energy, natural resources, and cost. Eliminating the need for shipping alone eliminates at least 12.7% of the carbon footprint for paper books.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

Flat World Knowledge offers local booksellers the opportunity to license [[open textbook]] content for [[on-demand printing]] by the [[Espresso Book Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;Xerox.

Some students use accessible and audio formats. Though [[Braille embosser]]s print on paper, it is essential to provide access to educational materials in the format of choice to students regardless of disability. The same electronic file that is provided for a Braille embosser by Bookshare for Flat World Knowledge open textbooks is also compatible with many [[refreshable Braille display]]s.

Other accessible and audio mp3 formats are very [[sustainable]] as they are electronic.

==Formats==

===Free===
Until November 2012,&lt;ref name="Chron_drop"/&gt; Flat World open textbooks were available to read for free through the Flat World Knowledge website in an e-reader like format. Any user with access to the Internet was able to read the entire textbook catalog for free. This option has since been eliminated because too many students were taking advantage of this option and the FWK business model was becoming unsustainable without increased revenue from the other options.

[[Accessible]] formats of published works for people with qualifying disabilities are available at no charge through [[Bookshare]].

===Paid===
Textbooks in formats including print, individual PDF chapters, ePub, .MOBI (Kindle), audio mp3, abridged audio study mp3, and optional study tools are available for purchase by students direct, through bookstores,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Calvin. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/book-news/deals/article/42674-flat-world-knowledge-reaches-out-to-college-bookstores.html "Flat World Knowledge Reaches Out to College Bookstores."] ''Publishers Weekly.'' April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and via select online providers.

For users that desire note taking, highlighting, flash cards, or access to a condensed study view of textbooks through their online account, a paid study pass purchase is required.

==Derivative works==
Derivative works created through the Flat World publishing engine are available online at no charge in the two formats described earlier or for purchase in print format direct or through bookstores by [[ISBN]]. An ISBN is generated for all derivative work publications developed through the Flat World Knowledge publishing engine as is a [[Creative Commons]] license compatible with the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Florez, Dean, Charles Cook, Eric Frank, and Dennis Passovoy.

No [[Internet browser]] preference is stated for general access to free online reading over the Internet. Flat World Knowledge textbooks can be viewed on all major browsers and platforms.

==Content management systems==
Flat World Knowledge textbook content can be integrated directly into a [[learning management system]] such as [[Blackboard Learning System]], ANGEL, [[Moodle]], [[WebCT]], or [[Desire2Learn]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chris. [https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/02/flat-world-know/ "Flat World Knowledge to Bring Free Textbooks into Blackboard."] Wired.com.

The '''FoolProof''' Initiative is a project by the [https://www.foolprooffoundation.org FoolProof Foundation] that teaches consumer [[life skills]] and healthy skepticism to consumers. It teaches consumers to question anyone who wants to impact their money or welfare. Its resources are generally listed under 
[[financial literacy]] resources.

FoolProof was founded by [[Walter Cronkite]] and a group of young people. It provides free, advertising-fee, and comprehensive consumer life skills curriculums for middle and high schools, as well as a consumer newspaper.

The peer-to-peer curriculums use video and audio, games and music in a modular system to teach critical thinking skills and habits that can travel with a consumer through life. It also includes complex as well as basic financial concepts such as understanding [[credit (finance)]] and [[credit score]], getting a [[checking account]] or [[savings account]], and knowing how to use [[credit cards]].

The Initiative, for instance, appears to be one of the most effective in reaching vulnerable young people with meaningful education, rather than programs sponsored by business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/04/who-do-you-want-to-teach-your-children-about-money/ Washington Post] Article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its motto is "Use Caution. Question Sellers. Rely on Research."

==Characteristics==

FoolProof is a program designed by young people from across the world to help educate students about financial decisions in a friendly video format using real-life stories. The best part is that FoolProof can be used for free by anyone, no matter their financial aptitude, to help (young) people learn about money and the power of healthy skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-nader/dont-be-a-financial-fool_b_9593054.html Huffington Post] Article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people generally make common mistakes when it comes to their money. The FoolProof Initiative addresses these problems.

Here is a list of the most common mistakes:

* I impulse buy and don't practice healthy skepticism.
* I don’t have to worry about [[credit (finance)]] yet.
* News is news, whatever the platform or source.
* I believe advertising generally tells me all I need to know about a product or service.
* [[Bad credit]] can’t keep me from getting a job.
* All loan companies have the same rates.
* Posting sensitive and personal information online is okay.
* All [[credit cards]] are alike.
* It’s OK to bounce a few checks.
* It’s OK to make minimum payments on a credit card.
* Paying late occasionally can’t hurt my credit.
* [[Fine print]] isn’t important.
* Young people don’t have a [[credit score]].

== Curriculum ==
Available are a variety of educational programs/curriculums that are tied to state financial literacy standards and guidelines, listed in every state by the [[United States Department of Education]]. FoolProof also teaches financial literacy topics required by the [[Council of Economic Education]].  All programs are available to any consumer for free.

== Endorsements ==
The FoolProof Initiative is endorsed by many consumer-oriented organizations throughout the United States:

* [[Consumer Federation of America]] (CFA), a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, education and advocacy.
* [[National Association of Consumer Advocates]] (NACA) is a nationwide organization of more than 1500 attorneys and consumer advocates who represent and have represented hundreds of thousands of consumers victimized by fraudulent, abusive and predatory business practices.
* The [[Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood]] educates the public about commercialism's impact on kids' wellbeing and advocates for the end of child-targeted marketing. CCFC’s endorsement of FoolProof’s middle and high school curriculums were its first endorsements ever of a screen curriculum.
* [[Public Citizen]] serves as the people’s voice in the nation’s capital.
* [[Credit Abuse Resistance Education]] (CARE) Program is a national program founded by the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|WDNY]] and the Bankruptcy Committee of the Monroe County Bar Association.  It was founded in 1997 by Bankruptcy Judge John C. Ninfo, II, and as of 2008 has a presence in all 50 states.

'''Gail Godwin''' (born June 18, 1937) is an American [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer. Godwin has written 14 novels, two short story collections, three non-fiction books, and ten [[libretti]]. Her primary literary accomplishments are her novels, which have included five best-sellers and three finalists for the [[National Book Award]]. Most of her books are realistic fiction novels that follow a character's psychological and intellectual development, often based on themes taken from Godwin's own life.

Godwin was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], but raised mostly in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] by her mother and grandmother. She adopted her mother's interest in writing at an early age and obtained a Bachelor's degree in journalism from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC). After graduating, she worked briefly as a reporter for ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', then traveled to Europe and worked for the [[U.S. Travel Service]] run by the [[Embassy of the United States in London|U.S. Embassy in London]]. She returned to the U.S. after six years. Godwin taught English at the [[University of Iowa]], while earning her M.A. (1968) and PhD (1971) in [[English Literature]].

While at the University of Iowa, Godwin's dissertation became her first novel, ''The Perfectionists''. By 1976 she had become a successful writer and author of three books. In particular, two books written by her in the 1980s, ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' (1982) and ''A Southern Family'' (1987), resulted in further acclaim and expanded the readership of her books. Following ''The Finishing School'' (1984), readership of her books dramatically declined until 2006, when ''Queen of the Underworld'' was published. ''Flora'' (2013) became one of her more commercially successful novels.

Godwin's grandmother filled the traditional role of a mother, cleaning, cooking and sewing, while her mother was the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Godwin's mother had a Bachelor's and master's degree from [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. She taught college-level English in the mornings, and worked as a reporter for a local paper, ''[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]'', in the evenings. On the weekends she wrote love stories for magazines in New York.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; According to Godwin, growing up with two female guardians had an influence on her writing and her decision to become a writer.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; By age five she had started identifying with her mother's occupation as a writer more so than her grandmother's work.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; At nine years old Godwin wrote her first story, titled "Ollie McGonnigle".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning 1993 p. 259"&gt;{{cite book | last=Manning | first=C.S. | title=The Female Tradition in Southern Literature | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-252-06444-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eo8J0NELAhkC&amp;pg=PA259 | accessdate=October 28, 2015 | page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gail Godwin (age 13) with Mother Kathleen Cole.jpg|thumb|right|Gail Godwin at age 13 with her mother]]In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a [[World War II]] veteran, and moved the family to Virginia.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; Godwin was further inspired by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; According to Godwin, much of her time growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Brown|title=Coming Home|newspaper=The Ashville Citizen|date=October 21, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not.&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"/&gt; As Cole's salary increased and he was able to support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

In Godwin's late teens, her stepfather was working as a salesman and the family moved often. Godwin attended several different high schools,&lt;ref name="HISTORY.com 1937"&gt;{{cite web | title=Novelist Gail Godwin is born - Jun 18, 1937 | website=HISTORY.com | date=June 18, 1937 | url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/novelist-gail-godwin-is-born | accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an all-girls Catholic school, [[Carolina Day School|St. Genevieve-of-the-Pines]].&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; It was Godwin's favorite teacher at St. Genevieve-of-the-Pines who persuaded her to start keeping a personal diary.&lt;ref name="Schwabe 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Schwabe | first=Liesl | title=Past, Present: Gail Godwin | website=PublishersWeekly.com | date=March 22, 2013 | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/56477-past-present-gail-godwin.html | accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Godwin, she had a "church upbringing or convent school training."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Spiritual Life: Perspectives from Poets, Prophets, and Preachers|first=Gail|last=Godwin|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended church at St. Mary's and All Souls.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt; She also wrote a short novel as a teenager.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Godwin had no relationship with her father, until the two re-connected at her high school graduation.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Godwin's father then offered to pay for her college education.&lt;ref name="HISTORY.com 1937"/&gt; During her junior year in college, Godwin moved in with her father, who committed suicide later that year.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"&gt;{{cite book | last=Champion | first=L. | last2=Austin | first2=R. | title=Contemporary American Women Fiction Writers: An A-to-Z Guide | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-313-31627-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FGahwDJFu4C&amp;pg=PA102 | accessdate=August 20, 2015 | pages=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's uncle{{efn|Her uncle's obituary says he died in the hospital after suffering a stroke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=William I.

Godwin attended [[William Peace University|Peace College]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] from 1955 to 1957. She then transferred to [[University of North Carolina]] (UNC), where she attended from 1957 to 1959, graduating with a bachelor's degree in journalism.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; While in college she worked on ''The Otherwise Virgins'', a novel her mother had written, but was unable to find a publisher for.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; In 1959 Knopf sent an agent to UNC to scout young writers. Godwin submitted a portion of her novel ''Windy Peaks'' for their consideration. The story was about the staff and guests at a resort hotel in the mountains.

==Early work==
Godwin's first job out of college was at ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', where she worked as a journalist for one year. There she met and briefly married photographer and co-worker, Douglas Kennedy.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; They were married in 1960 and divorced several months later in 1961.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; According to Godwin, she "worked very hard", but her stories were too "flamboyant" for the publication and she was fired.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; According to ''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', she was incorporating too much human interest into the paper's stories, which were supposed to be factual.&lt;ref name="twothousand"/&gt; After briefly living with her mother again,&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; Godwin moved to London to distance herself from a failed marriage and job.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Clef to the Roman|date=March 5, 2006|first=Liesl|last=Schillinger|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/books/review/05schillinger.html?n=Top%2FFeatures%2FBooks%2FBook%20Reviews&amp;_r=0|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London Godwin worked for the [[U.S. Travel Service]] run by the American [[embassy]]&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; from 1961 to 1965.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; Godwin said she was a "glorified receptionist," who was able to read books in secret while at work.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; Her cousin, who was the mayor of [[Weaverville, North Carolina]], helped to get her the job.&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; While she was employed by the embassy, Godwin completed a novel entitled ''Gull Key''. Like many of her early works, the book focuses on a female character figuring out if marriage and being a parent is the life she wants for herself. Several publishers rejected the novel and the manuscript was lost when Godwin sent the only copy to a publisher that went out of business without returning it.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt;

While in England, Godwin took a course in creative writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; They were married two months later.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; The marriage was brief and they were divorced in 1966.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Flora | first1 =Joseph|last2=Bain|first2=Robert | authorlink = | title =Contemporary Fiction Writers of the South| publisher =Greenwood | date = August 23, 1993 | location = | pages =193–201| isbn = 978-0-313-28764-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; After their breakup, Godwin returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; At age 29, she took a job as fact-checker in [[New York City]] for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. She said the job was embarrassing, because she wanted to be a writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;

At this point, a distant uncle of Godwin's died, leaving her an inheritance of $5,000.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite news|date=October 16, 1994|newspaper=The Charlotte Observer|title=Love and Order|first=Dannye|last=Powell}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used the money to apply to the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]] and, after being accepted, to move from New York to [[Iowa City]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; There Godwin met her teacher and future mentor [[Kurt Vonnegut]].&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; At Iowa, Godwin worked as an instructor while earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from the same university in 1968 and 1971 respectively.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twothousand"/&gt; She began teaching [[Greek Drama]], before earning a position teaching literature.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; By age 30, Godwin had written three novels, but was unable to get any of them published.&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"/&gt;

==Author==

===Early published work===
According to ''The Asheville Citizen-Times'', Godwin's first successful work was a 1969 short story in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; Her first published novel was her [[dissertation]] written as graduate work at University of Iowa. It was published in 1970 and called ''The Perfectionists''.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; The story was based loosely on Godwin's second marriage. It was accepted by [[Harper &amp; Row]] in December 1968,&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"/&gt; while Godwin completing her graduate work.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; From 1971 on, Godwin earned a living through her work as a writer and augmented her income by means of intermittent teaching positions.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

[[File:Gail &amp; Robert's Woodstock House.jpg|thumb|right|The house in Woodstock, New York, where Godwin completed many of her books]]After completing her graduate work in 1971, Godwin spent two months at the [[Yaddo#Artists.27 colony|Yaddo artist's colony]] in Upstate New York in 1972. There she wrote 100 pages of a novel called ''The Villain'', which was never published. The work was scrapped, but ended up being part of the basis for ''The Odd Woman''.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; According to author Jane Hill, it was while working on ''The Odd Women'' that Godwin transitioned from linear narratives to more complex structures where the plot interweaves past and present events.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

It was at Yaddo that Godwin met composer Robert Starer and began a life partnership with him that lasted until his death in 2001.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt; They moved to [[Stone Ridge, New York]] in 1973&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; and later built a house in [[Woodstock, New York]], where Godwin continued her work from home.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt; In addition to her books and short stories, Godwin wrote [[libretti]] for ten of Starer's musical compositions.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

===Height of Godwin's career===
By 1976 Godwin was a successful writer and novelist who had published three books: ''The Perfectionists'', ''Glass People'', and ''The Odd Woman''.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt; ''The Odd Woman'' was the longest and most widely recognized of the three.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; Several short stories by Godwin were published in prominent magazines like Harper's Esquire, [[Ms.]] and the [[Paris Review]], where she was often featured on the cover.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Charlotte Observer|date=February 20, 1976|title=Gail Godwin: She's a Writer at the Core}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was awarded grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (1975–76) and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] (1975–76).&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Throughout her career, Godwin worked consistently with her agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=February 15, 1999|title=The Good Husband}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's early books were published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]].&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt; After the editor for ''The Perfectionists'', David Segal, died suddenly of a heart attack, [[Robert Gottlieb]] from Knopf became her editor for her next four books.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Godwin credits Gottlieb for much of the success of her early works.&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"/&gt; Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, ''USA Today'' commented that this could be in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb.&lt;ref name="Godwin 2015"/&gt; After Knopf, Godwin contracted with [[Viking]], who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkusone"&gt;{{cite web | last=Godwin | first=Gail | website=Kirkus Reviews | date=November 1, 2014 | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gail-godwin/publishing/ | title=Publishing|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years 1982 to 1991, Godwin produced another collection of short fiction and four more novels.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; According to ''Publishers Weekly'', it was ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' (1982) and ''A Southern Family'' (1987) that substantially expanded her readership. These novels remained on bestseller lists for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gail Godwin: A Leap of Faith in a New Novel|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=February 15, 1999|first=John|last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's earlier works had sold an average of less than 8,000 copies, while ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' sold more than 1.5 million.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; It was the most popular of Godwin's early works&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; and the first time she had written a narrative from the point-of-view of multiple characters.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alpha"/&gt; In 1987, Godwin was awarded the [[Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize]] for her work on ''The Southern Family''.&lt;ref name="University of Rochester"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kafka Recipients : Susan B.

[[File:Gail Godwin at Pawley's Island Writing The Finishing School (1983).jpg|thumb|left|Gail Godwin writing ''The Finishing School'' on a typewriter in 1983.]]According to ''Publishers Weekly'', Godwin had "achieved a huge degree of success" and still had many devoted readers, but by 1999 she was "no longer the draw she once was."&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt; By 2006 ''The Finishing School'' (1984) was her last major, commercially successful book, which was followed by a drop in readership.&lt;ref name="Godwin 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Godwin | first=Gail | title=Gail Godwin Recalls Her Years in 'Publishing' | website=USA TODAY | date=January 17, 2015 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2015/01/17/publishing-a-writers-memoir/21802343/ | accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes 2006"/&gt; According to Godwin, she was "one of the many authors to be caught in the tumult while [the publishing industry] thrashed about in search of a new business model."&lt;ref name="Kirkusone"/&gt; ''The Los Angeles Times'' said her characters that were progressive working women in the 1970s and 1980s, were now considered "tame" in a modern context.&lt;ref name="latimes 2006"&gt;{{cite news| first=Susan|last=Reynolds|title=A Double Dose of Bestseller Gail Godwin | newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=January 24, 2006 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/24/entertainment/et-godwin24 | accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kirkus Reviews'' said Godwin had "a couple of subpar efforts," until publishing ''Queen of the Underworld'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="Narrative Magazine 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Godwin | first=Gail | website=Kirkus Reviews | date=November 1, 2014 | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gail-godwin/unfinished-desires/ | accessdate=September 18, 2015|title=Unfinished Desires}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flora'' (2013) became one of her better selling books.&lt;ref name="Wood 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wood | first=Lucy | title=What's Essential | website=Kirkus Reviews | date=November 1, 2014 | url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/whats-essential/ | accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin also authored an autobiography, ''Publishing'' that appeared in 2015.&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"/&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' said her auto-biography was a "preemptive strike" after she was approached by an independent biographer.&lt;ref name="latimes 2006"/&gt; As of 2015, Godwin's published works have included 14 novels, two collections of short stories, three non-fiction works, and ten libretti.&lt;ref name="Smith 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Smith | first=Dinitia | title=For Gail Godwin, the Prose Was the Easy Part | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=January 26, 2015 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-publishing-by-gail-godwin-1422316084 | accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia and other work===
According to ''The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature'', Godwin was unusual in that she was a popular novelist that was also working in academia.&lt;ref name="Powell 2012 p. 178"/&gt; Godwin taught at the [[University of Illinois]] Center for Advanced Studies from 1971 to 1972.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gail Godwin and Friends to Get Together|first=Rick|last=Gunter|newspaper=The Asheville Citizen|date=September 30, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time as an author, she was also a lecturer at the Iowa Writers' Workshop (1972 to 1973), [[Vassar College]] (1977), and [[Columbia University]] (1978/1981).&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2012 p. 178"/&gt; She acted as chair of the fiction panel for the [[National Book Awards]] in 1986&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; and 2008.&lt;ref name="National Book Foundation, Presenter of the National Book Awards, www.nationalbook.org"&gt;{{cite web | title=2008 National Book Awards Winners and Finalists, The National Book Foundation | website=National Book Foundation, Presenter of the National Book Awards, www.nationalbook.org | url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2008#.VehinZ1VhHw | accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Godwin also founded a small publishing house called St. Hilda's Press. It published religious texts not printed by more commercialized publishers.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt; She later became a Distinguished Alumna of the University of North Carolina and the University of Iowa.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

==Themes==
Most of Godwin's works are based on themes or events taken from her own life.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; The characters, settings and narratives vary from novel-to-novel, but common topics have included family, the position of women in society and relationships, a woman's artistic and career pursuits, and the role of religious faith.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; According to ''The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature'', Godwin's characters "struggle intellectually to navigate the mazes of race, class, gender, family, faith and religion."&lt;ref name="Powell 2012 p. 178"&gt;{{cite book | last=Powell | first=T. | title=The Intellectual in Twentieth-century Southern Literature | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | series=Southern literary studies | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8071-3898-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjnl_fyIt88C&amp;pg=PA178 | accessdate=September 18, 2015 | page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', "she writes about issues pertaining to women - male-female roles, marriage, family, personal freedom, self-concept, and self-actualization."&lt;ref name="twothousand"/&gt; Author Jane Hill said Godwin's books are about co-existing with authorities, the role of decision-making in life, careers as an artist, and the consequences of thwarted ambition.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; Much of her emphasis is on the concept of the self&lt;ref name="alpha"&gt;{{cite book | last=Xie | first=Lihong | title=The Evolving Self in the Novels of Gail Godwin | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | series=Southern literary studies | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-8071-1924-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTOD5-XkaJoC&amp;pg=PA32 | accessdate=August 19, 2015 | page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one's struggles with society.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

Most of the academic analysis of Godwin's work focuses on challenges her characters have as women.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; According to ''Contemporary Fiction Writers of the South'', a typical protagonist in Godwin's novels is a young woman that "in search of herself, confronts obstacles caused by her family, her lovers, her husband, or her own inanition as she struggles to establish her independence and secure her identity through her work."&lt;ref name="Flora 1993 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Flora | first=Joseph | title=Contemporary fiction writers of the South : a bio-bibliographical sourcebook | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, Conn | year=1993 | isbn=0-313-28764-3 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character may be personally flawed, then achieve self-reflection or personal growth thanks to the support of their community or a mentor.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Main characters often make poor choices, but become a better person, learn to make better decisions and build stronger bonds often as a result of intellectual pursuits.&lt;ref name="Powell 2012 p. 178"/&gt; According to critic Anne Cheney, the protagonist may be "searching for happiness, academic or artistic achievement, love, respect, or, more generally, meaning in life."&lt;ref name="Emerick 2001 pp. 134–145"/&gt;

According to [[Warren French]] from the [[University of Wales]], Godwin's works are most often seen as having two primary themes: gender roles and southern settings. French said Godwin herself disapproves of being categorized, which she feels creates "externally imposed limitations" on the themes she covers.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; However scholars continue to attempt to put her work into a distinctive literary category.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; In her early works Godwin was seen as a "woman" writer, because her books appealed to a mostly female audience and because she is a woman.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; After publishing ''A Southern Family'' she began being identified as a southern writer.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2012 p. 178"/&gt; According to ''[[The Times]]'' (London), Godwin has a "pesky resistance to categorisation" and she often changes themes even after being commercially successful with one.&lt;ref name="Katsoulis 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Katsoulis | first=Melissa | title=Flora: A Novel by Gail Godwin | website=The Times | date=July 20, 2013 | url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/fiction/article3820012.ece | accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Lihong Xie said Godwin could be identified with the literary tradition of the [[Bildungsroman]], which focuses on the moral and psychological development of a character.&lt;ref name="LSU Press"&gt;{{cite web | title=The History of Southern Women's Literature | website=LSU Press |first1=Carolyn|last1=Perry|first2=Mary|last2=Weaks-Baxter| url=http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-history-of-southern-women-s-literature/ | accessdate=August 25, 2015|pages=545–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other critics posit that a quest for meaning and self-identification are Godwin's primary themes.&lt;ref name="Emerick 2001 pp. 134–145"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Emerick | first=Ron | title=Theo and the Road to Sainthood in Gail Godwin | journal=The Southern Literary Journal | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | volume=33 | issue=2 | year=2001 | pages=134–145 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/slj.2001.0004 | doi=10.1353/slj.2001.0004 | accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other themes in Godwin's work have included escaping the cultural expectations of becoming a "southern lady,"&lt;ref name="Kissel 1996 p. "/&gt; childhood abandonment,&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Woman Searches for the True Clear Light in a Multi-Hued World|newspaper=The News &amp; Observer|date=March 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; depression and suicide,&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; racial discrimination, social class&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; and succeeding without a male companion.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Her work has spanned different literary categories, such as realism, fantasy and allegory.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chithraleka |first=D. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1, 2007 |url=http://worldlitonline.net/jan-07/Jan2007_8.pdf|title=The Portrayal of Women in the Novels of Gail Godwin |journal=The Indian Review of World Literature in English |publisher= |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
All of Godwin's books written from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life.&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Matuz | first=Roger | title=Contemporary Southern Writers | publisher=St. James Press | location=Detroit | year=1999 | isbn=1-55862-370-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early works focus on women hoping for a relationship with a male companion, but at the same time wanting independence and freedom.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt; The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt; and patriarchy.&lt;ref name="alpha"/&gt; Most of Godwin's early works include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

Her first three books, ''The Perfectionists'' (1970), ''Glass People'' (1972) and ''The Odd Woman'' (1974), have protagonists who find that their relationship with a male companion restricts their personal and professional development.&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "/&gt; The first two books are each about a female character who feels trapped in an unhappy marriage.&lt;ref name="Flora 2006 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Flora | first=Joseph | title=Southern Writers a New Biographical Dictionary | publisher=Louisiana State University Press | location=Baton Rouge | year=2006 | isbn=0-8071-3123-7 | page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Contemporary Southern Writers'', "unlike fairy tale romances, these novels present a realistic depiction of feminist concerns and struggles."&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "/&gt; Lihong Xie comments that Godwin's protagonists are southern women that "caught between the ideal of southern womanhood and contemporary feminism, struggle to form a personal identity&amp;nbsp; ..."&lt;ref name="LSU Press"/&gt;

''Violet Clay'' (1978) and ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' (1982) are each about an unmarried protagonist's career in a creative profession.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite news|title=Novelist Gail Godwin Takes up Story of a Woman's Spiritual Quest|first=Dale|last=Neal|newspaper=Asheville Citizen-Times|date=March 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flora 2006 p. "/&gt; In ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' the main character resists the temptation to get married and chooses instead to focus on her work.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; ''A Mother and Two Daughters'' and ''A Southern Family'' (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

In Godwin's early books, the female protagonists tend to be fearful, passive and repeat their mistakes.&lt;ref name="Kissel 1996 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Kissel | first=Susan | title=Moving on : The Heroines of Shirley Ann Grau, Anne Tyler, and Gail Godwin | publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press | location=Bowling Green, OH | year=1996 | isbn=0-87972-712-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist is often depicted as a victim who has failed to achieve independence and is struggling to form a personal identity that could exist beyond that of their relationship with a male companion.&lt;ref name="LSU Press"/&gt; In her next books, Godwin begins to introduce stronger and more independent central characters.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; ''Violet Clay'' (1978) for example, features a more assertive character than those in prior novels.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; According to Susan S. Kissel Adams from [[Northern Kentucky University]], Godwin's later characters:&lt;ref name="Kissel 1996 p. "/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;come to value inclusion and connection over exclusion and isolation in their lives. They seek ways to combine their private and their public selves, open and extend family structures, take political action, and fulfill their social responsibilities&amp;nbsp; ... In their struggle against southern codes and family structures that retain a powerful hold even in the late twentieth century. Godwin's daughters of the South grow from a state of dependency and arrested development: they begin to embark on mature, adult lives of their own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later works===
As in her earlier novels, Godwin's work in the 1970s and 1980s still centers mostly on difficulties female characters experienced as women.&lt;ref name="Flora 2006 p. "/&gt; However, she departs from this theme in ''The Finishing School'' (1984), which is about two women of different generations and the student-mentor relationship between them, rather than their relationship with men.&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "/&gt; According to Lihong Xie, Godwin's work during this period continues to be about "the female self" and a woman's intimate relationships with husbands, fathers and God.&lt;ref name="LSU Press"/&gt;

Godwin's books begin to incorporate religious themes starting with ''Father Melancholy's Daughter'' (1991). The novel is told from the perspective of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion.&lt;ref name="Emerick 2001 pp. 134–145"/&gt; ''Father Melancholy's Daughter'' was followed by several books that centered on the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels.&lt;ref name="twelve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flora 2006 p. "/&gt; Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life,&lt;ref name="Kissel 1996 p. "/&gt; or as a subject of intellectual interest.&lt;ref name="Emerick 2001 pp. 134–145"/&gt; During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.&lt;ref name="Kissel 1996 p. "/&gt;

According to ''Narrative Magazine'', Godwin transitions from female protagonists who are "looking for ways to get out of traps and confinements" to those who make "interesting or dangerous life choices."&lt;ref name="Narrative Magazine 2009"/&gt; Some of Godwin's later works depict successful, but unconventional marriages. In ''The Good Husband'' (1994) both partners accept the wife's career as having a priority over the husband's.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; ''The Good Husband'' is also a return to the theme of marriage that is typical of some of Godwin's earlier works.&lt;ref name="twothousand"/&gt; According to ''Contemporary Southern Writers'', ''The Good Husband'' "explores the dying experience."&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "/&gt; Godwin also published several non-fiction works based on her own life during this period.&lt;ref name="Narrative Magazine 2009"/&gt;

Godwin's short story collections ''Dream Children'' and ''Mr. Bedford and the Muses'' focus on themes similar to those in her novels, but also incorporate dreams and myth.&lt;ref name="Matuz 1999 p. "/&gt; They tend to be less auto-biographical than her novels.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; According to philosopher [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], Godwin's approach to dream-worlds is radical, because the dream is incorporated into the characters' real-world experiences. Her characters compare their real and dream worlds to each other in order to "negotiate their sense of destiny." She said ''Dream Children'' challenges the distinction between reality and dream experiences, where the dream does not "violate one's theory of reality."&lt;ref name="springerone"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tymieniecka |first=Anna-Teresa |date=2009 |title=Existence, Historical Fabulation, Destiny |url=  |publisher=Springer  |isbn=978-1-4020-9801-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 18, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[USA Today]]'' said that the subjects covered in ''Unfinished Desires'' (2010) include "Mean girls. Lesbian kisses. Learning disabilities. Domestic violence. Alcoholism. [and] Roman Catholic nuns."&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title=Godwin's 'Unfinished Desires' is only halfway done | website=USA TODAY | date=June 28, 2013 |first=Deirdre|last=Donahue|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/godwins-unfinished-desires-is-only-halfway-done/2469473/ | accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Times'' (London), ''Flora'' (2013) "encompasses most of the themes that have preoccupied [Godwin] throughout her career." It takes place in the South in the mid-1940s in the mountains, where a widowed schoolmaster raises his ten-year-old daughter.&lt;ref name="Katsoulis 2013"/&gt; In a 2015 interview, Godwin says that her work has become less "angry". She said her early works showed a frustration with not being heard, and that her later books focuses on her enemies. Now she's working to understand "the villains' villains."&lt;ref name="Piepenbring 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Piepenbring | first=Dan | title=People and Rooms: An Interview with Gail Godwin | website=The Paris Review | date=April 10, 2015 | url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/04/10/people-and-rooms-an-interview-with-gail-godwin/ | accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
By 1980 Godwin's writing had become the subject of essays, book chapters and other literary analysis from academic critics.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "Gail Godwin has been accused of not being able to decide whether she's a popular or a literary writer, but she's certainly accrued enough bestsellers and literary honors to claim both identities."&lt;ref name="Sayers 2010"&gt;{{cite web | last=Sayers | first=Valerie | title=Book World reviews Gail Godwin's 'Unfinished Desires' | website=Washington Post | date=January 19, 2010 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/18/AR2010011803350.html | accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the scholarly attention on her works comes from those critics with an interest in southern or feminist authors.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; According to ''Contemporary Fiction Writers of the South'', Godwin's books have been "widely and favorably reviewed".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; ''Contemporary American Women Fiction Writers'' states that "although some reviews of her work have been mixed&amp;nbsp; ... her books are accomplished works of fiction, if not masterpieces."&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt;

''Contemporary Literary Criticism'' said "most of her books are characterized as well-written, well executed, readable, witty, and having vivid, believable characters.&lt;ref name="twothousand"&gt;{{cite book | last=White | first=Tim | title=Contemporary Literary Criticism | publisher=Cengage Gale | location=Farmington Hills | year=2000 | isbn=0-7876-3200-7 | pages=115–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin is typically praised for having convincing plots,&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; witty, intelligent characters and that she has strong narrative skill.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; She has been criticized, in particular in response to ''The Good Husband'', for excessive symbolism.&lt;ref name="ChampionAustin"/&gt; According to the ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', Godwin is "thoughtful and philosophical", but she is often critiqued for authoring fiction that is so closely representative of her own life.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

''The Odd Woman'', ''The Finishing School'' and ''Southern Family'' received overall positive reviews, while ''Violet Clay'' and ''The Good Husband'' received more negative reviews.&lt;ref name="twothousand"/&gt; According to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''Flora'' was one of Godwin's best books.&lt;ref name="Miner 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Miner | first=Valerie | title='Flora' by Gail Godwin | website=BostonGlobe.com | date=May 5, 2013 | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/05/04/book-review-flora-gail-godwin/7aMXFUQF1CvbZHxjYnFdzL/story.html | accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educating about genocide in Rwanda ==
Recent Rwanda history curricula explicitly stipulate the teaching of the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide of the Tutsi]], notably through the comparison "of different genocides" with a view to "suggest ways of preventing genocide from happening again in Rwanda and elsewhere". A comparative approach has been adopted, which is clearly reflected in the 2015 Curriculum for [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The competence-based curriculum framework mentions "[[genocide studies]]" as a cross-cutting issue, therefore introducing the study of genocide in a variety of subject areas. It further states that "Rwandan children should know about the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi alongside the Holocaust and other genocides".&lt;ref&gt;Rwanda Education Board. 2015. Competence based curriculum: Curriculum framework pre-primary to upper secondary. Ministry of Education, Republic of Rwanda. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.tcop.rw/&lt;/nowiki&gt; le/2041/download?token=T398Bm6a&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching about the 1994 genocide of the [[Tutsi]] in Rwanda, and thereby introducing genocide studies in history textbooks and curricula, has been part of a gradual process to promote national unity and peace. This process included a moratorium on some chapters of Rwandan history in 1995, which ended when considerations pertaining to the 1994 genocide were introduced into the 2008 history curriculum. Recent approaches also built on the acknowledgement of the disastrous effects of pre-genocide Rwandan education, which contributed to discrimination against the Tutsi population and constituted a backdrop for the ideology that led to the genocide. In contrast, introducing the history of the genocide in the education system was a recognition that schools, in addition to non-formal and informal learning environments, are crucial venues to impart knowledge about the genocide and to overcome silence, denial and conflict. These changes also correspond to a deeper reflection on appropriate pedagogies to help learners grapple with the legacy of the genocide. According to Jean-Damascène Gasanabo, director-general of the Research and Documentation Center on Genocide at the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide (CNLG) in Kigali, "This change in the curriculum has been supplemented by a shift to transform learning from one based on standard rote memorization to one that encourages discussion and a spirit of critical thinking and analysis. This approach identi es the student as an active participant in the learning experience, not merely a silent recipient of history as 'evangelical speech'."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Aegis Trusts Education about the Holocaust.svg|thumb|Aegis Trust's Sustainable Peace Model/Framework]]
The [[Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre|Kigali Genocide Memorial]] and [[Aegis Trust]], in partnership with other Rwandan organizations such as the Educators' Institute for Human Rights, has developed education programmes and in-service training to help teachers build capacity and acquire historical knowledge to deal with genocides and mass atrocities. Such programmes emphasize "critical thinking, empathy and individual moral responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Gasanabo, J.D., Mutanguha, F. and Mpayimana, A.. 2016. Teaching about the Holocaust and Genocide in Rwanda. Contemporary Review of the Middle East. Special Issue: Holocaust Education, Volume 3, Issue 3, pp. 329-345. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347798916654583&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They explore historical examples, primarily the genocide of the Jewish people and the genocide of the Tutsi, through a "Sustainable Peace Model/Framework" which seeks to link genocide education (looking back) to genocide prevention (looking into the present) to peace-building (looking forward).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education about the Holocaust ==
{{Main|Education about the Holocaust}}

"Genocide education" deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. [[Genocide studies]] – referring to academic research about the broader trends and patterns of genocide and mass atrocities – and genocide education have become more widespread in universities and schools, as genocide and mass atrocities are recurring phenomena in the world. The studies have expanded to examine theories about how and why genocide happens. Education about the particular event of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] includes considerations about the concept, planning and implementation of that genocide, and can prompt reflections as to how what we learn about the Holocaust can contribute to the prevention of mass atrocities today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The role of gender ==
Scholars and educators are increasingly recognizing and exploring gender as a dimension of genocide and other mass atrocities. Educators may wish to consider how gender influences, affects, and manifests itself in genocide, from the strategies of its perpetrators to the experiences of its victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, most atrocities have been committed by men. Genocide scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], however, notes that "when women, along with men, are mobilized, forced, encouraged, allowed to participate in genocide and other atrocious violence, they generally display no more reluctance than (often reluctant) males". [[Wendy Lower]], for example, studied the role of German women during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and found that relative to their role in German society and their professional positions, women participated in the perpetration of crimes "as zealous administrators, robbers, tormentors, and murderers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. 2017. Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction, 3rd edition, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lower, W. 2013. Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, Houghton Mi in Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gender can shape and dictate both the experiences of victims and the methods perpetrators employ when committing genocide and mass atrocities. Roles often relegated to the female sphere can influence the fates of women. As traditional caregivers, for example, women who provide direct care for children or elderly relatives may inadvertently hinder or eliminate their own ability to survive genocidal violence. At the same time, perpetrators often differently persecute men and women. During the Holocaust, pregnant women and mothers of small children were consistently labeled "incapable of work". Consequently, women often found themselves among the  first sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "Women during the Holocaust," &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005176&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressors' intent on a symbolic and physical disruption of group reproduction often target women and girls for sexualized violence, such as mass rape or forced sterilization. Cases also exist in which boys and men have been systematically sexually victimized. Transgressions of gender norms such as homosexuality and transsexuality have also served as grounds for the targeting of both men and women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term '''global village''' represents the [[approximation|simplifying]] of the whole world into one village through the use of [[electronic media]]. ''Global village'' is also a term to express the constituting relationship between [[socioeconomics|economics and other social sciences]] throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian [[media theorist]], [[Marshall McLuhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "Global Village" as it is. According to M. McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a Joyce scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term.

McLuhan described how electric technology  has contracted the globe into a village&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media''. (Gingko Press, 1964, 2003) p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the instantaneous movement of information from every quarter to every point at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Letters of Marshall McLuhan''. (Oxford University Press, 1987) p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview ==

Marshall McLuhan, who was a Canadian philosopher, invented the word in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Golovine |first1=Mila |title=Global Village: Where Cultures Connect |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mila-golovine/global-village-where-cult_b_5035779.html |website=Huffingtonpost.com |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan based his concept on the idea that cultures would focus on communicating and move towards personal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Beth |title=Marshall McLuhan &amp; the Global Village Concept |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/marshall-mcluhan-the-global-village-concept.html |website=study.com |publisher=study.com |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The term global village means different parts of the world that form one community that’s linked by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'global village' |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/global-village |website=Collins dictionary |publisher=Collins dictionary |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of communication such as Skype allow us to communicate and connect with others, especially others in other countries, easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yew |first1=Lee |title=The World Is Truly A Global Village |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2012/0326/current-events-singapore-world-truly-global-village-lee-kuan-yew.html#1b4fc3187fc4 |website=forbes.com |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The new reality of the [[digital age]] has implications for forming new socially meaningful structures within the context of [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential McLuhan|last=Mcluhan|first=Eric|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-465-01995-1|location=Concord, Ont. : Anansi|pages=7–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging messages, stories, opinions, posts, and videos through channels on telecommunication pathways can cause miscommunication-- especially through different cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720608000153|title=Cultural diversity and information and communication technology impacts on global virtual teams|last=Shachaf|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.12.003|volume=45|journal=Information &amp; Management|pages=131–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary analysts question the causes of changes in community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often they speculate about whether or not the consequences of these changes could lead to some new sociological structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of them have pointed out that the increased velocity of transactions has fostered international density, making [[social network]]s a catalyst for [[social change]].

Across the global village people have reached out and transcended their neighborhoods. They are involved in a complex community of networks stretching across cities, nations, oceans, and governments. Yet at the same time the increasing communications with friends on [[social media]] may also increase the density of interconnections within already existing social clusters. The global village's implications on sociological structures are yet to be fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Network Community: An Introduction to Networks and Global Village'', By: Barry Wellman&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does multimedia have the ability to impact individuals differently for cultural reasons, but messages also affect people due to their religion, politics, beliefs, business, money etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The time in which messages are received also affects how a message is understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Marshall McLuhan’s time, the global village was already apparent. It was already a comprehensive and seminal way to grasp what was happening to the world at large at any time (and correspondingly, what should be done with this in mind): "The global village absolutely ensures maximal disagreement on all points" (McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool. New York: The New American Library, p.&amp;nbsp;272).

During the primitive years, people primarily stayed in tune with the simultaneous mode of their perception and thinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today human society struggles neurologically, with the simultaneous mode taking the upper hand once again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Our brains are constantly adapting and morphing to the modifications of [[technological advancement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through technology, the creation of social media allows people to constantly comment on each other's posts as well as creating them to share with the multi-media global world. 55% of teens possess a social media account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/|title=Center for Media Literacy|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has connected people with jobs that they couldn’t have received before because of their geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediacritiques.net|title=Journal of Media Critiques [JMC]|website=www.mediacritiques.net|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social medias have connected the world so that users can learn more about cultures different from their own through interactions on social media as well as maintaining relationships from opposing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebecca|first=Sawyer,|date=2011-01-01|title=The Impact of New Social Media on Intercultural Adaptation|url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/242/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global village and media ==
People use technology to fit into a [[digital community]] to which they aren't physically connected, but mentally connected. Each [[social media platform]] acts as a digital home for individuals, allowing people to express themselves through the global village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A Review of General Semantics argues that media ecology and new media have expanded who has the ability to create and view media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valcanis|first=Tom|date=|year=2011|title=An iPhone in Every Hand: Media Ecology, Communication Structures, and the Global Village|url=|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=68|pages=33–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mass media began, it has called for the westernization of the world, hence the global village.  Without the mass media in effect countries like India or Turkey wouldn’t be living [[American way|American lifestyle]] because they wouldn’t have the knowledge of what the acquisitions of the American nation constitute. Since most of the developing countries acquired the news and entertainment from developed nations like the U.S, the information received is biased in favor of developed nations which connects the world in similarities within the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M|first=Kraidy, Marwan|date=2002-01-01|title=Globalization of Culture Through the Media|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/325/|journal=Encyclopedia of Communication and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time communicative activities of people. Social Spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others who share the same interests and concerns. According to McLuhan, the enhanced "electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree." &lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia"&gt;''Understanding Media'', McGraw Hill, 1964, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Increased speed of communication and the ability for people to read about, spread, and react to global news quickly, forces us to become more involved with others from various social groups and countries around the world and to be more aware of our global responsibilities.&lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia" /&gt; Similarly, web-connected computers enable people to link their web sites together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Global theater==
No chapter in ''Understanding Media'', later books, contains the idea that the global village and the electronic media create unified communities. In an interview with Gerald Stearn,&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, Gerald Emmanuel. ''McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool'' (1968), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan says that it never occurred to him that uniformity and tranquility were the properties of the global village. McLuhan argued that the global village ensures maximal disagreement on all points because it creates more discontinuity and division and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] under the increase of the village conditions. The global village is far more diverse.
 
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan starts using the term ''global theater'' to emphasize the changeover from consumer to producer, from acquisition to involvement, from job holding to role playing, stressing that there is no more community to clothe the naked specialist.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall and Nevitt, Barrington. ''From Take Today: The Executive as Dropout'' (Harcourt Brace, 1972) p 265 and back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustave García was born on February 1, 1837 in [[Milan, Italy]], the son of  [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García]] (1805–1906) and the soprano [[Eugénie Mayer]] (1818–1880).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Allan Keiler]] |coauthors= |title=Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey |year= |publisher= |page=74 |quote=Gustave Garcia was the son of Manuel Garcia the younger, the most famous singing teacher of the nineteenth century. ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVi0eYa8GZgC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Gustave+Garcia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nYo2TIf7IIH_8AaYm_SeAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Gustave%20Garcia&amp;f=false |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional début as an operatic baritone in 1860 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London as [[Don Giovanni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Robin May]] |coauthors= |title=A companion to the opera |year=1977  |publisher= |page= |quote= His son Gustave Garcia (1837-1925) was a baritone and teacher who sang at La Scala after making his debut in London ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCelsUA2eTIC&amp;q=Gustave+Garcia+opera&amp;dq=Gustave+Garcia+opera&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Zw2TOiOJoL48AaviO3WAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He married and had a son, baritone [[Alberto García (singer)|Alberto García]] (1875–1946).

Best known in his second career, as a teacher, in 1880 he became a professor of singing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], where he worked till 1890. He also taught at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] from 1883 to 1910, and from 1884 at the [[Royal College of Music]] until his illness and final retirement. His pupils at the Royal College included [[Martyn Green]]. He died on June 12, 1925.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2066">'''Guy Stanton Ford''' (May 9, 1873 – December 29, 1962) was the sixth president of the [[University of Minnesota]]. Ford had originally come to the University of Minnesota in 1913, serving as the dean of the Graduate School and as a professor of history. He became president in 1938 after the sudden death of [[Lotus Coffman]]. He left the University of Minnesota in November 1941 to become the executive secretary of the [[American Historical Association]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and Editor of [[American Historical Review]] (until 1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guy Stanton Ford, 1938-1941|url=http://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/guy-stanton-ford|website=University of Minnesota Office of the President}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford's doctoral thesis ([[Columbia University]], 1903) was entitled ''Hanover and Prussia, 1795–1803. A Study in Neutrality''. Before he went to the University of Minnesota, he  was faculty member of the [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].

The annual [http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/ford/index.html Guy Stanton Ford Memorial Lecture] is a [[public lecture]] by a distinguished scholar in any of many different fields.

'''HawkQuest''', founded in 1986 by Kin Quitugua,&lt;ref name="animal_behaviorists"/&gt; is an environmental education organization based in [[Parker, Colorado|Parker]], [[Colorado]], which uses participatory lectures including live [[bird of prey|raptors]] to help people "understand and appreciate the interaction of wild living things in their natural environment."&lt;ref name="hq_main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hq_about"/&gt;

HawkQuest has partnered with [[Xcel Energy]] to create classroom programs that use the bird cams deployed by the energy company.&lt;ref name="creyete"/&gt;&lt;ref name="birdcam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hq_lessons"/&gt;

==Founder==

Kin Quitugua, master falconer and founder of HawkQuest, was born in [[Guam]] and moved to Colorado with his family when he was young. In college, he met master [[falconry|falconer]] Rick Cole, who took him on as an apprentice. After becoming a master falconer himself, he founded HawkQuest to teach others about nature with the help of his birds.&lt;ref name="animal_behaviorists"/&gt;

==The birds==
As of 2010, HawkQuest had 28 individual [[eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s, [[owl]]s, and [[hawk]]s. The 15 species represented are [[bald eagle]], [[golden eagle]], [[American kestrel]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[prairie falcon]], [[barred owl]], [[burrowing owl]], [[barn owl]], [[great horned owl]], [[spectacled owl]], [[Eurasian eagle-owl]], [[Eastern screech owl]], [[ferruginous hawk]], [[red-tailed hawk]], and [[Harris's hawk]]. All of these birds are either injured or have been imprinted to humans and would not be able to survive in the wild.&lt;ref name="hq_reptors"/&gt;

==Programs==
HawkQuest provides interactive lectures to groups of all ages, bringing the birds to schools,&lt;ref name="apscms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="broomfieldenterprise"/&gt; nature centers,&lt;ref name="cbs4denver"/&gt; and other venues.&lt;ref name="bbhc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steamboat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wild_bird_landing"/&gt; HawkQuest raptors can be seen at close range at events such as Native American markets, renaissance festivals, educational symposiums, and craft fairs.&lt;ref name="grapevinesun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hq_events"/&gt; Their classroom-in-the-wild program takes students outdoors into the birds' natural environment.&lt;ref name="hq_programs"/&gt; They will set up opportunities for bird and photo enthusiasts to photograph the raptors in the wild.&lt;ref name="photo_op"/&gt;

In 2007, HawkQuest presented their message to almost 1.5 million people in 555 events.&lt;ref name="hq_event_stats"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16099">[[File:Hen - The Swedish pronoun.svg|thumb|Visual illustration of the two gendered pronouns and ''hen'' by merged [[gender symbol]]s]]
'''''Hen''''' ({{IPA-sv|hɛn:|lang|Sv-hen.ogg}}) is a [[gender-neutral pronoun|gender-neutral personal pronoun]] in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] intended as an alternative to the gender-specific ''hon'' ("she") and ''han'' ("he"). It can be used when the gender of a person is not known or when it is not desirable to specify them as either a "she" or "he". The word was first proposed in 1966, and again in 1994, with reference to the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''hän'', a [[personal pronoun]] that is gender-neutral, since Finnish does not have [[grammatical gender]]s. However, it did not receive widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some books, magazines and newspapers, and provoked media debates and controversy over [[feminism]], [[gender neutrality]], and [[parenting]]. In July 2014 it was announced that ''hen'' would be included in ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'', the official [[glossary]] of the [[Swedish Academy]].

It is currently treated as a [[neologism]] by Swedish [[manual of style|manuals of style]]. Major newspapers like ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The [[Swedish Language Council]] has not issued any specific proscriptions against the use of ''hen'', but recommends the inflected forms ''hens'' ("her(s)/his") as the possessive form and the object form ''hen'' ("her/him") over ''henom'', which also occurs. ''Hen'' has two basic usages: as a way to avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who are [[agender]], [[genderqueer]], or those who reject the notion of binary gender on ideological grounds.

== Linguistic background ==
[[File:Gender in Pronouns.png|thumb|right|350px|Map illustrating the prevalence of gendered pronouns across world languages]]
The [[Swedish language]] has a set of [[personal pronoun]]s which is more or less identical in form to that of [[English language|English]]. The common pronouns used for human beings are either ''han'' ("he") or ''hon'' ("she"). While [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] historically had the same set of three [[grammatical gender]]s as modern [[German language|German]], with masculine, feminine and neuter, the three-gender system fell out of use from the dialects out of which the respective [[standard language]]s were developing sometime in the late Middle Ages. The system contracted so that words of masculine and feminine gender folded into a ''common gender'' while the neuter gender remained. In Swedish, there are two words that would translate to the English pronoun "it": ''den'' for common gender words and ''det'' for neuter gender words. Both are gender-neutral in the sense of not referring to male or female, but they are not used to refer to human beings except in specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (1996), pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of usage==
Attempts to introduce ''hen'' as a gender-neutral pronoun date back to 1966 when linguist Rolf Dunås suggested it in the regional newspaper ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]''. In 1994, it was again proposed by linguist [[Hans Karlgren]] in the national newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' as a practical alternative to more complicated literary alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 8 March 2012.[http://blog.svd.se/kultur/2012/03/08/%E2%80%9Dhen%E2%80%9D-foreslogs-av-sprakforskare-redan-1994-%E2%80%93-i-svd/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the feminist cultural magazine ''Ful''&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.tidskriftenful.se/index.php?m=ful&amp;o=manifest official manifesto] by ''Ful'' regarding the use of ''hen''.&lt;/ref&gt; became the first periodical to adopt a consistent usage of ''hen''.&lt;ref name="Atladottir"&gt;Margret Atladottir, "[http://nojesguiden.se/artiklar/nar-konet-ar-okant När könet är okänt]", ''[[Nöjesguiden]]'', 29 February 2012. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', the modern standard Swedish encyclopedia, had created an article about ''hen'' describing it as a "suggested gender-neutral personal pronoun instead of ''hon'' and ''han''".&lt;ref&gt;''Språkrådet'', 15 March 2012. "[http://www.sprakradet.se/13119 Hen inte nytt i Nationalencyklopedin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129185836/http://www.sprakradet.se/13119 |date=2013-01-29 }}"; Nina Bahadur, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/swedish-gender-neutral-pronoun-hen-national-encyclopedia_n_3063293.html Swedish Gender-Neutral Pronoun, 'Hen,' Added To Country's National Encyclopedia]", ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the children's book ''Kivi och Monsterhund'' ("Kivi and Monster Dog") by Jesper Lundqvist was published. The book consistently used ''hen'' instead of ''han'' or ''hon'' and sparked a lively media debate.&lt;ref&gt;Adrianna Pavlica, "[http://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/1.874481-sa-borjade-debatten-om-hen Så började debatten om hen"] ''[[Göteborgsposten]]'', 29 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the February 2012 issue of ''[[Nöjesguiden]]'', a Stockholm-based arts and entertainment monthly, ''hen'' was used consistently in all texts with the exception of direct quotes.&lt;ref&gt;Margret Atladottir, "[http://nojesguiden.se/blogg/margret-atladottir/darfor-anvander-vi-ordet-hen-ledare-i-nr-2-2012 Därför använder vi ordet hen]", ''[[Nöjesguiden]]'', 29 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, the word had generated so much publicity that ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'', Finland's largest Swedish-language newspaper by circulation, declared that "hen is here to stay".&lt;ref&gt;Matts Lindqvist, "[http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2012-09-19/hen-har-kommit-att-stanna Hen har kommit för att stanna]". ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'', 19 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Swedish linguist Per Ledin made a survey of the use of ''hen'' in a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of Swedish [[blog]]s. His conclusion was that use among bloggers had been rising steadily from 2009 to 2012 and that it should be considered as an established word. However, ''hen'' accounted for just 0.001% of total usage of personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Per Ledin, "[http://pasvenska.se/hen-i-bloggosfaren-spridningsmonster/ Hen i bloggosfären: spridningsmönster]". ''[http://pasvenska.se/ På svenska]'', 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline [[Norwegian Air Shuttle|Norwegian]] employed the term in an ad campaign in 2012 as a tongue-in-cheek provocation with the slogan "The businessHEN's airline".&lt;ref&gt;''Språktidningen'', "[http://spraktidningen.se/blogg/nu-debatterar-vi-hen-igen Nu debatterar vi hen igen!]" 11 September 2012. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dagensmedia.se/marknadsforing/kampanjer/norwegian-vander-sig-till-hen-6132158&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, ''hen'' began to see use in official documents in some government agencies. The [[hovrätt|Court of Appeal for Lower Norrland]] applied the term in a ruling on [[official misconduct]] by a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;''Språktidningen'', "[http://spraktidningen.se/blogg/hens-uppgang-har-natt-hovratten Hens uppgång har nått hovrätten]" 14 December 2012. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hen'' appeared in an official political context for the first time in February 2013 when [[Minister for Gender Equality (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for Gender Equality]] [[Maria Arnholm]] used it in a debate in the [[Riksdag]], the Swedish parliament. In commenting on the debate afterwards, Arnholm described the word as "a practical way of simplifying" and "a smart way of developing language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lova Olsson |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/arnholm-lanserar-hen-i-riksdagen_7911126.svd |title=Arnholm lanserar "hen" i riksdagen |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date=2013-02-13 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, [[Boden Municipality]] had adopted manuals of style to be used by their employees in an official context where ''hen'' was recommended "to avoid repetition of he/she in texts where sex is unclear or where we wish to include both sexes".&lt;ref&gt;Original quote: "för att undvika upprepningar av han/hon i texter där vi inte vet kön eller vill omfatta bägge könen"; ''Språktidningen'', "[http://spraktidningen.se/blogg/sa-funkar-klarsprak-i-boden Så funkar klarspråk i Boden]", 30 August 2013. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2014, ''hen'' had become an established term both in traditional media and among bloggers. The language periodical ''Språktidningen'' concluded that the instances of usage had gone from one instance for every 13,000 uses of ''hon/han'' to just under 1 in 300.&lt;ref&gt;''Språktidningen'', "[http://spraktidningen.se/blogg/sa-snabbt-okar-hen-i-svenska-medier Så snabbt ökar hen i svenska medier]", 18 mars 2013. Retrieved 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 2014, the [[Swedish Academy]] announced that in April 2015, ''hen'' would be included in ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'', the most authoritative [[glossary]] on the Swedish language.

Although the [[Swedish Language Council]], the primary regulatory body of the Swedish language, has not made a specific recommendation against using ''hen'', it does recommend using constructions such as ''När kunden har fått hem varan ska den källsortera emballaget'', "when the customer has received the merchandise, ''it'' should recycle the packaging".&lt;ref&gt;Use of the pronoun ''den'' ("it") is determined by the grammatical gender of the word ''kund'' ("customer"), a word that belongs to the [[common gender]]. By contrast, words like ''barn'' ("child") which belong to the neuter gender would be referred to with the pronoun ''det''.&lt;/ref&gt; The existing ''den'' is recommended instead of ''hen'' when referring to human beings in general. The Council also recommends against using the object form ''henom'' ("her/him") with the reasoning that it is too similar to ''honom'' ("him"), which undermines the gender-neutral intention of the word, and that the [[grammatical case|case system]] on which the form is based is a remnant that is no longer used in Swedish; ''hen'' is instead recommended as both the subject and object form (as in ''jag såg hen''; "I saw him/her") while ''hens'' is the recommended possessive form (i.e. "her(s)/his").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/sprakradgivning/aktuellt-sprakrad/granskade-rad/2014-04-30-hur-anvander-man-pronomenet-hen.html |title=Hur använder man pronomenet hen? |trans-title=How does one use the pronoun hen? |date=2014-08-25 |publisher=[[Swedish Language Council]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2015-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529135120/http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/sprak/sprakradgivning/aktuellt-sprakrad/granskade-rad/2014-04-30-hur-anvander-man-pronomenet-hen.html |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the use of ''hen'' by the Minister for Gender Equality, and following a meeting of the [[Speaker of the Riksdag]] together with party representatives, the Parliament made an official announcement that ''hen'' should not be used in official government documents, but that individual members of parliament are free to use it in spoken debates and written motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nyheter &amp;nbsp;00.53 |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/riksdagen-bor-avsta-fran-hen/ |title=Riksdagen bör avstå från hen |publisher=DN.SE |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
From an early stage, ''hen'' has generated controversy and reactions in media. In 2010, the early use of the word prompted reactions of ridicule and skepticism. Columnist Lisa Magnusson taunted it as a "mega-feminist piece of poultry",&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Magnusson, "[http://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/kronikorer/lisamagnusson/article12094836.ab Hen – ett dumfeministiskt fjäderfä]", ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, a series of interviews and articles about the use of ''hen'' in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', one of Sweden's leading newspapers, generated widespread debate. Referring to young children as ''hen'' was considered especially controversial, sparking critical reactions from the general public, officials within public daycare and media pundits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dalén, Karl|title=Starka reaktioner efter intervjuer om "hen"|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/starka-reaktioner-efter-intervjuer-om-hen|accessdate=2014-07-20|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, ''Dagens Nyheter'' issued a ban on the use of ''hen'' in its article on the advice of chief editor [[Gunilla Herlitz]]. As a reaction to this, journalist and programmer [[Oivvio Polite]] created the website dhen.se,&lt;ref&gt;A play on the [[URL]] of ''Dagens Nyheter'', dn.se, and its acronym "DN" which is pronounced {{IPA-sv|de: ɛn|}} in Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; a site that mirrored the content of the paper's online edition, but with all instances of ''han'' and ''hon'' replaced with ''hen''. An employee at ''Dagens Nyheter'' reacted by filing a complaint to the police against dhen.se for violating Swedish [[copyright law]], but later retracted his accusation when the newspaper's management proved unwilling to pursue legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/print/dagspress/article3535185.ece|title=Herlitz inför hen-förbud|publisher=[[Dagens Media]]|author=Dante Thomsen|date=2012-09-10|accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial aspect of  the use of ''hen'' has been vis-à-vis young children, especially in public schools. [[Egalia]], a [[preschool]] in [[Södermalm]], an upper middle-class borough in central [[Stockholm]], had been at the forefront of gender-neutral [[pedagogy]], and quickly adopted the use of ''hen''. This policy sparked debate and controversy in Sweden and received widespread attention in international media in 2011–2012.&lt;ref&gt;Dave McGinn, "[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/youre-a-hen-im-a-hen-gender-neutral-pronoun-gains-ground-in-sweden/article4107472/ You're a hen, I'm a hen: gender-neutral pronoun gains ground in Sweden]" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/world/europe/swedish-school-de-emphasizes-gender-lines.html Swedish School’s Big Lesson Begins With Dropping Personal Pronouns]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Charlotte Maas, "[http://www.zeit.de/2012/34/C-Schule-Kindergarten-Schweden Sei, was du willst]", ''[[Die Zeit]]'' , 24 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soffel, Jenny.

'''Ingram Olkin''' (July 23, 1924 &amp;ndash; April 28, 2016) was a professor emeritus and chair of [[statistics]] and education at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]]. He is known for developing statistical analysis for evaluating policies, particularly in education, and for his contributions to [[meta-analysis]], [[statistics education]], [[multivariate analysis]], and [[majorization]] theory.

==Biography==
Olkin was born in 1924 in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contributions to Probability and Statistics: Essays in Honor of Ingram Olkin|author1=Gleser, L.J.|author2=Perlman, M.D.|author3=Press, S.J.|author4=Sampson, A.R.|date=2012|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461236788|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=5nLrBwAAQBAJ|page=4|accessdate=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.S. in mathematics at the [[City College of New York]], an M.A. from [[Columbia University]], and his Ph.D. from the [[University of North Carolina]]. Olkin also studied with [[Harold Hotelling]]. Olkin's advisor was [[S. N. Roy]] and his Ph.D. thesis was "On distribution problems in multivariate analysis" submitted in 1951.

Olkin died from complications of [[colorectal cancer]] at his home in [[Palo Alto, California]] on April 28, 2016, aged 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2016/05/04/ingram-olkin-influential-stanford-professor-statistics-education-dies-91/|title=Ingram Olkin, influential Stanford professor of statistics and education, dies at 91|publisher=Stanford.edu|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A spokesperson for the statistics profession: Honors and awards==
Olkin was awarded the first Elizabeth Scott Award from the [[American Statistical Association]] for his achievements in supporting women in statistics.

In 1962 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1984, he was President of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]. Olkin is a Guggenheim, Fulbright, and Lady Davis Fellow, with an honorary doctorate from [[De Montfort University]].

==Publications and editing==
Olkin has written many books including ''Statistical methods for meta-analysis'', ''Probability theory'', and ''Education in a Research University''&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;. Olkin's coauthors include [[S. S. Shrikhande]] and [[Larry V. Hedges]]. Olkin has written two books with Albert W. Marshall, ''Inequalities: Theory of [[Majorization]] and its Applications'' (1979) and ''[[Survival analysis|Life distributions]]: Structure of nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric families'' (2007). In [[nonparametric statistics]] and [[statistical decision theory|decision theory]], Olkin wrote ''Selecting and ordering populations: A new statistical methodology'' with [[Jean D. Gibbons|Jean Dickinson Gibbons]] and Milton Sobel (1977, 1999).

Ingram was Editor of the ''Annals of Mathematical Statistics'' and served as the first editor of the ''[[Annals of Statistics]],'' both published by the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]. He was a primary force in the founding of the ''[[Journal of Educational Statistics]],'' which is published with the [[American Statistical Association]]. Olkin was also an editor with the mathematics journal, ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'', and has been active in supporting a series of international conferences on [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]].

== History &amp; background ==
Jirnexu was formerly known as Saving Plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-accidental-fintech-firm|title=Cover Story: The accidental fintech firm|date=2017-06-16|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, former Citi banker Yuen Tuck Siew, together with James Barnes founded RinggitPlus.com, a comparison and application website for financial products in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asianentrepreneur.org/21863-2/|title=Yuen Tuck Siew, Co-Founder of Saving Plus - The Asian Entrepreneur|last=Ting|first=Henry|date=2015-12-23|work=The Asian Entrepreneur|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/the-rise-and-rise-of-chatbots|title=The rise and rise of chatbots|last=Ramchandani|first=Nisha|work=The Business Times|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was officially launched in 2013 to allow comparison of and application for credit cards, home loans, car loans, investments and insurance schemes.&lt;ref name="Khoo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vulcanpost.com/243832/financial-comparison-websites-malaysia/|title=7 Financial Comparison Websites To Help You Make Wise Decisions In Malaysia|last=Khoo|first=Jean|date=2015-05-19|work=Vulcan Post|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themalaysianreserve.com/new/story/smart-money-siew-yuen-tuck|title=Smart Money on Siew Yuen Tuck {{!}} The Malaysian Reserve|website=themalaysianreserve.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kristian Rikardsen Løken''' (31 July 1884{{spaced ndash}}March 1961) was a highly decorated Norwegian military officer who served in the Belgian ''[[Force Publique]]'' from 1907 to 1917, fighting German colonial forces in [[East Africa]] from 1914 to 1917, and went on to command a [[Norwegian Army]] infantry brigade during the 1940 [[Norwegian Campaign]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

In 1943, Løken was one of 1,100 Norwegian officers arrested and sent as prisoners-of-war to Germany, only being released after the German capitulation in 1945.

==Early life and education==
Kristian Løken was born in the town of [[Elverum]] in [[Hedmark]] county, Norway. He was the son of [[smallholder]] Rikard Løken (1845–1909) and Gurine Syversen (1852–1902). Kristian had an older brother, [[Halvor Løken|Halvor]] (born 8 March 1876), who also sought a military career. He attended the upper section of the [[Norwegian Military Academy]] from 1903, graduating as an infantry officer in 1906. That same year he took his [[examen artium]].&lt;ref name=barth391&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Barth |editor-first=Bjarne Keyser |editor-link=Bjarne Keyser Barth |encyclopedia=Norges militære embedsmenn 1929 |title=Løken, K.

After graduating, Løken was posted as a first lieutenant to the 1st Akershus Brigade. In 1910 he achieved a permanent position in the Norwegian infantry. He was transferred to the [[5th Division (Norway)|5th Brigade]] in 1911 and to the [[2nd Division (Norway)|2nd Brigade]] on 1 October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Barth 1930, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Officielt.

Løken was declared [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] soon after graduation,&lt;ref name="løken1903"/&gt; and granted leave from the Norwegian Army in 1907. He then entered the service of the ''Force Publique'' in the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt; He would have three periods of service in the Congo in the coming ten years.&lt;ref name=gyldendals3854&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=|first= |authorlink= |editor1-last=Bull |editor1-first=Francis |editor1-link=Francis Bull |editor2-last=Eskeland |editor2-first=Arnold |editor2-link= |editor3-last=Tandberg |editor3-first=Erik |editor3-link= |encyclopedia=Gyldendals store konversasjonsleksikon |title=Løken, Kristian Rikardsen |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2011082608023 |accessdate= |edition=3rd |year=1972 |publisher=Gyldendal |volume=3: H-L |location=Oslo |id= |isbn=8205002681 |doi= |page=3854 |quote= |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Løken was among a sizeable number of Norwegian junior officers who sought foreign service after being unable to gain paid officers positions in Norway. The [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] had trained a large number of officers in the lead-up to the 1905 [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], officers that were no longer required once the crisis between the two countries had settled.&lt;ref name=semb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/kongospor/finn_kjelstrup_tekst.html |title=I kong Leopolds klær - Et 100-års minne |last1=Semb |first1=Ellen |last2= |first2= |year=2007 |work=Museum of Cultural History |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In total, 200-300 Norwegian citizens took service in the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Along with other Norwegian officers, Løken was shipped out of [[Oslo|Kristiania]] in March 1907. His brother, then army captain Halvor Løken, bid him farewell at the docks with the words "It's a comfort to know that ill weeds never wither" ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: "''{{lang|no|Det er jo en trøst å vite at ukrutt ikke forgår så lett}}''"), in reference to the unhealthy and dangerous conditions then to be found in the Congo Free State.&lt;ref name=semb/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Some 20 Norwegian officers lost their lives as a result of their service in the Congo.&lt;ref name=semb/&gt;|group=Note}}

Løken's group of officers first underwent a three-month colonial training course in [[Brussels]], Belgium, before being shipped to the Congo.&lt;ref name=semb/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Among the other officers in the group was the later [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborator]] [[Finn Kjelstrup]].&lt;ref name=semb/&gt;|group=Note}} During his service in the Congo, Løken would periodically receive renewed permission from the Norwegian authorities to remain in ''Force Publique'' service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I dagens løb. - Kongofareren |first= |last= |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digavis_aftenposten_null_null_19130216_54_86_2 |newspaper=Aftenposten |date=16 February 1913 |page=5 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially given command of a ''Force Publique'' company, Løken eventually became a battalion commander in the Belgian Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Viksveen 1992, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Løken was one 21 Norwegians to attain the rank of ''[[Commandant]]'' in the ''Force Publique''.&lt;ref&gt;Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained in ''Force Publique'' service after [[Leopold II of Belgium]] gave up his personal control of the territory in 1908 and transferred it to the Belgian state. Løken's first tour in the Congo lasted until 1910, when he returned to Norway. He went back to the Congo in 1911, staying until 1913, and had a final tour from 1914 to 1917.&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt;&lt;ref name=gyldendals3854/&gt; During his final years in the [[Belgian Congo]], Løken saw action as first a company commander and later a battalion commander in the First World War [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]],&lt;ref name="løken1903"/&gt; fighting the [[Schutztruppe|German colonial forces]] commanded by General [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]].&lt;ref name=gyldendals3854/&gt;&lt;ref name=fokus&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=|first= |authorlink= |editor1-last=Heintz |editor1-first=Anatol |editor1-link=Anatol Heintz |editor2-last=Vogt |editor2-first=Hans |editor2-link=Hans Vogt (linguist) |encyclopedia=Fokus: illustrert familieleksikon |title=Løken, Kristian Rikardsen |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007050204035 |accessdate= |edition=2nd |year=1964 |publisher=Aschehoug |volume=3: I-mektighet |location=Oslo |id= |isbn= |doi= |page=404 |quote= |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=75th&gt;{{cite news |title="Kongo-Løken" er 75 år |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=Aftenposten |edition=Evening |date=30 July 1959 |page=3 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the battles in [[German East Africa]] where Løken fought was that at Ruakadigi in present-day [[Rwanda]] in January 1916.&lt;ref name=fokus/&gt;&lt;ref name=flood1903&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia=Studentene fra 1903: oplysninger samlet til 25-års-jubileet 1928 |title=Flood, Carl Gustav |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2012101206029 |accessdate= |edition= |year=1928 |publisher= |volume= |location=Oslo |id= |isbn= |doi= |page=96 |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Several of the other Norwegian officers fighting on [[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|the Belgian side]] were killed during the East African Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Viksveen 1992, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Norwegian fatalities in the campaign occurred in the battle of Ruakadigi, where Commandant Carl Gustav Flood was amongst those killed.&lt;ref name=flood1903/&gt;|group=Note}}

Kristian Løken left the ''Force Publique'' and the Congo in 1917 and returned to Norway on 12 November 1917.&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt;&lt;ref name="løken1903"/&gt; Due to his years spent in the Congo he was affectionately nicknamed "Kongo-Løken" by his Norwegian friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name=75th/&gt;&lt;ref name=christensen&gt;Christensen 1990, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hovland92&gt;Hovland 2000, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; During his final years of life, Løken received a pension from the Belgian state for his ''Force Publique'' service.&lt;ref&gt;Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-war years==
Returning to regular Norwegian Army service, Løken was promoted to the rank of captain in May 1918.&lt;ref name="løken1903"/&gt; Following his promotion, he assumed command of the 4th Company of the [[4th Infantry Regiment (Norway)|4th Infantry Regiment]], a command he continued to hold until 1930. In 1918 he attended a [[hand grenade]] course, in 1919 the Norwegian infantry shooting school, in 1921 a machine gun course and in 1928 a tactical command course. From 1926 onwards he served on occasion as an instructor at the shooting school. From 1929 to 1931 he commanded the First Company of the [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Norwegian Royal Guards]].&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt;&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt; In the period 1932–1933 he led the Norwegian Military Academy. He attained the rank of major in 1933, and colonel in 1939.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt; From 1933 to 1939 he served with the [[6th Infantry Regiment (Norway)|6th Infantry Regiment]] in [[Hønefoss]].&lt;ref name="løken190350"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Berner |first1=Jørgen H. |last2=Aalheim |first2=Trygve |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia=Studentene fra 1903: biografiske oplysninger samlet til 50-års-jubileet 1953  |title=Løken, Kristian Rikardsen |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2016051948033 |accessdate= |edition= |year=1953 |publisher= |volume= |location=Oslo |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages=89–90|language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the inter-war years Løken wrote three articles for the military journal ''[[Norsk Militært Tidsskrift]]'', one in 1927 on the subject of basic military training and two in 1936 on Norwegians serving with the ''Force Publique'' in the First World War East African Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Johnsen and Wasberg 1969, pp. 223, 328, 330&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his military career, Løken worked for the [[Office of the Auditor General of Norway]] from 1920 to 1923. After his years at the Auditor General, Løken spent a year in France in 1923–1924, teaching Norwegian students at the [[Lycée Pierre-Corneille]] in [[Rouen]], [[Normandy]]. He had been a state authorised French language translator in Norway since 1920.&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt;

On 17 January 1931, Kristian Løken married the [[Brandval]]-born Guldborg Noer (born 3 July 1886), the daughter of forest owner Arne Noer and Thea Hokaasen. The couple had no children.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt;&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

==Second World War==
By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Løken was in command of the [[14th Infantry Regiment (Norway)|14th Infantry Regiment]] in [[Nordland]] county, a position he had held since 17 January 1939, when he replaced Colonel [[Carl Gustav Fleischer]], who went on to command the [[6th Division (Norway)|6th Division]] with the rank of major general.&lt;ref&gt;Fure 1995, pp. 80, 90, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1939, Løken assumed command of Norwegian [[6th Brigade (Norway)|6th Brigade]], after the brigade's previous commander Colonel [[Wilhelm Faye]] had been appointed chief of defence for [[Finnmark]] county following the outbreak of the [[Winter War]] between Finland and the Soviet Union. Colonel Løken was also appointed chief of defence for the mainland of [[Troms]] county in [[Northern Norway]]. In this command Løken carried out brigade-sized field exercises to prepare his troops for potential combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandvik 1965I, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hovland 2000, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Løken was replaced as commander of the 14th Infantry Regiment by Lieutenant Colonel [[Thoralf Nummedal]].&lt;ref&gt;Hovland 2000, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1940, Løken was temporarily in command of the 6th Division's officer cadets, while these were deployed on winter exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Haga 1998, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Løken's headquarters were located at [[Bardu]] in Troms.&lt;ref&gt;Steen 1958, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian Campaign===
Following the [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Norway]] and the [[Battles of Narvik|German attack on Narvik]] on 9 April 1940, by [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Mountain Division]] troops led by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Eduard Dietl]], Løken was responsible for carrying out the Norwegian mobilization in Troms.&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 45-53, 94&lt;/ref&gt; The first task Løken carried out, in addition to the mobilization, was using the forces initially available to him to block the German forces at Narvik from advancing into Troms. Maintaining control of the central army base [[Setermoen]] was vital for the Norwegian mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Haga 1998, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The forces under Løken's direct command when the Germans invaded were an infantry battalion, a mountain artillery battalion and assorted support troops. In the evening of 8 April, Colonel Løken had been ordered to send his infantry battalion and a motorized artillery battery to Narvik to defend the town, but the transfer of forces was pre-empted by the German landing.&lt;ref&gt;Steen 1958, pp. 23, 59&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining a defensive posture with almost his entire force during the mobilization stage, Løken came into disagreement with the top leadership of the 6th Division, which wanted a swift counter-attack against the Germans as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 425-426&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not mounting an immediate counter-attack, Løken did move troops forward to blocking positions further south than planned, as he saw it as important to stop the German advance in the [[Gratangen]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde 2009, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Løken's more cautious approach to warfare lead to a deterioration of his relationship with the more offensive division commander, Carl Gustav Fleischer.&lt;ref name=hovland92/&gt; On 19 April, Løken reported that the morale of the opposing German forces seemed to be faltering, and that most of the Germans appeared to be "below average" at [[skiing]].&lt;ref&gt;Lie 2000, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing the mobilization in his area of responsibility and stopping the German advances into Troms, Colonel Løken was in overall command of the [[Battle of Gratangen|early counter-attacks]] carried out in late April 1940 by the 6th Brigade against the German forces in the Gratangen area.&lt;ref&gt;Sandvik 1965I, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Løken first had his headquarters at Kroken in [[Salangsdalen]] in Troms, before it moved forward to [[Fossbakken]] in [[Lavangen]]. Løken personally commanded the central axis of the failed first Norwegian advance at Gratangen.&lt;ref&gt;Ramberg et. al. 1996, pp. 103, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During the attack the 6th Brigade greatly outnumbered the German defenders, with two infantry battalions with artillery support mounting a direct attack against the German positions on Lapphaugen, while another two battalions made a flank march to cut off the defenders. The frontal attack failed after Løken had hesitated in attacking and sent his units against strong German positions in a disorganized and uncoordinated manner. While the main attack failed, the flank march of the 1st Battalion, [[12th Infantry Regiment (Norway)|12th Infantry Regiment]] was counter-attacked by the Germans, the Norwegians suffering heavy losses and being routed.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde 2009, pp. 294-309&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed initial offensive, Løken severely criticized the commander of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, Major [[Nils Christoffer Bøckman]], for having bypassed Løken's brigade command in order to receive permission to advance directly from the 6th Division, exposing his unit to counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 1997, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Løken's orders to the battalion had been to under no circumstance move down into the Gratangen valley, but stay on defensible ground.&lt;ref&gt;Den Militære undersøkelseskommisjon av 1946, 1979, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1940, the 6th Division was reorganized into two weak brigades, the three-battalion strong 6th Brigade under Colonel Løken and the slightly smaller [[7th Brigade (Norway)|7th Brigade]] under Colonel Wilhelm Faye. While the 6th Brigade  was to follow a generally mountainous advance route against the Germans, the 7th was to attack along the coast in cooperation with French expeditionary forces.&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th Brigade carried out a hard-fought mountain campaign over the coming weeks, pushing the Germans southwards along the Swedish border.&lt;ref&gt;Haarr 2010, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

During the advance ski patrols reported in late April to Colonel Løken that the mountainous [[Kuberg Plateau]], in the advance route of the brigade, was unoccupied by the Germans. Failure on the part of Løken to act on this information and seize the plateau allowed the Germans to occupy and fortify the feature on 7 May 1940, requiring heavy fighting a week later before they were dislodged.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde 2009, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1940, Løken was relieved of command of the 6th Brigade, being replaced by the Lieutenant Colonel [[Ole Berg]]. Colonel Løken was instead appointed temporary chief of the 6th District Command (covering Northern Norway) on 7 May 1940, replacing Colonel [[Lars Mjelde]], who had taken sick.&lt;ref&gt;Haga 1998, pp. 94, 168, 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandvik 1965II, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment was formally confirmed by royal resolution on 31 May 1940, at a meeting of the King and Cabinet at [[Storsteinnes]] in [[Balsfjord]], Troms.&lt;ref&gt;Nygaardsvold 1947, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; According to General [[Otto Ruge]]'s memoirs, the replacement of Løken as a field commander was motivated by a wish on the side of the commander of the 6th Division, General Carl Gustav Fleischer, to have a "young and aggressive" brigade commander.&lt;ref&gt;Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Following his appointment, Lieutenant Colonel Berg led the 6th Brigade in successful offensive actions against the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ole Berg |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Tom |last=Kristiansen |authorlink=Tom Kristiansen |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ole_Berg/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main task of the 6th District Command, which Løken led for the remaining month of the Norwegian Campaign, was to coordinate the efforts of the civilian authorities in Northern Norway in support of the needs of the Norwegian front line forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hovland 2000, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; During Løken's time in command, the 6th District Command was initially based in [[Harstad]], then later at [[Moen, Troms|Moen]] in [[Målselv]], Troms.&lt;ref&gt;Hauge 1960, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lie 2000, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 1940, the forces in Northern Norway capitulated, a ceasefire having been in place since 24:00 on 9 June. Despite having been on the offensive until 8 June, the Norwegian troops were ordered to capitulate after [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] had [[Operation Alphabet|pulled out of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Nøkleby |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Nøkleby  |editor=Dahl, Hans Fredrik |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |pages=206–207 |title=kapitulasjonen i 1940 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=11 August 2012 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |volume=|location=Oslo|isbn= |language=Norwegian |editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before releasing the Norwegian officers from captivity, the Germans demanded that each gave their word of honour not to participate in further resistance.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Moland |first=Arnfinn |authorlink=Arnfinn Moland  |editor=Dahl, Hans Fredrik |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |pages=314–315 |title=offiserer |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=11 August 2012 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |volume=|location=Oslo|isbn= |language=Norwegian |editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Norwegian capitulation, Colonel Løken worked on maintaining order and calm in Northern Norway in the transition phase to German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1956, pp. 153-154&lt;/ref&gt; Løken had been made the acting commander of the 6th Division in the demobilization phase, retaining a 10-man force of armed military police under his command until 27 July 1940. The military police officers worked on returning requisitioned civilian vehicles and organizing military depots.&lt;ref&gt;Austigard, Grüner and Julnes, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Once the tasks in connection with the demobilization of the Norwegian forces in the north were completed, Løken returned to his home in [[Mosjøen]].&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

In mid-1941 Løken moved to [[Oslo]]. In the period March 1942 to July 1943 he worked in Oslo's civil air defence.&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

===Imprisonment===
In August 1943, the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupying authorities]] carried out mass arrests of 1,100 Norwegian officers, suspecting the officer class of supporting the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; Colonel Kristian Løken was arrested on 16 August 1943 and given prisoner number 913.&lt;ref name=Ottosen&gt;Ottosen 2004, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first imprisoned at [[Oflag XXI-C]] in [[Ostrzeszów|Schildberg]] in the German-annexed ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''. While interned at Oflag XXI-C, Løken shared a room with Colonel [[Johannes Henrik Schiøtz|Johannes Schiøtz]], with whom he had attended the Norwegian Military Academy close to four decades earlier.{{#tag:ref|Several other members of the Norwegian Military Academy class of 1906 were also interned with Løken in Germany, amongst whom were Colonel [[Gulbrand Østbye]] (who like Løken had led an infantry brigade during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign), Colonel [[August Emil Dessen Tobiesen]], Major [[Kolbjørn Knudsen]] and Major [[Georg Otto Lorange]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiøtz 2007, pp. 247, 280&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Løken and Schiøtz were roommates at Oflag XXI-C from 6 January 1944 to 19 January 1945, when the Norwegian prisoners were sent on a one-week [[The March (1945)|forced-march]] on foot and by train to [[Oflag III-A]] in [[Luckenwalde]], Germany. On 24 January, five days into the journey, Løken was transferred to a hospital train carriage, suffering from ill health. The Norwegian prisoners of war remained interned at Oflag III-A until their German guards abandoned the camp on 21 April 1945, with Soviet forces arriving the next day. On 10 May 1945, two days after the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]], the Norwegian prisoners left Luckenwalde, reaching Norway in several groups in late May/early June 1945.&lt;ref name=Ottosen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schiøtz 2007, pp. 193, 307-323, 350-351, 375-423&lt;/ref&gt; Løken arrived in Oslo on 28 May 1945.&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

==Post-war life==
From 1946 to 1954, Løken worked with the General Inspector of the Infantry, and until 1952 as a French language teacher at the Norwegian Military Academy.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |first= |last= |url= |newspaper=Aftenposten |edition=Morning |date=7 March 1961 |page=15 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Løken also held the position as second in command of District Command North in Northern Norway. According to the Norwegian military intelligence officer [[Christian Christensen (editor)|Christian Christensen]], Løken's relationship with the commander of District Command North, General [[Arne Dagfin Dahl]], was poor. Løken was, according to Christensen, completely relegated from any meaningful tasks by General Dahl.&lt;ref name=christensen/&gt; Several years previously, during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, Løken had been Dahl's commanding officer.&lt;ref&gt;Haga 1998, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 1949 he formally retired from the Norwegian Armed Forces, yet continued working for several years under temporary contracts.&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

Colonel Kristian Løken was the vice chairman of the reconstituted Norwegian Congo Veterans' Association ({{Lang-no|Norske kongoveteraners forening}}, {{Lang-fr|Section de Norvège des Vétérans Coloniaux}}). He remained a member until the association was finally disestablished in 1960, being awarded the society's 50 year medal (commemorating the disestablishment of the Congo Free State in 1908) in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, pp. 153, 190-196&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The original association, founded in 1939, had been disestablished in 1946.

By 1948, he lived in Oslo, Norway.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt; Kristian Rikardsen Løken died in March 1961, aged 76.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Honours and awards==
For his services in the Congo, the Belgian authorities awarded Løken a total of 14 decorations.&lt;ref name=75th/&gt; Among his Belgian honours, Løken was made an Officer of the [[Order of Leopold II]], a Knight of [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]],&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt; a Knight of the [[Royal Order of the Lion]] and a Knight of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown with palm]], as well as being awarded the [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Croix de guerre with palm]], the [[Order of the African Star|Order of the African Star, Silver Medal]], the [[1914–1917 African Campaigns Commemorative Medal]], the [[Commemorative Medal of the 1914–1918 War]], the [[Inter-Allied Victory Medal (Belgium)|Inter-Allied Victory Medal 1914–1918]], and the Commemorative Medal of Congo.&lt;ref name=barth391/&gt;&lt;ref name="løken190350"/&gt;

After the end of the Second World War, Colonel Løken was decorated by the Norwegian government with the [[St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch]], the second highest Norwegian war decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Gjems-Onstad 1996, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Defence Medal 1940–1945]] and the [[Haakon VII Jubilee Medal 1905–1955]]. The French government made him an {{lang|fr|Officier}} of the {{lang|fr|[[Legion of Honour|Légion d'honneur]]}} and awarded him the {{lang|fr|[[1939–1945 War Cross (France)|Croix de guerre]]}}.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt;

'''La plume de ma tante''' ({{lang-fr|"my aunt's quill"}}) is a phrase in popular culture, attributed to elementary French language instruction (possibly as early as the 19th century&lt;ref name="TeschnerEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard V. Teschner|author2=Eston Earl Evans|title=Analyzing the Grammar of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fij1OwTBS4EC&amp;pg=RA2-PA9|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=15 May 2007|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-166-3|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and used as an example of grammatically correct phrases with limited practical application that are sometimes taught in introductory foreign language texts. As [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] said in 1958, "As every student knows, the most idiotically useless phrase in a beginner's French textbook is ''la plume de ma tante'' (the pen of my aunt)."&lt;ref name="Inc1958"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frisky French Fun on Broadway|journal=Life|date=8 December 1958|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is also used to refer to something deemed completely irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Beeby-Lonsdale1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allison Beeby-Lonsdale|title=Teaching Translation from Spanish to English: Worlds Beyond Words|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=30 October 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=978-0-7766-0399-5|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lent its name to the musical play ''[[La Plume de Ma Tante]]'', which won a [[Tony Award]] in 1959.

The phrase is also used in teaching and remembering the sounds of the French vowel ''a''; '''La plume de ma tante''' contains three instances of ''a'' that use two different pronunciations. Other limited-use phrases used as pronunciation guides include: '''Le petit bébé est un peu malade''' ({{lang-fr|"the little baby is slightly ill"}}), which contains six variants of ''e'', and '''Un bon vin blanc''' ({{lang-fr|"a good white wine"}}), which contains four nasal vowels.

The phrase's French converse is [[:fr:My tailor is rich|''my tailor is rich'']], the first in the original English [[Assimil]] guide.

In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', [[Linda Blair]]'s character utters the phrase as she is possessed. In 1982, [[Del Boy]] from the TV show ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' says it to a policewoman in the first episode of the second season.

'''Maine Question 2''', formally '''An Act to Establish The Fund to Advance Public Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www1.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/citizensguide2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was a citizen-initiated referendum question that appeared on the Maine November 8, 2016 statewide ballot. It sought to increase state aid to public schools by instituting a surcharge of 3% on Maine income taxes for those with income above $200,000 a year.  As the [[Maine Legislature]] and [[Governor of Maine|Governor]] [[Paul LePage]] declined to enact the proposal as written, it appeared on the ballot along with elections for [[United States presidential election, 2016|President of the United States]], [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maine, 2016|Maine's two U.S. House seats]], the Legislature, and various local elections.

The question was passed by roughly 10,000 votes.  The surtax created by the question was repealed as part of state budget negotiations on July 3, 2017 that added $162 million to public education funding from general revenue.

==Background==
In 2003, Maine voters passed a referendum calling for the state to pay for 55% of the cost of operating public schools, as a way to reduce pressure on local property taxes.  That percentage has never been met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/07/10/business/maine-budget-deemed-credit-negative-for-cities-towns/|title=Moody’s: Maine budget ‘credit negative’ for cities, towns|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To attempt to reach that target, a group called Stand Up for Students announced that it would start a petition drive to implement a 3% surcharge on Maine income taxes paid on those with incomes above $200,000 a year, estimated to be the top 2% of earners in Maine.&lt;ref name=propose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/10/07/news/state/group-proposes-taxing-top-2-percent-to-help-state-meet-education-funding-law/|title=Group proposes taxing top 2 percent to help state meet education funding law|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that such a tax surcharge would result in $110 million a year in revenue.&lt;ref name=qualify&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/03/02/politics/petition-to-force-more-maine-school-aid-clears-ballot-hurdle/|title=Petition to force more Maine school aid clears ballot hurdle|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition drive was carried out by some paid signature gatherers, but was largely done by volunteers from the Maine Education Association and the [[Maine People's Alliance]], a liberal organizing group.  MEA members were offered $25 Visa gift cards for every 100 signatures they gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/12/17/group-that-wants-maine-to-spend-more-on-public-schools-nears-petition-goal/|title=Group that wants Maine to spend more on public schools nears petition goal|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of [[Maine Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] certified that the proposal qualified for the ballot on March 2, 2016, stating that 66,849 signatures were valid.&lt;ref name=qualify /&gt;

The exact wording of the question was disputed.  Secretary Dunlap proposed the wording "Do you want to establish a fund to support kindergarten through 12th grade public education by adding a three percent surcharge on Maine taxable income above $200,000?".  During the required public comment period before the wording was finalized, the [[Governor of Maine|Governor's Office]] filed an objection to the proposed wording, stating that the word 'tax' or 'surtax' should be used instead of 'surcharge'.  Doing so, they stated, would have been consistent with prior referendums calling for generating revenue. A Stand Up for Students spokesman called the objection an effort to confuse voters, citing tax cuts enacted by Governor [[Paul LePage]]. Dunlap had until June 24 to make a final decision, which was only possible to appeal by going to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpbn.net/post/lepage-administration-challenges-wording-education-ballot-question#stream/0|title=LePage Administration Challenges Wording of Education Ballot Question |publisher=[[MPBN]]|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunlap released the final wording of the question on June 23, which read as "Do you want to add a 3% tax on individual Maine taxable income above $200,000 to create a state fund that would provide direct support for student learning in kindergarten through 12th grade public education?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2016/06/23/maine-secretary-of-state-revises-wording-of-all-five-november-ballot-questions/|title=Maine secretary of state revises wording of all five November ballot questions|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce formed a PAC called No on Question 2 on August 2, 2016.  Chamber President Dana Connors said that while they support strong education funding, it should be done in a manner that does not affect the economy. He went on to state that such a tax would discourage professionals from living in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/08/02/politics/maine-chamber-of-commerce-forms-pac-to-oppose-new-tax-to-fund-education/|title=Maine Chamber of Commerce forms PAC to oppose new tax to fund education|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the surtax became a point of contention in state budget negotiations for the 2017-2018 budget, with Governor LePage and minority House Republicans opposed to any tax increases in the budget. A budget that did not eliminate the surtax passed the Republican-controlled [[Maine Senate]], but not the House, leading to a shutdown of Maine state government at the end of the fiscal year on June 30th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/06/30/maine-senate-gives-initial-budget/omGsdYeYyjoGTse6aPlNXM/story.html|title=With no budget deal, Maine partially shuts its government|publisher=Boston Globe|date=July 1, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, negotiators agreed to, and LePage signed, a budget that eliminated the surtax but added an additional $162 million for public education to the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2017/07/03/house-vote-again-falls-short-in-state-budget-saga/|title=LePage signs budget, ending state government shutdown after 3 days|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=July 4, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Microsoft Student Partners''' is a worldwide recognizable program to sponsor students majoring in disciplines related to [[technology]]. The MSP program enhances students' [[employability]] by offering training in skills not usually taught in [[academia]], including knowledge of [[List of Microsoft products|Microsoft technologies]].

The program is available in most countries, and all students in [[college]] and [[university]] level are eligible to apply. If accepted, Student Partners are assumed to further share the knowledge among the academic community by, for example, arranging courses, giving presentations and initiating projects.

==History==
The MSP Program was initiated in 2001, and operated in 15 countries for five years. In late 2006, the program was expanded to 50 countries worldwide,&lt;ref name="GlobalInitiativePressRel"/&gt; and as of July 2010, there are more than 2800 members worldwide across 101 countries and regions.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"/&gt;

{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

==Purpose==
The MSP program is an educational and promotional program to sponsor [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students majoring in disciplines related to technology, typically [[computer science]], [[computer information systems]], and [[information technology]]. MSP program aims to enhance students' employability and increase students' awareness of Microsoft technologies. Student Partners are offered training especially in product-specific [[skill]]s not typically taught in academia.

The program aims to increase awareness of Microsoft products, programs and initiatives. Consequently, the program helps expanding the [[End-user (computer science)|user base]] of Microsoft products, and results in better availability of properly educated [[workforce]] in those technologies.

==Membership==
The MSP program is active around the world to college and university level students{{#tag:ref|Attending at [[high school]] level, or earlier, may also be possible, depending on the individual. Youngest MSP are [[Praneet Sah]] and [[Babar Iqbal]], both being 13 years old. The youngest [[Microsoft Certified Professional]], M. Lavinashree, is 9 years old.&lt;ref name="YoungestMCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/12/youngest-microsoft-certified-professional-just-9-years-old.ars|title=Youngest Microsoft Certified Professional just 9 years old | accessdate = 2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}. Microsoft chooses one skilled student from each institution at a time to serve as representatives. Typically, a Microsoft Student Partner is science major from [[engineering]] or [[business school]] of [[higher education]].

[[Microsoft]] offers compensation to the members of the Student Partners program through salaries (in some countries only) and [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] packages which are distributed to them for testing and promotional purposes. Student Partners are given access to [[MSDN]] Premium Subscriptions to support their promotional activities. At times, Student Partners are invited to technology-related [[Academic conference|conferences]].

The candidate students are evaluated on the following attributes:
* '''Technical expertise'''
:A strong understanding of the overall set of Microsoft Visual languages and the .NET Framework is preferred, along with specific demonstrable skills in one or more languages or technologies. Students skilled in multiple platforms, languages, and technologies are especially encouraged to join the program. 
* '''Be a campus leader'''
:Nominees should be actively involved in student technical clubs, societies, and organizations, preferably in leadership roles. 
* '''Be an active part of the online community'''
:Nominees should be actively involved in online communities, academic or professional. Examples include blogs, newsgroups, forums, online clubs, and related. 
* '''Embrace new technology'''
:Nominees should seek out new technologies, explore them, and share that experience and knowledge gained with fellow students and faculty. 
* '''Work well with faculty'''
:Nominees should be well regarded by faculty within their department and across campus. 
* '''Keep an outgoing personality and mature attitude'''
:Nominees should have an outgoing personality in public situations. They should also have a positive, mature attitude towards responding to criticism and engaging in debate.

==Activities==
Student Partners are given access to the latest Microsoft software, [[Programming tool|development tools]], reference material, industry events, and training opportunities.&lt;ref name="GlobalInitiativePressRel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/MSSPTechEdPR_7112006.mspx | title = Microsoft Rolls Out Global Initiative to Promote Career Development for Students | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2010-03-24 | date = 2006-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSPs are assumed to further share the knowledge among the academic community by arranging courses; giving presentations and lectures; and initiating projects among the students. MSPs are also used to promote incentives, for example, the Microsoft [[Imagine Cup]];&lt;ref group="note" name="ICNote"&gt;Student Partners may also actively compete in [[Imagine Cup]]; they are not directly affiliated to the organizers of the incentive.&lt;/ref&gt; and programs, such as the Ultimate Steal&lt;ref name="TheUltimateSteal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/student/discounts/theultimatesteal-us/default.aspx | title=Microsoft Office Discount for US Students - The Ultimate Steal - Office 2007 Software for $59.95 | accessdate = 2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its affiliate program.&lt;ref name="TheUltimateStealAffiliateProgram"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://student.theultimatesteal.com/public_interface.html?pi=1&amp;pic=4 |title=The Ultimate Steal Affiliate Program |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717040513/https://student.theultimatesteal.com/public_interface.html?pi=1&amp;pic=4 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Student Partners (based on a selection criteria) are provided internships and job opportunities at a few Microsoft Divisions through the program.

Local MSP activities include, for example, attending the Student Technology Day in [[United Kingdom|UK]],&lt;ref name="StudentTechnologyDay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/uk/academia/studenttechnologyday/default.mspx | title = Student Technology Day - Making Computer Science Matter | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which included high-profile presentations, such as one by the CEO of Microsoft, [[Satya Nadella]]; and TechDays, for instance in [[France]],&lt;ref name="TechDaysFrance"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/france/mstechDays | title = Microsoft Techdays : le rendez-vous des professionnels de l’informatique | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="TechDaysCanada"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/canada/techdays | title = Microsoft Tech Days Canada 2008 | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2009-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the MSPs developed a programmed called the Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA), which aims to not only train the students throughout the year but also place the students in various internship programmes over the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msa.azurewebsites.net/ | title = Microsoft Student Accelerator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11693">The '''Mokken Scale''' is a [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] method of data reduction. A Mokken scale is a unidimensional scale that consists of hierarchically-ordered items that measure the same underlying, latent concept. This method is named after the political scientist [[Rob Mokken]] who suggested it in 1971.&lt;ref name=mokken1971theory&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokken|first1=Rob|title=A theory and procedure of scale analysis: With applications in political research|date=1971|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokken scaling belongs to [[Item response theory]]. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of [[Guttman scale]]. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling can be used to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are based on the assumption that the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that a respondent who answered a difficult question correctly is assumed to answer an easy question correctly.&lt;ref name="Crichton"&gt;Crichton, N. (1999) "Mokken Scale Analysis" ''Journal of Clinical Nursing 8, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that ''every'' respondent who answered a difficult question affirmatively will ''necessarily'' answer an easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who answered a difficult question affirmatively are more ''likely'' to answer an easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.&lt;ref name="Crichton"/&gt;

The chance that a respondent will answer an item correctly is described by an item response function. Mokken scales are similar to [[Rasch model|Rasch scales]], in that they both adapted Guttman scales to a probabilistic model. However, Mokken scaling is described as 'non-parametric' because it makes no assumptions about the precise shape of the item response function, only that it is monotone and non-decreasing. The key difference between Mokken scales and Rasch scales is that the latter assumes that all items have the same item response function. In Mokken scaling the Item Response Functions differ for different items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

Mokken scales can come in two forms: first as the Double Monotonicity model, where the items can differ in their difficulty. It is essentially, is an ordinal version of Rasch scale; and second, as the Monotone Homogeneity model, where items differ in their discrimination parameter, which means that there can be a weaker relationship between some items and the latent variable and other items and the latent variable.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt; Double Monotonicity models are used most often.

Double Monotonicity models are based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;
# There is a unidimensional latent trait on which subject and items can be ordered.
# The item response function is monotonically nondecreasing. This means that as one moves from one side of the latent variable to the other, the chance of giving a positive response should never decrease.
# The items are locally stochastically independent: this means that responses to any two items by the same respondent should not be the function any other aspect of the respondent or the item, but his or her position on the latent trait.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

The issue of sample size for Mokken scaling is largely unresolved. Work using simulated samples and varying the item quality in the scales (Loevinger's coefficient and the correlation between scales) suggests that, where the quality of the items is high that lower samples sizes in the region of 250-500 are required compared with sample sizes of 1250-1750 where the item quality is low.&lt;ref name="Straat"/&gt; Using real data from the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthpromotion.net/resources/user-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the required sample size depends on the Mokken scaling parameters of interest as they do not all respond in the same way to varying sample size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/21642850.2018.1505520|title = What are the minimal sample size requirements for Mokken scaling?

== Extensions ==

While Mokken scaling analysis was originally developed to measure the extent to which individual dichotomous items form a scale, it has since been extended for polytomous items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Schuur|first1=Wijbrandt|title=Mokken scale analysis: Between the Guttman scale and parametric item response theory|journal=Political Analysis|date=2003|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139–163|url=http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/139.short|doi=10.1093/pan/mpg002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while Mokken scaling analysis is a confirmatory method, meant to test whether a number of items form a coherent scale (like [[Confirmatory factor analysis]]), an Automatic Item Selection Procedure has been developed to explore which latent dimensions structure responses on a number of observable items (like [[Factor analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ark | first1 = L.A. (Andries) | year = 2012 | title = New Developments in Mokken Scale Analysis in R | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Software | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | doi=10.18637/jss.v048.i05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some confusion in Mokken scaling between the concepts of Double Monotonicity model and invariant item ordering. The latter implies that all respondents to a series of questions all respond to them in the same order across the whole range of the latent trait. For dichotomously scored items, the Double Monotonicity model can mean invariant item ordering; however, for polytomously scored items this does not necessarily hold.&lt;ref name="Ligtvoet"&gt;Ligtvoet, R., van der Ark, L.A., te Marvelde J.M., and Sijtsma, K. (2010) Investigating an Invariant Item Ordering for Polytomously Scored Items in Educational and Psychological Measurement [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0013164409355697 Volume: 70 issue: 4, page(s): 578-595]&lt;/ref&gt; For invariant item ordering to hold not only should the item response functions not intersect, also, the item step response function between one level and the next within each item must not intersect.&lt;ref name="Sijtsma"&gt;Sijtsma, K., Meijer R.R., van der Ark, L.A.

The [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] '''Museum Conservation Institute'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-conservation-institute Museum Conservation Institute Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; (MCI) aims to be the center for specialized [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and technical collection [[research]] for all of the Smithsonian museums&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution Smithsonian Institution Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/fact-sheet-smithsonian-collections Smithsonian Collections Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; MCI's staff combine state-of-the-art instrumentation and scientific techniques with the knowledge of materials and the history of technology to provide technical research studies and interpretation of art, as well as historical and anthropological objects, to improve the conservation and collections storage capabilities at the Smithsonian. For the majority of the Smithsonian collections, MCI is the only Smithsonian resource for technical studies and analyses.

==History==

The Smithsonian's Board of Regents&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents Smithsonian Board of Regents Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; established the Conservation Research Laboratory of the United States National Museum in 1963 in response to a growing need to support conservation of the entire Institution's collections.

In 1965 the name of the laboratory was changed to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory (CAL). In 1983, the laboratory moved to the Museum Support Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-support-center Museum Support Center Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; in Suitland, Maryland. Congress mandated a national conservation training program among other wider responsibilities including an expanded conservation science research program.

The Board of Regents approved a name change to the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) in 1998. SCMRE's mission was to serve all museum communities - national and international, and provide professional training and education programs.

In 2006 the Board of Regents approved the name change to the Museum Conservation Institute (MCI).

'''''MyMathLab''''' is an online interactive and educational system designed by [[Pearson Education]] to accompany its published math textbooks. It covers courses from basic math through calculus and statistics, as well as math for business, engineering and future educators. Pearson designed ''MyMathLab'' to respond to the needs of instructors and students who wanted more opportunity for practice, immediate feedback, and automated grading.&lt;ref name=mymathlab&gt;[http://mymathlab.com/ "MyMathLab"], MyMathLab features. Pearson PLC. Retrieved 18 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

== MyLab and Mastering  ==
Pearson's ''MyLab'' and ''Mastering'' series consists of more than 70 online interactive and educational system in a variety of different subjects. Some features of ''MyMathLab'' (and MyStatLab) specifically for students are homework, quizzes, tests, full eText, and multimedia tutorials. For instructors' benefits, ''MyMathLab'' records and evaluates students' learning progress and time spent on assignments. Instructors may set up a customized ''MyMathLab'' course. &lt;ref name=MyMathLab&gt;[https://studiesblog.com/mymathlab/ "MyMathLab/Mastering"], MyMathLab/Mastering.Stuidesblog &lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
A report of the effectiveness of MyLab and Mastering, and how to plan and implement a course has been published by Pearson.&lt;ref name=Implementing&gt; [http://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/global/northamerica/results/files/AL_Feb_20_for_RL.pdf?v1424908100 "MyLab and Mastering survey 2015"], MyLab/mastering. Pearson PLC. Retrieved 17 April 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fayetteville State University]] conducted a study on whether using an online interactive system such as ''MyMathLab'' would increase a student's academic performance compared to the traditional paper-based homework system. The study was done in a college algebra course. The result showed that those who pass the course using ''MyMathLab'' is 70% while using traditional homework system is 49%.&lt;ref name=colloquium&gt;Kodippili, Asitha, and Senaratne, Deepthika. "Is Computer-generated Interactive Mathematics Homework More Effective Than Traditional Instructor-graded homework?", "British Journal of Educational Technology" Vol 39, No 5 (2008): 928-932. Retrieved 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study neglected to factor in students preemptively dropping the course out of frustration and the increased amount of time students were forced to spend on a topic due to poor user interface design and incorrect answer parsing.   A study done by [[North Georgia College and State University]] shows that most students found ''MyMathLab's'' video tutoring feature useful. Some students argue that most of ''MyMathLab's'' videos only cover basic concepts when they demand more videos on advanced materials. Another review claims that some tutors are not as easily understood as others. "MyMathLab" has also fallen under additional criticism for wording problems in a way that students cannot easily understand. &lt;ref name=video&gt;Spence, Diana J.

Retrieved 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Features ==
Pearson’s ''MyMathLab'' consists of several features that aid instructors and students. The homework and practice exercises take advantage of an algorithm to generate problems, so students can have limitless options to practice problems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/mymathlab/students/features/index.html|title=Students, Learn About MyLab Math|last=Pearson|website=www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another core feature of ''MyMathLab'' is the eText book. The eText book can be viewed through a traditional computer or a mobile tablet. The eText itself has features such as: highlighting text, adding links, bookmark pages, and pin notes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The gradebook feature of ''MyMathLab'' helps both instructors and students keep track of progress within the course, and shows students which concepts they have yet to master.

The '''Palacio de la Autonomía''' (Autonomy Palace) is a museum and site where the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] gained autonomy from direct government control in 1929. The building is from the late 19th century, and located on the corner of Licenciado de Verdad and Rep de Guatemala streets, north of [[Santa Teresa la Antigua]] and east of [[Templo Mayor]].&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=92–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has a 500-year history, starting from part of lands granted by [[Hernán Cortés]]. The current building was constructed by the administration of President [[Porfirio Díaz]], but it was ceded to the University in 1910. Since that time, the building has had a number of uses, including housing a dental school and a preparatory school. Today it houses the Museo de la Autonomía Universitaria (University Autonomy Museum).

==Description==
This building was constructed during the Porfirio Díaz period and belongs to the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; The architecture of the building is considered to be eclectic, built of white stone brought from Pachuca,  and a facade accentuated by a triangular [[pediment]] with a relief and foliage. Part of the building’s foundation lies on wall that surrounded the sacred plaza of the Templo Mayor.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hermosos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Palacio de la Autonomía, uno de los edificios más hermosos del Centro Histórico |author= José Carlos Aviña  |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n526575.htm |newspaper= El Sol de México |location=Mexico City |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate= |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Autonomy Palace, one of the most beautiful buildings in the Historic Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site has a history of over 500 years.&lt;ref name="posee"&gt;{{cite news |title= Posee el Palacio de la Autonomía una historia de 500 años |author= Carlos Aviña  |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n176784.htm |newspaper= El Sol de México |location=Mexico City |date=February 19, 2007 |accessdate= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Autonomy Palace possesses a history of 500 years }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], Hernán Cortés distributed areas in the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]]. This space was reserved for Luis de Rivera, the first representative of the Casa de Moneda (coin mint) in [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; Next, the area became part of the Santa Teresa la Antigua convent and after  it was closed by the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]], the building here became housing.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; This property was then acquired by the government of Porfirio Díaz, which constructed the current building in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; It was the site of the Escuela Normal de Maestros (Teachers’ College), then part of the Universidad Nacional de México, today Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in 1910.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt;

As part of UNAM, the building functioned as the dean’s offices.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; In 1929, documents were signed here which gave the university its autonomy from direct government control.&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; After 1930, the building was the Escuela de Iniciación Universitaria (School of University Initiation) then the Escuela Nacional de Comerico y Administración (National School of Commerce and Administration).&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; After much of the  UNAM moved to the [[Ciudad Universitaria]], it housed the Escuela National de Odontología, (National School do Dentistry).&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; When this school moved in 1958, due to its growth, the building became the main campus of the Escuela de Enfermería y Obstetricia (School of Nursing and Obstetrics).&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; Lastly, it became Plantel Número 2 “Doctor Erasmo Castellanos Quinto” of the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (Mexico)|Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (National Preparatory School)]], and functioned as such until 1978.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt;

==Museo de la Autonomía Universitaria==
A group of dentists organized a campaign to reconstruct the building in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; Today, the building functions as a museum called the Museo de la Autonomía Universitaria (University Autonomy Museum) and is also commonly called the Palacio de la Autonomía (Autonomy Palace).&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; The Universidad Nacional de México gained autonomy, free from direct government control of the curriculum, in 1929. This autonomy is considered to be extremely important to Mexican public universities. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the event in 2004, the building was given its current name. The museum holds the Hall of Mexican Dentistry, a temporary exhibit hall, and archeological exhibit, and is the site of the university radio station UNAM-FM.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt; It contains archives related to the major players in the university’s struggle to gain autonomy.&lt;ref name="posee"/&gt; There have been windows built into the foundation to allow visitors to see remnants of the old convent.&lt;ref name="hermosos"/&gt;

It has been published in [[Moscow]] since 2007. The circulation of the magazine is about 2000 copies. It is distributed both by retail and subscription.

==Founding==
''Pro Knigi'' was supposed to be the keeper of traditions in the [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] period press of the early twentieth century. Before it, some magazines were published by a bookseller and collector N. Solovyev, "Anticvar" (1902–1903) and "Russian bibliophile" (1911–1916). The board of publishers of the magazine has been led by the Head of the National union of Bibliophiles, the Head of [[Federal Agency on Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation]], [[Mikhail Seslavinsky|M. Seslavinsky]], since 2008.

==The content of the magazine==
''Pro Knigi'' is considered to be an authentic guide to a bibliophile’s life in the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopaedia of bibliophile’s life.

*[[Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope|Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy]] ([[ESEM]])
*[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS)
*[[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[Micro-X-ray fluorescence]] (μ-XRF and XRF)
*[[X-ray diffraction]] analysis (XRD)
*[[Infrared Spectroscopy|Infrared]]  (FT-IR) and [[UV spectroscopy]] (UV-Vis)
*[[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS)

Other methods for the investigation of materials include a [[weathering]] chamber to simulate environmental conditions and mobile measuring systems for monitoring the physical and chemical environment for art works [[in situ]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated0"/&gt;

== Achievements ==

The Rathgen has exposed several scandalous forgeries, including paintings in the [[Wolfgang Beltracchi|Beltracchi affair]]. Analysis of [[Wood#Growth rings|annular rings]] in the original frames demonstrated that the wood was indeed old but came from trees that had once stood tightly side by side, unlikely for diverse works such as [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Max Ernst]].&lt;ref&gt;Der Tagesspiegel, 25 January 2012, S. 16; "Verräterische Jahresringe" ''Revealing Growth Rings'', retrieved 02-01-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6503">'''Reginald Andrew Lassalle''', better known as '''Rex Lassalle''' was born in Belmont, [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]] in 1945. He attended Belmont Boys Intermediate School and [[Saint Mary's College, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Mary's College]],&lt;ref name="Lassalle1999Acknowledgements.no.22" /&gt; Port of Spain. He is a former [[lieutenant]] in the [[Trinidad and Tobago Regiment]] who, together with [[Raffique Shah]], led a [[mutiny]] by the Regiment on April 21, 1970 (''see [[Black Power Revolution]]'').

Lassalle attended the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] from January 1965 to December 1966.  After returning to Trinidad he served as a [[second lieutenant]] and then a lieutenant. Following the mutiny he was charged with over fifty offenses including [[treason]] and mutiny.  Although he was never actually tried for treason, he was [[court martial]]ed in March 1971 and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.  He appealed, won the appeal, and was eventually set free after an appeal by the State to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] and was freed on July 27, 1972.  In total he served 27 months in prison.

He was strongly influenced by his parents during childhood and particularly their intuitive insights into nature and animals.&lt;ref name="Lassalle1999p1" /&gt; The impact of this is reflected in his 1999 book on 9 Star Ki or [[Chinese astrology]], Lassalle's in-depth personal treatment of the subject. His grounding in 9 Star Ki came through [[Michio Kushi]]&lt;ref name="Lassalle1999Acknowledgements.no.2" /&gt; the well known [[macrobiotics]] educator. He went on to study [[Osteopathy]] at the [[College of Osteopaths]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], England and qualified in 1974.&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p6.3"/&gt; Another profound influence on his work at this time was that of Dr. Major Bertrand DeJarnette&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p6.3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BertrandDeJarnette" /&gt; the renowned American engineer, inventor, osteopath and [[chiropractor]]. He then studied [[acupuncture]] and [[homeopathy]] under Professor Malcolm Stemp&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p6.3"/&gt; of [[Newton Abbott]], [[Devon]] the accomplished British homeopath.&lt;ref name="FellowshipofHomeopaths"/&gt;

Around this time (late 1970s) he became involved with [[martial arts]] and studied under Kanetsuka Sensei [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115191304/http://www.bafonline.org.uk/baf/ksensei.html] of the British Aikido Federation and also [[Kazuo Chiba|Chiba Sensei]]&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p6.3" /&gt; where he picked up many techniques concerning the breath which he then applied, along with his knowledge of acupuncture, to develop his own style of [[Shiatsu]]. He founded a school of shiatsu in the mid-1980s called Hara Shiatsu International and trained the first generation of Shiatsu teachers in the UK.&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p5" /&gt;

Lassalle was strongly influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy especially that of the Tibetan and [[Zen]] traditions&lt;ref name="Lassalle2009p7" /&gt; and this would reflect itself in his approach to health, well being, nutrition and also to his particular style of 9 Star Ki astrology. In recent years his work has been in providing services to the Spa industry during the course of which (2009) he wrote a book on spa massage. He continues to develop new methods in this area.&lt;ref name="Madarin2010p4" /&gt;

The objectives addressed in the development of the platform SWAD can be specified depending on its potential beneficiaries:&lt;ref name="Vargas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vargas |first1=Antonio Cañas |title=SWAD: Info |url=https://openswad.org/info/ |website=openswad.org |accessdate=24 September 2018 |language=en}}  [[File:CC-BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/au/ Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Australia] license.&lt;/ref&gt;

* For teachers and other administrators of the platform, the objectives were carrying through internet the management tasks related to a course and its students, and improved mentoring and general communication with them.
* For students, the objectives have been improved access to materials and information of the courses, the possibility of self-assessment at a distance, and the improvement of the communication both student-student and student-teacher.

A fundamental criterion at the development of the platform has been to facilitate its use by users, emphasizing both the ease of learning and use for students and teachers (usability), and the time saving and quality improvement in various tasks related to teaching.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

For the institution or company, SWAD has the additional advantage of being fast and efficient, consuming very little computer resources, so being suitable for low-cost installations. Compared to other tools used for the same purpose, since its implementation in C language, SWAD does not require a big hardware and software infrastructure, even in large universities, being sufficient a single server.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

== Technical specifications ==

=== Server ===
SWAD core is a [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] programmed in [[C (programming language)|C]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main core for SWAD platform (GitHub)|work=GitHub, Inc.|url=https://github.com/acanas/swad-core}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising almost all the functionality of the platform. The core is supplemented with some external programs like photo processing module and [[Online chat|chat]] module.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWAD source code|work=OpenSWAD.org |url=http://openswad.org/source/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The server runs on a [[Linux]] system with [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and a [[MySQL]] or [[MariaDB]] database.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

=== Clients ===
Being a web application, the [[Client (computing)|client]] can be any modern [[web browser]]. To use the chat you must have [[Java (software platform)|Java]] runtime environment.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

Besides the web client, there is an [[M-learning]] application for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices called SWADroid,&lt;ref name="deslocalizan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deslocalizan2" /&gt; which implements some of the most used features in the web version.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

== Hierarchy and roles ==

=== Hierarchical organization ===
SWAD can accommodate in a single platform one or multiple educational organizations. It uses the following hierarchical structure:&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;
* Countries
* Institutions ([[University|universities]], [[Academy|academies]], [[organization]]s, [[Company|companies]],...)
* Centres ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]], [[building]]s,...)
* Degrees ([[Academic degree|degrees]], [[Master's degree|masters]],...)
* [[Course (education)|Courses]]
* Group types (lectures, practicals, seminars,...)
* Groups (A, B, morning, afternoon,...)
The central element of this hierarchy is the course, which can register several teachers and students.

=== Roles ===
Each user has a role of student, non-editing teacher or teacher at each of the course in which he/she is enrolled. In addition, some users may be administrators of one or more degrees, centres or institutions, as well as global administrators of the platform.&lt;ref name="Vargas"/&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], a '''state-integrated school''' is a former private school which has integrated into the state education system under the '''Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975''', becoming a [[state school]] while retaining its special character. State-integrated schools were established by the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour Government]] in the early 1970s as a response to the near-collapse of the country's then private [[Catholic school]] system, which had run into financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="TeAraPS2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/private-education/page-2 |title= Private schools, 1820s to 1990s |first= Megan |last= Cook |publisher= [[Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |date= 13 July 2012 |accessdate= 30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2016, there were 329 state-integrated schools in New Zealand, of which 237 identify as [[Roman Catholicism in New Zealand#Education|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/number-of-schools|title=Ministry of Education, "Number of Schools"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.educationcounts.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|type=Excel pivot table|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Figures derived from the "New Zealand Schools Pivot Table 1996-2016" spreadsheet available at https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/number-of-schools|group=nb}} They educate approximately 87,500 students, or 11.5% of New Zealand's student population,&lt;ref name="rolls"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/71778/Roll-by-Affiliation-and-Authority.xls |title= Roll by Authority &amp; Affiliation – 1 July 2013 |publisher= Ministry of Education (New Zealand) |accessdate= 9 November 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140818210219/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/71778/Roll-by-Affiliation-and-Authority.xls |archivedate= 18 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the second-most common type of school in New Zealand behind non-integrated state schools.

==History==
[[File:Jonathan Hunt.jpg|thumb|The Right Honourable [[Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand politician)|Jonathan Hunt]] is credited with the idea of integrating private schools into the state school system]]
New Zealand's state education system was established in 1877. Prior to then, schools were run by church groups and other private groups. From 1852 until provinces were abolished in 1876, all schools were entitled to receive some financial assistance from provincial governments. Under the [[Education Act 1877]], education became compulsory for all children between 7 and 13 years of age and gave all children between 5 and 15 years of age the entitlement to a free and secular education in a state-run school. The secular-education requirement arose from a deadlock between secularist, Catholic, and Protestant MPs over how much and what type of religious influence (if any) should be included in state schools. Ultimately, MPs opted for the safest route by making state education secular. As a result, both Catholic and Protestant churches set up their own private school systems.&lt;ref name="TeAraPS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nzceo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzceo.catholic.org.nz/media/resources/brief-history-of-integration.pdf |title= A Brief History of the Integration of Catholic Schools in New Zealand into the State System of Schools |first= Patrick J. |last= Lynch |publisher= New Zealand Catholic Education Office |date= 24 July 2012 |accessdate= 31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TeAraED2"&gt;{{cite web |first= Nancy |last= Swarbrick |title= Primary and secondary education – Education from 1840 to 1918 |publisher= Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date= 13 July 2012 |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/primary-and-secondary-education/page-2 |accessdate= 31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, private religious schools had to cope with increasing rolls due to changes in the compulsory school starting and leaving ages (the school leaving age was increased to 15 in 1944; the school starting age was lowered to 6 in 1964) and the [[Post–World War II baby boom|post-war baby boom]]. In addition, private schools had to keep pace with the drive for higher-quality facilities and smaller class sizes in the state sector, while dealing with a teacher shortage and the increasing cost of land, equipment and salaries. The Catholic school system, in particular, had to hire more lay teachers to cope with student numbers – the proportion of lay teachers in the Catholic system increased from 5 percent in 1956 to 38 percent in 1972 – and more lay teachers meant higher salary costs. Catholic parishes were struggling to meet the increasing costs while keeping tuition fees down, and ultimately many of them accrued large amounts of debt or cut costs, causing schools to be run down. By the end of the 1960s, the Catholic school system was facing a financial crisis and was on the brink of collapse.&lt;ref name="nzceo" /&gt;

In November 1972, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] was elected to government, and Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]] immediately sought a solution to the Catholic school funding crisis. The government determined the state school system would not be able to cope with an influx of students if the Catholic system were to collapse, so sought a way for the state to assist them to keep them open. The idea of integrating private schools into the state system has been credited to MP (and later [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand politician)|Jonathan Hunt]], and after consultation, the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act was drawn up.&lt;ref name="nzceo" /&gt; The Act was passed by Parliament and signed into law on 10 October 1975, and came into force on 16 August 1976.&lt;ref name="nzceo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section 1, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The first private school to integrate was [[Wesley College, Auckland|Wesley College]], Pukekohe, in 1977. The first two Catholic schools to integrate were [[Cardinal McKeefry Catholic Primary School|Cardinal McKeefry School]] and St Bernard's School, both in Wellington, in August 1979. Despite the increasing urgency, it took until 1984 to integrate every Catholic school.&lt;ref name="nzceo" /&gt;

==Features==
State-integrated schools are established through an integration agreement between the Crown and the proprietors of the private school to be integrated. Each integration agreement sets out the school's particular special character, which is usually a religious or philosophical belief. Of the 331 state-integrated schools, 238 are Catholic schools (i.e. Catholicism is their special character),&lt;ref name="schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/72516/Affiliation-and-Authority.xls|title=Number of schools by Affiliation &amp; Authority – 1 July 2013|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)]]|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the local Catholic diocese or [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institute]] acting as proprietor. The special characters of the remaining 93 schools include [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational Christian]], [[Montessori education|Montessori]] and [[Waldorf education|Waldorf (Steiner)]].

Proprietors retain ownership of the school land and buildings, and representatives of the proprietors sit as trustees on the school's board of trustees. The main role of the proprietors is to ensure that the special character of the school is maintained and preserved, and have the authority to address problems if the special character is being compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

With several major exceptions relating to their special characters and their proprietors, state-integrated schools are required to operate like their non-integrated counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Section 4, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt; This includes complying with all National Education Goals and National Administration Guidelines ("NEGs and NAGs") set by the government, having to employ registered teaching staff, and complying with the nationally-set school year. State-integrated schools must follow the nationally-set curriculum (The New Zealand Curriculum / Te Matautanga o Aotearoa), but they may teach their special character within it.&lt;ref&gt;Section 31, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt; State-integrated schools that have a religious special character are exempt from the religious instruction restrictions of state schools, and may hold religious education classes and religious services while the school is open for instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Section 32, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt; At some state-integrated secondary schools, religious studies is offered as a subject contributing to the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA), New Zealand's main secondary school qualification.&lt;ref name="North&amp;South"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Brand Catholic: a (not so) private education |first= Joanna |last= Wade |magazine= [[North &amp; South (New Zealand magazine)|North &amp; South]] |date= November 2011 |pages= 40–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State-integrated schools are permitted to give preference in enrolment to students who, either themselves or through their parents, identify with the school's special character.&lt;ref&gt;Section 29, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Each proprietor defines what is required for preferential enrolment. For all Catholic schools and most other religious schools, a letter from the priest of the student's or their parent's parish is required for preferential enrolment, and obtaining such a letter usually requires a certain commitment to the religion, e.g. Catholic priests usually require a minimum of the student's (or at least one of their parent's) baptism into the Catholic faith. Schools may admit a limited number of non-preference students (usually no more than 5–10% of their total roll) after all preferential enrolments, up to the maximum school roll set in the school's integration agreement.&lt;ref name="North&amp;South" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://www.villa.school.nz/WebSpace/732/ |title= Enrolment Criteria |publisher= [[Villa Maria College, Christchurch]] |accessdate= 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fees===
State-integrated schools are allowed to charge a fee to parents of students known as "attendance dues". The Crown does not own the school land or buildings and do not fund their capital cost to maintain [[separation of church and state]], so proprietors are permitted to charge attendance dues to keep the school up to the standard of an equivalent state school and to help pay off any debt accrued by the school before it was integrated. Proprietors cannot charge attendance dues for more than the amount set for their school and published in ''[[The New Zealand Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Section 36, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from attendance dues, state-integrated schools like other state schools are not allowed to charge fees to domestic students&lt;ref&gt;Section 35, Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and temporary residents – the latter includes all Australian citizens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/contents.html |title= Section 2: Interpretation – Education Act 1989 No 80 (as of 4 October 2013) – New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand) |accessdate= 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but commonly request voluntary donations to top-up funding from the government and attendance dues.

A survey of 25 state-integrated secondary schools by [[North &amp; South (New Zealand magazine)|''North &amp; South'' magazine]] in November 2011 found the attendance dues generally ranged from NZ$240–280 per year for Catholic schools in [[Christchurch]] to $740 per year for Catholic schools in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], and from $1,150 to $2,300 per year for non-Catholic state-integrated schools. Requested donations at the surveyed schools varied from $140 to over $3,200.&lt;ref name="North&amp;South" /&gt; As a comparison, the largest donation requested by a non-integrated state school is $975 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10893670 |title= 'Free' school costs almost $1,000 a year |first1= Rob |last1= MacGregor |first2= Boris |last2= Jancic |newspaper= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |date= 29 June 2013 |accessdate= 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sven Koenig''' is a full [[professor]] in [[computer science]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. He received an [[M.S.]] degree in computer science from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1991 and a [[Ph.D.]] degree in computer science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1997, advised by Reid Simmons.

==Research==

Koenig is an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] [[researcher]] who develops techniques for planning and learning under uncertainty and time constraints, both for single agents and teams of agents. His research often combines ideas from artificial intelligence and robotics with ideas from other disciplines, such as [[decision theory]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[operations research]] and [[economics]].

==Scientific Achievements==

In his pre-dissertation work, Koenig applied [[Markov Decision Process]]es (MDPs) to artificial intelligence planning. The standard textbook in artificial intelligence, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] (second edition), states "The connection between MDPs and AI planning problems was made first by Sven Koenig (1991), who showed how probabilistic STRIPS operators provide a compact representation for transition models."

Koenig's dissertation on "Goal-Directed Acting with Incomplete Information" describes a robust robot navigation architecture based on [[partially observable Markov decision process]] models. His papers on the subject are highly cited due to their pioneering nature and the subsequent wide adoption of probabilistic robot navigation approaches.

After his dissertation, Koenig laid a broad foundation for [[incremental heuristic search]] in artificial intelligence with the development of search algorithms such as Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), D* Lite, Adaptive A* (AA*) and Fringe-Saving A* (FSA*). The ideas behind his incremental heuristic search algorithm D* Lite, for example, have been incorporated by others into a variety of path planning systems in robotics, including Carnegie Mellon University's winning entry in the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]].

Koenig is also known for his work on real-time search, ant robots, probabilistic planning with nonlinear utility functions, development and analysis of robot-navigation methods (goal-directed navigation in unknown terrain, localization, coverage and mapping), agent coordination based on cooperative auctions, and any-angle path planning.

==Professional Activities==

Koenig was conference co-chair of the 2004 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, program co-chair of the 2005 International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems and program co-chair of the 2007 and 2008 AAAI Nectar programs. He served or serves on the editorial boards of several artificial intelligence and robotics journals, on the board of directors of the Robotics: Science and Systems Foundation, on the advisory boards of the [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]] and Americas School on Agents and Multiagent Systems, and on the steering committees of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling and the Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation, and Approximation.

==Honors and awards==

Koenig is the recipient of an [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Recognition of Service Award, an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] CAREER award, an [[IBM]] Faculty Partnership Award, a Charles Lee Powell Foundation Award, a Raytheon Faculty Fellowship Award, a Mellon Mentoring Award, a [[Fulbright]] Fellowship, the [[IEEE Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award]], and the Tong Leong Lim Pre-Doctoral Prize from the University of California at Berkeley.

A '''thesis''' or '''dissertation'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally, the concepts "dissertation" and "thesis" (plural, "theses") were not interchangeable. When, at ancient universities, the lector had completed his lecture, there would traditionally follow a disputation, during which students could take up certain points and argue them. The position that one took during a disputation was the thesis, while the dissertation was the line of reasoning with which one buttressed it. Olga Weijers: The medieval ''disputatio''. In: [http://www.ascleiden.nl/Pdf/horaestklein.pdf ''Hora est! (On dissertations)''], p.23-27. Leiden University Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; is a document submitted in support of candidature for an [[academic degree]] or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.&lt;!-- who knows what this source actually says? It's not publicly accessible and (especially if not even quoted from) needs to be replaced with one that is--&gt;&lt;ref name="iso7144"&gt;International Standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7144: Documentation—[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=13736&amp;ICS1=1&amp;ICS2=140&amp;ICS3=40 Presentation of theses and similar documents], International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, the word "thesis" or a cognate is used for part of a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Master's degree|master's]] course, while "dissertation" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in other contexts, the reverse is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascleiden.nl/Pdf/horaestklein.pdf Douwe Breimer, Jos Damen et al.: ''Hora est! (On dissertations)'']. Leiden University Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''graduate thesis''' is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grad.ubc.ca/handbook-graduate-supervision/graduate-thesis|title=The Graduate Thesis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.

The word "dissertation" can at times be used to describe a [[treatise]] without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term "thesis" is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.

==Etymology==
The term "thesis" comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|θέσις}}, meaning "something put forth", and refers to an intellectual [[proposition]]. "Dissertation" comes from the [[Latin]] ''dissertātiō'', meaning "discussion". Aristotle was the first philosopher to define the term thesis. &lt;blockquote&gt;"A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts with the general opinion...for to take notice when any ordinary person expresses views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Works of Aristotle|last=Aristotle|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1928|isbn=|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=W.D.|volume=1|location=Oxford|pages=Bk. I.11 104b19-23|translator-last=Pickard-Cambridge|translator-first=W.A.|chapter=Topica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Aristotle, a thesis would therefore be a supposition that is stated in contradiction with general opinion or express disagreement with other philosophers (104b33-35). A supposition is a statement or opinion that may or may not be true depending on the evidence and/or proof that is offered (152b32). The purpose of the dissertation is thus to outline the proofs of why the author disagrees with other philosophers or the general opinion.

== Structure and presentation style ==
[[File:Irony thesis.png|thumb|Cover page to [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s university thesis (1841).]]

=== Structure ===
A thesis (or dissertation) may be arranged as a [[thesis by publication]] or a [[monograph]], with or without appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers. An ordinary monograph has a [[title page]], an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], a [[table of contents]], comprising the various chapters (e.g., introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion), and a [[bibliography]] or (more usually) a references section. They differ in their structure in accordance with the many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.

Dissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature impinging on the topic of the study, the methods used, and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format : a) an introduction, which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance; b) a literature review, reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue; c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen; d) a findings chapter, outlining the findings of the research itself; e) an analysis and discussion chapter, analysing the findings and discussing them in the context of the literature review (this chapter is often divided into two—analysis and discussion); f) a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gary (2009) ''Your Research Project''. Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudestam &amp; Newton (2007) ''Surviving your dissertation. '' Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Style ===
Degree-awarding institutions often define their own [[Style guide|house style]] that candidates have to follow when preparing a thesis document. In addition to institution-specific house styles, there exist a number of field-specific, national, and international standards and recommendations for the presentation of theses, for instance [[ISO 7144]].&lt;ref name="iso7144"/&gt; Other applicable international standards include [[ISO 2145]] on section numbers, [[ISO 690]] on bibliographic references, and [[ISO 31]] on quantities or units.

Some older house styles specify that [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (title page, abstract, table of content, etc.) uses a separate page number sequence from the main text, using [[Roman numerals]]. The relevant international standard&lt;ref name="iso7144"/&gt; and many newer style guides recognize that this [[book design]] practice can cause confusion where electronic document viewers number all pages of a document continuously from the first page, independent of any printed page numbers. They, therefore, avoid the traditional separate number sequence for front matter and require a single sequence of [[Arabic numerals]] starting with 1 for the first printed page (the [[recto]] of the title page).

Presentation requirements, including pagination, layout, type and color of paper, use of [[acid-free paper]] (where a copy of the dissertation will become a permanent part of the library collection), [[paper size]], order of components, and citation style, will be checked page by page by the accepting officer before the thesis is accepted and a receipt is issued.

However, strict standards are not always required. Most Italian universities, for example, have only general requirements on the character size and the page formatting, and leave much freedom for the actual typographic details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Italian Studies MA Thesis Work Plan | url=https://italian.georgetown.edu/graduate-thesis-work-plan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thesis or dissertation committee is a committee that supervises a student's dissertation. In the US, these committees usually consist of a primary supervisor or [[Doctoral advisor|advisor]] and two or more committee members, who supervise the progress of the dissertation and may also act as the examining committee, or jury, at the oral examination of the thesis (see below).

At most universities, the committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with his or her primary adviser, usually after completion of the [[comprehensive examination]]s or prospectus meeting, and may consist of members of the comps committee. The committee members are doctors in their field (whether a PhD or other designation) and have the task of reading the dissertation, making suggestions for changes and improvements, and sitting in on the defense. Sometimes, at least one member of the committee must be a professor in a department that is different from that of the student.

=== Argentina ===
In the ''[[Science and technology in Argentina|Latin American docta]]'', the academic dissertation can be referred to as different stages inside the academic program that the student is seeking to achieve into a recognized [[List of universities in Argentina|Argentine University]], in all the cases the students must develop original contribution in the chosen fields by means of several paper work and essays that comprehend the body of the ''thesis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gfme.org/global_guide/pdf/13-18%20Argentina.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031095524/http://www.gfme.org/global_guide/pdf/13-18%20Argentina.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly to the academic degree, the last phase of an academic thesis is called in Spanish a ''defensa de grado'', ''defensa magistral'' or ''defensa doctoral'' in cases in which the university candidate is finalizing his or her [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]], [[Master's degree|master's]], or [[Doctorate|PhD program]]. According to a committee resolution, the dissertation can be approved or rejected by an academic committee consisting of the thesis director, the thesis coordinator, and at least one evaluator from another recognized university in which the student is pursuing his or her academic program. All the dissertation referees must already have achieved at least the academic degree that the candidate is trying to reach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?item=29&amp;apps=16&amp;id=428&amp;act=ver&amp;idioma=en Comisión Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación Universitaria {{es icon}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825184546/http://www.coneau.edu.ar/index.php?item=29&amp;apps=16&amp;id=428&amp;act=ver&amp;idioma=en |date=25 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Disputed section|Canadian Theses|date=February 2016}}

At English-speaking [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian universities]], writings presented in fulfillment of [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] coursework requirements are normally called ''papers'', ''term papers'' or ''essays''. A longer paper or essay presented for completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree is sometimes called a ''major paper''. High-quality research papers presented as the empirical study of a "postgraduate" consecutive bachelor [[honours degree|''with Honours'']] or Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree are called ''thesis'' (Honours Seminar Thesis). Major papers presented as the final project for a master's degree are normally called ''thesis''; and major papers presenting the student's research towards a [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] are called ''theses'' or ''dissertations''.

At Canadian universities under the French influenced system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca |title=Carleton University – Canada's Capital University |publisher=Carleton.ca |date= |accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; students may have a choice between presenting a "''mémoire''"', which is a shorter synthetic work (roughly 75 pages) and a ''thèse'' which is one hundred pages or more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A synthetic monograph associated with doctoral work is referred to as a "''thèse''". See also [[compilation thesis]]. Either work can be awarded a "''mention d'honneur''" (excellence) as a result of the decision by the examination committee, although these are rare.

A typical undergraduate paper or essay might be forty pages. Master's theses are approximately one hundred pages. PhD theses are usually over two hundred pages. This may vary greatly by discipline, program, college, or university. However, normally the required minimum study period is primarily depending on the complexity or quality of research requirements.

Theses Canada acquires and preserves a comprehensive collection of Canadian theses at [[Library and Archives Canada]]' (LAC) through partnership with Canadian universities who participate in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/thesescanada/index-e.html |title=Our Universities – About Theses Canada – Theses Canada Portal |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Croatia ===
At most university [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Croatia, a degree is obtained by defending a thesis after having passed all the classes specified in the degree programme. In the [[Bologna process|Bologna]] system, the bachelor's thesis, called ''završni rad'' (literally "final work" or "concluding work") is defended after 3 years of study and is about 30 pages long. Most students with bachelor's degrees continue onto master's programmes which end with a master's thesis called ''diplomski rad'' (literally "diploma work" or "graduate work"). The term dissertation is used for a doctoral degree paper (''doktorska disertacija'').

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, higher education is completed by passing all classes remaining to the educational compendium for given degree and defending a thesis. For [[bachelor]]s programme the thesis is called ''bakalářská práce'' (bachelor's thesis), for master's degrees and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees it is the ''diplomová práce'' (master's thesis), and for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree it is dissertation ''dizertační práce''. Thesis for so called Higher-Professional School (Vyšší odborná škola, VOŠ) is called ''absolventská práce''.

=== Finland ===
The following types of thesis are used in Finland (names in Finnish/Swedish):
* ''Kandidaatintutkielma/kandidatavhandling'' is the dissertation associated with lower-level academic degrees ([[bachelor's degree]]), and at [[Vocational university|universities of applied science]].
* ''Pro gradu(-tutkielma)/(avhandling )pro gradu'', colloquially referred to simply as 'gradu', is the dissertation for [[master's degrees]], which make up the majority of degrees conferred in Finland, and this is therefore the most common type of thesis submitted in the country.  The equivalent for engineering and architecture students is ''diplomityö/diplomarbete''.
* The highest-level theses are called ''lisensiaatintutkielma/licentiatavhandling'' and ''(tohtorin)väitöskirja/doktorsavhandling'', for [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] and [[Doctor (title)|doctoral]] degrees, respectively.

=== France ===
[[File:Claude Bernard's thesis for his doctorate Wellcome M0011459.jpg|thumb|The cover of the thesis presented by [[Claude Bernard]] to obtain his [[Doctorate of Medicine]] (1843).]]

In France, the academic dissertation or thesis is called a ''thèse'' and it is reserved for the final work of doctoral candidates. The minimum page length is generally (and not formally) 100 pages (or about 400,000 characters), but is usually several times longer (except for technical theses and for "exact sciences" such as physics and maths).

To complete a master's degree in research, a student is required to write a ''[[mémoire]]'', the French equivalent of a master's thesis in other higher education systems.

The word ''dissertation'' in French is reserved for shorter (1,000–2,000 words), more generic academic treatises.

The defense is called a ''soutenance''.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, an academic thesis is called ''Abschlussarbeit'' or, more specifically, the basic name of the degree complemented by ''-arbeit'' (rough translation: ''-work''; e.g., ''Diplomarbeit'', ''Masterarbeit'', ''Doktorarbeit''). For bachelor's and master's degrees, the name can alternatively be complemented by ''-thesis'' instead (e.g., ''Bachelorthesis'').

Length is often given in page count and depends upon departments, faculties, and fields of study. A bachelor's thesis is often 40–60 pages long, a diploma thesis and a master's thesis usually 60–100. The required submission for a doctorate is called a ''Dissertation'' or ''Doktorarbeit''. The submission for a [[Habilitation]], which is an academic qualification, not an academic degree, is called ''Habilitationsschrift'', not ''Habilitationsarbeit''. PhD by publication is becoming increasingly common in many fields of study{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

A doctoral degree is often earned with multiple levels of a [[Latin honors]] remark for the thesis ranging from ''summa cum laude'' (best) to ''rite'' (duly). A thesis can also be rejected with a Latin remark (''non-rite'', ''non-sufficit'' or worst as ''sub omni canone''). Bachelor's and master's theses receive [[Academic grading in Germany|numerical grades]] from 1.0 (best) to 5.0 (failed).

=== India ===
In India the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}} ([[Latin]] for "by live voice") examination (''viva'' in short). Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners and the candidate. One examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |title=MSc Engg and PhD in IISc |publisher=Ece.iisc.ernet.in |date= |accessdate=24 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111192137/http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, PG Qualifications such as MSc Physics accompanies submission of dissertation in Part I and submission of a Project (a working model of an innovation) in Part II. Engineering qualifications such as BTech, B.E., MTech or M.E. also involves submission of dissertation. In all the cases, the dissertation can be extended for summer internship at certain [[research and development]] organizations or also as PhD synopsis.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the term thesis is used specifically to refer to master's theses. The undergraduate thesis is called ''skripsi'', while the doctoral dissertation is called ''disertasi''. In general, those three terms are usually called as ''tugas akhir'' (final assignment), which is mandatory for the completion of a degree. Undergraduate students usually begin to write their final assignment in their third, fourth or fifth enrollment year, depends on the requirements of their respective disciplines and universities. In some universities, students are required to write a ''proposal skripsi'' or ''proposal tesis'' (thesis proposal) before they could write their final assignment. If the thesis proposal is considered to fulfill the qualification by the academic examiners, students then may proceed to write their final assignment.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, usually students are required to present a thesis in their Master's degree and a dissertation in their Doctorate degree, both of which requiring the students to defend their research before a committee and gaining their approval. Most of the norms and rules of writing a thesis or a dissertation are influenced by the French higher education system.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

=== Italy ===
In Italy there are normally three types of thesis. In order of complexity: one for the Laurea (equivalent to the UK Bachelor's Degree), another one for the Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to the UK Master's Degree) and then a thesis to complete the Dottorato di Ricerca (PhD). Thesis requirements vary greatly between degrees and disciplines, ranging from as low as 3–4 ECTS credits to more than 30. Thesis work is mandatory for the completion of a degree.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysian universities often follow the British model for dissertations and degrees. However, a few universities follow the United States model for theses and dissertations. Some public universities have both British and US style PhD programmes. Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, at undergraduate level the thesis is usually called final year project, as it is completed in the senior year of the degree, the name project usually implies that the work carried out is less extensive than a thesis and bears lesser credit hours too. The undergraduate level project is presented through an elaborate written report and a presentation to the advisor, a board of faculty members and students. At graduate level however, i.e. in MS, some universities allow students to accomplish a project of 6 credits or a thesis of 9 credits, at least one publication &lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=noprint Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt; is normally considered enough for the awarding of the degree with project and is considered mandatory for the awarding of a degree with thesis. A written report and a public thesis defense is mandatory, in the presence of a board of senior researchers, consisting of members from an outside organization or a university. A PhD candidate is supposed to accomplish extensive research work to fulfill the dissertation requirements with international publications being a mandatory requirement. The defense of the research work is done publicly.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, an academic thesis is named by the degree, such as bachelor/undergraduate thesis or masteral thesis. However, in [[Philippine English]], the term ''doctorate'' is typically replaced with ''doctoral'' (as in the case of "doctoral dissertation"), though in official documentation the former is still used. The terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are commonly used interchangeably in everyday language yet it generally understood that a ''thesis'' refers to bachelor/undergraduate and master academic work while a ''dissertation'' is named for doctorate work.

The Philippine system is influenced by American collegiate system, in that it requires a ''research project'' to be submitted before being allowed to write a thesis. This project is mostly given as a prerequisite writing course to the actual thesis and is accomplished in the term period before; supervision is provided by one professor assigned to a class. This project is later to be presented in front of an academic panel, often the entire faculty of an academic department, with their recommendations contributing to the acceptance, revision, or rejection of the initial topic. In addition, the presentation of the research project will help the candidate choose their primary thesis adviser.

An undergraduate thesis is completed in the final year of the degree alongside existing seminar (lecture) or laboratory courses, and is often divided into two presentations: ''proposal'' and ''thesis'' presentations (though this varies across universities), whereas a master thesis or doctorate dissertation is accomplished in the last term alone and is defended once. In most universities, a thesis is required for the bestowment of a degree to a candidate alongside a number of units earned throughout their academic period of stay, though for practice and skills-based degrees a ''practicum'' and a written report can be achieved instead. The examination board often consists of 3 to 5 examiners, often professors in a university (with a Masters or PhD degree) depending on the university's examination rules. Required word length, complexity, and contribution to scholarship varies widely across universities in the country.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, a bachelor's degree usually requires a ''praca licencjacka'' (bachelor's thesis) or the similar level degree in engineering requires a ''praca inżynierska'' (engineer's thesis/bachelor's thesis), the master's degree requires a ''praca magisterska'' (master's thesis). The academic dissertation for a PhD is called a ''dysertacja'' or ''praca doktorska''. The submission for the [[Habilitation]] is called ''praca habilitacyjna" or ''dysertacja habilitacyjna". Thus the term ''dysertacja'' is reserved for PhD and Habilitation degrees. All the theses need to be "defended" by the author during a special examination for the given degree. Examinations for PhD and Habilitation degrees are public.

=== Portugal and Brazil ===
In Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation (''dissertação'') is required for completion of a master. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis (''tese'') is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours. The examination board typically involves 5 to 6 scholars (including the advisor) or other experts with a PhD degree (generally at least half of them must be external to the university where the candidate defends the thesis, but it may depend on the University). Each university / faculty defines the length of these documents, and it can vary also in respect to the domains (a thesis in fields like philosophy, history, geography, etc., usually has more pages than a thesis in mathematics, computer science, statistics, etc.) but typical numbers of pages are around 60–80 for MSc and 150–250 for PhD.{{Citation needed|reason=The number of pages can change a lot depending on the universities and the domains. Furthermore, 60 pages for a master's dissertation seems really wrong. I would say that the minimum is around 90. For instance, I accessed some master's dissertations randomly on the University of São Paulo's web site (http://www.teses.usp.br/index.php?option=com_jumi&amp;fileid=11&amp;Itemid=76&amp;lang=en) and they had between 100 and 200 pages.|date=August 2018}}

In Brazil the Undergraduate Thesis is called ''TCC'' or ''Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso'' (Course Conclusion Work).

=== Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine ===
In Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine an academic dissertation or thesis is called what can be literally translated as a "master's degree work" (thesis), whereas the word ''dissertation'' is reserved for doctoral theses ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). To complete a master's degree, a student is required to write a thesis and to then defend the work publicly. The length of this manuscript usually is given in page count and depends upon educational institution, its departments, faculties, and fields of study {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Slovenia ===
At universities in Slovenia, an academic thesis called ''diploma thesis'' is a prerequisite for completing undergraduate studies. The thesis used to be 40–60 pages long, but has been reduced to 20–30 pages in new [[Bologna process]] programmes. To complete Master's studies, a candidate must write ''magistrsko delo'' (Master's thesis) that is longer and more detailed than the undergraduate thesis. The required submission for the doctorate is called ''doktorska disertacija'' (doctoral dissertation). In pre Bologna programmes students were able to skip the preparation and presentation of a Master's thesis and continue straightforward towards doctorate.

=== Slovakia ===
In Slovakia, higher education is completed by defending a thesis, which is called ''bachelor's thesis'' "bakalárska práca" for bachelors programme, master's thesis or "diplomová práca" for master's degrees, and also doctor of medicine or dentistry degrees and dissertation "dizertačná práca" for Philosophiae doctor (PhD.) degree.

=== Sweden ===
[[File:Licentiate thesis from Chalmers, Sweden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of a Licentiate dissertation in Sweden]]
In Sweden, there are different types of theses. Practices and definitions vary between fields but commonly include the ''C thesis''/Bachelor thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies, ''D thesis''/'/[[Magister degree#Sweden|Magister]]/one year master's thesis, which corresponds to 15 HP or 10 weeks of independent studies and ''E Thesis''/two-year master's thesis, which corresponds to 30 HP or 20 weeks of independent studies. After that there are two types of post graduate degrees, Licentiate dissertation and PhD dissertation. A licentiate degree is approximately "half a PhD" in terms of size and scope of the thesis. Swedish PhD studies should in theory last for four years, including course work and thesis work, but as many PhD students also teach, the PhD often takes longer to complete.

=== United Kingdom ===
Outside the academic community, the terms ''thesis'' and ''dissertation'' are interchangeable. At universities in the United Kingdom, the term ''thesis'' is usually associated with PhD/[[EngD]] ([[doctorate|doctoral]]) and research master's degrees, while ''dissertation'' is the more common term for a substantial project submitted as part of a taught master's degree or an [[undergraduate degree]] (e.g. [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], BSc, [[BMus]], BEd, [[BEng]] etc.).

Thesis word lengths may differ by faculty/department and are set by individual universities.

A wide range of supervisory arrangements can be found in the British academy, from single supervisors (more usual for undergraduate and Masters level work) to supervisory teams of up to three supervisors. In teams, there will often be a Director of Studies, usually someone with broader experience (perhaps having passed some threshold of successful supervisions). The Director may be involved with regular supervision along with the other supervisors, or may have more of an oversight role, with the other supervisors taking on the more day-to-day responsibilities of supervision.

=== United States ===
In some U.S. doctoral programs, the "dissertation" can take up the major part of the student's total time spent (along with two or three years of classes) and may take years of full-time work to complete. At most universities, ''dissertation'' is the term for the required submission for the doctorate, and ''thesis'' refers only to the master's degree requirement.

''Thesis'' is also used to describe a cumulative project for a bachelor's degree and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an [[Latin honors|honors]] academic designation. These projects are called "senior projects" or "senior theses"; they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student teaching period (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master's thesis, they are not as long and they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They may or may not be defended before a committee but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations.

Specific undergraduate courses, especially writing-intensive courses or courses taken by upperclassmen, may also require one or more extensive written assignments referred to variously as theses, essays, or papers. Increasingly, high schools are requiring students to complete a senior project or senior thesis on a chosen topic during the final year as a prerequisite for graduation. The [[extended essay]] component of the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme]], offered in a growing number of American high schools, is another example of this trend.

Generally speaking, a dissertation is judged as to whether or not it makes an original and unique contribution to scholarship. Lesser projects (a master's thesis, for example) are judged by whether or not they demonstrate mastery of available scholarship in the presentation of an idea.{{dubious|date=January 2014}}

The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis may vary significantly among universities or programs.

== Thesis examinations ==
One of the requirements for certain advanced degrees is often an oral examination (called a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' examination or just ''viva'' in the UK and certain other English-speaking countries). This examination normally occurs after the dissertation is finished but before it is submitted to the university, and may comprise a presentation (often public) by the student and questions posed by an examining committee or jury. In North America, an initial oral examination in the field of specialization may take place just before the student settles down to work on the dissertation. An additional oral exam may take place after the dissertation is completed and is known as a '''thesis''' or '''dissertation''' "'''defense'''", which at some universities may be a mere formality and at others may result in the student being required to make significant revisions.

=== Examination results ===
The result of the examination may be given immediately following deliberation by the examiners (in which case the candidate may immediately be considered to have received his or her degree), or at a later date, in which case the examiners may prepare a defense report that is forwarded to a Board or Committee of Postgraduate Studies, which then officially recommends the candidate for the degree.

Potential decisions (or "verdicts") include:

* Accepted/pass with no corrections.
: The thesis is accepted as presented. A grade may be awarded, though in many countries PhDs are not graded at all, and in others, only one of the theoretically possible grades (the highest) is ever used in practice.

* The thesis must be revised.
: Revisions (for example, correction of numerous grammatical or spelling errors; clarification of concepts or methodology; an addition of sections) are required. One or more members of the jury or the thesis supervisor will make the decision on the acceptability of revisions and provide written confirmation that they have been satisfactorily completed. If, as is often the case, the needed revisions are relatively modest, the examiners may all sign the thesis with the verbal understanding that the candidate will review the revised thesis with his or her supervisor before submitting the completed version.

* Extensive revision required.
: The thesis must be revised extensively and undergo the evaluation and defense process again from the beginning with the same examiners. Problems may include theoretical or methodological issues. A candidate who is not recommended for the degree after the second defense must normally withdraw from the program.

* Unacceptable.
: The thesis is unacceptable and the candidate must withdraw from the program. This verdict is given only when the thesis requires major revisions and when the examination makes it clear that the candidate is incapable of making such revisions.

At most North American institutions the latter two verdicts are extremely rare, for two reasons. First, to obtain the status of doctoral candidates, graduate students typically write a qualifying examination or comprehensive examination, which often includes an oral defense. Students who pass the qualifying examination are deemed capable of completing scholarly work independently and are allowed to proceed with working on a dissertation. Second, since the thesis supervisor (and the other members of the advisory committee) will normally have reviewed the thesis extensively before recommending the student proceed to the defense, such an outcome would be regarded as a major failure not only on the part of the candidate but also by the candidate's supervisor (who should have recognized the substandard quality of the dissertation long before the defense was allowed to take place). It is also fairly rare for a thesis to be accepted without any revisions; the most common outcome of a defense is for the examiners to specify minor revisions (which the candidate typically completes in a few days or weeks).

At universities on the British pattern it is not uncommon for theses at the ''viva'' stage to be subject to major revisions in which a substantial rewrite is required, sometimes followed by a new ''viva''. Very rarely, the thesis may be awarded the lesser degree of M.Phil ([[Master of Philosophy]]) instead, preventing the candidate from resubmitting the thesis.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, doctoral theses are usually examined by three examiners although some, like the [[Australian Catholic University]] and the [[University of New South Wales]], have shifted to using only two examiners; without a live defense except in extremely rare exceptions. In the case of a master's degree by research the thesis is usually examined by only two examiners. Typically one of these examiners will be from within the candidate's own department; the other(s) will usually be from other universities and often from overseas. Following submission of the thesis, copies are sent by mail to examiners and then reports sent back to the institution.

Similar to a master's degree by research thesis, a thesis for the research component of a master's degree by coursework is also usually examined by two examiners, one from the candidate's department and one from another university. For an Honours year, which is a fourth year in addition to the usual three-year bachelor's degree, the thesis is also examined by two examiners, though both are usually from the candidate's own department. Honours and Master's theses sometimes require an oral defense before they are accepted.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, a thesis is usually examined with an oral examination. This applies to almost all [[Diplom]], [[Magister (degree)|Magister]], master's and doctoral degrees as well as to most bachelor's degrees. However, a process that allows for revisions of the thesis is usually only implemented for doctoral degrees.

There are several different kinds of oral examinations used in practice. The ''Disputation'', also called ''Verteidigung'' ("defense"), is usually public (at least to members of the university) and is focused on the topic of the thesis. In contrast, the ''Rigorosum'' is not held in public and also encompasses fields in addition to the topic of the thesis. The ''Rigorosum'' is only common for doctoral degrees. Another term for an oral examination is ''Kolloquium'', which generally refers to a usually public scientific discussion and is often used synonymously with ''Verteidigung''.

In each case, what exactly is expected differs between universities and between faculties. Some universities also demand a combination of several of these forms.

=== Malaysia ===
Like the British model, the PHD or MPhil student is required to submit their theses or dissertation for examination by two or three examiners. The first examiner is from the university concerned, the second examiner is from another local university and the third examiner is from a suitable foreign university (usually from Commonwealth countries). The choice of examiners must be approved by the university senate. In some public universities, a PhD or MPhil candidate may also have to show a number publications in peer reviewed academic journals as part of the requirement. An oral viva is conducted after the examiners have submitted their reports to the university. The oral viva session is attended by the Oral Viva chairman, a rapporteur with a PhD qualification, the first examiner, the second examiner and sometimes the third examiner.

Branch campuses of British, Australian and Middle East universities in Malaysia use the respective models of the home campuses to examine their PhD or MPhil candidates.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, a thesis is followed by an oral defense. In most universities, this applies to all bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees. However, the oral defense is held in once per semester (usually in the middle or by the end) with a presentation of revisions (so-called "plenary presentation") at the end of each semester. The oral defense is typically not held in public for bachelor and master oral defenses, however a colloquium is held for doctorate degrees.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a thesis is examined with an oral defense, which includes an initial presentation by the candidate followed by an extensive questioning/answering period. Typical duration for the total exam is 1 hour 30 minutes for the MSc and 3 hours for the PhD.

=== North America ===
In North America, the ''thesis defense'' or ''oral defense'' is the final examination for [[Doctorate|doctoral]] candidates, and sometimes for [[master's degree|master's]] candidates.

The examining committee normally consists of the thesis committee, usually a given number of professors mainly from the student's university plus his or her primary supervisor, an [[external examiner]] (someone not otherwise connected to the university), and a chair person. Each committee member will have been given a completed copy of the dissertation prior to the defense, and will come prepared to ask questions about the thesis itself and the subject matter. In many schools, master's thesis defenses are restricted to the examinee and the examiners, but doctoral defenses are open to the public.

The typical format will see the candidate giving a short (20–40-minute) presentation of his or her research, followed by one to two hours of questions.

At some U.S. institutions, a longer public lecture (known as a "thesis talk" or "thesis seminar") by the candidate will accompany the defense itself, in which case only the candidate, the examiners, and other members of the faculty may attend the actual defense.

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
A student in Ukraine or Russia has to complete a thesis and then defend it in front of their department. Sometimes the defense meeting is made up of the learning institute's professionals and sometimes the students peers are allowed to view or join in. After the presentation and defense of the thesis, the final conclusion of the department should be that none of them have reservations on the content and quality of the thesis.

A conclusion on the thesis has to be approved by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the educational institute. This conclusion (final grade so to speak) of the thesis can be defended/argued not only at the thesis council, but also in any other thesis council of Russia or Ukraine.

=== Spain ===
The [[:es:Diploma de Estudios Avanzados|Diploma de estudios avanzados]] (DEA) can last two years and candidates must complete coursework and demonstrate their ability to research the specific topics they have studied. After completing this part of the PhD, students begin a dissertation on a set topic. The dissertation must reach a minimum length depending on the subject and it is valued more highly if it contains field research. Once candidates have finished their written dissertations, they must present them before a committee. Following this presentation, the examiners will ask questions.

=== United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the thesis defense is called a {{lang|la|viva voce}}  ([[Latin]] for "by live voice") examination (''viva'' for short). A typical ''viva'' lasts for approximately 3 hours, though there is no formal time limit. Involved in the ''viva'' are two examiners and the candidate. Usually, one examiner is an academic from the candidate's own university department (but not one of the candidate's supervisors) and the other is an [[external examiner]] from a different university. Increasingly, the examination may involve a third academic, the 'chair'; this person, from the candidate's institution, acts as an impartial observer with oversight of the examination process to ensure that the examination is fair. The 'chair' does not ask academic questions of the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Lynne (2005) ''How to Examine a Thesis'', McGraw-Hill International, pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, there are only two or at most three examiners, and in many universities the examination is held in private. The candidate's primary supervisor is not permitted to ask or answer questions during the viva, and their presence is not necessary. However, some universities permit members of the faculty or the university to attend. At the University of Oxford, for instance, any member of the University may attend a DPhil viva (the University's regulations require that details of the examination and its time and place be published formally in advance) provided he or she attends in full academic dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |title=Oxford University Examination Regulations, 2007 |publisher=Admin.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=24 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113002548/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/25-54_1_Regulations_governing_the_content_and_length_of_theses.shtml#subtitle_2 |archive-date=13 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submission ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
A submission of the thesis is the last formal requirement for most students after the defense. By the final [[time limit|deadline]], the student must submit a complete copy of the thesis to the appropriate body within the accepting institution, along with the appropriate forms, bearing the signatures of the primary supervisor, the examiners, and, in some cases, the head of the student's department. Other required forms may include library authorizations (giving the university library permission to make the thesis available as part of its collection) and [[copyright]] permissions (in the event that the student has incorporated copyrighted materials in the thesis). Many large scientific publishing houses (e.g. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], [[Elsevier]]) use copyright agreements that allow the authors to incorporate their published articles into dissertations without separate authorization.

Failure to submit the thesis by the deadline may result in graduation (and granting of the degree) being delayed. At most U.S. institutions, there will also be various fees (for binding, microfilming, copyright registration, and the like), which must be paid before the degree will be granted.

Once all the paperwork is in order, copies of the thesis may be made available in one or more university [[Library|libraries]]. Specialist abstracting services exist to publicize the content of these beyond the institutions in which they are produced. Many institutions now insist on submission of digitized as well as printed copies of theses; the digitized versions of successful theses are often made available online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[aviation]] training, a '''view-limiting device''' simulates [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC) by restricting a pilot's [[field of view]] only to the [[Control panel (engineering)|instrument panel]]. They are worn by pilots who are working toward an [[instrument rating]], which allows a pilot to fly into conditions that are less than favorable for [[visual flight]].  They are also used by instrument-rated pilots for practicing instrument flight to maintain currency for acting as pilot in command under [[instrument flight rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Although there are slight variations between the states, most children in Year 3 are aged between eight and nine.&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mceetya.edu.au/verve/_resources/Volume_1_CSSA_Final_Report.pdf|title=Cost/Benefit Analysis Relating to the Implementation of a Common School Starting Age and Associated Nomenclature by 1 January 2010|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Atelier Learning Solutions Pty Ltd|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, Year 3 is the third year of compulsory education. Children are aged seven or eight in this year group.
&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamup.co.nz/Child/SchoolEducation/SchoolBasics/SchoolYearsAndLevels.aspx|title=School years and levels|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Ministry of Education|work=Team-up website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year 3 pupils are usually educated in [[Primary school]]s or in [[Area school]]s.&lt;ref name="NZ2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamup.co.nz/Child/SchoolEducation/SchoolBasics/TypesOfSchools.aspx|title=Types of schools|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Ministry of Education|work=Team-up website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
===England===
In schools in England Year 3 is the third year after [[Reception (school)|Reception]]. It is the third full year of compulsory education, with children being admitted who are aged 7 before 1 September in any given academic year. It is also the first year of [[Key Stage 2]] in which the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] is taught.&lt;ref name="ncuk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curriculum.qca.org.uk/key-stages-1-and-2/Values-aims-and-purposes/about-the-primary-curriculum/index.aspx|title=About the primary curriculum|accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year 3 is usually the fourth year of [[primary school]] or the first year group in a [[Junior School]]. In some areas of England, Year 3 is the final or penultimate year group in [[First school]].

===Wales===
In schools in Wales Year 3 is the third year after [[Reception (school)|Reception]]. It is currently the third full year of compulsory education, with children being admitted who are aged 7 before 1 September in any given academic year. It is the first year group in [[Key Stage 2]].&lt;ref name="wales"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/educationandskills/parents/whatwillchildlearn/?lang=en|title=What will your child learn? |accessdate=2009-01-10|publisher=Welsh Assembly Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
