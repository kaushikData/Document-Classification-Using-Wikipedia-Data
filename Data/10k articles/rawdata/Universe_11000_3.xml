The '''Armech Thermal Power Station''' (ATPS), is a planned [[Waste|waste powered]] electricity power station in [[Ghana]], with a proposed installed capacity of {{convert|60|MW}}.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2 April 2018 |date=26 March 2018 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201803260775.html |title=Africa: Armech Africa to Build US$300 Million Waste-to-Energy Plant in Tema |newspaper=[[Ghanaian Times]] via [[AllAfrica.com]] |location=Accra |author=Ghanaian Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The facility would be located in the industrial area of the city of [[Tema]],&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; approximately {{convert|30|km|0}}, by road, east of [[Accra]], the largest city and capital of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=2 April 2018 |date=2 April 2018 |url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Ghana_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Accra%2C%20Ghana&amp;toplace=Tema%2C%20Ghana&amp;dt1=ChIJc6e3soSQ3w8R0y0OZdhO0b4&amp;dt2=ChIJKT4NQKV4IBARi0gmQF1L38w |title=Distance between Accra, Ghana and Tema, Ghana |publisher=Globefeed.com | last=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Armech Thermal Power Station is a waste-to-energy (W2E) power plant located in Tema, Ghana's largest sea-port. The waste that will be burned to generate the electricity, will be sourced from several metropolitan and municipal assemblies in the [[Greater Accra Region]]. These include [[Accra]], [[Tema]], [[Ga South Municipal District]], [[Ga East Municipal District]], and [[La Dade Kotopon Municipal District]]. The Ghana Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development is a collaborator on this development.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The development of this power station is in response to the unsatisfactory waste-management environment in the Greater Accra area, particularly among the low-income communities. The dangers that these communities face include (a) bio-degraded waste that contains parasites and disease-causing microbes (b) [[leachate| toxic leachate]] which seeps from landfills into the water table and (c) the toxic emissions from landfill burning.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The poor environmental sanitation, leads to stagnation of drainage water and the breeding of disease-spreading mosquitoes. In the Greater Accra Area, 3.5 million malaria cases are recorded every year, with 900,000 of them occurring among children of less than five years of age, as of March 2018.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The power generated will be sold to the [[Electricity Company of Ghana]], for integration into the national electricity grid.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Construction==
The power station is being built by ''Armech Africa Limited''. The main contractor is [[Energy China]], with money borrowed from [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]]. The construction cost is budgeted at US$300 million.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; This project represents the first grid-ready waste-to-energy project in the countries of the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. There are plans to develop a second waste-to-energy plant in [[Kumasi]], in the [[Ashanti Region]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

The '''Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant''' is located 2.5 miles (4&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of the [[Clifton Court Forebay]] and 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Tracy, CA]]. The plant is the first pumping plant for the [[California Aqueduct]] and the [[South Bay Aqueduct]]. It provides the necessary [[Hydraulic head|fluid head (potential energy)]] for the [[California Aqueduct]] to flow for approximately 80 miles (130&amp;nbsp;km) south past the [[O'Neill Forebay]] and the [[San Luis Reservoir]] to the [[Dos Amigos Pumping Plant]]. The Banks Pumping Plant initially flows into the [[Bethany Reservoir]]. It is from the [[Bethany Reservoir]] that the [[South Bay Aqueduct]] begins. 

The [[John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility]] is located 2 miles upstream from the facility and prevents fishes from reaching the pumping plant.&lt;ref&gt;https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2008/06/05/where-water-runs-uphill/&lt;/ref&gt;

Limits on water pumping from the Sacramento Delta is a politically contentious issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/water-and-drought/delta/article122434249.html&lt;/ref&gt; In dry years, water pumped from the Delta creates a hazard to spring-run [[salmon]]. As the Banks Pumping Plant pulls water from the Sacramento River southward across the Delta, it disrupts the normal flow direction of east to west that salmon [[Juvenile fish|smolt]] follow to the Pacific Ocean. Populations of salmon and [[steelhead trout]] have reached critically low levels in the decades after SWP water withdrawals began. The fish migration issue has become hotly contested in recent years, with rising support for the construction of the [[Peripheral Canal]], which would divert water around the Delta, restoring the natural flow direction.

==Characteristics==
* Number of units: 11
* Normal static head: 236 to 252&amp;nbsp;ft (72 to 77 m)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lvmwd.com/for-customers/education/the-journey-your-water-takes/little-drop-s-journey/harvey-o-banks-pumping-plant&lt;/ref&gt;
* Total flow at design head: 10,920&amp;nbsp;ft³/s (302 m³/s) (21,659 acre-feet/day)
* Total motor rating: 333,000&amp;nbsp;hp (248 MW)

'''''Brehms Tierleben''''' (English title: ''Brehm's Animal Life'') is a scientific reference book, first published in the 1860s by [[Alfred Brehm|Alfred Edmund Brehm]] (1829&amp;ndash;1884).

== Publishing history ==

As a freelance writer, Brehm furnished [[Popular science magazines|popular-scientific magazines]] with [[essays]] and [[travel journal|travelogues]].  Because of his success in doing this, in 1860 he was commissioned to write a 10-volume [[zoological]] encyclopedia. Journeys to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]] both interrupted and enriched the work.  The first six volumes of the encyclopedia, published under the title ''Illustrirtes Thierleben'', appeared from 1864 to 1869, published by the [[Bibliographisches Institut]] under [[Herrmann Julius Meyer]].  Illustrated under the direction of [[Robert Kretschmer]] (1818&amp;ndash;1872), they met with wide approval from the educated [[bourgeoisie]].

As of the second edition, which consisted of ten volumes published from 1876 to 1879, the work was already titled ''Brehms Tierleben''. The work made Brehm famous around the world and its title is still a
catchphrase today, even though science has gone far beyond Brehm.  Perhaps the greatest change in the second edition was the addition of new illustrations by [[Gustav Mützel]], the brothers [[August Specht|August]] and [[Friedrich Specht]] and others, which [[Charles Darwin]] said were the best he had ever seen. The second edition was reprinted from 1882 to 1884, and a third edition, published from 1890 to 1893, followed. The work has been translated into various languages.  Editions have continued to appear into the 20th century, especially in the form of abridged, one-volume works.

== Note on the title ==

The title was at its time written "Brehms Thierleben" (or respectively, "Illustrirtes Thierleben"), and is in Germany historicisingly usually still cited in that way. The spelling reform of 1901 did away with the exception of writing "Thier" with ''th'', which never means the English ''th'' sound in this context. (Similarly, the adjective in the original title would now be written "illustr''ie''rtes".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">The '''British Electricity Authority''' (BEA) was established as the central British electricity authority&lt;ref&gt;Katzarov. _Theory of Nationalization_ (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012). https://books.google.ae/books?id=M9HoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=Electricity+Act+1947&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dKN5DoV9kE&amp;sig=dMR4dYCJxfygLJ_eunt2NNu4Uy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCWoVChMIqMvb7cCPxgIVylUUCh1zYABF#v=onepage&amp;q=Electricity%20Act%201947&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 under the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Great Britain]]'s electricity supply industry. It was created under the [[Electricity Act 1947]]. The Authority took over the operations of over 600 small public supply power companies, [[municipal]] authority electricity departments and the [[Central Electricity Board]] to form the BEA, which comprised a central authority and 14 area boards. The BEA was responsible for the generation, distribution and sale of electricity to users, its duty was to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity supply.&lt;ref&gt;Electricity Act 1947 Section 1&lt;/ref&gt; It did not include control of the [[North of Scotland Hydro Board]], which remained independent of the BEA.

==Area boards==
The new area boards were:
# [[East Midlands Electricity Board]] (EMEB)
# [[Eastern Electricity Board]] (EEB)
# [[London Electricity Board]] (LEB)
# [[Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board]] (MANWEB)
# [[Midlands Electricity Board]] (MEB)
# [[North Eastern Electricity Board]] (NEEB)
# [[North Western Electricity Board]] (NORWEB)
# [[South East Scotland Electricity Board]] 
# [[South Eastern Electricity Board]] (SEEBOARD)
# [[South Wales Electricity Board]] (SWALEC)
# [[South West Scotland Electricity Board]] 
# [[South Western Electricity Board]] (SWEB)
# [[Southern Electricity Board]] (SEB)
# [[Yorkshire Electricity Board]] (YEB)

==Formation of the Central Electricity Authority==
As a result of the [[Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954]], the British Electricity Authority was replaced on 1 April 1955 by the [[Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA) for England and Wales. At the same time, the two South of Scotland Area Boards and the associated electricity generation and distribution plant were merged into the [[South of Scotland Electricity Board]] (SSEB) to form an integrated electricity board responsible for generation, distribution and electricity supply in southern and central Scotland.

[[File:The Brown Ocean Effect.webm|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Before [[Tropical Storm Bill (2015)|Tropical Storm Bill]] made landfall over Texas, eastern Texas experienced several days of rain that began flooding areas to the south east and northern parts of the state. As Tropical Storm Bill moved northward through Texas it is hypothesized that it fed off the highly saturated ground (as if it were still over the ocean) and can be seen slightly in/tensifying (via winds) as it moved into Oklahoma and progressed to the northeast.&lt;/small&gt;]]
The '''brown ocean effect''' is an observed weather phenomenon involving [[tropical cyclone]]s after [[landfall]].  They are commonly expected to lose energy when they make landfall, but instead maintain strength or intensify over land surfaces.&lt;ref name=WUJun15&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these systems are highly common in the United States and China, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) names Australia the most conducive environment after 30 years of research. In Australia, such storm systems are called ''agukabams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
One source of the brown ocean effect has been identified as the large amount of [[Latent heat#Meteorology|latent heat]] that can be released from extremely wet soils.&lt;ref name=WUJun15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WUJun15 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/main/index.html 2013 NASA study] found that, from 1979-2008, 45 of 227 tropical storms either gained or maintained strength after making landfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release stated, "The land essentially mimics the moisture-rich environment of the ocean, where the storm originated." Originally, research devoted to [[extratropical cyclone]]s, storms that first derive energy from the warm ocean waters and later from the conjecture of various air masses, explained the intensification of storms after landfall.&lt;ref name="NASA2013" /&gt; However, as research into these storms persists, Andersen and Shepherd, the two leading scientists behind the NASA study, discovered that some of these storms were not transitioning from warm-core to cold-core but were actually maintaining their warm-core dynamics, while ultimately outputting a greater measure of rainfall.&lt;ref name="NASA2013" /&gt; 

In order for the brown ocean effect to take place, three land conditions must be met: "First, the lower level of the atmosphere mimics a tropical atmosphere with minimal variation in temperature. Second, soils in the vicinity of the storms need to contain ample moisture. Finally, evaporation of the soil moisture releases latent heat, which the team found must measure at least 70 watts averaged per square meter."&lt;ref name="NASA2013" /&gt; Storm systems impacted by the brown ocean effect gave rise to a new sub-category of tropical storm type called ''Tropical Cyclone Maintenance and Intensification Event'' or TCMI.&lt;ref name=NASA2013&gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study concluded that latent surface heat flux from land surfaces actually have the potential to be larger than from the ocean, albeit for brief periods only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Examples==

&lt;!--Seriously, start including other basins--&gt;
[[File:Tropical Storm Allison- Eye.jpg|thumb|Allison with an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]]-like feature over Mississippi.]]

[[2001 Atlantic hurricane season|2001]]'s [[Tropical Storm Allison]] spent a dozen days in June meandering slowly across the [[Southeastern United States]] from Texas to the Carolinas, generating torrential rains and looking much healthier over land than it would over the ocean prior to landfall and subsequent of departure.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}

[[Tropical Storm Erin (2007)|Tropical Storm Erin]] of 2007 is an example of the effect, when the storm intensified over central Texas, eventually forming an eye over [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=WUJun15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/2011MWR3593.1|url=https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/opinion/clark-evans-ncar|title=Sensitivity in the Overland Reintensification of Tropical Cyclone Erin (2007) to Near-Surface Soil Moisture Characteristics|authors=Clark Evans, Russ S.

Erin really brought attention to the inland intensification of tropical cyclones."&lt;ref name="NASA2013" /&gt;

[[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)]] upon landfall over the Florida mainland strengthened to near hurricane strength and briefly forming an eye-like feature before weakening. The cause of this was the waterlogged terrain of South Florida specifically Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liveweatherblogs.com/prometweatherblogs/3/2/1558/Fay....Wednesday-Midday-Update]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible case is [[Tropical Storm Bill (2015)|Tropical Storm Bill]] of [[2015 Atlantic hurricane season|2015]], when [[2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak|saturated soil conditions]] sustained the system for a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/longlived-bill-meets-its-demise-in-midatlantic.html|title=Long-Lived Bill Meets its Demise in Mid-Atlantic |author=Bob Henson |date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season|2016]], Tropical Depression Eleven made landfall in Eastern Florida. While over land, it became the first tropical cyclone to reach tropical storm strength while over Florida, where it was named ''[[Tropical Storm Julia (2016)|Julia]]''.

One possible case in the southern hemisphere is [[Cyclone Kelvin|Tropical Cyclone Kelvin]] in [[2017–18 Australian region cyclone season|2018]]. Shortly after making landfall over [[Western Australia]], Kelvin developed a clear [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and continued strengthening despite moving over the [[Great Sandy Desert]], where most tropical cyclones rapidly weaken.

[[Tropical Storm Alberto (2018)|Tropical Storm Alberto]] of [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season|2018]] is another example of the brown ocean effect. The storm sustained it's strength as a Tropical Depression after landfall, lasting for an additional three days after its landfall. Alberto became one of only eleven cyclones to reach [[Lake Huron]] as a tropical depression.&lt;ref name="TWN"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wenckstern |first1=Erin |title=The strangeness of Alberto: Making history over Great Lakes |url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/subtropical-storm-alberto-remnants-tropical-depression-great-lakes-florida-michigan-ontario-strange-hurricane-season-atlantic-ocean/102686|publisher=The Weather Network |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7155">'''Carbon nanofoam''' is an [[allotropes of carbon|allotrope of carbon]] discovered in 1997 by [[Andrei V. Rode]] and co-workers at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name="Rode1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rode|first=A.V.|author2=Hyde, S.T. |author3=Gamaly, E.G. |author4=Elliman, R.G. |author5=McKenzie, D.R. |author6= Bulcock, S. |title=Structural analysis of a carbon foam formed by high pulse-rate laser ablation|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science &amp; Processing|year=1999|volume=69|issue=7|pages=S755–S758|doi=10.1007/s003390051522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web. The material is extremely light, with a density of 2–10&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.0012&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Rode1999"/&gt;&lt;!-- note the ref states that the density is (2–10) kg/cm3, but that can't be right. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zani|first=A.|author2=Dellasega, D. |author3=Russo, V. |author4= Passoni, M. |title=Ultra-low density carbon foams produced by pulsed laser deposition|journal=Carbon|volume=56|pages=358–365|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2013.01.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gallon of nanofoam weighs about a quarter of an ounce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kenneth Chang |title=A Flaky New Carbon: It's Feather Light and Magnetic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/06/science/a-flaky-new-carbon-it-s-feather-light-and-magnetic.html |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon [[atom]]s linked in [[graphite]]-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of [[heptagon]]s among the regular [[hexagon]]al pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of [[buckminsterfullerene]]s, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of [[pentagon]]s.

The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an [[aerogel]], but with 1% of the density of previously produced [[aerogel#Carbon|carbon aerogels]]—or only a few times the density of [[air]] at [[sea level]]. Unlike [[carbon aerogel]]s, carbon nanofoam is a poor [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductor]]. The nanofoam contains numerous [[unpaired electron]]s, which Rode and colleagues propose is due to carbon atoms with only three bonds that are found at topological and bonding defects. This gives rise to what is perhaps carbon nanofoam's most unusual feature: it is attracted to magnets, and [[Curie point|below −183 °C]] can itself be made magnetic.

'''China Airlines Flight 676''' (CAL676, CI676) was a scheduled international passenger flight that crashed into a road and residential area in Tayuan, Taoyuan County (now [[Taoyuan City]]), near [[Taoyuan International Airport|Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] (present-day Taoyuan International Airport), Taiwan on the night of Monday, 16 February 1998.

The [[Airbus A300]] jet liner was en route from [[Ngurah Rai Airport]] in [[Bali]], Indonesia to Taipei, Taiwan. The weather was inclement with rain and fog when the aircraft approached Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, so the pilot executed a [[Go-around|missed approach]]. After the jet was cleared to land at runway 05L, the autopilot was disengaged, and the pilots then attempted a manual go-around. The jet slowed down, pitched up by 40 degrees, rose 1,000 feet (300 m), stalled, and crashed into a residential neighborhood, bursting into flames at local time 4:20 PM. All 196 people on board were killed (including the governor of [[Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|Taiwan's central bank]], [[Sheu Yuan-dong]], his wife, Huang Mian-mei, and three central bank officials&lt;ref name="NYTOverTwoHundredDieasTaiwanJet"&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DB173FF934A25751C0A96E958260 Over 200 Die as Taiwan Jet Crashes in Bad Weather]." ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;), along with seven people on the ground. Hsu Lu, the manager of the Voice of Taipei radio station, said that one boy was pulled alive from the wreckage and later died.&lt;ref name="NYTOverTwoHundredDieasTaiwanJet"/&gt;

It remains the deadliest aviation accident on Taiwanese soil and the fifth-deadliest involving an Airbus A300.  [[China Airlines]] had twelve A300s in its fleet at the time of the accident. It is also the second deadliest accident overall in Taiwan's history, behind [[China Airlines Flight 611]], a [[Boeing 747-200|Boeing 747-209B]]&lt;ref name="ltnews-2002"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://old.ltn.com.tw/2002/new/may/26/today-air8.htm | title=華航空難特別報導 華航「空難」 33年來615人罹難 | publisher=[[Liberty Times]] 自由時報 | date=2002-05-26 | accessdate=2016-08-28 | author1=陳芸芸 | author2=李文儀|language=zh |location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; which crashed in the [[Taiwan Strait]] with 225 fatalities.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved in the accident was an [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B4-622R]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|B|1814|.}} It was delivered to China Airlines on 14 December 1990 and was powered by 2x [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000|Pratt and Whitney PW4156]] engines. The aircraft was 7.3 years old at the time of the accident and had completed 20,193 flight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Airbus/A300/578,B-1814-China-Airlines.php B-1814 China Airlines Airbus A300B4-622R – cn 578 – Planespotters.net Just Aviation]. Planespotters.net.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Kang Long-Lin, who was 49 years old, joined China Airlines in 1990, and had 7,210 hours total flight time. First Officer Jiang Der-Sheng who was 44 years old, joined China Airlines in 1996, and had 3,530 hours total flight time. Both pilots were formerly with the Republic of China Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rvs.unibielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/Research/Rvs/Misc/Additional/Reports/taipei/taipei.html#AircraftInformation{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The flight consisted of 189 Taiwanese nationals, along with 5 Americans, one French, and one Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/17/world/over-200-die-as-taiwan-jet-crashes-in-bad-weather.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
The plane took off from [[Ngurah Rai International Airport|Ngurah Rai Int'l Airport]], [[Bali]], Indonesia en route to [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|Chiang Kai-Shek Int'l Airport]], [[Taipei]], Taiwan with 182 passengers and 14 crew at 15:27.

The Airbus carried out an ILS/DME approach to runway 05L at Taipei Chiang Kai Shek Airport in light rain and fog but came in 1,000 feet too high above the glide slope (at 1,515 feet, 1.2&amp;nbsp;nm short of the threshold). Go around power was applied 19 seconds later over the threshold (at a 1,475 feet agl). The landing gear was raised and the flaps set to 20deg as the Airbus climbed through 1,723 feet in a 35-deg pitch-up.

Reaching 2,751 feet (42.7 deg pitch-up, 45 knots speed) the A300 stalled. Control could not be regained as the aircraft fell and smashed into the ground 200 feet left off the runway. It then surged forward, hit a utility pole and a highway median and skidded into several houses, surrounded by fish farms, rice paddies, factories and warehouses, and exploded, killing all on board.

Weather was 2,400 feet visibility, RVR runway 05L of 3,900 feet, 300 feet broken ceiling, 3,000 feet overcast.&lt;ref name="ASN - Flight 676"/&gt; According to the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder), the last words were from the First Officer and were "Pull up, too low!" This was surrounded by the Terrain alarm and stall warnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/cvr/ca676tr.shtml China Airlines 676 CVR Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702204306/http://www.airdisaster.com/cvr/ca676tr.shtml |date=2 July 2013 }}. AirDisaster.Com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and conclusion==
On initial approach to land, the aircraft was more than 300 meters above its normal altitude when it was only six nautical miles away from the airport. Nonetheless it continued the approach. Only when approaching the runway threshold, a go around was initiated. During this time, the pilot had unknowingly disengaged the plane's autopilot but was not aware of it. During the go around he therefore did nothing to actively take control of the plane as he thought the autopilot would initiate the maneuver. For 11 seconds, the plane was under no one's control.

Following a formal investigation that had continued for nearly two years, a final report by a special task force under the Civil Aviation Administration concluded that pilot error was behind the crash of Flight 676.  The report concludes by pointing the finger at China Airlines for what it calls "insufficient training" and "poor management of the resources in the pilot's cabin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2000/01/04/0000018211 Official report says CAL crash was caused by pilot].

'''Codrington Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] near [[Yambuk]] on the coast of south-western [[Victoria, Australia]].
Completed in June 2001, the 18.2[[Megawatt|MW]] installation of 14 [[wind turbines]] generates 51 GWh annually, for a capital cost of A$30 million by
[[Pacific Hydro]] being the first fully private investment in a wind farm in Australia. When opened it was Australia’s largest wind farm and the first in Victoria.

The '''Yambuk wind farm''' (Part of the [[Portland Wind Farm]] project) is directly adjacent to the Codrington Wind Farm. It has a total of 30MW in its 20 turbines.

'''''Crude Oil''''' ({{zh|s=采油日记|t=採油日記|p=Cǎi yóu rì jì}}) is a 2008 Chinese documentary film directed by [[Wang Bing (director)|Wang Bing]]. Filmed in the [[Inner Mongolia]]n portion of the [[Gobi Desert]], it follows a group of [[oil field]] workers as they go about their daily routine.

Like Wang's debut feature — the nine-hour ''[[Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks]]'' — ''Crude Oil'' is notable for its [[List of longest films|extreme length]], running 840 minutes (14 hours). The original plan called for a 70-hour film, but Wang felt compelled to exert additional editorial control and reduced the work to its present length.&lt;ref name='IFFR-programmer'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://professionals.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/eng/blogs/gertjan_zuilhof/a_programmers_chronicles_20.aspx |title=A Programmer's Chronicles 20 |accessdate=2008-05-01 |last=Zuilhof |first=Gertjan |publisher=International Film Festival Rotterdam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120142425/http://professionals.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/eng/blogs/gertjan_zuilhof/a_programmers_chronicles_20.aspx |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The director himself came down with severe [[altitude sickness]] and left the location three days into the one-week shoot; his crew completed the remainder without him.&lt;ref name='IHT'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Joan | last=Dupont | coauthors= | title=Edgy Asian directors in spotlight at Rotterdam | date=2008-01-31 | publisher= | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/31/arts/fmdupont.php | work =[[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-05-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An International [[petroleum company]] called Consolidated Oil covertly sets fire to an [[oil well]] in the [[Sahara]] because the government of the North African nation won't comply with their demands. Due to the extent of the damage, oil prices rise sharply. The company's president Mr. Stewart ([[Ray Milland]]) assigns John Carter, aka "Salamander", ([[Stuart Whitman]]) to deflect suspicion. However, when Carter arrives on location, a company representative hinders his efforts and implies to him that the fire was started on purpose. Consolidated Oil hires a Romanian [[firefighting]] crew with little experience in oil well fires, but the Romanian specialists team up with Carter and find proof of [[arson]]. Eventually they succeed in putting out the seven fires. Consolidated Oil tries to sabotage the [[firefighting]] but their efforts fail. The international [[news media]] exposes the conspiracy and Stewart is unmasked as one of the driving forces behind the scheme. He learns that he is to be a scapegoat and is then murdered. His secretary is not only unsurprised when she is informed of his death, but she has already written his [[obituary]]. Meanwhile, the Romanian firefighters are publicly celebrated in the unnamed Arab country.

Some chemistry sources define 'arachadonic acid' to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids.  However, almost all writings in biology, medicine and nutrition limit the use of the term 'arachidonic acid' to ''all''-''cis'' 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (ω-6).

ETA is found in green-lipped mussel and appears to act as dual inhibitor of arachidonic acid oxygenation by both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/132/6/1634S Improvement of Arthritic Signs in Dogs Fed Green-Lipped Mussel], Tiffany Bierer, Linh Bui,June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elwire.jpg|thumbnail|Close up of El-Wire of a variety of colors]]
[[Image:ElWireFuelRails.JPG|thumbnail|El-Wire Project]]

'''Electroluminescent wire''' (often abbreviated as '''EL wire''') is a thin [[copper wire]] coated in a [[phosphor]] which glows when an [[alternating current]] is applied to it.  It can be used in a wide variety of applications—vehicle and structure decoration, safety and emergency lighting, toys, clothing etc.—much as [[rope light]] or [[Christmas lights]] are often used.  Unlike these types of strand lights, EL wire is not a series of points, but produces a 360 degree unbroken line of visible light.  Its thin diameter makes it flexible and ideal for use in a variety of applications such as clothing or costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescent_wire|title=Citation needed|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

==Structure==
EL wire's construction consists of five major components.  First is a solid-copper wire core coated with phosphor.  A very fine wire or pair of wires is spiral-wound around the phosphor-coated copper core and then the outer [[Indium tin oxide|ITO]] conductive coating is evaporated on.  This fine wire is electrically isolated from the copper core.  Surrounding this "sandwich" of copper core, phosphor and fine copper wire is a clear [[PVC]] sleeve.  Finally, surrounding this thin and clear PVC sleeve is another clear, colored [[translucent]] or [[fluorescent]] PVC sleeve.
[[File:EL wire.svg|thumbnail|left|Diagram of El-Wire]]

An alternating current electric potential of approximately 90 to 120 volts at about 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz is applied between the copper core wire and the fine wire that surrounds the copper core. The wire can be modeled as a coaxial [[capacitor]] with about 1&amp;nbsp;nF of capacitance per foot, and the rapid charging and discharging of this capacitor excites the phosphor to emit light.  The colors of light that can be produced efficiently by phosphors are limited, so many types of wire use an additional fluorescent organic dye in the clear PVC sleeve to produce the final result.  These organic dyes produce colors like red and purple when excited by the blue-green light of the core.

A resonant [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] is typically used to generate the high voltage drive signal.  Because of the capacitance load of the EL wire, using an inductive (coiled) [[transformer]] makes the driver a very efficient tuned [[LC circuit|LC oscillator]]. The efficiency of EL wire is very high, and thus up to a hundred meters of EL wire can be driven by [[AA battery|AA batteries]] for several hours.

In recent years, the LC circuit has been replaced for some applications with a single chip switched capacitor inverter IC such as the Supertex HV850; this can run 30cm of angel hair wire at high efficiency, and is suitable for solar lanterns and safety applications. The other advantage of these chips is that the control signals can be derived from a microcontroller, so brightness and colour can vary depending on battery state or ambient temperature.

EL wire - in common with other types of EL devices - does have limitations: at high frequency it dissipates a lot of heat, and that can lead to breakdown and loss of brightness over time. Because the wire is unshielded and typically operates at a relatively high voltage, EL wire can produce high-frequency interference (corresponding to the frequency of the oscillator) that can be picked up by sensitive audio equipment, such as guitar pickups. 
There is also a voltage limit: typical EL wire breaks down at around 180V p-p, so if using an unregulated transformer back to back, [[Zener diode|zeners]] and series current limiting resistors are essential.

In addition, EL sheet and wire can sometimes be used as a touch sensor, since compressing the capacitor will change its value.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ORP-hOTBLk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequencers==

'''EL wire sequencers''' can flash electroluminescent wire, or ''EL wire,'' in sequential patterns. EL wire requires a low-power, high-frequency ''driver'' to cause the wire to illuminate. Most EL wire drivers simply light up one strand of EL wire in a constant-on mode, and some drivers may additionally have a blink or strobe mode. A sound-activated driver will light EL wire in synchronization to music, speech, or other ambient sound, but an EL wire sequencer will allow multiple lengths of EL wire to be flashed in a desired sequence. The lengths of EL wire can all be the same color, or a variety of colors.

The images above show a sign that displays a telephone number, where the numbers were formed using different colors of EL wire. There are ten numbers, each of which is connected to a different channel of the EL wire sequencer.&lt;ref&gt;The telephone number has been obscured in both photos in order to comply with Wikipedia guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like EL wire drivers, sequencers are rated to drive (or power) a range or specific length of EL wire. For example, using a sequencer rated for 1.5 to 14 meters (5 to 45 feet), if less than 1.5m is used, there is a risk of burning out the sequencer, and if more than 14m is used, the EL wire will not light as brightly as intended.

There are commercially available EL wire sequencers capable of lighting three, four, five, or ten lengths of EL wire. There are professional and experimental sequencers with many more than ten channels, but for most applications, ten channels is enough. Sequencers usually have options for changing the speed, reversing, changing the order of the sequence, and sometimes, to change whether the first wires remain lit or go off as the rest of the wires in the sequence are lit. EL wire sequencers tend to be smaller than a pack of cigarettes and most are powered by batteries. This versatility lends to the sequencers' use at nighttime events where [[mains electricity]] is not available.

===Applications===
By arranging each strand of EL wire into a shape slightly different from the previous one, it is possible to create animations using EL wire sequencers. EL wire sequencers are also used for costumes and have been used to create animations on various items such as kimonos, purses, neckties, and motorcycle tanks. They are increasingly popular among artists, dancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29802122 | title=The dancers who light up the stage with wearable tech | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[maker culture]], and similar creative communities, such as exhibited in the annual [[Burning Man]] alt-culture festival.

'''Fatty acid synthesis''' is the creation of [[fatty acid]]s from [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[NADPH]] through the action of [[enzyme]]s called [[fatty acid synthase]]s. This process takes place in the [[cytoplasm]] of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Most of the acetyl-CoA which is converted into fatty acids is derived from [[carbohydrate]]s via the [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]]. The glycolytic pathway also provides the [[glycerol]] with which three fatty acids can combine (by means of [[Ester|ester bonds]]) to form [[Fat|triglycerides]] (also known as "triacylglycerols" – to distinguish them from fatty "acids" – or simply as "fat"), the final product of the [[Lipogenesis|lipogenic]] process. When only two fatty acids combine with glycerol and the third alcohol group is phosphorylated with a group such as [[phosphatidylcholine]], a [[phospholipid]] is formed. Phospholipids form the bulk of the [[lipid bilayer]]s that make up [[cell membrane]]s and surround the [[organelles]] within the cells (e.g. the [[cell nucleus]], [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]] etc.)

==Straight-chain fatty acids==
Straight-chain fatty acids occur in two types: saturated and unsaturated.

===Saturated straight-chain fatty acids===
[[File:Saturated Fatty Acid Synthesis.png|thumb|left|px150| Synthesis of saturated fatty acids via fatty acid synthase II in ''E. coli'']]
Much like [[β-oxidation]], straight-chain fatty acid synthesis occurs via the six recurring reactions shown below, until the 16-carbon [[palmitic acid]] is produced.&lt;ref name=transFA&gt;Dijkstra, Albert J., R. J. Hamilton, and Wolf Hamm. "Fatty Acid Biosynthesis." Trans Fatty Acids. Oxford: Blackwell Pub., 2008. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetaCyc pathway: superpathway of fatty acids biosynthesis (''E. coli'')|url=http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-6285&amp;detail-level=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagrams presented show how fatty acids are synthesized in microorganisms and list the enzymes found in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name=transFA /&gt; These reactions are performed by [[fatty acid synthase]] II (FASII), which in general contain multiple enzymes that act as one complex. FASII is present in [[prokaryotes]], plants, fungi, and parasites, as well as in [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=lipidlib&gt;"Fatty Acids: Straight-chain Saturated, Structure, Occurrence and Biosynthesis." Lipid Library – Lipid Chemistry, Biology, Technology and Analysis. Web. 30 Apr. 2011. &lt;http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/lipids/fa_sat/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In animals, as well as some fungi such as yeast, these same reactions occur on fatty acid synthase I (FASI), a large dimeric protein that has all of the enzymatic activities required to create a fatty acid. FASI is less efficient than FASII; however, it allows for the formation of more molecules, including "medium-chain" fatty acids via early chain termination.&lt;ref name=lipidlib /&gt;

Once a 16:0 carbon fatty acid has been formed, it can undergo a number of modifications, resulting in desaturation and/or elongation. Elongation, starting with stearate (18:0), is performed mainly in the ER by several membrane-bound enzymes. The enzymatic steps involved in the elongation process are principally the same as those carried out by FAS, but the four principal successive steps of the elongation are performed by individual proteins, which may be physically associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetaCyc pathway: stearate biosynthesis I (animals)|url=http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-5972&amp;detail-level=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetaCyc pathway: very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis II|url=http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-7036&amp;detail-level=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that during fatty synthesis the reducing agent is [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], whereas [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]] is the oxidizing agent in [[beta-oxidation]] (the breakdown of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA). This difference exemplifies a general principle that NADPH is consumed during biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is generated in energy-yielding reactions.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 559–565, 614–623|isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thus NADPH is also required for the synthesis of [[cholesterol]] from acetyl-CoA; while NADH is generated during [[glycolysis]].) The source of the NADPH is two-fold. When [[Malic acid|malate]] is oxidatively decarboxylated by "NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-linked malic enzyme" to form [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NADPH are formed. NADPH is also formed by the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] which converts glucose into ribose, which can be used in synthesis of [[nucleotides]] and [[nucleic acids]], or it can be catabolized to pyruvate.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

===Glycolytic end products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids===
{{Main article|Citric acid cycle#Glycolytic end products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids}}

In humans, fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the [[liver]] and [[adipose tissue]], as well as in the [[mammary glands]] during lactation.

The pyruvate produced by glycolysis is an important intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) is removed from the [[citric acid cycle]] and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for [[gluconeogenesis]] (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate.&lt;ref name= ferre&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000100426 | title = SREBP-1c Transcription Factor and Lipid Homeostasis: Clinical Perspective | journal = Hormone Research | year = 2007 | first = P. | last = Ferre |author2=F.

===Animals cannot resynthesize carbohydrates from fatty acids===
The main fuel stored in the bodies of animals is fat. The young adult human's fat stores average between about 10–20&amp;nbsp;kg, but varies greatly depending on age, gender, and individual disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sloan |first1=A.W |last2=Koeslag |first2=J.H. |last3=Bredell |first3=G.A.G. |date=1973 |title= Body composition work capacity and work efficiency of active and inactive young men |journal= European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=32 |pages=17–24 |doi=10.1007/bf00422426}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the human body stores only about 400&amp;nbsp;g of [[glycogen]], of which 300&amp;nbsp;g is locked inside the skeletal muscles and is unavailable to the body as a whole.

Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of [[beta oxidation]] inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondrion, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] reaction.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; It can also not be converted to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] as the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase|pyruvate decarboxylation]] reaction is irreversible.&lt;ref name=stryer3 /&gt; Instead it condenses with [[oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]], to enter the [[citric acid cycle]]. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] and [[alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form [[citric acid]].  The decarboxylation reactions occur before [[malic acid|malate]] is formed in the cycle. This is the only substance that can be removed from the mitochondrion to enter the [[Gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic pathway]] to form glucose or glycogen in the liver or any other tissue.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; There can therefore be no net conversion of fatty acids into glucose.

Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt;

'''Regulation'''

Acetyl-CoA is formed into malonyl-CoA by [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], at which point malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the point of regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both [[phosphorylation]] and [[allosteric regulation]]. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the [[Krebs cycle]] and conserve energy.&lt;ref&gt;Diwan, Joyce J. "Fatty Acid Synthesis." Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) :: Architecture, Business, Engineering, IT, Humanities, Science. Web. 30 Apr. 2011. &lt;http://rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/fasynthesis.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

High plasma levels of [[insulin]] in the blood plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus promoting the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while [[epinephrine]] and [[glucagon]] (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting [[lipogenesis]] in favor of fatty acid oxidation via [[beta-oxidation]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;

====Anaerobic desaturation====
Many bacteria use the anaerobic pathway for synthesizing unsaturated fatty acids. This pathway does not utilize oxygen and is dependent on enzymes to insert the double bond before elongation utilizing the normal fatty acid synthesis machinery. In ''Escherichia coli'', this pathway is well understood.
[[File:Anaerobic desaturation.png|thumb|left|px150|Synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids via anaerobic desaturation]]
* FabA is a β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydrase – it is specific for the 10-carbon saturated fatty acid synthesis intermediate (β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP).
* FabA catalyzes the dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP, causing the release of water and insertion of the double bond between C7 and C8 counting from the methyl end. This creates the trans-2-decenoyl intermediate.
* Either the trans-2-decenoyl intermediate can be shunted to the normal saturated fatty acid synthesis pathway by FabB, where the double bond will be hydrolyzed and the final product will be a saturated fatty acid, or FabA will catalyze the isomerization into the cis-3-decenoyl intermediate.
* FabB is a β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase that elongates and channels intermediates into the mainstream fatty acid synthesis pathway. When FabB reacts with the cis-decenoyl intermediate, the final product after elongation will be an unsaturated fatty acid.&lt;ref name=FabR&gt;Feng, Youjun, and John ECronan. "Complex binding of the FabR repressor of bacterial unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis to its cognate promoters." Molecular microbiology 80.1 (2011):195–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The two main unsaturated fatty acids made are Palmitoleoyl-ACP (16:1ω7) and cis-vaccenoyl-ACP (18:1ω7).&lt;ref name= Clostridium&gt;Zhu, Lei, et al. "Functions of the Clostridium acetobutylicium FabF and FabZ proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis." BMC Microbiology 9(2009):119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most bacteria that undergo anaerobic desaturation contain homologues of FabA and FabB.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Haihong, and John ECronan. "Functional replacement of the FabA and FabB proteins of Escherichia coli fatty acid synthesis by Enterococcus faecalis FabZ and FabF homologues." Journal of Biological Chemistry 279.33 (2004):34489-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Clostridia are the main exception; they have a novel enzyme, yet to be identified, that catalyzes the formation of the cis double bond.&lt;ref name=Clostridium /&gt;

'''Regulation'''

This pathway undergoes [[transcriptional regulation]] by [[Fatty acid metabolism regulator protein FadR|FadR]] and FabR. FadR is the more extensively studied protein and has been attributed bifunctional characteristics. It acts as an activator of ''fabA'' and ''fabB'' transcription and as a [[repressor]] for the β-oxidation [[regulon]]. In contrast, FabR acts as a repressor for the transcription of fabA and fabB.&lt;ref name=FabR /&gt;

====Aerobic desaturation====
Aerobic desaturation is the most widespread pathway for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. It is utilized in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. This pathway utilizes [[Fatty acid desaturase|desaturases]] to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids from full-length saturated fatty acid substrates.&lt;ref name=Bsubtilis&gt;Mansilla, Mara C, and Diegode Mendoza. "The Bacillus subtilis desaturase: a model to understand phospholipid modification and temperature sensing." Archives of Microbiology 183.4 (2005):229-35.&lt;/ref&gt; All desaturases require oxygen and ultimately consume NADH even though desaturation is an oxidative process. Desaturases are specific for the double bond they induce in the substrate. In [[Bacillus subtilis]], the desaturase, Δ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-Des, is specific for inducing a cis-double bond at the Δ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; position.&lt;ref name= ferre /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bsubtilis /&gt; ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' contains one desaturase, Ole1p, which induces the cis-double bond at Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name= ferre /&gt;

In mammals the aerobic desaturation is catalyzed by a complex of three membrane-bound enzymes (''NADH-cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; reductase, cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'', and a ''desaturase''). These enzymes allow molecular oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to interact with the saturated fatty acyl-CoA chain, forming a double bond and two molecules of water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Two electrons come from NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and two from the single bond in the fatty acid chain.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; These mammalian enzymes are, however, incapable of introducing double bonds at carbon atoms beyond C-9 in the fatty acid chain.{{#tag:ref |[[File:Fatty acid numbering.png|thumb|upright=2|Numbering of carbon atoms]][[Essential fatty acid#Nomenclature and terminology|The position of the carbon atoms]] in a fatty acid can be indicated from the COOH- (or carboxy) end, or from the -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or methyl) end. If indicated from the -COOH end, then the C-1, C-2, C-3, ... .(etc.) notation is used (blue numerals in the diagram on the right, where C-1 is the –COOH carbon).  If the position is counted from the other, -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, end then the position is indicated by the ω-n notation (numerals in red, where ω-1 refers to the methyl carbon).

The positions of the double bonds in a fatty acid chain can, therefore, be indicated in two ways, using the C-n or the ω-n notation. Thus, in an 18 carbon fatty acid, a double bond between C-12 (or ω-7) and C-13 (or ω-6) is reported either as Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; if counted from the –COOH end (indicating only the "beginning" of the double bond), or as ω-6 (or omega-6) if counting from the -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end. The "Δ" is the Greek letter "delta", which translates into "D" ( for '''D'''ouble bond) in the Roman alphabet. Omega (ω) is the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and is therefore used to indicate the "last" carbon atom in the fatty acid chain. Since the ω-n notation is used almost exclusively to indicate the positions of the double bonds close to the -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end in [[essential fatty acid]]s, there is no necessity for an equivalent "Δ"-like notation – the use of the "ω-n" notation always refers to the position of a double bond. |group=nb}}.) Hence mammals cannot synthesize [[linoleate]] or [[linolenate]] (which have double bonds at the C-12 (= Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), or the C-12 and C-15 (= Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and Δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) positions, respectively, as well as at the Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; position), nor the polyunsaturated, 20-carbon [[arachidonic acid]] that is derived from linoleate. These are all termed [[essential fatty acids]], meaning that they are required by the organism, but can only be supplied via the diet. (Arachidonic acid is the precursor the [[prostaglandins]] which fulfill a wide variety of functions as [[Paracrine signalling|local hormones]].)&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

'''Regulation'''

In ''B. subtilis'', this pathway is regulated by a [[two-component system]]: DesK and DesR. DesK is a membrane-associated kinase and DesR is a transcriptional regulator of the ''des'' gene.&lt;ref name= ferre /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bsubtilis /&gt; The regulation responds to temperature; when there is a drop in temperature, this gene is upregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity of the membrane and stabilize it under lower temperatures. DesK is the sensor protein that, when there is a decrease in temperature, will autophosphorylate. DesK-P will transfer its phosphoryl group to DesR. Two DesR-P proteins will dimerize and bind to the DNA promoters of the ''des'' gene and recruit RNA polymerase to begin transcription.&lt;ref name= ferre /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bsubtilis /&gt;

'''''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'''''

In general, both anaerobic and aerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis will not occur within the same system, however ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''Vibrio'' ABE-1 are exceptions.&lt;ref name=Pseudomonas&gt;Wada, M, N. Fukunaga, and S. Sasaki. "Mechanism of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in Pseudomonas sp. strain E-3, a psychrotrophic bacterium." Journal of Bacteriology 171.8 (1989):4267-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DesT&gt;Subramanian, Chitra, Charles ORock, and Yong-MeiZhang. "DesT coordinates the expression of anaerobic and aerobic pathways for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa." Journal of Bacteriology 192.1 (2010):280-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vibrio&gt;Morita, N, et al. "Both the anaerobic pathway and aerobic desaturation are involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in Vibrio sp. strain ABE-1." FEBS Letters 297.1–2 (1992):9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
While ''P. aeruginosa'' undergoes primarily anaerobic desaturation, it also undergoes two aerobic pathways. One pathway utilizes a Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-desaturase (DesA) that catalyzes a double bond formation in membrane lipids. Another pathway uses two proteins, DesC and DesB, together to act as a Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-desaturase, which inserts a double bond into a saturated fatty acid-CoA molecule. This second pathway is regulated by repressor protein DesT. DesT is also a repressor of ''fabAB'' expression for anaerobic desaturation when in presence of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. This functions to coordinate the expression of the two pathways within the organism.&lt;ref name=DesT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, Kun, et al. "Two aerobic pathways for the formation of unsaturated fatty acids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa." Molecular microbiology 60.2 (2006):260-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branched-chain fatty acids==
Branched-chain fatty acids are usually saturated and are found in two distinct families: the iso-series and anteiso-series. It has been found that [[Actinomycetales]] contain unique branch-chain fatty acid synthesis mechanisms, including that which forms tuberculosteric acid.

===Branch-chain fatty acid synthesizing system===

The branched-chain fatty acid synthesizing system uses [[alpha-keto acid|α-keto acids]] as primers. This system is distinct from the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers.&lt;ref name=iso /&gt; α-Keto acid primers are derived from the [[transamination]] and [[decarboxylation]] of [[valine]], [[leucine]], and [[isoleucine]] to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively.&lt;ref name=tuberculo /&gt; 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine may be used to form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid.&lt;ref name= branched&gt;Naik, Devaray N., and Toshi Kaneda. "Biosynthesis of Branched Long-chain Fatty Acids by Species of Bacillus: Relative Activity of Three α-keto Acid Substrates and Factors Affecting Chain Length." Can. J. Microbiol. 20 (1974): 1701–708.&lt;/ref&gt; Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the [[Branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase|branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase]] (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in ''Escherichia coli'' used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender.&lt;ref name=bioBC&gt;Oku, Hirosuke, and Toshi Kaneda. "Biosynthesis of Branched-chain Fatty Acids in Bacillis Subtilis." The Journal of Biological Chemistry 263.34 (1988): 18386-8396.&lt;/ref&gt; The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.&lt;ref name=branched /&gt;

'''BCKA decarboxylase and relative activities of α-keto acid substrates'''

The BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is composed of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and is essential for the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the transamination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with branched-chain α-keto acid substrates than with straight-chain substrates, and in [[Bacillus]] species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by [[α-ketoisocaproate]] and α-ketoisovalerate.&lt;ref name= branched /&gt;&lt;ref name=bioBC /&gt; The enzyme's high affinity toward branched-chain α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for branched-chain fatty acid synthetase.&lt;ref name=bioBC /&gt;

'''Factors affecting chain length and pattern distribution'''

α-Keto acid primers are used to produce branched-chain fatty acids that, in general, are between 12 and 17 carbons in length. The proportions of these branched-chain fatty acids tend to be uniform and consistent among a particular bacterial species but may be altered due to changes in malonyl-CoA concentration, temperature, or heat-stable factors (HSF) present.&lt;ref name=branched /&gt; All of these factors may affect chain length, and HSFs have been demonstrated to alter the specificity of BCKA decarboxylase for a particular α-keto acid substrate, thus shifting the ratio of branched-chain fatty acids produced.&lt;ref name=branched /&gt; An increase in malonyl-CoA concentration has been shown to result in a larger proportion of C17 fatty acids produced, up until the optimal concentration (≈20μM) of malonyl-CoA is reached.  Decreased temperatures also tend to shift the fatty-acid distribution slightly toward C17 fatty-acids in ''Bacillus'' species.&lt;ref name=iso&gt;Kaneda, Toshi. "Iso- and Anteiso-Fatty Acids in Bacteria: Biosynthesis, Function, and Taxonomic Significance." Microbiological Reviews 55.2 (1991): 288–302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=branched /&gt;

===Branch-chain fatty acid synthase===
This system functions similarly to the branch-chain fatty acid synthesizing system, however it uses short-chain carboxylic acids as primers instead of alpha-keto acids. In general, this method is used by bacteria that do not have the ability to perform the branch-chain fatty acid system using alpha-keto primers. Typical short-chain primers include isovalerate, isobutyrate, and 2-methyl butyrate. In general, the acids needed for these primers are taken up from the environment; this is often seen in ruminal bacteria.&lt;ref name=alicyclic&gt;Christie, William W. "Fatty Acids: Natural Alicyclic Structures, Occurrence, and Biochemistry." The AOCS Lipid Library. 5 Apr. 2011. Web. 24 Apr. 2011. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/lipids/fa_cycl/file.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721024500/http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/lipids/fa_cycl/file.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall reaction is:

: Isobutyryl-CoA + 6 malonyl-CoA +12 NADPH + 12H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Isopalmitic acid + 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 12 NADP + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 7 CoA&lt;ref name=iso /&gt;

The difference between (straight-chain) fatty acid synthase and branch-chain fatty acid synthase is substrate specificity of the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of acyl-CoA to acyl-ACP.&lt;ref name=iso /&gt;

===Omega-alicyclic fatty acids===
[[File:11-cyclohexyludencanioc acid.png|thumb|left]]
Omega-alicyclic fatty acids typically contain an omega-terminal propyl or butyryl cyclic group and are some of the major membrane fatty acids found in several species of bacteria. The fatty acid synthetase used to produce omega-alicyclic fatty acids is also used to produce membrane branched-chain fatty acids. In bacteria with membranes composed mainly of omega-alicyclic fatty acids, the supply of cyclic carboxylic acid-CoA esters is much greater than that of branched-chain primers.&lt;ref name=iso /&gt; The synthesis of cyclic primers is not well understood but it has been suggested that mechanism involves the conversion of sugars to [[shikimic acid]] which is then converted to cyclohexylcarboxylic acid-CoA esters that serve as primers for omega-alicyclic fatty acid synthesis&lt;ref name=alicyclic /&gt;

[[Image:LeFOUR-IN-HAND1905.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A four-in-hand]]
A '''four-in-hand''' is a [[carriage]] drawn by a hitch of four horses having the lines rigged in such a way that it can be driven by a single driver. The [[stagecoach]] and the [[Tallyho#Coach|tally-ho]] are usually four-in-hand coaches.

&lt;!--Before the four-in-hand rigging was developed, two drivers were needed to handle four horses.  With a four-in-hand the solo driver could handle all four horses by holding all the lines in one hand, thus the name. the first sentence is not correct and neither is the second--&gt;
Today Four-in-hand driving is the top discipline of [[combined driving]] in sports. One of its major events is the [[Combined driving#FEI World Cup Driving|FEI World Cup Driving series]]. 

The [[four-in-hand knot]] used to tie neckwear may have developed from a knot used in the rigging of the lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14666">A '''geometric separator''' is a line (or other shape) that partitions a collection of geometric shapes into two subsets, such that proportion of shapes in each subset is bounded, and the number of shapes that do not belong to any subset (i.e. the shapes intersected by the separator itself) is small.

When a geometric separator exists, it can be used for building divide-and-conquer algorithms for solving various problems in [[computational geometry]].

== Separators that are closed shapes ==

A simple case in which a separator is guaranteed to exist is the following:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = W. D. | last2 = Wormald | first2 = N. C. | doi = 10.1109/sfcs.1998.743449 | chapter = Geometric separator theorems and applications | title = Proceedings 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

M. | year = 2003 | title = Polynomial-time approximation schemes for packing and piercing fat objects | journal = Journal of Algorithms | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–189 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Given a set of ''n'' disjoint axis-parallel squares in the plane, there is a rectangle ''R'' such that, at most 2''n''/3 of the squares are inside ''R'', at most 2''n''/3 of the squares are outside ''R'', and at most O(sqrt(''n'')) of the squares are not inside and not outside ''R'' (i.e. intersect the boundary of ''R'').

Thus, ''R'' is a geometric separator that separates the ''n'' squares into two subset ("inside ''R''" and "outside ''R''"), with a relatively small "loss" (the squares intersected by R are considered "lost" because they do not belong to any of the two subsets).

=== Proof ===
Define a ''2-fat rectangle'' as an axis-parallel rectangle with an aspect ratio of at most&amp;nbsp;2.

Let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a minimal-area 2-fat rectangle that contains the centers of at least ''n''/3 squares. Thus every 2-fat rectangle smaller than ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; contains fewer than ''n''/3 squares.

For every ''t'' in [0,1), let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be a 2-fat rectangle with the same center as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, inflated by&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t''.
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; contains ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so it contains the centers of at least ''n''/3 squares.
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is less than twice as large as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so it can be covered by two 2-fat rectangles that are smaller than ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Each of these 2-fat rectangles contains the centers of less than ''n''/3 squares. Therefore ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; contains the centers of less than 2''n''/3 squares.

Now it remains to show that there is a ''t'' for which ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; intersects at most O(sqrt(''n'')) squares.

First, consider all the "large squares" – the squares whose side-length is at least &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. For every ''t'', the perimeter of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is at most 2&amp;middot;perimeter(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) which is at most 6&amp;middot;width(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), so it can intersect at most &lt;math&gt;12 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; large squares.

Next, consider all the "small squares" – the squares whose side-length is less than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

For every ''t'', define: intersect(''t'') as the set of small squares intersected by the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;. For every ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;|t_1-t_2| \geq 1/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{width}(R_{t_1})-\operatorname{width}(R_{t_2})| \geq \operatorname{width}(R_0)/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore there is a gap of at least &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{width}(R_0) / 2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; between the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and the boundary of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, intersect(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and intersect(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are disjoint. Therefore:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{\sqrt{n}-1}{|\operatorname{intersect}(j/\sqrt{n})|} \leq n&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore by the [[pigeonhole principle]] there is a certain ''j''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for which:

: &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{intersect}(j_0/\sqrt{n})| \leq \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The separator we look for is the rectangle ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t = j_0/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This proof is based on the more general proof of Chan (2003), but with the better constants of Smith&amp;Wormald (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application example ===
Using this separator theorem, we can solve certain problems in computational geometry in the following way:

* Separate the input set of squares to two disjoint subsets;
* Solve the problem on each subset separately;
* Combine the solutions to the two sub-problems and get an approximate solution to the original problem.

=== Generalizations ===
The above theorem can be generalized in many different ways, with possibly different constants. For example:

* Instead of squares, the input collection can contain arbitrary [[fat object]]s, such as: circles, rectangles with a bounded aspect ratio, etc.
* Instead of two-dimensional shapes in a plane, the input collection can contain objects of any dimension, and they can be situated in a ''d''-dimensional [[torus]].
* Instead of requiring that the shapes in the input collection be disjoint, we can put a weaker requirement, that the collection is:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998 /&gt;
** ''k-thick'', i.e., each point is covered by at most ''k'' different shapes.
** ''l-k-thick'', i.e., each point is covered by at most ''k'' different shapes with a size ratio (size of largest shape divided by size of smallest shape) at most&amp;nbsp;''l''.
** ''k-overloaded'', i.e., for any subcollection of shapes, the sum of their individual measures is at most ''k'' times the measure of their union.
* Instead of a rectangle separator, the separator can be any shape that can be covered by smaller copies of itself.
* Instead of bounding the number of shapes in each side of the separator, it is possible to bound any measure which satisfies certain axioms.&lt;ref name=Chan2003 /&gt;

=== Optimality ===
The ratio of 1:2, in the square separator theorem above, is the best that can be guaranteed: there are collections of shapes that cannot be separated in a better ratio using a separator that crosses only O(sqrt(''n'')) shapes. Here is one such collection (from theorem 34 of &lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998 /&gt;):

Consider an [[equilateral triangle]]. At each of its 3 vertices, put ''N''/3 shapes arranged in an exponential spiral, such that the diameter increases by a constant factor every turn of the spiral, and each shape touches its neighbours in the spiral ordering. For example, start with a 1-by-Φ rectangle, where Φ is the [[golden ratio]]. Add an adjacent Φ-by-Φ square and get another golden rectangle. Add an adjacent (1+Φ)-by-(1+Φ) square and get a larger golden rectangle, and so on.

Now, in order to separate more than 1/3 of the shapes, the separator must separate O(''N'') shapes from two different vertices. But to do this, the separator must intersect O(''N'') shapes.

== Separators that are hyperplanes ==

:: Given a set of ''N''=4''k'' disjoint axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, there is a line, either horizontal or vertical, such that at least ''N''/4 rectangles lie entirely to each side of it (thus at most ''N''/2 rectangles are intersected by the separator line).

=== Proof ===
Define ''W'' as the most western vertical line with at least ''N''/4 rectangles entirely to its west. There are two cases:
* If there are at least ''N''/4 rectangles entirely to the east of ''W'', then ''W'' is a vertical separator.
* Otherwise, by moving ''W'' slightly to the west, we get a vertical line that intersects more than ''N''/2 rectangles. Find a point on this line that has at least ''N''/4 rectangles above and ''N''/4 rectangles below it, and draw a horizontal separator through it.

=== Optimality ===
[[File:HyperplaneׂGeometricSeparatorCounterExample.svg|20px|right]]
The number of intersected shapes, guaranteed by the above theorem, is O(''N''). This upper bound is asymptotically tight even when the shapes are squares, as illustrated in the figure to the right. This is in sharp contrast to the upper bound of O({{radic|''N''}}) intersected shapes, which is guaranteed when the separator is a closed shape (see [[#Separators that are closed shapes|previous section]]).

[[File:HyperplaneׂGeometricSeparatorCounterExample2.svg|40px|right]]
Moreover, when the shapes are arbitrary rectangles, there are cases in which no line that separates more than a single rectangle can cross less than ''N''/4 rectangles, as illustrated in the figure to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=MvG|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/509928/cutting-a-cake-without-destroying-the-toppings|title=Cutting a cake without destroying the toppings|date=September 2013|accessdate=2014-01|publisher=Math Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalizations ===
The above theorem can be generalized from disjoint rectangles to ''k''-thick rectangles. Additionally, by induction on ''d'', it is possible to generalize the above theorem to d dimensions and get the following theorem:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998/&gt;

:: Given ''N'' axis-parallel ''d''-boxes whose interiors are ''k''-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane such that at least:
::: &lt;math&gt;\lfloor(N+1-k)/(2d)\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
:: of the ''d''-box interiors lie to each side of the hyperplane.

For the special case when ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. each point is contained in at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 
boxes), the following theorem holds:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998/&gt;

:: Given ''N'' axis-parallel ''d''-boxes whose interiors are (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-thick, there exists an axis-parallel hyperplane that separates two of them.

The objects need not be boxes, and the separators need not be axis-parallel:

:: Let ''C'' be a collection of possible orientations of hyperplanes (i.e. ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{horizontal,vertical}). Given ''N'' ''d''-objects, such that every two disjoint object are separated by a hyperplane with an orientation from ''C'', whose interiors are ''k''-thick, there exists a hyperplane with an orientation from ''C'' such that at least: (''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')/O(''C'') of the ''d''-objects interiors lie entirely to each side of the hyperplane.

=== Algorithmic versions ===

It is possible to find the hyperplanes guaranteed by the above theorems in O(''Nd'') steps. Also, if the 2''d'' lists of the lower and upper endpoints of the intervals defining the boxes's ''i''th coordinates are pre-sorted, then the best such hyperplane (according to a wide variety of optimality measures) may be found in O(''Nd'') steps.

== Separators that are width-bounded strips between parallel hyperplanes ==

:: Let ''Q'' be a set of ''n'' points in the plane such that the minimal distance between points is ''d''. Let ''a''&gt;0 be a constant.
:: There is a pair of parallel lines of distance&amp;nbsp;''a'', such that at most 2''n''/3 points lie to each side of the strip, and at most &lt;math&gt;1.3 {a \over d} \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; points lie inside the strip. 
:: Equivalently: there is a line such that at most 2''n''/3 points lie to each side of it and at most &lt;math&gt;1.3 {a \over d} \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; points lie at a distance of less than ''a''/2 from it.

=== Proof sketch ===
Define the ''centerpoint'' of ''Q'' as a point ''o'' such that every line through it has at most 2''n''/3 points of ''Q'' in each side of it. The existence of a centerpoint can be proved using [[Helly's theorem]].

For a given point ''p'' and constant ''a''&gt;0, define ''Pr(a,p,o)'' as the probability that a random line through ''o'' lies at a distance of less than ''a'' from ''p''. The idea is to bound this probability and thus bound the expected number of points at a distance less than ''a'' from a random line through ''o''.

=== Applications ===
Bounded-width separators can be used for approximately solving the [[protein folding]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1137/s0097539704440727| title = Geometric Separators and Their Applications to Protein Folding in the HP-Model| year = 2007| last1 = Fu | first1 = B. | last2 = Wang | first2 = W. | journal = SIAM Journal on Computing| volume = 37| issue = 4| pages = 1014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for an exact sub-exponential algorithm to find a [[maximum independent set]], as well as several related covering problems, in geometric graphs.&lt;ref name="Fu"/&gt;

'''Glomfjord power plant''' is a 6×20&amp;nbsp;MW [[hydroelectric power plant]] in [[Glomfjord]] in the municipality of [[Meløy]] in [[Nordland]] county, [[Norway]]. It gets its water from Nedre Navervatn lake which is located about 465 meters above sea level, but there are plans to start taking water from Fykanvatn lake as well. The outlet of the plant is Glomfjorden (the [[Norwegian Sea]]).
).

The plant is currently owned by [[Statkraft]].
[[File:Glomfjord hydroelectric power plant with surroundings.JPG|thumb|none|The power plant is located at the bottom of Glomfjord.]]

==History==
The power plant was built in 1918 to a design by the architect [[Olaf Nordhagen]].  In 1942, during the [[Second World War]], an Anglo-Norwegian raid, [[Operation Musketoon]], attacked the German-held power plant.

'''''Go Further''''' is a 2003 [[documentary film]] by [[Ron Mann]] starring [[Woody Harrelson]] and a group of other environmental activists riding around in a large, [[biofuel|bio-fueled]] bus. The tour was called the Simple Organic Living Tour and it was produced by cause-related marketers the Spitfire Agency. The film debuted at the [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival in March 2003, and at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2003, where it was first runner-up for the People's Choice Award. It was also nominated for a [[Genie Award]] for Best Documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academy.ca/hist/history.cfm?stitle=Go+Further&amp;awyear=0&amp;winonly=0&amp;awards=0&amp;rtype=2&amp;curstep=4&amp;submit.x=49&amp;submit.y=12 ACCT - Canadian Awards History Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The film features cameos by [[Dave Matthews]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Ken Kesey]], [[Bob Weir]] (of the [[Grateful Dead]]), [[Michael Franti]] (of [[Spearhead (band)|Spearhead]]), [[Anthony Kiedis]] (of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), [[Rob Heydon]], [[Medeski Martin &amp; Wood]], and [[The String Cheese Incident]].

==Description==
Ron Mann’s ''Go Further'' is a documentary observing the escapades of Woody Harrelson and his comrades as they travel from Seattle, Washington, to Los Angeles, California.  In an attempt to spread a message of change in order to better the planet, Woody and his companions - "a yoga-teacher, a raw food chef, a hemp-activist, a junk-food addict, and a college student who suspends her life to impulsively hop aboard" - &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphinxproductions.com/films/gofurther/ Go Further Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330010539/http://www.sphinxproductions.com/films/gofurther/ |date=2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; speak at numerous universities and visit various environmentally important sites.  These sites include a tree-friendly paper producer, an eco-friendly farmer, and an activist training camp where people are trained various techniques to resist authorities attempting to break up protests.  It is an example of [[individual and political action on climate change]], with a [[Left Coast]] flavor, in contrast with the [[New York City]] ''[[No Impact Man]]''.

{{main|Individual and political action on climate change}}

==Book==
The film also triggered the writing of a book, titled ''Go Further'', published by Warwick Publishing in Toronto, Ontario.  The book's ideologies and themes parallel the movie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1135">'''Incongruent melting''' occurs when a solid substance does not [[melting|melt]] uniformly. During melting a new solid (of different composition) forms. For example, melting of [[orthoclase]] (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) produces [[leucite]] (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) in addition to a melt. The melt produced is rich in silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) so that the proportions of leucite and melt created can be recombined to yield the bulk composition of the starting feldspar. Another mineral that melts incongruently is [[enstatite]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which produces forsterite (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in addition to a melt (if melting at low pressure). Enstatite melts congruently between pressures of 2.5 and 5.5 [[bar (unit)|kilobar]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">The '''Kudu Power Project''' is a project designed to increase power production in [[Namibia]]. The main elements of the project are development of the [[Kudu gas field]] and construction of an 800 MW combined cycle [[natural gas]]-fired power station at [[Oranjemund]]. When completed, the power station will feed Namibian and [[South Africa]]n power grids. The project will be developed by [[NamPower]], a national energy company of Namibia.

Of the total 800 MW capacity, approximately 400 MW are foreseen for use in Namibia. This amount would significantly increase the country´s current power supply capacity, which stands at 500MW and is mainly dependent on the [[Ruacana Power Station]].

'''Nappa leather''' is a  [[leather]], typically dyed, made from [[goat|goat]]-, cow-, calf-, [[sheep|lamb]]- or other skin by [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. It is noted for its soft hand. It is a generic term in the leather field and has no distinct test for characterization. Because of this ambiguity, the term is often used in advertising{{cn|date=September 2016}} to imply that a leather is particularly supple. Among other uses, Nappa leather is often used in leather products such as furniture, clothing, handbags, and shoes. As the term is used today, Nappa leather may be either natural grain,{{what|date=March 2018}} or more likely, corrected grain.{{what|dated=March 2018|date=November 2018}}

==History==
Nappa leather was first 'coined' by Emanuel Manasse in 1875 while working for the Sawyer Tanning Company in [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name="Emanuel Manasse"&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/ Emanuel Manasse] - obituary article (1899) and patent (1875), retrieved 11/08/2010 from Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Nappa tannage in the "strict sense", but a term no longer used in this framework, refers to a tannage consisting of alum salts with vegetable tanning agents.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/napa%20leather Napa leather] is defined in Merriam-Webster's dictionary.

'''Naval Reactors''' ('''NR''') is an umbrella term for the [[U.S. government]] office that has comprehensive responsibility for safe and reliable operation of the [[United States Navy]]'s nuclear propulsion program.  A single entity, it has authority and reporting responsibilities within both the [[United States Department of the Navy]] ([[NAVSEA]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]]) and the [[United States Department of Energy]] ([[National Nuclear Security Administration]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/45608main_NNBE_Progress_Report2_7-15-03.pdf NASA/Navy Benchmarking Exchange (NNBE)], Volume II, NASA Office of Safety &amp;

Program responsibilities are delineated in [https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12344.html Presidential Executive Order 12344 of February 1, 1982], and prescribed by Public Laws 98-525 of October 19, 1984 (42 USC 7158), and 106-65 of October 5, 1999 (50 USC 2406).&lt;ref name=NNSA&gt;[[National Nuclear Security Administration]], [http://nnsa.energy.gov/ourmission/poweringnavy Powering the Navy] - NNSP official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Soon after his U.S. Navy service during [[World War II]], Captain (later Admiral) [[Hyman G. Rickover]] became an early advocate of [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. Assigned to the [[Bureau of Ships]] in September 1947, Rickover received training in nuclear power at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and worked with the Bureau to explore the possibility of nuclear ship propulsion. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the Division of Reactor Development, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and then assumed control of the Navy's effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships.

The office was originally a joint activity of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships. When the AEC was abolished, Naval Reactors became a joint effort of the Navy and the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]], which partly replaced the AEC. In 1977, ERDA was combined with the Federal Energy Administration to form the U.S. Department of Energy. On the Navy side of the organization, the Bureau of Ships has transitioned since the 1950s to become the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), within which NR is Code 08, usually abbreviated NAVSEA 08 or SEA 08.

Within seven years of its inception, the organization that developed from this concept would put into operation the nation's first power reactor (the ''Nautilus'' prototype). The following four years would see three more nuclear submarines and two reactor plant prototypes operating and another seven ships and two prototypes being built. To date, more reactors have been built and safely operated by the NR program than any other US program.

[[Hyman G. Rickover]] parlayed an impressive personal publicity effort and intensive links with the [[United States Congress]] into an unprecedented tenure situation as head of Naval Reactors whereby he could not be relieved by conventional military procedures.&lt;ref name="RickoverEffect"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Rickover Effect | publisher=IUniverse, Lincoln, NE | author=Rockwell, Theodore | year=2002 | pages=155 | isbn=0-595-25270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted successively, partially as a result of Congressional involvement, until he reached the rank of full [[Admiral]] and held the position for over 30 years from 1949 to February 1, 1982 (when he was retired). 

The Director of Naval Reactors also serves as a Deputy Administrator of the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].&lt;ref name=NNSA /&gt;

==Management and personnel principles==
Many books (including those referenced below) and articles have been written about core NR management principles such as attention to detail and adherence to rigidly-defined standards and specifications, as well as the organization's unique (for government) personnel practices. NR staff and alumni (including Admiral Rickover himself) have often been called by Congress, the President and other government agencies to provide expert opinion and management support to other important government programs, most notably the large scale reviews following the destruction of the [[Space Shuttle]]s ''Columbia'' and ''Challenger''. NR alumni have also founded or led numerous corporate and industrial organizations, for example MPR Associates, Inc. [http://www.mpr.com/], founded by three of Admiral Rickover's leading technical managers in NR's early days.

The '''New York Power Authority''' (NYPA), officially the Power Authority of the State of New York, is a [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]]. It is the largest state public power organization in the [[United States]]. NYPA provides some of the lowest-cost [[electricity]] in the nation, operating 16 generating facilities and more than 1,400 circuit-miles of transmission lines. Its main administrative offices are in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].

NYPA uses no state tax dollars and incurs no state debt, financing its projects principally through the sale of [[bond (finance)|bond]]s. The bonds are repaid and the projects operated using revenues from operations.

State and federal regulations determine NYPA’s customer base, which includes large and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, public power systems and government agencies. NYPA also sells electricity to private utilities for resale (without profit) to their customers, and to neighboring states, under federal requirements. Approximately 70 percent of the electricity NYPA produces is clean renewable [[hydropower]]. Its lower-cost power production and electricity purchases support hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout [[New York State]].

The New York Power Authority has been financially responsible for the  [[New York State Canal Corporation]] since April 2016 and has owned it since January 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypa.gov/Press/2016/123116.html|title=N.Y. Power Authority to Assume Ownership of Canal Corporation on New Year's Day|date=January 2, 2017|publisher=New York Power Authority|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
“Power the economic growth and competitiveness of New York State by providing customers with low-cost, clean, reliable power and the innovative energy infrastructure and services they value.”

==Organization==
Since 2011, the President and Chief Executive Officer has been [[Gil C. Quiniones]]. The executive staff report to a 7-member board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nypa.gov/about/leadership|title=NYPA Org Webpage|date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it had operating expenses of $2.335 billion, an outstanding debt of $1.305 billion, and a staffing level of 2,327 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abo.ny.gov/reports/annualreports/ABO2018AnnualReport.pdf|title=NYSABO 2018 Report|pp=16,29,44|date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Electric power produced from NYPA's facilities - in addition to being sold to large and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, public power systems, government agencies, private utilities for resale (without profit) to their customers, and neighboring states, under federal requirements - is sold into the wholesale electricity market of New York State, which is administered by the [[New York energy law#NYISO|NYISO]]. A larger direct sales customer of electric power is the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]. NYPA also provides electrical engineering consulting services to the MTA when the MTA is planning for and building new power facilities.  

==Facilities==

===Hydroelectric generation===
NYPA operates three large [[hydroelectric]] complexes: the 2,441-[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant|Niagara Power Project]], on the [[Niagara River]] in Lewiston; the 800-MW [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam|St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project]], on the [[St. Lawrence River]] in Massena; and the 1,160-MW [[Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project]] in the Catskill Mountain towns of North Blenheim and Gilboa.

NYPA also has four small hydro facilities with a net capability of 10-MW: the Ashokan Project in Ulster County, the Crescent Plant in [[Albany County, New York|Albany]] and [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] counties, the Gregory B. Jarvis Plant in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] and the Vischer Ferry Plant in [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] counties.

===Petroleum-based generation===
Other generating facilities include two highly efficient natural gas-fueled power plants: the 135-MW Richard M. Flynn Power Plant, in Holtsville, [[Long Island]] and a 500-MW facility, in Astoria, [[Queens, New York|Queens]].

Additionally, NYPA operates seven small, clean power plants also fueled by natural gas. Those units – six in [[New York City]] and one on Long Island – combine for 461-MW.

===Electric transmission lines===
The hub of NYPA’s statewide power transmission facilities is the Frederick R. Clark Energy Center, in [[Marcy, New York]]. NYPA’s high-voltage transmission assets include a 765-kilovolt (kV) line that stretches more than 100 miles from the Canada–US border to the Clark Energy Center and almost 1,000 miles of 345-kV power lines that crisscross New York State, including the [[Marcy South|Marcy South line]] and a {{convert|26.3|mi|abbr=on}} transmission project, that follows an underground and underwater path from Westchester County to Long Island.

===New York State Canal Corporation===
The New York Power Authority has been financially responsible for the  [[New York State Canal Corporation]] since April 2016 and has owned it since January 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypa.gov/Press/2016/123116.html|title=N.Y. Power Authority to Assume Ownership of Canal Corporation on New Year's Day|date=January 2, 2017|publisher=New York Power Authority|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Governor Roosevelt]] signed the Power Authority Act into law on April 27, 1931.

[[File:StLawrencePowerProject.jpg|thumb|left|St. Lawrence Power Project]]'''St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project'''
The [[International Joint Commission]] granted its approval for a cross-border construction project in 1952. In 1953, the [[Federal Power Commission]] issued a license for NYPA to develop the U.S. portion of a power dam crossing the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]]. On May 13, 1954, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed legislation that cleared the way for construction of both a hydroelectric facility and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].
First power was achieved in July 1958, and on June 27, 1959, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and Vice President [[Richard M. Nixon]] formally dedicated the St. Lawrence Project as a symbol of international cooperation. In 1981, NYPA’s half of the cross-border power dam was renamed the St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project in honor of the man who founded the Power Authority half a century earlier.

'''Niagara Power Project'''
[[File:NiagaraPowerVista.jpg|thumb|Niagara Power Vista]]In 1956, a rock slide destroyed most of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.’s Schoellkopf hydropower plant, resulting in a power shortage that endangered thousands of local manufacturing jobs. In response to the emergency, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act in 1957. After obtaining a license from the [[Federal Power Commission]], [[Robert Moses]] commenced work on NYPA’s second hydroelectric generating station in early 1958. When it was completed, three years later, the Niagara Power Project was the largest facility of its kind in the Western world. In a recorded message broadcast February 10, 1961, to mark first power, President [[John F. Kennedy]] called the Niagara project “[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Pi-0aHRDQ an outstanding engineering achievement]” and an “example to the world of North American efficiency and determination.”

[[File:BlenheimGilboa.jpg|thumb|left|Blenheim-Gilboa Power Project]]'''Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project''' &lt;br&gt;Legislation signed by Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] in 1968 allowed NYPA to expand its generation assets and build nuclear and pumped storage power projects. This led to construction of the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project, which produced electricity for the first time in July 1973, and the [[James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant]] (named after a NYPA chairman), in Scriba, [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]], where power was first generated in February 1975.

{{nuclear weapons}}

A '''nuclear explosion''' is an [[explosion]] that occurs as a result of the rapid release of energy from a high-speed [[nuclear reaction]]. The driving reaction may be [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion]] or a multi-stage cascading combination of the two, though to date all fusion-based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion, and a [[pure fusion weapon]] remains a hypothetical device.

Atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with [[mushroom cloud]]s, although mushroom clouds can occur with large chemical explosions. It is possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without those clouds. Nuclear explosions produce [[radiation]] and [[radioactive]] debris.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}

{{Main article|Nuclear weapons testing|List of nuclear weapons tests|History of nuclear weapons}}

The first man made nuclear explosion occurred on July 16, 1945 at 5:50 am on the [[Trinity Test]] Site near [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]] in the United States, an area now known as the [[White Sands Missile Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. Department of Energy|title=Trinity Site - World's First Nuclear Explosion|url=https://energy.gov/management/trinity-site-worlds-first-nuclear-explosion|website=Energy.gov Office of Management|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=70 Years Since Trinity: The Day the Nuclear Age Began|journal=The Atlantic|date=July 16, 2015|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2015/07/70-years-since-trinity-when-we-tested-nuclear-bombs/398735/|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event involved the full-scale testing of an implosion-type fission [[atomic bomb]]. In a memorandum to the U.S. Secretary of War, General Leslie Groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groves|first1=General Leslie|title=The First Nuclear Test in New Mexico: Memorandum for the Secretary of War, Subject: The Test|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/truman-bombtest/|accessdate=23 December 2016|agency=PBS.org|publisher=United States War Department|date=July 18, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this test, a uranium-gun type nuclear bomb ([[Little Boy]]) was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, with a blast yield of 15 kilotons; and a plutonium implosion-type bomb ([[Fat Man]]) on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, with a blast yield of 21 kilotons. In the years following [[World War II]], eight countries have conducted nuclear tests with 2475 devices fired in 2120 tests.&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{citation|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaoping|first2=Robert|last2=North|first3=Carl|last3=Romney|first4=Paul G.|last4=Richards|date=August 2000|title=Worldwide Nuclear Explosions|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/my_papers/WW_nuclear_tests_IASPEI_HB.pdf|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the [[United States]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], pledging to refrain from testing [[nuclear weapon]]s in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground tests. Many other non-nuclear nations acceded to the Treaty following its entry into force; however, two nuclear weapons states have not acceded: [[France]], [[China]] {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The primary application to date has been military (i.e. nuclear weapons), and the remainder of explosions include the following:

*[[Nuclear pulse propulsion]], including using a nuclear explosion as asteroid deflection strategy.
*Power generation; see [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]]
*[[Peaceful nuclear explosions]]

==Nuclear weapons==
{{Main article|Nuclear weapons|History of nuclear weapons}}

Only two nuclear weapons have been deployed in [[combat]]—both by the United States against [[Japan]] in [[World War II]]. The first event occurred on the morning of 6 August 1945, when the [[United States Army Air Forces]] dropped a [[uranium]] gun-type device, code-named "[[Little Boy]]", on the city of [[Hiroshima]], killing 70,000 people, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean [[Unfree labour|slave laborers]]. The second event occurred three days later when the United States Army Air Forces dropped a [[plutonium]] implosion-type device, code-named "[[Fat Man]]", on the city of [[Nagasaki]]. It killed 39,000 people, including 27,778 Japanese munitions employees, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants. In total, around 119,000 people were killed in these [[bomb]]ings. (See ''[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]'' for a full discussion). Nuclear weapons are largely seen as a 'deterrent' by most governments; the sheer scale of the destruction caused by a nuclear weapon has prevented serious consideration of their use in [[war]]fare, rendering the concept of [[total war]] completely useless.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Nuclear testing===
{{Main article|Nuclear testing}}

Since the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] and excluding the combat use of nuclear weapons, mankind (those few nations with capability) has detonated roughly 1,700 nuclear explosions, all but 6 as tests. Of these, six were [[peaceful nuclear explosion]]s. '''Nuclear tests''' are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Throughout the 20th century, most nations that have developed nuclear weapons had a staged test of them. Testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work, as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how structures behave when subjected to a nuclear explosion. Additionally, nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most [[list of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons states]] publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test.

==Effects of nuclear explosions==
{{Main article|Effects of nuclear explosions}}

The dominant effects of a nuclear weapon (the blast and thermal radiation) are the same physical damage mechanisms as conventional [[Explosive material|explosive]]s, but the energy produced by a nuclear explosive is millions of times more per gram and the temperatures reached are in the tens of [[megakelvin]]. Nuclear weapons are quite different from conventional weapons because of the huge amount of explosive energy they can put out and the different kinds of effects they make, like high temperatures and nuclear radiation.

The devastating impact of the explosion does not stop after the initial blast, as with conventional explosives. A cloud of nuclear radiation travels from the epicenter of the explosion, causing an impact to life forms even after the heat waves have ceased.

Any nuclear explosion (or [[nuclear war]]) would have wide-ranging, long-term, catastrophic effects. [[Radioactive contamination]] would cause [[genetic mutation]]s and cancer across many generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Fraser]] and [[Tilman Ruff]]. [http://www.theage.com.au/comment/2015-is-the-year-to-ban-nuclear-weapons-20150219-13jali.html#ixzz4BTMwrzJ2 2015 is the year to ban nuclear weapons],

'''Paul David Klemperer''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 15 August 1956)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U23290 KLEMPERER, Prof. Paul David’], ''Who's Who 2014'', A &amp; C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is an economist and the Edgeworth Professor of Economics at [[Oxford University]]. He is a member of the [[Klemperer|Klemperer family]]. He works on industrial economics, competition policy, [[auction]] theory, and [[climate change]] economics and policy.

Klemperer has an engineering degree from [[Cambridge University]], and an [[MBA]] and an economics PhD from [[Stanford University]]. He was elected John Thomson Fellow and tutor of [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]] in 1984, and a professorial fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford]] in 1995, when he became [[Edgeworth Professor of Economics]] in succession to Nobel Prize winner [[James Mirrlees]].

He was a member of the UK [[Competition Commission]] from 2001–5. He was elected a fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1994, a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1999, and a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.

== Academic contributions ==

His 1985 papers (with Jeremy Bulow and John Geanakoplos) developed the concept – and invented the terminology&amp;nbsp;– of "[[strategic complements]]" that is now commonly used in game theory, industrial organisation and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/multimarket.PDF Multimarket Oligopoly, JPE]&lt;/ref&gt;

His PhD thesis, and independent work by Carl Christian von Weizsacker, began the study of consumer [[switching costs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1885068?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101520514723 Switching Costs, QJE]&lt;/ref&gt;

His paper on supply function equilibria (with Margaret Meyer) developed a standard model for the analysis of privatised electricity markets, and has been important in developing the theory of multiunit auctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/supply.pdf Supply Functions, Econometrica]&lt;/ref&gt;

His papers (many of which are co-authored with Jeremy Bulow) apply ideas from auction theory to other economic contexts, including finance and political economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138791?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101520514723 Rational Frenzies and Crashes, JPE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/116984?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101520514723 War of Attrition, AER]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2118262?uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101520514723 Auctions versus negotiations, AER]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also invented new auction designs, including the "Product Mix Auction" that is now in regular use by the Bank of England (currently used monthly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00523.x | volume=8 | title=THE PRODUCT-MIX AUCTION: A NEW AUCTION DESIGN FOR DIFFERENTIATED GOODS | year=2010 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=526–536 | last1 = Klemperer | first1 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new auction for differentiated products has similarities to a simultaneous multiple-round auction, but runs instantaneously, is said to be more robust against collusion, and allows sellers, as well as buyers, to specify how the quantities they trade will depend on the auction prices. His other innovations include the Anglo-Dutch auction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292197001232 | doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(97)00123-2 | volume=42 | title=Auctions with almost common values: The `Wallet Game' and its applications | year=1998 | journal=European Economic Review | pages=757–769 | last1 = Klemperer | first1 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with Aytek Erdil) Reference-Rule Pricing for package auctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00524.x | volume=8 | title=A NEW PAYMENT RULE FOR CORE-SELECTING PACKAGE AUCTIONS | year=2010 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=537–547 | last1 = Erdil | first1 = Aytek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also worked (with Elizabeth Baldwin) on applying [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry tropical geometry] to economics and auctions, including the Product Mix auction.

== Public policy ==

He was principal auction-theorist designing the UK '[[3G]]' mobile-phone license auction that raised £22½ billion in spring 2000 and was far more successful than several parallel exercises on the [[European continent]]. The Netherland auction that took place 3 months later raised 1/4 of the revenue per head of population, and the difference has been attributed to the auction design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ikt.web.etu.edu.tr/RePEc/pdf/1002.pdf Madden, Saglam and Morey "Auction Design and the Success of National 3G Spectrum Auctions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708233133/http://ikt.web.etu.edu.tr/RePEc/pdf/1002.pdf |date=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the [[UK Treasury]] owes £15 billion or more to him and [[Ken Binmore]], who led the auction team.

In 2002, he advised the [[UK government]] on the world's first auction for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, working with Nobel prizewinner [[Eric Maskin]].

In 2007–2008, he advised the UK and US governments on the financial crisis, and he developed a new form of auction (the Product Mix auction) to help the [[Bank of England]] alleviate the liquidity crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regulation2point0.org/2010/08/auction-magic/ Auction Magic, Reguation2point0]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank Governor, Sir Mervyn King, told the Economist that "The Bank of England's use of Klemperer auctions in our liquidity insurance operations is a marvellous application of theoretical economics to a practical problem of vital importance to financial markets."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/10/microeconomics A golden age of micro. The Economist, October 19th 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently advised other countries' Central Banks.

He advised the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] 1999–2001, was a member of the UK [[Competition Commission]] from 2001–5, and remains on its Panel of Economic Advisors.

He participated in the meeting that drafted the Potsdam Memorandum to the 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in [[Bali]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxeu.org/article/climate-change-innovation-key What is the top priority on climate change?, VoxEU]&lt;/ref&gt; he is on the Environmental Economics Academic Panel to the UK's Department of the Environment (Defra).

The '''Peugeot EX1 Concept''' is an [[electric car|electric]] [[concept car|concept]] [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]] introduced and made by the [[France|French]] [[automaker]] [[Peugeot]], presented at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]]. It has two engines that provide 250&amp;nbsp;kW (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and 480 Nm of torque.&lt;ref name="autosterracom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://autos.terra.com/noticias/paris_2010_peugeot_ex1_concept/aut96824 |title=Paris 2010: Peugeot EX1 Concept |publisher=Terra |accessdate=2011-02-18}} ''French language''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
As part of [[Peugeot]]’s 200th anniversary celebrations, the brand’s design offices wanted to create a [[concept car]], electrically powered.&lt;ref name="peugeotcom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peugeot.com/en/design/concepts-cars/concept-ex1.aspx |title=Concept EX1 |publisher=Peugeot |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Previous [[concept cars]] from [[Peugeot]] have been the Asphalte and 20Cup. The EX1 is a 2-door [[roadster (automobile)|roadster]] that is shaped like a “water droplet”, with a rear section built around two closely set rear wheels.

The EX1 features stylistic design codes first presented on the SR1 concept in earlier 2010. The [[monocoque]] body structure is manufactured from a carbon/honeycomb composite to optimise weight and rigidity. The car is 0.90 metres high and 1.77 metres wide.

==Performance==
It has broken six speed records for a vehicle weighing less than 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. From a standing start, the EX1 set the following times: 1/8 mile (8.89sec), 1/4 mile (14.4s), 500m (16.81s), 1/2 mile (23.85s), 1000m (28.16s), and 1 mile (41.09s).&lt;ref name="eurotuner09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurotuner.com/news/eurp_1009_peugeot_ex1_electric_speed_record |title=Peugeot EX1 Concept Sets Electric Speed Records |publisher=eurotuner |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph run in 2.24sec and an overall top speed of 161&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="electrovelocitycom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electrovelocity.com/2010/09/22/stunning-peugeot-ex-1-unveiled |title=Stunning Peugeot EX 1 Unveiled |publisher=ElectroVelocity |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Taipingsi military airport in [[Chengdu, China]], the EX1 improved those records with 7.08s for 1/8mile, 12.67s for 1/4mile, and 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h at 2.24s&lt;ref name="eurotuner12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurotuner.com/news/eurp_1012_peugeot_ex1_ev_breaks_records |title=Peugeot EX1 EV breaks records in China |publisher=eurotuner |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monstersandcriticscom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1607263.php |title=Peugeot with record drive in electric EX1 concept |publisher=M&amp;C |author=Deutsche Presse Agentur |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2011-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012082147/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1607263.php |archivedate=2012-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="060mag"&gt;[http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ Concept Or Not, Peugeot EX1 Is One Fast EV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224082830/http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ |date=2013-12-24 }} ''0-60mag''.

A '''Planck particle''', named after physicist [[Max Planck]], is a hypothetical particle defined as a tiny [[black hole]] whose [[Compton wavelength]] is equal to its [[Schwarzschild radius]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel M. Deza; Elena Deza. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LXEezzccwcoC Encyclopedia of Distances]''. Springer; 1 June 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-642-00233-5}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LXEezzccwcoC&amp;pg=PA433 433].&lt;/ref&gt; Its mass is thus approximately the Planck mass, and its Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are about the Planck length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q525116713762240/ "Light element synthesis in Planck fireballs" - SpringerLink]&lt;/ref&gt; Planck particles are sometimes used as an exercise to define the Planck mass and Planck length.&lt;ref&gt;B. Roy Frieden; Robert A. Gatenby. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qw5ka5HezacC Exploratory data analysis using Fisher information]''. Springer; 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84628-506-6}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qw5ka5HezacC&amp;pg=PA163 163].&lt;/ref&gt; They play a role in some models of the evolution of the universe during the [[Planck epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Edward Robert |last=Harrison | 
url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC |title=Cosmology: the science of the universe | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-521-66148-5}} p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=–8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA424 424]&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to a [[proton]], for example, the Planck particle would be extremely small (its radius being equal to the [[Planck length]], which is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; times the proton's radius) and massive (the [[Planck mass]] being 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; times the proton's mass).{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=–8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA478 478]}} The Planck particle would also have a very fleeting existence, evaporating due to [[Hawking radiation]] after approximately {{val|5|e=-39|u=[[second]]s}}.

==Derivation==
While opinions vary as to its proper definition, the most common definition of a Planck particle is a particle whose [[Compton wavelength]] is equal to its [[Schwarzschild radius]]. This sets the relationship:

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{m c} = \frac{2 G m}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus making the mass of such a particle:

: &lt;math&gt; m = \sqrt{\frac{h c}{2 G}} &lt;/math&gt;

This mass will be &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi } &lt;/math&gt; times larger than the [[Planck mass]], making a Planck particle 1.772 times more massive than the Planck unit mass.

Its radius will be the Compton wavelength:

: &lt;math&gt; r = \frac{h}{m c} = \sqrt{\frac{2G h}{c^3}} &lt;/math&gt;
The Planck length {{math|&lt;var&gt;ℓ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\ell_\mathrm{P}= \frac{r}{2 \sqrt{\pi}} =\sqrt\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}  &lt;/math&gt;

==Dimensions==
Using the above derivations we can substitute the universal constants ''h'', ''G'', and ''c'', and determine physical values for the particle's mass and radius. Assuming this radius represents a sphere of uniform density we can further determine the particle's volume and density.

'''''Pourouma cecropiifolia''''' ('''Amazon grape''', '''Amazon tree-grape''' or '''uvilla'''; syn. ''P. multifida'') is a species of ''[[Pourouma]]'', native to tropical [[South America]], in the western [[Amazon Basin]] in northern [[Bolivia]], western [[Brazil]], southeastern [[Colombia]], eastern [[Ecuador]], eastern [[Peru]], and southern [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a medium-sized [[evergreen]] [[tree]] growing to 20 m tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are palmately compound, with 9–11 leaflets 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2.5–4&amp;nbsp;cm broad, on a 20&amp;nbsp;cm petiole. The [[flower]]s are white, produced 20 or more together in a 10&amp;nbsp;cm long [[inflorescence]]; it is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female flowers on separate trees. The [[fruit]] is ovoid, 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm long, purple when ripe, [[grape]]-like except for its [[wintergreen]] smell; the skin is rough, inedible but easily peeled.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed.

==Agriculture==
The fruit is sweet and juicy, eaten fresh and made into jams. The tree grows quickly, and grows well in poor upland soils. It is vulnerable to floods. The fruit is susceptible to fungal attacks and does not keep well, which limits its commercial viability.&lt;ref name=rainforestconservation/&gt;

[[File:SESShield-3D.png|thumb|Analysis software for lightning protection used on a power substation.]]

'''Power engineering software''' is [[software]] used to create models, analyze or calculate the design of [[Power station]]s, [[Overhead power line]]s, [[Transmission tower]]s, [[Electrical grid]]s, [[Ground (electricity)|Grounding]] and Lightning{{clarify|date=July 2017}} systems and others. It is a type of application software which is used for power engineering problems, which are transformed into mathematical expressions.

== History ==
The first software for power engineering were created  in the end of 60s. The first software were created for monitoring [[power plant]]s. In the next decades the Power engineering and Computer technologies are develop very fast. It were created and software,to collect the data for the power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=2808|title=Plant Performance Monitoring|website=www.cpuc.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first computer languages,which were used in the [[Nuclear plant]]s and in the [[Thermal plant]]s were [[C (programming language)]]. In the next years the programming language [[Python (programming language)|Python]] were used,to be create algorithms and software programs. In French [[Nuclear plant]]s one of the most using computer languages is Python.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Who-writes-the-software-for-nuclear-power-plants-Which-languages-do-they-use|title=Who writes the software for nuclear power plants? Which languages do they use?|website=www.quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of 80s were developed the first programs and platforms for electrical power modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://etap.com/company/about-us|title=About Us - Operation Technology -Corporate Profile - 7 C's of ETAP - ETAP|website=etap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power plants analysis software ==
[[File:Etap.png|thumb|3D modeling grounding grid]]
After 2000 begins to develop rapidly analytical programming and [[3D modeling]]. Software products are being created for design power plants and their elements and connections. Programs are based on mathematical algorithms and computations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dlubal.com/en/solutions/industries/power-plants-analysis-and-design-software|title=Analysis &amp; Design Software for Power Plants|first=Dlubal|last=Software|website=Dlubal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power software as ETAP, [[CYME (software)|CYME]], DINIS, IPSA, PSS/E and DIgSILENT are pioneers at the category power engineering software. Most of this product used [[MARKAL]], [[Energy Technologies Institute|ESME]] and other modelling methods. The transmission lines be designed according to minimum requirements set out in the SQSS (security and quality of supply standard). This also applies to other elements of the power systems. In the software world,were developed many CAD software products for 2D and 3D electrical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pannam.com/blog/top-design-engineering-software-tools/|title=50 Top Design Engineering Software Tools and Apps - Pannam|date=9 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable energy controller software ==
The controllers of Renewable energy used different software. The digital controllers are different types: ADC, DAC, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnvgl.com/energy/generation/software/index.html|title=Renewables Software - DNV GL|website=DNV GL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controllers most of the time to this date are programmed with computer languages like:C,C++,Java and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/1423231/?reload=true|title=C++ encapsulated dynamic runtime power control for embedded systems|first1=O.

A '''rattleback''' is a semi-ellipsoidal [[top]] which will rotate on its axis in a preferred direction. If spun in the opposite direction, it becomes unstable, "rattles" to a stop and reverses its spin to the preferred direction.

This spin-reversal appears to violate the law of the [[angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]]. Moreover, for most rattlebacks the motion will happen when the rattleback is spun in one direction, but not when spun in the other. Some exceptional rattlebacks will reverse when spun in either direction.&lt;ref name="motivate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Hugh's Talk |work=Millennium Mathematics Project |url=http://motivate.maths.org/conferences/conf14/c14_talk1.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306062339/http://www.motivate.maths.org/conferences/conf14/c14_talk1.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-06 |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This makes the rattleback a physical curiosity that has excited human imagination since prehistorical times.&lt;ref&gt;"celt, n.2". OED Online. September 2012. Oxford University Press. 1 October 2012 &lt;http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/29533?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=2&amp;rskey=EPfrjA&amp;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A rattleback may also be known as a "anagyre", "[[celt (tool)|celt]]", "Celtic stone", "rebellious celt", "rattlerock", "spin bar", "Robinson Reverser", "wobble stone" (or "wobblestone") and by the product names "ARK", "Bizzaro Swirl", "RATTLEBACK", "Space Pet" and "Space Toy".

==History==
[[File:RATTLEBACK - ANAGYRE -(GAEL 24 inches) - Emmanuel Peluchon.jpg|thumb|Large rattleback made from different wood densities]]
Archeologists who investigated ancient [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[archaeology|sites]] in the 19th century found celts which exhibited the spin-reversal motion. The [[antiquarian]] word "[[celt (tool)|celt]]" (the "c" is pronounced as "s") describes [[adze]]-, [[axe]]-, [[chisel]]- and [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]-shaped [[lithic analysis|lithic]] tools and weapons.

The first modern descriptions of these celts were published in the 1890s when [[Gilbert Walker]] wrote his "On a curious dynamical property of celts" for the ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' in Cambridge, England, and "On a dynamical top" for the ''Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics'' in Somerville, Massachusetts, US.

Additional examinations of rattlebacks were published in 1909 and 1918, and by the 1950s and 1970s, several more examinations were made. But, the popular fascination with the objects has increased notably since the 1980s when no fewer than 28 examinations were published.

==Size and materials==
[[File:Celt with weights of gemstone turtles-01.jpg|thumb|200px|Carved wooden rattleback]]
While rattleback [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s are described as stone with various measurements, most which are sold currently as novelty puzzles and toys are described as plastic with measurements of 3.75 inches long x 0.75 inches wide x 0.4375 inches high. Carved wooden rattlebacks are described with a measurement of 5.5 to 6 inches in length. One plastic rattleback made and sold by Charles W. Sherburne is described as 12 inches in length. Glass rattlebacks, and those made of spoons, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.exo.net/~pauld/TomTits2000/europetrip/technorama%20lecture/technoramalecture.html&lt;/ref&gt; are described as being tested with unreported measurements. Larger rattlebacks (up to 8 feet long and 16 inches wide) are made on request by Emmanuel Peluchon for science museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boisselier.ca/en/products-page/curiosities/|title=Rattlebacks, puzzles and musical tree by Emmanuel Peluchon|website=boisselier.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two rattleback design types exist. They have either an asymmetrical base with a skewed rolling axis, or a symmetrical base with offset weighting at the ends.

==Physics==
[[Image:Rolling-pitching.png|thumb|200px|Rolling and pitching motions|left]]
The spin-reversal motion follows from the growth of [[flight dynamics|instabilities]] on the other rotation axes, that are rolling (on the main axis) and pitching (on the crosswise axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/dynamo08/moffatt/ | title=Keith Moffatt, Cambridge Univ. &amp; KITP, Rattleback Reversals: A Prototype of Chiral Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spoon_Celt.webm|thumb|Rattleback made with spoon exhibiting multiple spin reversals. Original video and idea by Prof. Christian Ucke.]]
When there is an asymmetry in the mass distribution with respect to the plane formed by the pitching and the vertical axes, a coupling of these two instabilities arises; one can imagine how the asymmetry in mass will deviate the rattleback when pitching, which will create some rolling.

The amplified mode will differ depending on the spin direction, which explains the rattleback's asymmetrical behavior. Depending on whether it is rather a pitching or rolling instability that dominates, the growth rate will be very high or quite low.

This explains why, due to friction, most rattlebacks appear to exhibit spin-reversal motion only when spun in the pitching-unstable direction, also known as the strong reversal direction. When the rattleback is spun in the "stable direction", also known as the weak reversal direction, friction and damping often slow the rattleback to a stop before the rolling instability has time to fully build.  Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit "unstable behavior" when spun in either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988RSPSA.418..165G|title=Spin Reversal of the Rattleback: Theory and Experiment|first1=A.|last1=Garcia|first2=M.|last2=Hubbard|date=8 July 1988|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=418|issue=1854|pages=165–197|doi=10.1098/rspa.1988.0078}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other ways to add motion to a rattleback include tapping by pressing down momentarily on either of its ends, and rocking by pressing down repeatedly on either of its ends.

For a comprehensive analysis of rattleback's motion, see V.Ph. Zhuravlev and D.M. Klimov (2008).&lt;ref&gt;V.Ph. Zhuravlev and D.M. Klimov, Global motion of the celt, ''Mechanics of Solids'', 2008, Vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 320-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous papers were based on simplified assumptions and limited to studying local instability of its steady-state oscillation.

Realistic mathematical modelling of a rattleback is presented by G. Kudra and J. Awrejcewicz (2015).&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00707-015-1353-z G. Kudra, J. Awrejcewicz, Application and experimental validation of new computational models of friction forces and rolling resistance, ''Acta Mechanica'', 2015 (DOI: 10.1007/s00707-015-1353-z).]&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on modelling of the contact forces and tested different versions of models of friction and rolling resistance, obtaining good agreement with the experimental results.

Numerical simulations predict that a rattleback situated on a harmonically oscillating base can exhibit rich bifurcation dynamics, including different types of periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Awrejcewicz, G. Kudra, Mathematical modelling and simulation of the bifurcational wobblestone dynamics, ''Discontinuity, Nonlinearity and Complexity'', 3(2), 2014, 123-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scalar boson''' is a [[boson]] whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] equals zero. ''Boson'' means that it has an integer-valued [[Spin (physics)|spin]]; the ''scalar'' fixes this value to 0.

The name ''scalar boson'' arises from [[quantum field theory]]. It refers to the particular transformation properties under [[Lorentz transformation]].

== Examples ==
* The only fundamental scalar boson in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is the [[Higgs boson]], the existence of which was confirmed on 14 March 2013 at the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. As a result of this confirmation, the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] was awarded to [[Peter Higgs]] and [[François Englert]].
* Various known composite particles are scalar bosons, e.g. the [[alpha particle]] and the [[pion]].
** [[Scalar meson]]s have invariant [[Parity (physics)|parity]] under Lorentz transformation, whereas [[pseudoscalar meson]]s reverse parity under Lorentz transformation.
* The [[Quartic interaction|''φ''⁴-theory]], a popular quantum field theory, uses scalar bosonic fields as employed in many introductory books to quantum field theories,&lt;ref&gt;

'''Seversk''' ({{lang-ru|Се́верск}}) is a [[closed city|closed]] [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Tomsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], located {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} northwest of [[Tomsk]] on the right bank of the [[Tom River]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=108,590|p2002=109,106}}

==History==
Founded in 1949, it was known as '''Pyaty Pochtovy''' ({{lang|ru|Пя́тый Почто́вый}}, lit. ''the Fifth Postal'') until 1954 and as '''Tomsk-7''' ({{lang|ru|Томск-7}}) until 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} City status was granted to it in 1956.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with five [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as '''Seversk [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Tomsk Oblast|districts]].&lt;ref name="Ref267"&gt;Law #271-OZ&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Seversk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Seversk Urban Okrug'''.&lt;ref name="Ref898"&gt;Decision #69/1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Seversk is the site of the [[Siberian Chemical Combine]], founded in 1954. It comprises several [[nuclear reactor]]s and chemical plants for separation, enrichment, and reprocessing of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Following an agreement in March 2003 between [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] to shut down Russia's three remaining plutonium-producing reactors, two of the three plutonium producing reactors (the two that are sited at Seversk) have now been shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world-nuclear-news.org/print.aspx?id=18136|title=Russia shuts second plutonium-producing reactor at Seversk|date=6 June 2008|publisher=World Nuclear News|accessdate=August 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726095422/http://world-nuclear-news.org/print.aspx?id=18136|archivedate=July 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The remaining operating production reactor is sited at [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk in Krasnoyarsk Krai]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear warheads]] are produced and stored on the premises. One of the most serious [[nuclear accident]]s at SGCE occurred on April&amp;nbsp;6, 1993, when a tank containing a highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] solution exploded.

==Government==
The current Chair of the City [[Duma]] and Mayor is [[Grigory Shamin]], who has served since 2010. The current city manager is Anatoly Abramov, who has served since August 2007.

== Secret city ==
[[File:Seversk Central control.jpg|thumb|left|Central entry checkpoint]]

Seversk was a secret city in the [[Soviet Union]] until President [[Boris Yeltsin]] decreed in 1992 that such cities could use their historical names. The town appeared on no official maps until then. As was the tradition with Soviet towns containing secret facilities, the designation "Tomsk-7" (like its predecessor "Pyaty Pochtovy") is simply a [[postal code]] which implies that the place is located close to the city of Tomsk.

For many years, residents had restrictions to enter or leave the city. Upon leaving Seversk, residents had to surrender their special entry passes at the checkpoint and were forbidden from discussing where they worked or lived. In 1987 some restrictions were lifted due to the large number of residents who worked or studied in Tomsk.

The city still remains closed to non-residents. There are six checkpoints where visitors must show entry documents. Permission to visit the city may only be granted by the appropriate authorities through the institution being visited, or through a private party such as a close relative. Prior to May 2007, visitors had to apply for entry passes at a special office in Tomsk proper. Since that date visitors can apply for entry documents directly at the main checkpoint.

==Tomsk-7 explosion==
There was a [[nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] at the [[Tomsk-7 Reprocessing Complex]] on April&amp;nbsp;6, 1993, when a tank exploded while being cleaned with [[nitric acid]]. The explosion released a cloud of [[radioactive gas]]. [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] has identified the Tomsk-7 explosion as one of the world's 10 [[List of nuclear and radiation fatalities by country|"worst nuclear disasters"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=August 26, 2009|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Nine municipal cultural and artistic institutions successfully work in Seversk, as well as four establishments of additional education for children of artistic and aesthetic focus and two organizations of other forms — a nonprofit organization [https://web.archive.org/web/20110823160251/http://old.seversknet.ru/city/fotoalb/20.html "House of Culture in the name of N. Ostrovskiy"] and a cinema called [http://www.seversknet.ru/culture/mir/ "Mir"].

==Education==
There is a major post-secondary school in the city, the [[Seversk State Technological Academy]], a branch of [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]].

'''Sodium chlorate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Sodium|Na]][[Chlorate|ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is a white [[crystalline]] powder that is readily soluble in water. It is [[hygroscopic]]. It decomposes above 300&amp;nbsp;°C to release [[oxygen]]&lt;ref name=pubchem&gt;{{PubChemLink|516902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leave [[sodium chloride]]. Several hundred million tons are produced annually, mainly for applications in [[bleach]]ing paper.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Synthesis==
Industrially, sodium chlorate is produced by the [[electrolysis]] of a hot sodium chloride solution:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Helmut Vogt, Jan Balej, John E. Bennett, Peter Wintzer, Saeed Akbar Sheikh, Patrizio Gallone “Chlorine Oxides and Chlorine Oxygen Acids” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_483}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:NaCl + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →  NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

This reaction progresses in heat (at least 70 degrees Celsius), and controlled [[pH]]. In lower temperature or with high pH another reaction progresses:
2 NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[Sodium hypochlorite|NaClO]] + NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[Chloralkali process]] is an industrial process for the electrolytic production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine.

It can also be synthesized by passing [[chlorine]] gas through a solution of [[sodium hydroxide]]. It is then purified by [[crystallization]].

==Uses==
The main commercial use for sodium chlorate is for making [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The largest application of ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which accounts for about 95% of the use of chlorate, is in bleaching of pulp.  All perchlorate compounds are produced industrially by the oxidation of solutions of sodium chlorate by electrolysis.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Herbicides===
Sodium chlorate is used as a non-selective [[herbicide]]. It is considered [[phytotoxicity|phytotoxic]] to all green plant parts. It can also kill through root absorption.

Sodium chlorate may be used to control a variety of plants including [[morning glory]], [[canada thistle]], [[johnson grass]], [[bamboo]], [[senecio|Ragwort]], and [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]]. The herbicide is mainly used on non-crop land for spot treatment and for total vegetation control on areas including roadsides, fenceways, and ditches. Sodium chlorate is also used as a [[defoliant]] and [[desiccant]] for:

{{columns|col1 = 
*[[Cotton]]
*[[Safflower]]
*[[maize|Corn]]
*[[Flax]]
*[[capsicum|Peppers]]
*[[Soybean]]s
| col2 = 
*Grain [[sorghum]]
*Southern peas
*Dry beans
*[[Rice]]
*[[Sunflower]]s
}}

If used in combination with [[atrazine]], it increases the persistence of the effect. If used in combination with [[2,4-D]], performance is improved. Sodium chlorate has a [[soil sterilant]] effect. Mixing with other herbicides in aqueous solution is possible to some extent, so long as they are not susceptible to oxidation.

The sale of sodium chlorate as a weedkiller was banned in the European Union in 2009, with existing stocks to be used within the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hortweek.com/sodium-chlorate-banned-ec/fresh-produce/article/841864 |title=Sodium chlorate banned by EC |website=Horticulture Week|date=28 August 2008  |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical oxygen generation===
[[Chemical oxygen generator]]s, such as those in commercial aircraft, provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure.  Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate:&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 NaCl  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Heat required for this reaction is generated by [[Redox|oxidation]] of a small amount of iron powder mixed with the sodium chlorate, and the reaction consumes less oxygen than is produced. [[Barium peroxide]] ([[barium|Ba]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is used to absorb the [[chlorine]] that is a minor product in the decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 
| title = Functions of Barium Peroxide in Sodium Chlorate Chemical Oxygen 
|author1=Yunchang Zhang |author2=Girish Kshirsagar |author3=James C. Cannon  |last-author-amp=yes | volume = 32

| pages = 966–969 
| year = 1993 
| doi = 10.1021/ie00017a028  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An ignitor charge is activated by pulling on the emergency mask. Similarly, the [[SolidOx (welding)|Solidox]] welding system used pellets of sodium chlorate mixed with combustible fibers to generate oxygen.

==Toxicity in humans==
Due to its oxidative nature, sodium chlorate can be very toxic if ingested. The oxidative effect on [[hemoglobin]] leads to [[methaemoglobin]] formation, which is followed by [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of the [[globin]] protein and a [[cross-link]]ing of [[erythrocyte]] membrane proteins with resultant damage to the membrane enzymes. This leads to increased permeability of the membrane, and severe [[hemolysis]]. The denaturation of hemoglobin overwhelms the capacity of the [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase|G6PD]] [[metabolic pathway]]. In addition, this enzyme is directly denatured by chlorate reducing its activity.

Therapy with [[ascorbic acid]] and [[methylene blue]] are frequently used in the treatment of [[methemoglobinemia]]. However, since methylene blue requires the presence of [[NADPH]] that requires normal functioning of G6PD system, it is less effective than in other conditions characterized by hemoglobin oxidation.

Acute severe hemolysis results, with [[organ failure|multi-organ failure]], including [[disseminated intravascular coagulation|DIC]] and [[renal failure]]. In addition there is a direct toxicity to the [[Proximal tubule|proximal renal tubule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = THE PATHOGENESIS OF ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMATIC AND TOXIC INJURY.

== Formulations ==
Sodium chlorate comes in [[dust]], [[spray (liquid drop)|spray]] and [[:wikt:granule|granule]] formulations. There is a risk of fire and explosion in dry mixtures with other substances, especially [[organic compound|organic]] materials, and other [[herbicides]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], powdered [[metal]]s, and strong [[acid]]s. In particular, when mixed with [[sugar]], it has explosive properties. If accidentally mixed with one of these substances it should not be stored in dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beveridge |first= Alexander |title= [[Forensic Investigation of Explosions]] |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-7484-0565-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketed formulations contain a [[fire retardant]], but this has little effect if deliberately ignited. Most commercially available chlorate weedkillers contain approximately 53% sodium chlorate with the balance being a fire depressant such as [[sodium metaborate]] or [[ammonium phosphate]]s.

==Trade names==
Sodium chlorate is the active ingredient in a variety of commercial herbicides. Some trade names for products containing sodium chlorate include Atlacide, Defol, De-Fol-Ate, Drop-Leaf, Fall, Harvest-Aid, Kusatol, Leafex, and Tumbleaf. The compound may be used in combination with other herbicides such as atrazine, 2,4-D, [[bromacil]], [[diuron]], and sodium metaborate.

Sodium chlorate was an extensively used weedkiller within the EU, up until 2009 when it was withdrawn after a decision made under terms of EU Regulations. Its use as a herbicide outside the EU remains unaffected, as does its use in other non-herbicidal applications, such as in the production of chlorine dioxide biocides and for pulp and paper bleaching.

{{For|the information security term|Spillage of Classified Information}}

In [[industrial production]], '''spillage''' is the loss of production output due to production of a series of defective or unacceptable products which must be rejected. Spillage is an often costly event which occurs in manufacturing when a process degradation or failure occurs that is not immediately detected and corrected, and in which defective or reject product therefore continues to be produced for some extended period of time.

Spillage results in costs due to lost production volume, excessive scrap, delayed delivery of product, and wastage of human and capital equipment resources. Minimization of the occurrence and duration of manufacturing spillage requires that [[Feedback|closed-loop]] control and associated process monitoring and metrology functions be integrated into critical steps of the overall manufacturing process. The extent to which [[process control]] is complete and metrology is high resolution so as to be comprehensive determines the extent to which spillages will be prevented.

The term was originally coined by the [[Bakelite Company]], in 1955, for their lightweight composites made of hollow [[phenol formaldehyde resin|phenolic]] microspheres bonded to a matrix of phenolic, [[epoxy]], or [[polyester]].&lt;ref name&gt;From the Oxford English Dictionary citation of Sci. News Let. 2 Apr. 213/3&lt;/ref&gt;

Tailorability is one of the biggest advantages of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bardella|first=L.|author2=Genna F. |title=On the elastic behavior of syntactic foams|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|year=2001|volume=38|issue=2|pages=7235–7260|doi=10.1016/S0020-7683(00)00228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix material can be selected from almost any metal, polymer, or ceramic. Microballoons are available in a variety of sizes and materials, including [[glass microsphere]]s, [[cenosphere]]s, [[carbon]], and polymers. The most widely used and studied foams are glass microspheres (in epoxy or polymers), and cenospheres or ceramics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shubmugasamy|first=V.|title=Compressive Characterization of Single Porous SiC Hollow Particles|journal=JOM|year=2014|volume=66|issue=6|pages=892–897|doi=10.1007/s11837-014-0954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in aluminium). One can change the volume fraction of microballoons or use microballoons of different effective density, the latter depending on the average ratio between the inner and outer radii of the microballoons.

The [[compression (physics)|compressive]] properties of syntactic foams, in most cases, strongly depend on the properties of microballoons. In general, the [[compressive strength]] of the material is proportional to its density.

The matrix material has more influence on the [[tension (physics)|tensile]] properties. [[Tensile strength]] may be highly improved by a chemical surface treatment of the particles, such as [[silanization]], which allows the formation of strong bonds between glass particles and epoxy matrix. Addition of fibrous materials can also increase the tensile strength.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- Dead link; no archive, no alternate source found beyond the other cited source &lt;ref name=RADS&gt;{{cite web|last=Allum|first=Ron|url=http://ronallum.com/products/isofloat/tailor-made}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''''The End of Eden''''' is a 1986 environmental documentary in which the South African filmmaker [[Rick Lomba]] (1950–1994) showed the rapid degradation of Africa’s ecosystems. The introduction of cattle ranching and the beef industry in the southern African landscape is featured prominently within the film as a primary source of devastation to the land.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of Eden (1986)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3453440/|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=videoasi&gt;{{cite web|title=The End Of Eden Part 1|url=http://ytube.videoasi.com/video/jtonoqgnW4g.html|publisher=videoasi.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tripod&gt;{{cite web|last=Parsons|first=Neil|title=BOTSWANA CINEMA &amp; FILM STUDIES|url=http://ubh.tripod.com/cinema/bots-cinema-studies.htm|publisher=tripod.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of Eden - Documentary by Rick Lomba|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J-ODVl9Omg|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is severely critical of the policies of the [[World Bank]] and other international banks in advocating and funding African industrial agricultural and cattle breeding projects in an attempt to boost African economies. It portrays graphically the otherwise forbidden [[pesticides]] used to try to eradicate the [[tsetse fly]], which he describes as the last bastion of defence the [[wilderness]] has against the encroachment of civilisation, and the [[erosion]] and [[overgrazing]] that results. Some of it is filmed from a [[microlight]] aircraft which he used to approach these areas.

Numerous interviews with persons engaged in [[Conservation biology|conservation]], [[big-game hunting]], [[Malnutrition in South Africa|hunger]] relief and agriculture are presented as well as some economically and environmentally sustainable alternatives such as [[wildlife farming]].

The documentary was written and directed by Rick Lomba, produced by Rick Lomba Productions and narrated by American actor Jeff Folger.

It was funded by the [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]] and appeared on television for about three years, after which it inexplicably disappeared from circulation.

'''''There Will Be Blood''''' is a 2007 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]. It stars [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Paul Dano]]. The film was inspired by [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel ''[[Oil!]]'' It tells the story of a silver miner-turned-oilman (Day-Lewis) on a ruthless quest for wealth during [[History of oil in California through 1930|Southern California's oil boom]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]], [[Ciarán Hinds]], and [[Dillon Freasier]]  are also featured in the film.

''[[Fast Food Nation]]'' writer [[Eric Schlosser]] initially acquired the rights for the film from the Sinclair estate before Anderson took over the project. Anderson wrote the script with Day-Lewis in mind for the role of Plainview. [[Principal photography]] began in June 2006 on a ranch in [[Marfa, Texas]],&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; and took three months to complete. [[Radiohead]] guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] composed the score for the film. The film was produced by [[Paul Thomas Anderson|Ghoulardi Film Company]] and distributed by [[Paramount Vantage]] and [[Miramax|Miramax Films]].

''There Will Be Blood'' grossed $76.2 million worldwide against its $25 million budget. The film received significant critical praise, with the performance of Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview receiving widespread acclaim. Other qualities of the film, such as its cinematography, direction, and screenplay, were also lauded and received numerous awards and nominations. It premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director|Silver Bear Award for Best Director]] and a Special Artistic Contribution Award for Greenwood's score. It also appeared on many critics' "top ten" lists for the year, notably the [[American Film Institute Awards 2007|American Film Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards07/default.aspx "AFI Awards 2007"]. ''American Film Institute''. Retrieved November 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Society of Film Critics]], the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films#2000s|National Board of Review]], and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]]. Day-Lewis won [[Academy Award|Oscar]], [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], [[Golden Globe]], [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[NYFCC Award|NYFCC]] and [[IFTA Award|IFTA]] Best Actor awards for his performance, cementing his position as one of the most acclaimed actors of his generation. At the [[80th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] (tying with another Paramount Vantage/Miramax co-production [[No Country for Old Men (film)|''No Country for Old Men'']]), including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Anderson; it won two for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Day-Lewis and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] for [[Robert Elswit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade|title=Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade - Metacritic|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In 1898, Daniel Plainview, a prospector in [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], mines a potentially precious ore [[vein (geology)|vein]] from a pit mine hole. In the process of [[dynamite|dynamiting]] the [[lode]], he falls and breaks his leg. With the silver sample, he climbs out of the mine, drags himself to an assay office, and receives a silver and gold certificate [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, he [[History of oil in California through 1930|discovers oil]] near Los Angeles and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. He refers to the child, H. W., as his business partner, which allows him to present himself to potential investors as a family man.

In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to buy the farm at a bargain price. However, Paul's twin brother, Eli, demands $10,000 for the church, of which he is pastor. An agreement is made for $5,000 after the well begins producing, and Daniel acquires all the available surrounding land, except for one holdout: William Bandy. Oil production begins, but an accident kills a worker and a [[Blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli demands the $5,000 that Daniel still owes, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table, Eli berates his father for trusting Daniel.

A man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Angry, Daniel sends him away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but Daniel strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] and constructs a pipeline to the California coast, though the Bandy ranch remains an impediment.

While reminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious about Henry's story and one night quizzes him about it at gunpoint. "Henry" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry's, who died from [[tuberculosis]], and that he learned the details of Henry's life by reading his personal journal. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of the previous night's events and wants Daniel to repent. At the church, as part of Daniel's [[baptism]], Eli humiliates him, strikes him, and makes him confess to having abandoned his son, before announcing to the congregation that Daniel will be making a large donation to the church. With the pipeline underway, Daniel arranges for the still angry H. W. to return, while Eli leaves town for missionary work.

In 1927, H. W. marries Mary, Eli and Paul's sister. Daniel, now extremely wealthy but suffering from [[alcoholism]], lives as a recluse in a large mansion. Through a [[Language interpretation#Sign language|sign language interpreter]], H. W. asks Daniel to dissolve their partnership so that H. W. can establish his own oil company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts brutally, mocks H. W.'s deafness, and reveals H.W.'s true origins as an orphan. H. W. thanks God he has "none of Daniel in him" and leaves.

Eli visits Daniel, who is drunk, in Daniel's private [[bowling alley]]. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel drilling rights on the land of William Bandy, who has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly does so. Daniel reveals that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by [[slant drilling]] from surrounding wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts him, chases him around the bowling alley, and beats him to death with a bowling pin. When his butler enters the room, he finds Daniel sitting on the floor, muttering "I'm finished!"

[[File:Paul Thomas Anderson &amp; Daniel Day-Lewis-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Thomas Anderson]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] in New York, December 2007.]]
After [[Eric Schlosser]] finished writing ''[[Fast Food Nation]]'', reporters kept asking him about Upton Sinclair. Although he had read Sinclair's ''[[The Jungle]]'', he did not know about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel ''[[Oil!]]'', which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He thought that he would try to find a director who was as passionate about the book as he was, but director Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.&lt;ref name="ES-TNYT-2008"&gt;{{cite news |author=Schlosser, Eric  |date=February 22, 2008 |title='Oil!' and the History of Southern California |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson had been working on a screenplay about two fighting families. He struggled with the script and soon realized it was not working.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite news |author=Stern, Marlow |title='There Will Be Blood' Press Conference |work=Manhattan Movie Magazine |date=December 10, 2007 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homesick, he purchased a copy of ''Oil!'' in [[London, England|London]], drawn to its cover illustration of a California oilfield.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;{{cite news |author=Goodwin, Christopher |title=Daniel Day-Lewis Gives Blood, Sweat and Tears |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=November 25, 2007 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2922563.ece |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he read, Anderson became more fascinated with the novel. After contacting Schlosser, he adapted the first 150 pages to a screenplay. He began to get a real sense of where his script was going after making many trips to museums dedicated to early oilmen in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]].&lt;ref name="Hirschberg"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hirschberg, Lynn |title=The New Frontier's Man |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=December 11, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/magazine/11daylewis-t2.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1197697066-ZGxe5I9RiTtwkgTydXd2Dg&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson changed the title from ''Oil!'' to ''There Will Be Blood'' because he felt "there's not enough of the book to feel like it's a proper adaptation".&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt;

He said of writing the screenplay:
{{quote|I can remember the way that my desk looked, with so many different scraps of paper and books about the oil industry in the early 20th century, mixed in with pieces of other scripts that I'd written. Everything was coming from so many different sources. But the book was a great stepping-stone. It was so cohesive, the way Upton Sinclair wrote about that period, and his experiences around the oil fields and these independent oilmen. That said, the book is so long that it's only the first couple hundred pages that we ended up using, because there is a certain point where he strays really far from what the original story is. We were really unfaithful to the book. That's not to say I didn't really like the book; I loved it. But there were so many other things floating around. And at a certain point, I became aware of the stuff he was basing it on. What he was writing about was the life of [oil barons] [[Edward L. Doheny|Edward Doheny]] and [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry Sinclair]].

Anderson, who had previously stated that he would like to work with Daniel Day-Lewis,&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite news |author=Patterson, John |title='Magnolia' Maniac |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 10, 2000 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features |accessdate=April 12, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the screenplay with Day-Lewis in mind and approached the actor when the script was nearly complete.

Anderson has stated that the famous line in the final scene, "I drink your [[milkshake]]!", was paraphrased from a quote by former Secretary of the Interior and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New Mexico]], [[Albert Fall]], speaking before a Congressional investigation into the 1920s oil-related [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. Anderson said he was fascinated "to see that word [milkshake] among all this official testimony and terminology" to explain the complicated process of oil drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Foundas, Scott |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-01-17/film-tv/blood-sweat-and-tears |title=Paul Thomas Anderson: Blood, Sweat and Tears |newspaper=LA Weekly |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an independent attempt to locate the statement in Fall's testimony proved unsuccessful—an article published in the Case Western Reserve Law Review suggested that the actual source of the paraphrased quote may instead have been remarks in 2003 by Sen. [[Pete Domenici]] of New Mexico during a debate over drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peter M. Gerhart &amp; Robert D.

You don't have to take it up to the bedroom. This describes the actual drilling that is taking place.}}

According to Joanne Sellar, one of the film's producers, it was a hard film to finance because "the studios didn't think it had the scope of a major picture".&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; It took two years to acquire financing for the film.&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; For the role of Plainview's "son", Anderson looked at people in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], but he realized that they needed someone from [[Texas]] who knew how to shoot [[shotgun]]s and "live in that world".&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt; The filmmakers asked around at a school and the principal recommended [[Dillon Freasier]]. They did not have him read any scenes and instead talked to him, realizing that he was the perfect person for the role.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt;

To build his character, Day-Lewis started with the voice. Anderson sent him recordings from the late 19th century to 1927 and a copy of the 1948 film ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', including documentaries on its director, [[John Huston]], an important influence on Anderson's film.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; According to Anderson, he was inspired by the fact that ''Sierra Madre'' is "about greed and ambition and paranoia and looking at the worst parts of yourself".&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; While writing the script, he would put the film on before he went to bed at night. To research for the role, Day-Lewis read letters from laborers and studied photographs from the time period. He also read up on oil tycoon [[Edward Doheny]], upon whom Sinclair's book is loosely based.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lewis, Judith |title=Daniel Day-Lewis: The Way He Lives Now |newspaper=L.A.

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began in June 2006 on a ranch in [[Marfa, Texas]],&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; and took three months.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; Other location shooting took place in Los Angeles. Anderson tried to shoot the script in sequence with most of the sets on the ranch.&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; Two weeks in, Anderson replaced the actor playing Eli Sunday with [[Paul Dano]], who had originally only been cast in the much smaller role of Paul Sunday, the brother who tipped off Plainview about the oil on the Sunday ranch. A profile of Day-Lewis in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' suggested that the original actor, [[Kel O'Neill]], had been intimidated by Day-Lewis's intensity and habit of staying in character on and off the set.&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Both Anderson and Day-Lewis deny this claim,&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; and Day-Lewis stated, "I absolutely don't believe that it was because he was intimidated by me. I happen to believe that—and I hope I'm right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longsdorf |first=Amy |title=In 'Blood,' Day-Lewis unearths an oil tycoon's complexities |newspaper=The Morning Call |date=January 3, 2008 |url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/movies/all-go_movies.6208480jan03,0,5814474.story |accessdate=December 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115004440/http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/movies/all-go_movies.6208480jan03,0,5814474.story |archivedate=January 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson first saw Dano in ''[[The Ballad of Jack and Rose]]'' and thought that he would be perfect to play Paul Sunday, a role he originally envisioned to be a 12- or 13-year-old boy. Dano only had four days to prepare for the much larger role of Eli Sunday,&lt;ref name="National Public Radio Audio Interview, January 8, 2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17926946 |title=National Public Radio Audio Interview |publisher=NPR.org |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he researched the time period that the film is set in as well as [[Evangelism|evangelical]] preachers.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt; The previous two weeks of scenes with Sunday and Plainview had to be re-shot with Dano instead of O'Neill.&lt;ref name="Hirschberg" /&gt; The interior mansion scenes were filmed at the [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], the former real-life home of Edward Doheny Jr., a gift from his father, [[Edward Doheny]]. Scenes filmed at Greystone involved the careful renovation of the basement's two-lane bowling alley.&lt;ref name="LATimesHobart"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hobart |first=Christy |title=At Greystone, there will be 'Blood' -- and bowling |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |pages=F1, F4 |date=December 27, 2007 |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-blood27dec27,1,6977925.story?ctrack=2&amp;cset=true |accessdate=December 31, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119060955/http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-blood27dec27,1,6977925.story?ctrack=2&amp;cset=true &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson said it was "a particular situation, because it was so narrow that there could only be a very limited number of people at any given time, maybe five or six behind the camera and then the two boys."&lt;ref name="Modell" /&gt;

Anderson dedicated the film to [[Robert Altman]], who died while Anderson was editing it.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt;

''There Will Be Blood'' was shot using [[Panavision]] XL [[35 mm]] cameras outfitted primarily with Panavision C series and high-speed [[anamorphic]] lenses.&lt;ref name="DigContentProducer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldman |first=Michael |title=Old-Fashioned Filmmaking |date=November 1, 2007 |url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mil/features/video_oldfashioned_filmmaking/index2.html |accessdate=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Further|There Will Be Blood (album)}}
Anderson had been a fan of [[Radiohead]]'s music and was impressed with [[Jonny Greenwood]]'s scoring of the film ''[[Bodysong]]''. While writing the script for ''There Will Be Blood'', Anderson heard Greenwood's orchestral piece "Popcorn Superhet Receiver", which prompted him to ask Greenwood to work with him. After initially agreeing to score the film, Greenwood had doubts and thought about backing out, but Anderson's reassurance and enthusiasm for the film convinced him to stick with it.&lt;ref name="Willman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Willman |first=Chris |title=There Will Be Music |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20155516_20155530_20158721,00.html |accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ponto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ponto |first=Arya |title=Jonny Greenwood scoring PTA's new film |work=Just Press Play |date=September 7, 2007 |url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/there-will-be-blood/news/radioheads-jonny-greenwood-scoring-ptas-new-film.html |accessdate=December 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235832/http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/there-will-be-blood/news/radioheads-jonny-greenwood-scoring-ptas-new-film.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson gave Greenwood a copy of the film and three weeks later he came back with two hours of music recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.&lt;ref name="Stern" /&gt; Concerning his approach to composing the soundtrack, Greenwood said to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'':

{{quote|I think it was about not necessarily just making period music, which very traditionally you would do. But because they were traditional orchestral sounds, I suppose that's what we hoped was a little unsettling, even though you know all the sounds you're hearing are coming from very old technology.

In December 2008, Greenwood's score was nominated for a Grammy in the category of "Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media" for the [[51st Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#22 |title=51st Grammy Awards Nomination List |year=2008 |work=Grammy.com |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205000233/http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#22 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features classical music. Brahms' ''[[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77, 3rd movement, "Vivace ma non troppo"]]'' can be heard in the ending titles and during the film [[Arvo Pärt]]'s ''[[Fratres]]'' for cello and piano.&lt;ref&gt;Ending titles.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives a score of 91% based on reviews from 216 critics, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The consensus reads, "Widely touted as a masterpiece, this sparse and sprawling epic about the underhanded 'heroes' of capitalism boasts incredible performances by leads Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano, and is director Paul Thomas Anderson's best work to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/there_will_be_blood |title=There Will Be Blood |accessdate=April 19, 2008 |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= Flixster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] wrote, in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', "the film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic."&lt;ref name="Dargis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |title=An American Primitive, Forged in a Crucible of Blood and Oil |work=The New York Times |date=December 26, 2007 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/movies/26bloo.html?ref=movies |accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' also praised Day-Lewis' performance: "what's most fun, albeit in a frightening way, is watching this greedmeister become more and more unhinged as he locks horns with Eli Sunday … both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke.

[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Ebert gave ''There Will Be Blood'' a positive review but in comparing it to ''No Country for Old Men'' he found the McCarthy script for ''No Country'' to be better.]]
Schickel also named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #9, calling Daniel Day-Lewis' performance "astonishing", and calling the film "a mesmerizing meditation on the American spirit in all its maddening ambiguities: mean and noble, angry and secretive, hypocritical and more than a little insane in its aspirations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]]: [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1692274,00.html "The 10 Best Movies"]; Time.com.&lt;/ref&gt; James Christopher, chief film critic for ''[[The Times]]'', published a list in April 2008 of his top 100 films, placing ''There Will Be Blood'' in second place, behind only ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Christopher |title=Top 100 Films |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/related_features/top_100_films |work=The Times |date=April 27, 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, "''There Will Be Blood'' is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', and that is a great film, and a perfect one.

=== Themes and analysis ===
Many have seen the film as a commentary on the nature of capitalism and greed, and its inherent national presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepress.org/article/there-will-be-blood-madness-american-capitalismbut-no-method|title=There Will Be Blood: The madness of American capitalism...but no method|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Plainview's "I have a competition in me" speech has been looked at as key when analyzing the film from this angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warandnoise.com/therewillbeblood/|title=A Critical Analysis of There Will Be Blood: Intensional Godhood - Noisewar Internetlainen|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Denby of the ''New Yorker'' described the film as being about "...the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future..." and goes on to say that "this movie is about the vanishing American frontier.

==== Top ten lists ====
The film was on the [[American Film Institute]]'s 10 Movies of the Year; AFI's jury said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''There Will Be Blood'' is bravura film-making by one of American film's modern masters. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic poem of savagery, optimism and obsession is a true meditation on America.  The film drills down into the dark heart of capitalism, where domination, not gain, is the ultimate goal. In a career defined by transcendent performances, Daniel Day-Lewis creates a character so rich and so towering, that "Daniel Plainview" will haunt the history of film for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards07/movies07.aspx "AFI Movies of the Year Official Selections"].

==== Decade-end lists ====
Review aggregator site [[Metacritic]], when comparing over 40 'top ten of the decade' lists from various notable publications, found ''There Will Be Blood'' to be the most mentioned, appearing on 46% of critics' lists and being ranked the decade's best film on five of them.

In December 2009, Peter Travers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' chose the film as the #1 film of the decade, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two years after first seeing ''There Will Be Blood'', I am convinced that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait of an American primitive—take that, ''Citizen Kane''—deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to "drink the milkshake" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''—his rebel cries from the 1990s—''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: "It was one goddamn hell of a show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film. Phillips stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I think is the performance of the new century—''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/specials/bestofthedecade/index.html |title=Best of the Decade |date=December 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 28, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Lisa Schwarzbaum named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film as well. In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20168259,00.html |title=There Will Be Blood Review |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2009, the website [[Gawker.com]] determined that ''There Will Be Blood'' is film critics' consensus best film of the decade when aggregating all Best of the Decade lists, stating: "And when the votes were all in, by a nose, ''There Will Be Blood'' stood alone at the top of the decade, its straw in the whole damn cinema's milkshake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |title=There Will Be Blood Wins the Decade |work=Gawker |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203203506/http://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |archivedate=February 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The line, "I drink your milkshake!", used by Daniel Plainview to explain his technique has been used in other media repeatedly. For example:
* In season 24 of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', "I Drink Your Milkshake" was the title of a category about milkshakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=2541&amp;highlight=+i+drink+your+milkshake+ |title=Jeopardy! Show #5498 |website=J! Archive |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jon Stewart]], host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and the [[80th Academy Awards]] (for which ''There Will Be Blood'' was nominated for eight Oscars), has referenced the phrase "I drink your milkshake" several times on his show in response to news involving oil drilling, including during interviews with [[Ted Koppel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=174804&amp;title=Ted-Koppel |title=Ted Koppel |date=June 26, 2008 |website=The Daily Show |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=177587&amp;title=Nancy-Pelosi |title=Nancy Pelosi |date=July 28, 2008 |website=The Daily Show |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2008, a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit featured a [[Food Network]] show called ''I Drink Your Milkshake'', in which Daniel Plainview ([[Bill Hader]]) and H.W. ([[Amy Poehler]]) travel from state to state looking for the perfect milkshake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milkshakes |work=NBC |publisher=Hulu.com |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/10232/saturday-night-live-milkshakes |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5cB1Pmcig?url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/10232/saturday-night-live-milkshakes |archivedate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]" (October 15, 2008) parodies the final scene of the film: after [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] beats up [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] approaches and says, "Wendy!", to which she replies, "I'm finished," as Cartman lies face down in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/188250 |title=Wendy vs. Cartman |website=South Park Studios |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThermaSAVE 1.jpg|right|thumb|Orthographic view of ThermaSAVE panel segment abut]]
[[File:ThermaSAVE 3.jpg|right|thumb|Completed ThermaSAVE panel awaits destructive testing.]]

'''ThermaSAVE''' is a panel building system which uses a 4 to 12-inch-thick core of expanded [[polystyrene]] (similar to [[Styrofoam]]) sandwiched between two sheets of cellulose fiber-reinforced [[cement]] board varying in thickness from 3/8 to 7/16&amp;nbsp;inch, depending on structural requirements.  This creates a "stress skinned" panel, also known as [[structural insulated panel]]s (SIPs). Since c. 1984 [[H.H. Haddock|H.H. "Hoot" Haddock]] from [[Florence, Alabama]] has been working on perfecting a polystyrene-based building system that would be faster and easier to construct than wood framed buildings, while having superior insulation and strength.

==Demonstrations==

Haddock has used the panels to construct an {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] showroom and a {{convert|32000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} church, and at trade shows Haddock parks a 3,400-pound pickup truck on a 24-foot-long foam panel ramp which remains straight.

==Advantages==

Because expanded polystyrene is 95% air it is an excellent insulator; and the hard cement skin, bonded to the polystyrene, provides the structural
support. In combination the ThermaSAVE panels provide the best of both
worlds and have numerous advantages over standard building materials.

* Better insulation with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of 21.6 vs. 11 for wood results in significant cooling and heating savings.
* Weight load of a wall per linear foot is 3,750 vs. 3,200 for wood.
* Easy assembly requiring only a third of the time to set up the [[LEGO]]-like panels.
* Resistant to fire, wind, pests, moisture and sound. [http://www.fas.org/main/content.jsp?formAction=297&amp;contentId=383 (Fire test video)]
* Lower overall cost with a {{convert|1456|sqft|m2|adj=on}} in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] costing $55,287 with conventional materials and labor vs. $46,597 with a panel system.

==Disaster reconstruction==
[[File:ThermaSAVE 2.jpg|right|thumb|Hydraulic presses facilitate panels' adhesive cure.]]

After some consultation Haddock participated in an earthquake test conducted in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] on January 28, 2005 which was filmed by [[Daily Planet (television series)|Daily Planet]]. The two-story building withstood accelerations beyond 7[[g-force|''g'']] without losing any screws, whereas the previous record was 4 g. The test continued until the testing machine began to fail, but the building remained intact.

With the success of the tests the ThermaSAVE Building System could be implemented in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and even in areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] by 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15442">'''Tunnel ionization''' is a process in which [[electron]]s in an [[atom]] (or a [[molecule]]) pass through the potential barrier and escape from the atom (or molecule). In an intense [[electric field]], the potential barrier of an atom (molecule) is distorted drastically. Therefore, the length of the barrier that electrons have to pass decreases and electrons can escape from the atom's potential more easily.  Tunneling Ionization is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, since in the classical picture an electron does not have sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier of the atom.

When the atom is in a DC external field, the Coulomb potential barrier is lowered and the electron has an increased, non-zero probability of tunnelling through the potential barrier. In the case of an alternating electric field, the direction of the electric field reverses after the half period of the field. The ionized electron may come back to its parent ion. The electron may recombine with the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (nuclei) and its kinetic energy is released as light ([[high harmonic generation]]).  If the recombination does not occur, further ionization may proceed by collision between high-energy electrons and a parent atom (molecule). This process is known as [[non-sequential ionization]].&lt;ref&gt;Corkum, Paul B. "Plasma perspective on strong field multiphoton ionization."Physical Review Letters 71.13 (1993): 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DC tunneling ionization ==
Tunneling ionization from the ground state of a [[Hydrogen atom]] in an electrostatic (DC) field was solved schematically by [[Lev Landau|Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz, Quantum Mechanics (Pergamon, New York, 1965), 2nd ed., pg 276.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a simplified physical system that given it proper exponential dependence of the ionization rate on the applied external field. When  &lt;math&gt;E &lt;&lt; E_a &lt;/math&gt;, the ionization rate for this system is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; w = 4 \omega_a \frac{E_a}{\left|E\right|} \exp\left[ -\frac{2}{3}\frac{E_a}{\left|E\right|} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Landau expressed this in units where &lt;math&gt;m=e=\hbar=1&lt;/math&gt;. In [[International System of Units|SI units]] the previous parameters can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;E_a = \frac{m^2 e^5}{(4\pi \epsilon_0)^3 \hbar^4}  &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_a = \frac{m e^4}{(4\pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^3}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ionization rate is the total [[probability current]] through the outer classical turning point. This is found using the [[WKB approximation]] to match the ground state hydrogen wavefunction though the suppressed coulomb potential barrier.

== AC electric field ==
The ionization rate of a hydrogen atom in an alternating electric field, like that of a laser, can be treated, in the appropriate limit, as the DC ionization rate averaged over a single period of the electric field's oscillation. Multiphoton and tunnel ionization of an atom or a molecule describe the same process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. The difference between them is  a matter of definition under different conditions. They can henceforth be called MPI (multiphoton ionization) whenever the distinction is not necessary. The dynamics of the MPI can be described by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation.
[[File:Tunnel ionization 3.png|right|thumb|600px|Combined potential of an atom and a uniform laser field. At distances &lt;math&gt;r &lt; r_0&lt;/math&gt;, the potential of the laser can be neglected, while at distances with &lt;math&gt;r &gt; r_0&lt;/math&gt;, the Coulomb potential is negligible compared to the potential of the laser field. The electron emerges from under the barrier at &lt;math&gt;r=R_c&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ionization potential of the atom.]]
When the intensity of the laser is strong, the ''lowest-order perturbation theory'' is not sufficient to describe the MPI process. In this case, the laser field on larger distances from the nucleus is more important than the Coulomb potential and the dynamic of the electron in the field should be properly taken into account. The first work in this category was published by Keldysh.&lt;ref&gt;Keldysh L V 1965 Soviet Phys. JETP 2354&lt;/ref&gt; He modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states (the state of a free electron in the electromagnetic field&lt;ref&gt;Volcov D M 1934 Z. Phys. 94 250&lt;/ref&gt;). In this model, the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As is observed from the figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al.&lt;ref&gt;Perelemov A M, Popov V S and Terent'ev M V 1966 SovietPhys. JETP, 23 924&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perelemov A M and Popov V S 1967 Soviet Phys.JETP, 25 336&lt;/ref&gt; included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which is called the PPT model) was derived for short-range potential and includes the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction through the first-order correction in the quasi-classical action. In the quasi-static limit, the PPT model approaches the ADK model.&lt;ref&gt;Ammosov M V, Delone N B and Krainov V P 1986 SovietPhys. JETP, 64 1191&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments have been carried out on the MPI of rare gas atoms using strong laser pulses, through measuring both the total ion yield and the kinetic energy of the electrons. Here, one only considers the experiments designed to measure the total ion yield. Among these experiments are those by Chin et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Chin S L, Yergeau F and Lavigne P 1985 J. Phys.B 18 L213&lt;/ref&gt; Augst et al.&lt;ref&gt;Augst S, Meyerhofer D D, Strickland D and Chin SL  1991 JOSA B  8 858&lt;/ref&gt; and Auguste et al.&lt;ref&gt;AugusteT, Monot P, Lommpre L A, Mainfray G and Manus C 1992 J. Phys. B 254181&lt;/ref&gt; Chin et al. used a 10.6&amp;nbsp;μm CO2 laser in their experiment. Due to the very small frequency of the laser, the tunneling is strictly quasi-static, a characteristic which is not easily attainable using pulses in the near infrared or visible region of frequencies. These findings weakened the suspicion on the applicability of models basically founded on the assumption of a structureless atom. Larochelle et al.&lt;ref&gt;Larochelle S, Talebpour A and Chin S L 1998 J.Phys. B  31 1201&lt;/ref&gt; have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fits very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of Keldysh parameter.

==Analytical formula for the rate of MPI==
( be careful, there are a lot of typos in the following section )
The dynamics of  the MPI can be described  by finding the time evolution of the state of the atom which is described by the Schrödinger equation. The form of this equation in the electric field gauge, assuming the single active electron (SAE) approximation and using dipole approximation, is the following

:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t)=-\frac{1}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) + (\mathbf{E}(t)\cdot\mathbf{r}+V(\mathbf{r}))\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t)&lt;/math&gt;  
where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the electric field of the laser and &lt;math&gt; V(r) &lt;/math&gt; is the static Coulomb potential of the atomic core at the position of the active electron. By finding the exact solution of equation (1) for a potential &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2E_i}.\delta(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; E_i&lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of the ionization potential of the atom), the probability current &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t) &lt;/math&gt; is calculated. Then, the total MPI rate from short range potential for linear polarization, &lt;math&gt; W(\mathbf{E}, \omega)&lt;/math&gt;, is found from

:&lt;math&gt; W(\mathbf{E}, \omega)=\lim_{x\to\infty}\int_0^\frac{2\pi}{\omega} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)\,dz\,dy\,dt &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the laser, which is assumed to be polarized in the direction of the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; axis. The effect of the ionic potential, which behaves like &lt;math&gt; \frac{Z}{r} &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; is the charge of atomic or ionic core) at a long distance from the nucleus, is calculated through first order correction on the semiclassical action. The result is that the effect of ionic potential is to increase the rate of MPI by a factor of
:&lt;math&gt; I_{PPT}=(2(2E_i)^{\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{n^{*}} &lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; n^{*}=Z/\sqrt{2E_i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; is the peak electric field of laser. Thus, the total rate of MPI from a state with quantum numbers &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; in a laser field for linear polarization is calculated to be
:&lt;math&gt; W_{PPT}=I_{PPT}W(\mathbf{E}, \omega)=|C_{n^{*}l^{*}}|^{2}\sqrt{\frac{6}{\pi}}f_{lm}E_{i}(2(2E_i)^{\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{2n^{*}-|m|-3/2}(1+\gamma^{2})^{|m/2|+3/4}A_{m}(\omega, \gamma)e^{-\frac{2}{3}g(\gamma)(2E_i)^{\frac{3}{2}}/F} &lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt; \gamma= \frac{\omega \sqrt {2E_i}}{F} &lt;/math&gt; is the Keldysh`s adiabaticity parameter and &lt;math&gt; l^{*}=n^{*}-1 &lt;/math&gt; .The coefficients &lt;math&gt; f_{lm} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; g(\gamma) &lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt; C_{n^{*}l^{*}} &lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt; f_{lm}= \frac{(2l+1)(l+|m|){!}}{2^{|m|}|m|{!}(l-|m|){!}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g(\gamma)=\frac{3}{2\gamma} ((1+\frac{1}{2\gamma^{2}})\sinh^{-1}(\gamma)-\frac{\sqrt{1+\gamma^{2}}}{2\gamma})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|C_{n^{*}l^{*}}|^{2}= \frac{2^{2n^{*}}}{n^{*}\Gamma(n^{*}+l^{*}+1)\Gamma(n^{*}-l^{*})}&lt;/math&gt;   
The coefficient &lt;math&gt; A_{m}(\omega, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt;  is given by
:&lt;math&gt; A_{m}(\omega, \gamma)=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3\pi}}\frac{1}{|m|!}\frac{\gamma^{2}}{1+\gamma^{2}}\sum_{n&gt;v}^{\infty}e^{-(n-v)\alpha(\gamma)}w_{m}\left(\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\sqrt{1+\gamma^{2}}}(n-v)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt; w_{m}(x)=e^{-x^{2}}\int_0^x (x^2-y^2)^m e^{y^2}\,dy &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(\gamma)= 2(\sinh^{-1}(\gamma)-\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{1+\gamma^{2}}})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v= \frac{E_i}{\omega}(1+\frac{1}{2\gamma^{2}}) &lt;/math&gt;
The ADK model is the limit of the PPT model when &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; approaches zero (quasi-static limit). In this case, which is known as quasi-static tunnelling (QST), the ionization rate is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W_{ADK}=|C_{n^{*}l^{*}}|^{2}\sqrt{\frac{6}{\pi}}f_{lm}E_{i}(2(2E_i)^{\frac{3}{2}}/F)^{2n^{*}-|m|-3/2}e^{-(2(2E_i)^{\frac{3}{2}}/3F)} &lt;/math&gt;.
In practice, the limit for the QST regime is &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;1/2 &lt;/math&gt;. This is justified by the following consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, S. L. "From multiphoton to tunnel ionization." Advances in Multiphoton Processes and Spectroscopy 16 (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the Figure, the ease or difficulty of tunneling can be expressed as the ratio between the equivalent classical time it takes for the electron to tunnel out the potential barrier while the potential is bent down. This ratio is indeed &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, since the potential is bent down during half a cycle of the field oscillation and the ratio can be expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma =\frac {\tau_T} {\frac{1}{2}\tau_L}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; \tau_T &lt;/math&gt; is the tunneling time (classical time of flight of an electron through a potential barrier, and &lt;math&gt; \tau_L &lt;/math&gt; is the period of laser field oscillation.

==MPI of molecules==
Contrary to the abundance of theoretical and experimental work on the MPI of rare gas atoms, the amount of research on the prediction of the rate of MPI of neutral molecules was scarce until recently. Walsh et al.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh T D G, Decker J E and Chin S L 1993 J. Phys. B 26 L85&lt;/ref&gt; have measured the MPI rate of some diatomic molecules interacting with a 10.6&amp;nbsp;μm CO2 laser. They found that these molecules are tunnel-ionized as if they were structureless atoms with an ionization potential equivalent to that of the molecular ground state. Talebpour et al.&lt;ref&gt;Talebpour A, Larochelle A and Chin S L 1998 J.Phys. B 31 L49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Talebpour, J. Yang, S.L. Chin, Semi-empirical model for the rate of tunnel ionization of N2 and O2 molecule in an intense Ti:sapphire laser pulse, Optics Communications, 1999, 163:29–32&lt;/ref&gt; were able to quantitatively fit the ionization yield of  diatomic molecules interacting with a Ti:sapphire laser pulse. The conclusion of the work was that the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule can be predicted from the PPT model by assuming that the electron tunnels through a barrier given by &lt;math&gt; \frac{Z_{eff}}{r} &lt;/math&gt; instead of  barrier &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r} &lt;/math&gt; which is used in the calculation of the MPI rate of atoms. The importance of this finding is in its practicality; the only parameter needed for predicting the MPI rate of a diatomic molecule is a single parameter, &lt;math&gt; Z_{eff} &lt;/math&gt;. Using the semi-empirical model for the MPI rate of unsaturated hydrocarbons is feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Talebpour A, Larochelle A and Chin S L, Multiphoton ionization of unsaturated hydrocarbons, 1998 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 31 2769&lt;/ref&gt; This simplistic view ignores the ionization dependence on orientation of molecular axis with respect to polarization of the electric field of the laser, which is determined by the symmetries of the molecular orbitals. This dependence can be used to follow molecular dynamics using strong field multiphoton ionization.&lt;ref&gt;A. Jaron-Becker, Molecular Dynamics in Strong Laser Fields, IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, 2012, 18:105-112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunneling time==
The question of how long a tunneling particle spends inside the barrier region has remained unresolved since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is sometimes suggested that the tunneling time is instantaneous because both the Keldysh and the closely related Buttiker-Landauer&lt;ref&gt;Buttiker, M. and R. Landauer, Traversal Time for Tunneling. Physical Review Letters, 1982. 49(23): p. 1739–1742.&lt;/ref&gt; times are imaginary (corresponding to the decay of the wavefunction under the barrier). In a recent publication&lt;ref&gt;Landsman, Alexandra, et al. "Tunneling Time in Ultrafast Science is Real and Probabilistic." arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.2766 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; the main competing theories of tunneling time are compared against experimental measurements using the attoclock in strong laser field ionization of helium atoms. Refined attoclock measurements reveal a real and not instantaneous tunneling delay time over a large intensity regime.  It is found that the experimental results are compatible with the probability distribution of tunneling times constructed using a [[Feynman path integral|Feynman Path Integral]] (FPI) formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Fertig, H.A., Traversal-Time Distribution and the Uncertainty Principle in Quantum Tunneling. Physical Review Letters, 1990. 65(19): p. 2321-2324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamada, N., Unified derivation of tunneling times from decoherence functionals.Physical Review Letters, 2004. 93(17).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wind turbine blades in laydown yard Pasco 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Wind-turbine blades awaiting installation in laydown yard.]]

The primary application of wind turbines is to generate energy using the wind. Hence, the aerodynamics is a very important aspect of wind turbines. Like most machines, there are many different types of wind turbines, all of them based on different energy extraction concepts. 

Though the details of the aerodynamics depend very much on the topology, some fundamental concepts apply to all turbines. Every topology has a maximum power for a given flow, and some topologies are better than others. The method used to extract power has a strong influence on this. In general, all turbines may be grouped as being either [[Lift (force)|lift]]-based, or [[Drag (physics)|drag]]-based; the former being more efficient. The difference between these groups is the aerodynamic force that is used to extract the energy.

The most common topology is the [[horizontal-axis wind turbine]] (HAWT). It is a lift-based wind turbine with very good performance. Accordingly, it is a popular choice for commercial applications and much research has been applied to this turbine. Despite being a popular lift-based alternative in the latter part of the 20th century, the [[Darrieus wind turbine]] is rarely used today. The [[Savonius wind turbine]] is the most common drag type turbine. Despite its low efficiency, it remains in use because of its robustness and simplicity to build and maintain.

==General aerodynamic considerations==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The governing equation for power extraction is stated below:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

: Where: ''P'' is the power, ''F'' is the force vector, and ''v'' is the velocity of the moving wind turbine part.

The force ''F'' is generated by the wind's interaction with the blade. The magnitude and distribution of this force is the primary focus of wind-turbine aerodynamics. The most familiar type of aerodynamic force is drag. The direction of the drag force is parallel to the relative wind. Typically, the wind turbine parts are moving, altering the flow around the part. An example of relative wind is the wind one would feel cycling on a calm day.

To extract power, the turbine part must move in the direction of the net force. In the drag force case, the relative wind speed decreases subsequently, and so does the drag force. The relative wind aspect dramatically limits the maximum power that can be extracted by a drag-based wind turbine. Lift-based wind turbines typically have lifting surfaces moving perpendicular to the flow. Here, the relative wind does not decrease; rather, it increases with rotor speed. Thus, the maximum power limits of these machines are much higher than those of drag-based machines.

==Characteristic parameters ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Wind turbines come in a variety of sizes. Once in operation, a wind turbine experiences a wide range of conditions. This variability complicates the comparison of different types of turbines. To deal with this, [[nondimensionalization]] is applied to various qualities. Nondimensionalization allows one to make comparisons between different turbines, without having to consider the effect of things like size and wind conditions from the comparison. One of the qualities of nondimensionalization is that though geometrically similar turbines will produce the same non-dimensional results, other factors (difference in scale, wind properties) cause them to produce very different dimensional properties. 

The coefficient of power is the most important variable in wind-turbine aerodynamics. The [[Buckingham π theorem]] can be applied to show that the non-dimensional variable for power is given by the equation below. This equation is similar to efficiency, so values between 0 and less than 1 are typical. However, this is not exactly the same as efficiency and thus in practice, some turbines can exhibit greater than unity power coefficients. In these circumstances, one cannot conclude the first law of thermodynamics is violated because this is not an efficiency term by the strict definition of efficiency.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_P=\frac{P}{\frac{1}{2}\rho A V^3}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|CP}}}}

: Where: ''&lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt;'' is the coefficient of power, ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the air density, ''A'' is the area of the wind turbine, and V is the wind speed.

The thrust coefficient is another important dimensionless number in wind turbine aerodynamics.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_T=\frac{T}{\frac{1}{2} \rho A V^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|CT}}}}

Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) shows two important dependents. The first is the speed (U) that the machine is going at. The speed at the tip of the blade is usually used for this purpose, and is written as the product of the blade radius "r" and the rotational speed of the wind ("&lt;math&gt;U=\Omega r&lt;/math&gt;", where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational velocity in radians/second).&lt;sup&gt;[please clarify]&lt;/sup&gt; This variable is nondimensionalized by the wind speed, to obtain the speed ratio:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{U}{V}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|SpeedRatio}}}}

The force vector is not straightforward, as stated earlier there are two types of aerodynamic forces, lift and drag. Accordingly, there are two non-dimensional parameters. However both variables are non-dimensionalized in a similar way. The formula for lift is given below, the formula for drag is given after:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_L=\frac{L}{\frac{1}{2}\rho A W^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|CL}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_D=\frac{D}{\frac{1}{2}\rho A W^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|CD}}}}

: Where: ''&lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt;'' is the lift coefficient, ''&lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt;'' is the drag coefficient, ''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;'' is the relative wind as experienced by the wind turbine blade, and ''A'' is the area. Note that ''A'' may not be the same area used in the power non-dimensionalization of power.

The aerodynamic forces have a dependency on W, this speed is the relative speed and it is given by the equation below. Note that this is vector subtraction.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\vec{W}=\vec{V}-\vec{U}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|RelativeSpeed}}}}

==Drag- versus lift-based machines==

All wind turbines extract energy from the wind through aerodynamic forces. There are two important aerodynamic forces: drag and lift. Drag applies a force on the body in the direction of the relative flow, while lift  applies a force perpendicular to the relative flow. Many machine topologies could be classified by the primary force used to extract the energy. For example, a [[Savonious wind turbine]] is a drag-based machine, while a [[Darrieus wind turbine]] and conventional horizontal axis wind turbines are lift-based machines. Drag-based machines are conceptually simple, yet suffer from poor efficiency. Efficiency in this analysis is based on the power extracted vs. the plan-form area. Considering that the wind is free, but the blade materials are not, a plan-form-based definition of efficiency is more appropriate.

The analysis is focused on comparing the maximum power extraction modes and nothing else. Accordingly, several idealizations are made to simplify the analysis, further considerations are required to apply this analysis to real turbines. For example, in this comparison the effects of axial momentum theory are ignored. Axial momentum theory demonstrates how the wind turbine imparts an influence on the wind which in-turn decelerates the flow and limits the maximum power. For more details see [[Betz's law]]. Since this effect is the same for both lift and drag-based machines it can be ignored for comparison purposes. The topology of the machine can introduce additional losses, for example trailing vorticity in horizontal axis machines degrade the performance at the tip. Typically these losses are minor and can be ignored in this analysis (for example tip loss effects can be reduced with using high aspect-ratio blades).

===Maximum power of a drag-based wind turbine===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}

Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) will be the starting point in this derivation. Equation ({{EquationNote|CD}}) is used to define the force, and equation ({{EquationNote|RelativeSpeed}}) is used for the relative speed. These substitutions give the following formula for power.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{1}{2}\rho A C_D \left(UV^2-2VU^2+U^3\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|DragPower}}}}

The formulas ({{EquationNote|CP}}) and ({{EquationNote|SpeedRatio}}) are applied to express ({{EquationNote|DragPower}}) in nondimensional form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_P=C_D \left(\lambda-2\lambda^2+\lambda^3\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|DragCP}}}}

It can be shown through calculus that equation ({{EquationNote|DragCP}}) achieves a maximum at &lt;math&gt;\lambda=1/3&lt;/math&gt;. By inspection one can see that equation ({{EquationNote|DragPower}}) will achieve larger values for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In these circumstances, the scalar product in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) makes the result negative. Thus, one can conclude that the maximum power is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_P=\frac{4}{27}C_D&lt;/math&gt;

Experimentally it has been determined that a large &lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt; is 1.2, thus the maximum &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; is approximately 0.1778.

===Maximum power of a lift-based wind turbine===

The derivation for the maximum power of a lift-based machine is similar, with some modifications. First we must recognize that drag is always present, and thus cannot be ignored. It will be shown that neglecting drag leads to a final solution of infinite power. This result is clearly invalid, hence we will proceed with drag. As before, equations ({{EquationNote|1}}), ({{EquationNote|CD}}) and ({{EquationNote|RelativeSpeed}}) will be used along with ({{EquationNote|CL}}) to define the power below expression.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{1}{2}\rho A \sqrt{U^2+V^2} \left(  C_L UV - C_D U^2  \right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|LiftPower}}}}

Similarly, this is non-dimensionalized with equations ({{EquationNote|CP}}) and ({{EquationNote|SpeedRatio}}). However, in this derivation the parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma = C_D/C_L&lt;/math&gt; is also used:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_P=C_L \sqrt{1+\lambda^2} \left( \lambda - \gamma \lambda^2  \right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|LiftCP}}}}

Solving the optimal speed ratio is complicated by the dependency on &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and the fact that the optimal speed ratio is a solution to a cubic polynomial. Numerical methods can then be applied to determine this solution and the corresponding &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; solution for a range of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; results. Some sample solutions are given in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

Experiments have shown that it is not unreasonable to achieve a drag ratio (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) of about 0.01 at a lift coefficient of 0.6. This would give a &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; of about 889. This is substantially better than the best drag-based machine, and explains why lift-based machines are superior.

In the analysis given here, there is an inconsistency compared to typical wind turbine non-dimensionalization. As stated in the preceding section, the ''A'' (area) in the &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; non-dimensionalization is not always the same as the ''A'' in the force equations ({{EquationNote|CL}}) and ({{EquationNote|CD}}). Typically for &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; the A is the area swept by the rotor blade in its motion. For &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt; A is the area of the turbine wing section. For drag based machines, these two areas are almost identical so there is little difference. To make the lift based results comparable to the drag results, the area of the wing section was used to non-dimensionalize power. The results here could be interpreted as power per unit of material. Given that the material represents the cost (wind is free), this is a better variable for comparison.

If one were to apply conventional non-dimensionalization, more information on the motion of the blade would be required. However the discussion on Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines will show that the maximum &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; there is 16/27. Thus, even by conventional non-dimensional analysis lift based machines are superior to drag based machines.

There are several idealizations to the analysis. In any lift-based machine (aircraft included) with finite wings, there is a wake that affects the incoming flow and creates induced drag. This phenomenon exists in wind turbines and was neglected in this analysis. Including induced drag requires information specific to the topology, In these cases it is expected that both the optimal speed-ratio and the optimal &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; would be less. The analysis focused on the aerodynamic potential, but neglected structural aspects. In reality most optimal wind-turbine design becomes a compromise between optimal aerodynamic design and optimal structural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Horizontal-axis wind turbine==

The aerodynamics of a [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|horizontal-axis wind turbine]] (HAWT) are not straightforward.  The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow further away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition, the [[aerodynamics]] of a [[wind turbine]] at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields.

== Axial momentum and the Lanchester–Betz–Joukowsky limit ==

[[File:Lee Ranch Wind Speed Frequency.svg|thumb|right|Distribution of wind speed (red) and energy generated (blue). The histogram shows measured data, while the curve is the Rayleigh model distribution for the same average wind speed.]]
[[File:Vykonovafunkce.png|thumb|right|Distribution of wind speed (blue) and energy generated (yellow).]]

Energy in fluid is contained in four different forms: [[gravitational potential energy]], [[Vapor pressure|thermodynamic pressure]], [[kinetic energy]] from the velocity and finally [[thermal energy]]. Gravitational and thermal energy have a negligible effect on the energy extraction process. From a macroscopic point of view, the air flow about the wind turbine is at atmospheric pressure. If pressure is constant then only kinetic energy is extracted. However up close near the rotor itself the air velocity is constant as it passes through the rotor plane. This is because of [[conservation of mass]]. The air that passes through the rotor cannot slow down because it needs to stay out of the way of the air behind it. So at the rotor the energy is extracted by a pressure drop. The air directly behind the wind turbine is at sub-[[atmospheric pressure]]; the air in front is under greater than atmospheric pressure. It is this high pressure in front of the wind turbine that deflects some of the upstream air around the turbine.

[[Frederick W. Lanchester]] was the first to study this phenomenon in application to ship propellers, five years later [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky]] and [[Albert Betz]] independently arrived at the same results.&lt;ref&gt;Gijs A.M. van Kuik ''The Lanchester–Betz–Joukowsky Limit''. Wind Energy (2007), Volume 10, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that each researcher was not aware of the others' work because of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. Thus formally, the proceeding limit should be referred to as the Lanchester–Betz–Joukowsky limit. In general [[Albert Betz]] is credited for this accomplishment because he published his work in a journal that had a wider circulation, while the other two published it in the publication associated with their respective institution, thus it is widely known as simply the Betz Limit.

This is derived by looking at the axial momentum of the air passing through the wind turbine. As stated above some of the air is deflected away from the turbine. This causes the air passing through the rotor plane to have a smaller velocity than the free stream velocity. The ratio of this reduction to that of the air velocity far away from the wind turbine is called the axial induction factor. It is defined as below:

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv \frac{U_1 - U_2}{U_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: where ''a'' is the axial induction factor, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the wind speed far away upstream from the rotor, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the wind speed at the rotor.

The first step to deriving the Betz limit is applying [[Axial momentum|conservation of angular momentum]]. As stated above the wind loses speed after the wind turbine compared to the speed far away from the turbine. This would violate the conservation of momentum if the wind turbine was not applying a thrust force on the flow. This thrust force manifests itself through the pressure drop across the rotor. The front operates at high pressure while the back operates at low pressure. The pressure difference from the front to back causes the thrust force. The momentum lost in the turbine is balanced by the thrust force.

Another equation is needed to relate the pressure difference to the velocity of the flow near the turbine. Here the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]] is used between the field flow and the flow near the wind turbine. There is one limitation to the Bernoulli equation: the equation cannot be applied to fluid passing through the wind turbine. Instead conservation of mass is used to relate the incoming air to the outlet air. Betz used these equations and managed to solve the velocities of the flow in the far wake and near the wind turbine in terms of the far field flow and the axial induction factor. The velocities are given below as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U_2 &amp;= U_1(1 - a)\\
  U_4 &amp;= U_1(1 - 2a)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''U''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is introduced here as the wind velocity in the far wake. This is important because the power extracted from the turbine is defined by the following equation. However the Betz limit is given in terms of the coefficient of power &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficient of power is similar to efficiency but not the same. The formula for the coefficient of power is given beneath the formula for power:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P   &amp;=      0.5\rho AU_2(U_1^2 - U_4^2)\\
  C_p &amp;\equiv \frac{P}{0.5\rho AU_1^3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Betz was able to develop an expression for &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the induction factors. This is done by the velocity relations being substituted into power and power is substituted into the coefficient of power definition. The relationship Betz developed is given below:

:&lt;math&gt;C_p = 4a(1 - a)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The Betz limit is defined by the maximum value that can be given by the above formula. This is found by taking the derivative with respect to the axial induction factor, setting it to zero and solving for the axial induction factor. Betz was able to show that the optimum axial induction factor is one third. The optimum axial induction factor was then used to find the maximum coefficient of power. This maximum coefficient is the Betz limit. Betz was able to show that the maximum coefficient of power of a wind turbine is 16/27. Airflow operating at higher thrust will cause the axial induction factor to rise above the optimum value. Higher thrust cause more air to be deflected away from the turbine. When the axial induction factor falls below the optimum value the wind turbine is not extracting all the energy it can. This reduces pressure around the turbine and allows more air to pass through the turbine, but not enough to account for the lack of energy being extracted.

The derivation of the Betz limit shows a simple analysis of wind turbine aerodynamics. In reality there is a lot more. A more rigorous analysis would include wake rotation, the effect of variable geometry. The effect of airfoils on the flow is a major component of wind turbine aerodynamics. Within airfoils alone, the wind turbine aerodynamicist has to consider the effect of surface roughness, dynamic stall tip losses, solidity, among other problems.

== Angular momentum and wake rotation ==

The wind turbine described by Betz does not actually exist. It is merely an idealized wind turbine described as an actuator disk. It's a disk in space where fluid energy is simply extracted from the air. In the Betz turbine the energy extraction manifests itself through thrust. The equivalent turbine described by Betz would be a horizontal propeller type operating with infinite blades at infinite [[tip speed ratio]]s and no losses. The tip speed ratio is ratio of the speed of the tip relative to the free stream flow. This turbine is not too far from actual wind turbines. Actual turbines are rotating blades. They typically operate at high tip speed ratios. At high tip speed ratios three blades are sufficient to interact with all the air passing through the rotor plane. Actual turbines still produce considerable thrust forces. 
&lt;!-- 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\equiv\frac{R\Omega}{U_1}&lt;/math&gt;   "Please give definitions to these symbols"
 --&gt;

One key difference between actual turbines and the actuator disk, is that the energy is extracted through torque. The wind imparts a torque on the wind turbine, thrust is a necessary by-product of torque. Newtonian physics dictates that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the wind imparts a torque on the blades then the blades must be imparting a torque on the wind. This torque would then cause the flow to rotate. Thus the flow in the wake has two components, axial and tangential. This tangential flow is referred to as wake rotation.

Torque is necessary for energy extraction. However wake rotation is considered a loss. Accelerating the flow in the tangential direction increases the absolute velocity. This in turn increases the amount of kinetic energy in the near wake. This rotational energy is not dissipated in any form that would allow for a greater pressure drop (Energy extraction). Thus any rotational energy in the wake is energy that is lost and unavailable.

This loss is minimized by allowing the rotor to rotate very quickly. To the observer it may seem like the rotor is not moving fast; however, it is common for the tips to be moving through the air at 6 times the speed of the free stream. Newtonian mechanics defines power as torque multiplied by the rotational speed. The same amount of power can be extracted by allowing the rotor to rotate faster and produce less torque. Less torque means that there is less wake rotation. Less wake rotation means there is more energy available to extract. &lt;!-- Add the mathematics of wake rotation --&gt;

== Blade element and momentum theory ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}

{{main|Blade element momentum theory}}

The simplest model for [[horizontal axis wind turbine]] (HAWT) aerodynamics is [[blade element momentum theory|blade element momentum]] (BEM) theory. The theory is based on the assumption that the flow at a given annulus does not affect the flow at adjacent annuli. This allows the rotor blade to be analyzed in sections, where the resulting forces are summed over all sections to get the overall forces of the rotor. The theory uses both axial and angular momentum balances to determine the flow and the resulting forces at the blade.

The momentum equations for the far field flow dictate that the thrust and torque will induce a secondary flow in the approaching wind. This in turn affects the flow geometry at the blade. The blade itself is the source of these thrust and torque forces. The force response of the blades is governed by the geometry of the flow, or better known as the angle of attack. Refer to the [[Airfoil]] article for more information on how airfoils create lift and drag forces at various angles of attack. This interplay between the far field momentum balances and the local blade forces requires one to solve the momentum equations and the airfoil equations simultaneously. Typically computers and numerical methods are employed to solve these models.

There is a lot of variation between different versions of BEM theory. First, one can consider the effect of wake rotation or not. Second, one can go further and consider the pressure drop induced in wake rotation. Third, the tangential induction factors can be solved with a momentum equation, an energy balance or orthogonal geometric constraint; the latter a result of [[Biot–Savart law]] in vortex methods. These all lead to different set of equations that need to be solved. The simplest and most widely used equations are those that consider wake rotation with the momentum equation but ignore the pressure drop from wake rotation. Those equations are given below. a is the axial component of the induced flow, a' is the tangential component of the induced flow. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the solidity of the rotor, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the local inflow angle. &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficient of normal force and the coefficient of tangential force respectively. Both these coefficients are defined with the resulting lift and drag coefficients of the airfoil:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a &amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{4}{C_n\sigma}\sin^2\phi + 1}\\
  a'&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{4}{C_t\sigma}\sin\phi \cos\phi - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Corrections to blade element momentum theory ===

Blade element momentum (BEM) theory alone fails to represent accurately the true physics of real wind turbines. Two major shortcomings are the effects of a discrete number of blades and far field effects when the turbine is heavily loaded. Secondary shortcomings originate from having to deal with transient effects like dynamic stall, rotational effects like the [[Coriolis force]] and centrifugal pumping, and geometric effects that arise from coned and yawed rotors. The current state of the art in BEM uses corrections to deal with these major shortcomings. These corrections are discussed below. There is as yet no accepted treatment for the secondary shortcomings. These areas remain a highly active area of research in wind turbine aerodynamics.

The effect of the discrete number of blades is dealt with by applying the Prandtl tip loss factor. The most common form of this factor is given below where B is the number of blades, R is the outer radius and r is the local radius. The definition of F is based on actuator disk models and not directly applicable to BEM. However the most common application multiplies induced velocity term by F in the momentum equations. As in the momentum equation there are many variations for applying F, some argue that the mass flow should be corrected in either the axial equation, or both axial and tangential equations. Others have suggested a second tip loss term to account for the reduced blade forces at the tip. Shown below are the above momentum equations with the most common application of ''F'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F  &amp;= \frac{2}{\pi}\arccos\left[e^{-\frac{B (R - r)}{2r\sin\phi}}\right]\\
  a  &amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{4}{C_n\sigma}F\sin^2\phi + 1}\\
  a' &amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{4}{C_t\sigma}F\sin\phi\cos\phi - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The typical momentum theory applied in BEM is only effective for axial induction factors up to 0.4 ([[thrust coefficient]] of 0.96). Beyond this point the wake collapses and turbulent mixing occurs. This state is highly transient and largely unpredictable by theoretical means. Accordingly, several empirical relations have been developed. As the usual case there are several version, however a simple one that is commonly used is a linear curve fit given below, with &lt;math&gt;a_c=0.2&lt;/math&gt;. The turbulent wake function given excludes the tip loss function, however the tip loss is applied simply by multiplying the resulting axial induction by the tip loss function.

:&lt;math&gt;C_T = 4\left[a_c^2 + (1 - 2a_c)a\right]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;a &gt; a_c&lt;/math&gt;

The terms &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; represent different quantities. The first one is the thrust coefficient of the rotor, which is the one which should be corrected for high rotor loading (i.e., for high values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;), while the second one (&lt;math&gt;c_t&lt;/math&gt;) is the tangential aerodynamic coefficient of an individual blade element, which is given by the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients. {{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}

== Aerodynamic modeling ==

BEM is widely used due to its simplicity and overall accuracy, but its originating assumptions limit its use when the rotor disk is yawed, or when other non-axisymmetric effects (like the rotor wake) influence the flow.&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. ''Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics, 2nd ed.''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; Limited success at improving predictive accuracy has been made using [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamics (CFD)]] solvers based on [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes]] (RANS) and other similar three-dimensional models such as free vortex methods. These are very computationally intensive simulations to perform for several reasons. First, the solver must accurately model the far-field flow conditions, which can extend several rotor diameters up- and down-stream and include [[atmospheric boundary layer]] turbulence, while at the same time resolving the small-scale [[Boundary layer|boundary-layer]] flow conditions at the blades' surface (necessary to capture blade stall). In addition, many CFD solvers have difficulty meshing parts that move and deform, such as the rotor blades. Finally, there are many dynamic flow phenomena that are not easily modelled by RANS, such as dynamic stall and tower shadow. Due to the computational complexity, it is not currently practical to use these advanced methods for wind turbine design, though research continues in these and other areas related to helicopter and wind turbine aerodynamics.

Free vortex models (FVM) and Lagrangian particle vortex methods (LPVM)&lt;ref&gt;Cottet, G-H. and Koumoutsakos, P. ''Vortex Methods''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; are both active areas of research that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting for more of the three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to lifting line theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges.&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. ''Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics, 2nd ed.''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt; LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake.&lt;ref&gt;Cottet, G-H. and Koumoutsakos, P. ''Vortex Methods''. Cambridge University Press, 2000. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biot–Savart]] summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.&lt;!--

The '''yaw system''' of  [[wind turbines]] is the component responsible for the orientation of the wind turbine [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] towards the [[wind]].

==History==
{{See also|Windmill}}
The task of orienting the rotor into the wind was a complicated issue already for historical [[windmills]]. The first [[windmills]] able to rotate in order to "face" the [[wind]] appeared in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=gasch&gt;Wind Power Plants, R. Gasch and J. Twele, Solarpraxis, {{ISBN|3-934595-23-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rotatable [[nacelle]]s were mounted on the main structure of the [[windmill]] using primitive wooden [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearings]] lubricated with [[animal fat]]. The necessary yawing torque was created by means of [[Working animal|animal power]], [[human power]] or even [[wind power]] (implementation of an auxiliary rotor known as fantail).

[[VAWT|Vertical axis wind turbines]] ([[VAWT]]) do not need a yaw system since their vertical rotors can face the wind from any direction and only their self rotation gives the blades a clear direction of the air flow.&lt;ref name=gasch/&gt; [[Wind turbine|Horizontal axis wind turbines]] however need to orient their [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]]s into and out of the [[wind]] and they achieve that by means of passive or active yaw 
systems.

[[Wind turbine|Horizontal axis wind turbines]] employ some sort of yaw system which can be passive or active. Both passive and active systems have advantages and disadvantages and various design solutions (both active and passive) are being tried in order to find the optimal design for each wind turbine depending on its size, cost and purpose of operation.

==Types==
[[Image:wind.turbine.yaw.system.configurations.svg|thumb|right|400px|a) Upwind [[wind turbine]] equipped with an active yaw system, b) Upwind [[wind turbine]] equipped with a passive yaw system, c) Downwind [[wind turbine]] equipped 
with a passive yaw system.]]

=== Active yaw systems ===
The active yaw systems are equipped with some sort of torque producing device able to rotate the nacelle of the wind turbine against the stationary tower based on automatic signals from wind direction sensors or manual actuation (control system override). The active yaw systems are considered to be the state of the art for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. [[Vergnet]]). The various components of the modern active yaw systems vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active yaw systems include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower ([[yaw bearing]]), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. [[yaw drive]]), a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (yaw brake) and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. [[Weather vane|wind vanes]]) and gives the proper 
commands to the actuating mechanisms.

The most common types of active yaw systems are:  
* Roller [[yaw bearing]] - Electric [[yaw drive]] - Brake: The nacelle is mounted on a [[roller bearing]] and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful [[Electric motor|electric drives]]. A hydraulic or electric [[brake]] fixes the position of the [[nacelle]] when the re-orientation is completed in order to avoid [[wear]] and high [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue loads]] on wind turbine components due to [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]]. Systems of this kind are used by most of the wind turbine manufacturers and are considered to be reliable and effective but also quite bulky and expensive.
* Roller [[yaw bearing]] - Hydraulic [[yaw drive]]: The nacelle is mounted on a [[roller bearing]] and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful [[hydraulic motor]]s or [[Ratchet (device)|ratcheting]] [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. The benefit of the yaw system with [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic drives]] has to do with the inherent benefits of the hydraulic systems such as the high [[power-to-weight ratio]] and high [[Reliability engineering|reliability]]. On the downside however the hydraulic systems are always troubled by leakages of [[hydraulic fluid]] and clogging of their high pressure [[valve|hydraulic valves]]. The hydraulic yaw systems often (depending on the system design) also allow for the elimination of the yaw brake mechanism and their replacement with [[Gate valve|cut-off valves]].
* [[Yaw bearing|Gliding yaw bearing]] - Electric [[yaw drive]]: The nacelle is mounted on a friction based [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful [[Electric motor|electric drives]]. The need for a yaw brake is eliminated and depending on the size of the yaw system (i.e. size of the [[wind turbine]]) the [[yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] concept can lead to significant cost savings.
* [[Yaw bearing|Gliding yaw bearing]] - Hydraulic [[yaw drive]]: The nacelle is mounted on a friction based [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful [[hydraulic motor]]s or [[Ratchet (device)|ratcheting]] [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. This system combines the characteristics of the aforementioned [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] and [[hydraulic motor]] systems.

=== Passive yaw systems ===
The passive yaw systems utilize the wind force in order to adjust the orientation of the [[wind turbine]] rotor into the wind. In their simplest form these system comprise a simple [[roller bearing]] connection between the tower and the nacelle and a tail fin mounted on the nacelle and designed in such a way that it turns the [[wind turbine]] rotor into the wind by exerting a "corrective" torque to the nacelle. Therefore, the power of the wind is responsible for the rotor rotation and the nacelle orientation. Alternatively in case of [[Windward and leeward|downwind]] turbines the tail fin is not necessary since the rotor itself is able to [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] the nacelle into the wind. In the event of skew winds the "wind pressure" on the swept area causes a yawing [[Moment (physics)|moment]] around the tower axis (z-axis) which orients the rotor.&lt;ref name=gasch/&gt;

The tail fin (or wind vane) is commonly used for small wind turbines since it offers a low cost and reliable solution. It is however unable to cope with the high moments required to yaw the nacelle of a large wind turbine. The self-orientation of the [[Windward and leeward|downwind]] turbine rotors however is a concept able to function even for larger wind turbines. The French wind turbine manufacturer [[Vergnet]] has several medium and large self-orienting [[Windward and leeward|downwind]] [[wind turbines]] in production.

Passive yaw systems have to be designed in a way that the nacelle does not follow the sudden changes in [[wind direction]] with too fast a yaw movement, in order to avoid high [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] loads. Additionally the passive yaw systems with low yaw-[[friction]] are subjected to strong dynamic loads due to the periodic low [[amplitude]] yawing caused by the variation of the [[Moment of inertia|inertia moment]] during the rotor rotation. This effect becomes more severe with the reduction of the number of blades.

The most common passive yaw systems are: 
* Roller Bearing (free system): The [[nacelle]] is mounted on a [[roller bearing]] and it is free to rotate towards any direction. The necessary [[Moment (physics)|moment]] comes from a tail fin or the rotor ([[Windward and leeward|downwind]] [[wind turbines]])
* Roller Bearing - Brake (Semi-active system): The [[nacelle]] is mounted on a [[roller bearing]] and it is free to rotate towards any direction, but when the necessary orientation is achieved an active yaw brake arrests the [[nacelle]]. This prevents the uncontrolled [[vibration]] and reduced [[gyroscopic]] and [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue loads]]. 
* Gliding Bearing/Brake (Passive system): The [[nacelle]] is mounted on a [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] and it is free to rotate towards any direction. The inherent [[friction]] of the [[Yaw bearing|gliding bearing]] achieves a quasi-active way of operation.

== Components ==
[[Image:wind.turbine.yaw.system.overview.svg|thumb|right|400px|The main components of a typical yaw system found on most modern medium or large [[wind turbines]].]]

=== Yaw bearing ===
{{See also|Yaw bearing}}

One of the main components of the yaw system is the [[yaw bearing]]. It can be of the roller or gliding type and it serves as a rotatable connection between the tower and the [[nacelle]] of the [[wind turbine]]. The [[yaw bearing]] should be able to handle very high loads, which apart from the weight of the [[nacelle]] and rotor (the weight of which is in the range of several tenths of [[ton]]s) include also the [[bending moment]]s caused by the rotor during the extraction of the [[kinetic energy]] of the wind.

=== Yaw drives ===
{{See also|Yaw drive}}

The [[yaw drive]]s exist only on the active yaw systems and are the means of active rotation of the [[wind turbine]] [[nacelle]]. Each [[yaw drive]] consists of powerful [[electric motor]] (usually [[Alternating current|AC]]) with its electric drive and a large [[gearbox]], which increases the [[torque]]. The maximum static [[torque]] of the biggest [[yaw drive]]s is in the range of 200.000Nm with gearbox [[Gear ratio|reduction ratios]] in the range of 2000:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonfiglioli.com/700t2pres_uk.html Bonfiglioli Power &amp; Control Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the yawing of the large [[Wind Turbine|modern turbines]] is relatively slow with a 360° turn lasting several minutes.

=== Yaw brake ===

In order to stabilize the [[yaw bearing]] against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the [[yaw drive]]s in order to eliminate the [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] between [[Yaw drive|gear-rim]] and [[yaw drive]] [[pinions]] and to prevent the [[nacelle]] from [[oscillating]] due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces the [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of the electric [[yaw drive]]s, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated [[disk brake]].

The [[disk brake]] requires a flat circular [[Disc brake|brake disk]] and plurality of brake [[calipers]] with hydraulic [[piston]]s and [[brake pads]] [http://svendborg-brakes.dk/uk/products/brakes/active_brakes.html]. The hydraulic yaw brakes are able to fix the [[nacelle]] in position thus relieving the [[yaw drive]]s from that task. The cost however of the yaw brake in combination with the requirement of a hydraulic installation ([[pump]], [[valves]], [[piston]]s) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to [[lubricant]] [[contamination]] is often an issue.

A compromise that offers several advantages is the use of electric yaw brakes. These replace the hydraulic mechanism of the conventional brakes and with electro-mechanically actuated brake calipers. The use of electric yaw brakes eliminates the complexity of the hydraulic leakages and the subsequent problems that these cause to the yaw brake operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanning-kahl.en/index.php?id=azimut_bremsen [[Hanning &amp; Kahl GmbH]] Azimutbremsen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several wind turbine design and manufacturing companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods in order to eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and to reduce the cost of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system ({{convert|6|-|10|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system.

=== Yaw vane (passive systems)===

The yaw vane (or tail fin) is a component of the yaw system used only on small wind turbines with passive yaw mechanisms. It is nothing more than a flat surface mounted on the [[nacelle]] by means of a long [[Beam (structure)|beam]]. The combination of the large [[surface area]] of the fin and the increased [[length]] of the beam create a considerable [[torque]] which is able to rotate the [[nacelle]] despite the stabilizing [[gyroscopic]] effects of the rotor. The required [[surface area]] however for a tail fin to be able to [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a large [[wind turbine]] is enormous thus rendering the use of such a device un-economical.
