      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5423">In the [[construction industry]], the '''1:5:200 rule''' (or '''1:5:200 ratio''') is a [[rule of thumb]] that states that: {{quote|If the initial construction costs of a building is 1, then its maintenance and operating costs over the years is 5, and the business operating costs (salary of people working in that building) is 200.}}

==Rule==
The rule originated in a [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] paper by Evans ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, R., Haryott, R., Haste, N. and Jones, A. (1998) ''The Long Term Costs of Owning and Using Buildings'', London, Royal Academy of Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Designing Better Buildings: Quality and Value in the Built Environment|editor=Sebastian Macmillan|chapter=The long-term costs of owning and using buildings| first1 = Raymond | last1 = Evans | first2 = Richard | last2 = Haryott | first3 = Norman | last3 = Haste | first4 = Alan | last4 = Jones|pages=42–50|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the ratios are given as 1:10:200. The figures are [[mean|average]]s and broad generalizations, since construction costs will vary with land costs, building type, and location, and staffing costs will vary with business sector and local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing the Building Design Process|first = Gavin | last = Tunstall|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-6791-5|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intelligent Buildings: Design, Management And Operation|first = Derek | last = Clements-Croome|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-3266-8|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAE paper started a number of arguments about the basis for the figures: whether they were credible: whether they should be discounted; what is included in each category. These arguments overshadow the principal message of the paper that concentration on first capital cost is not optimising use value: support to the occupier and containment of operating-cost. Study by the [[Constructing Excellence]] Be Valuable Task Group, chaired by [[Richard Saxon]], came to the view that there is merit in knowing more about key cost ratios as benchmarks and that we can expect wide variation between building types and even individual examples of the same type.&lt;ref&gt;Saxon, Richard (2005) ''Be Valuable: A guide to creating value in the built environment'', London, [[Constructing Excellence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes ''et al'', of the [[University of Reading]] School of Construction Management and Engineering, observed that the "Evans ratio" is merely a passing remark in the paper's introduction (talking of "commercial office buildings" and stating that "similar ratios might well apply in other types of building") forming part of a pitch that the proportion of a company's expenditure on a building that is spent directly on the building itself (rather than upon staffing it) is around 3%, and that no data are given to support the ratio and no defence of it is given in the remainder of the paper. In attempting to determine this ratio afresh, from published data on real buildings, they found it impossible to reproduce the 1:5:200 ratio, in part because the data and methodology employed by Evans et al. were not published and in part because the definitions employed in the original paper could not be applied.  The ratios that they determined were different by an [[order of magnitude]] from the 1:5:200 ratio, being approximately 1:0.4:12.  They observed that "everyone else who deals with real numbers" pitches the percentage somewhere between 10% and 30%, and that their data support 12%.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=W.P.|last2=Ancell |first2= D|last3=Gruneberg |first3=S |authorlink3= |last4= Hirst |first4=L|year=2004 |title= Exposing the myth of the 1:5:200 ratio relating initial cost, maintenance and staffing costs of office buildings |url= http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/12142 |journal= Proceedings of the 20th Annual ARCOM Conference|publisher= Heriot-Watt University|volume= |issue= |pages=373–381 |doi= |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They note (as does Clements-Croome) that the three costs for every individual building are affected by a plethora of factors, yielding a wide variation in ratios. They suggest that "[p]erhaps the original 1:5:200 ratio was simply meant to be a statement to focus clients' attention" on the importance of considering the higher staffing costs of a building relative to its operating and construction costs, and to encourage people to not be too concerned with higher initial build costs to improve build quality and reduce later lifetime costs. They state that if this is so "then subsequent users of the ratio have misused it", and that the frequency of use of the ratio is not problematic, but that the authority and gravitas that are assigned to it is. They conclude that "perhaps the most worrying feature of this whole discussion is how this passing introductory remark in the paper by Evans ''et al'' has gained the status of a finding from research carried out by the Royal Academy of Engineering, which it most certainly is not!".&lt;ref name=Hughes /&gt;

==Plot==
Wealthy and influential businessman Mr. Malhotra ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) has built a factory on the shore of a lake into which pollutants and toxic waste are released. He wants to build a bridge across it for faster transportation but cannot do so due to a sacred tree present on the other side of the lake on a piece of land which belongs to Mrs. Dhillon ([[Amrita Singh]]), a religious but irrepressible Punjabi woman living with her two sons Aman Dhillon ([[Tiger Shroff]]) and Rohit Dhillon ([[Gaurav Pandey]]). Aman is a martial arts teacher in a school, and has a crush on Kirti ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), a fellow teacher.

After Malhotra fails to intimidate the Dhillon family into selling their land, he brings in Raka ([[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]]), a mercenary, to get the job done. Raka arrives at the tree with a chainsaw but Aman is present there and tries to stop him. Raka beats Aman badly but moments before he tries to decapitate him with the saw a lightning bolt hits the tree. The impact flings Raka away and he lands amongst barrels of toxic waste outside Malhotra's factory.

The next morning, Aman finds himself in his bed alive with no sign of any injury and presumes all that happened to be a dream. He also does not notice a [[Khanda (Sikh symbol)|khanda]] that has appeared on his back, the same symbol which was carved on the tree and had been imprinted on him during the attack. Later that day, he and his brother notice a few unusual things happening to him, such as increased agility and the ability to absorb information by touching objects. After escaping an ambush using super speed, Rohit and his mother confirm that Aman has somehow gained super powers. She immediately declares him a superhero.

After making him a costume and showing him several superhero films for inspiration, Aman's mother tells him the story of his father Sardar Kartar Singh Dhillon, a Sikh who went to [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] to learn martial arts and was named "Flying Jatt". She asks Aman to take up the legacy of his father and keep Flying Jatt as his superhero name to which he agrees. Although his superhero exploits get off to a rocky start, Flying Jatt is soon recognised when he saves hostages from a terrorist attack at an airport. As he gains even more success being a hero, Aman proposes to Kirti and reveals his secret identity to her.

Raka is found alive but is now stronger and more dangerous than before after being exposed to the pollutants at the factory, which further exposure continues to make him even more powerful. Aman goes on to battle him several times, beating Raka each time before finally becoming gravely injured in a brutal fight. To save him from further pain, his brother Rohit goes in his place as Flying Jatt and gets killed. Not wanting to lose her remaining son, Mrs. Dhillon decides to leave. However, Aman decides to stay, saying that the cries and sounds of pain of the people would never leave him. Aman then prepares to fight Raka one last time.

However, believing Flying Jatt to be dead, the people decide to take on Raka on their own, with even Malhotra joining them after his daughter is affected by the increasing pollution. Raka returns to kill them once and for all, but Flying Jatt suddenly appears. Raka, in a fit of rage, drags Flying Jatt to the sacred tree and tries to kill him when his mother reappears before them and prays, giving more inspiration to Aman who gets up and takes Raka to an [[asteroid]] near Earth. Raka becomes vulnerable on the pollution-free asteroid, and after a long fight, Aman finally inserts his [[Kara (Sikhism)|kara]] (steel bracelet) into Raka, causing him to explode.

==Reception==
A Flying Jatt received mixed reviews. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''A Flying Jatt'' has an approval rating of 50% on the basis of 6 reviews with an average rating of 4.8 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_flying_jatt/ |title=A Flying Jatt |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Srijana Mitra Das from [[The Times of India]] gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, "Tiger does a neat job as Aman, shivering superhero who fights crime but also buys 'do kilo lauki' on the way home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/a-flying-jatt/movie-review/53826314.cms|title=A Flying Jatt Movie Review|work=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Firstpost]] said "The film's comedy, occasional inventiveness and aura of innocence are what make it effective in its own way, despite the lack of depth. D'souza had displayed his natural wit even in his first film F.A.L.T.U. in 2011. A Flying Jatt could have been so much better than what it is, if he had not kept one eye fixed Westward for inspiration. This one is perhaps best suited to the very very young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstpost.com/bollywood/a-flying-jatt-review-tiger-shroff-is-a-sikh-superhero-in-this-tacky-yet-funny-film-2976430.html|title=A Flying Jatt review: Tiger Shroff is a Sikh superhero in this tacky yet funny film|date=25 August 2016|work=firstpost.com|accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarita Tanwar from [[Daily News and Analysis]] gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said "You'll need superhero levels of patience to watch this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/review-a-flying-jatt-review-you-ll-need-superhero-levels-of-patience-to-watch-this-2248693|title='A Flying Jatt' review: You'll need superhero levels of patience to watch this|date=25 August 2016|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anupama Chopra]] from the [[Hindustan Times]] gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and said "The first half of A Flying Jatt has moments of fun — I loved that despite being a superhero he has a fear of heights, so he flies very close to the ground. But post-interval, laughter takes a back seat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/flying-jatt-review-by-anupama-chopra-a-turbulent-ride/story-Dm185WL10hWGmxEj1y6Q7H.html|title=A Flying Jatt review by Anupama Chopra: A turbulent ride|date=26 August 2016|work=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HuffPost]] critic Suprateek Chatterjee asked the question, "Why does this even exist?" and stated, "Remo D'Souza's superhero flick is a symbol of Bollywood's laziness and creative bankruptcy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/08/25/a-flying-jatt-review-why-does-this-even-exist_a_21458703/|title='A Flying Jatt' Review: Why Does This Even Exist?|date=25 August 2016|work=huffingtonpost.in|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Malay sentiment''' refers to hostility or hatred that is directed toward [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] or the state of Malaysia. 

== Incidents by country ==
=== Thailand ===
{{main|Thaification}}
Southern Thailand and particularly the province of [[Pattani]] is the home of the ethnic Malays in Thailand. In the 18th century after the Thais captured the Malay-dominated provinces in the south, the Thai consciously avoided referring to the people as Malays and instead preferring the term Thai Muslim.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Page 42. Jory, Patrick. ''From "Patani Melayu" to Thai Muslims. ISIM Review. Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of integration, Malay identity was discouraged by the Thai state.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Due to such policy, there is a diminishing [[Malay language|Malay]] proficiency among young Malays.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Page 43. Jory, Patrick. ''From "Patani Melayu" to Thai Muslims. ISIM Review. Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to prejudice against Muslims in general instead of specifically against the Malays.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

At present, there are [[Pattani separatism|Malay separatists]] in southern Thailand demanding that the Malay-Muslim dominated provinces are granted independence. This has led to killings done by Muslim terrorists. Indiscriminate arrest of Malays has fuelled distrust and resentment against the Thai authority among the locals.&lt;ref&gt;''South arrests need justifying''. [[Bangkok Post]]. 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin had declared a militant law in southern Thailand. Former Prime Minister Thaksin has been blamed for action that lead to an [[Tak Bai Incident|incident at Tak Bai]] that led to the death of a number of Malays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2125/pdf/i9.pdf Thai Premier Blamed For Muslim Massacre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926003749/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2125/pdf/i9.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/nov2004/thai-n02.shtml|title=Outrage over murder of Thai Muslim demonstrators - World Socialist Web Site|author=James Cogan|date=2 November 2004|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ahrc-in-news/mainfile.php/2004ahrcinnews/207/|title=Asian Human Rights Commission|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
[[Singapore]] was once a thriving Malay fishing village prior to British colonisation.  According to the [[Malay Annals]], a Sumatran prince called [[Sang Nila Utama]] was known to have founded ancient Singapore in 1299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econtent.elibraryhub.com/SHC/NLBHB/SS/SingaporeStory/Spore_River.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703083041/http://econtent.elibraryhub.com/SHC/NLBHB/SS/SingaporeStory/Spore_River.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the modern city of Singapore stemmed from 1819 when established by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]]. Under the British administration, Singapore experienced an influx of immigrants particularly from [[China]] and [[India]]. Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, along with the present Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. Since Singapore's separation from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, it became a sovereign, multi-racial republic of which the Chinese community formed the majority.

In the 1970s, Mandarin was promoted over other Chinese dialects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Barr, M. Michael. ''[http://www.feer.com/articles1/2006/0610/free/p018.html The Charade of Metritocracy]''. Far Eastern Economic Review. October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Special Assistance Plan|SAP]] Schools were created to provide Mandarin among the Chinese. The reference to Confucian society by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew marked a shift in policy of neutral multiculturalism to Chinese-dominated society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chinese schools began receiving government aids while other schools were neglected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The former Prime Minister had once sparked a debate on the loyalty of the Malays to Singapore.  He stated that the Malays might have conflict when it comes to loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90915loy.htm A question of loyalty: the Malays in Singapore].

[[File:Dupondius Auguste Autel de Lyon.jpg|thumb|[[Dupondius]] with illustration of the ''Ara trium Galliarum''.]]
The '''''Ara trium Galliarum''''', or ‘Altar of the three Gallic provinces’, was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sanctuary]] near ''[[Lugdunum]]'' (today [[Lyon]] in [[France]]). The [[altar]] was consecrated to the goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Augustus]].

In the 2nd decade of the 1st century BC, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] built the ritual place as part of the preparation for his offensive in Germania. Once a year on August 1 the ''[[Concilium provinciae]]'', the province council of the [[Gaul|Gallic]] [[Roman province|provinces]], met at that place. The main function of the council was to sacrifice to the Roman Emperor (see [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]), elect a priest of Rome and Augustus for the coming year, and arrange public games. In this way, the Gallic tribes demonstrated their allegiance to Rome.

Analogous to the ''Ara trium Galliarum'' was the ''[[Ara Ubiorum]]'', constructed in ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' (modern [[Cologne]]) for the Germanic provincial council.

The concept of an '''archetype''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ɪ|t|aɪ|p}} appears in areas relating to [[behavior]], [[History of psychology#Emergence of German experimental psychology|modern psychological theory]], and [[literary analysis]]. An archetype can be:

# a statement, pattern of behavior, or [[Prototype theory|prototype]] (model) which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate. (Frequently used informal synonyms for this usage include "standard example", "basic example", and the longer form "archetypal example". Mathematical archetypes often appear as "[[canonical (disambiguation)|canonical]] examples".)
# a [[Platonic philosophy|Platonic philosophical idea]] referring to pure [[Theory of Forms|forms]] which embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing in Platonism
# a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in individual psyches, as in [[Jungian psychology]]
# a constantly recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology (this usage of the term draws from both [[Cultural anthropology|comparative anthropology]] and from [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian archetypal theory]]). In various seemingly unrelated cases in classic storytelling, media, etc., characters or ideas sharing similar traits recur.

==Etymology==
The word ''archetype'', "original pattern from which copies are made", first entered into English usage in the 1540s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=archetype&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Archetype|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''archetypum'', [[Latinisation of Greek|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπον}} (''archétypon'')'','' whose [[adjective]] form is {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}} (''archétypos''), which means "first-molded",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxe%2Ftupos {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}}], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is a compound of {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}} ''archḗ'', "beginning, origin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|τύπος}} ''týpos'', which can mean, amongst other things, "pattern", "model", or "type".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos τύπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Usage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literarydevices.net/archetype/|title=Online Literary Device - Archetype Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their work.
According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture and/or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.

==Plato==
{{Main|Theory of Forms}}
The origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as [[Plato]]. Plato's ''ideas'' were pure mental forms that were imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. They were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and [[Francis Bacon]] both employ the word 'archetype' in their writings; Browne in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.

==Jungian archetypes==
{{Main|Jungian archetypes}}

The concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], c. 1919. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] ( e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| title = Carl Jung| first = C. George| last = Boeree| accessdate = 2006-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060206030011/http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| archivedate= 6 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atpweb.org/jtparchive/trps-45-13-02-159.pdf Brown, R.S.(2013). Beyond the Evolutionary Paradigm in Consciousness Studies. The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 45.2, 159-171.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jung states in part one of ''Man And His Symbols'' that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype ''is a tendency to form such representations'' of a motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.&lt;/blockquote&gt;While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms ''primordial images,'' include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400850969.3|work=Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 9 (Part 1): Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400850969|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.

Other authors have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html|title=The 12 Common Archetypes|website=www.soulcraft.co|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dichter's application of archetypes ==
Later in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. [[Ernest Dichter]] took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Around 1939, he moved to New York and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a famous letter boasting his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail therapy. How Ernest Dichter, an acolyte of Sigmund Freud, revolutionised marketing |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541706 |quote=In 1939 he wrote to six big American companies, introducing himself as 'a young psychologist ... |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=December 17, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story archetypes ==
Christopher Booker, author of ''The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57131450|title=The seven basic plots : why we tell stories|last=Christopher.|first=Booker,|date=2004|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=0826452094|location=London|pages=|oclc=57131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:
# Overcoming the Monster
# Rags to Riches
# The Quest
# Voyage and Return
# Comedy
# Tragedy
# Rebirth
These themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes.

==Archetypal literary criticism==
{{Main|Archetypal literary criticism}}

Archetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a [[text (literary theory)|text]]'s meaning is shaped by [[culture|cultural]] and [[psychology|psychological]] myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring [[image]]s, [[symbol]]s, or [[pattern]]s (which may include motifs such as the "[[quest]]" or the "[[Ascent to Heaven|heavenly ascent]]"; recognizable character types such as the "[[trickster]]", "[[saint]]", "[[martyr]]" or the "[[hero]]"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.

The archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Azerbaijan Photographers Union''' (APU) is the public, creative, [[non-profit]] organization, based on the principles of [[open society]], [[voluntarism (action)|voluntariness]] and [[self-government]].

It acts under the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] and Charter of the Union.

The Azerbaijan Photographers Union was registered in the Ministry of Justice of the [[Azerbaijan]] Republic on the 20 November 1998 by certificate number 1073.

At the beginning of 1990, with the collapse of the USSR, all working structures became worthless and it became apparent that there was need of an organization in which professional and amateur photographers — all those who are devoted to photographic art — would join together.

At that time a serious, uniting moment in the organization's establishment became preparation and holding of the ''Photographers of Azerbaijan'' exhibition in Nantes, France in November 1995, where 105 works by 24 photographers were presented.

After the exhibition in France, there were 3 years of debates, the charter's complying, overcoming obstacles, and the initiative group was formed to tackle this - registered the Union officially, although actually the Union already acted from 1994 on a voluntary basis, without legal status.

The main purposes and tasks of the APU are promotion to the national development of photo art, popularization of its achievements in the country and abroad, preservation and creative use of photographic heritage. With the purpose of promotion and development of photo art the Union organizes exhibitions, competitions, festivals, master classes, conferences and symposiums with the participation of the Azerbaijani and foreign photographers, as well as promotes the amateur movement.

10 years passed from the APU's establishment. During this period the members of the creative union have organized and taken part in more than 100 exhibitions, including more than 30 in foreign countries (USA, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia etc.).

The Chairman of the Board is Mirnaib Hasanoglu.

This is one of King's numerous novels, which also include ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'', that tie in with [[The Dark Tower (series)|the ''Dark Tower'']] series. ''Black House'' was nominated to the [[Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref name="WWE-2001"&gt;{{cite web

The novel is set in Straub's homeland Wisconsin, rather than in King's frequently used backdrop of [[Maine]].  The town of "French Landing" is a fictionalized version of the town of [[Trempealeau]], Wisconsin.  Also, "Centralia" is named after the nearby small town of [[Centerville, Trempealeau County, Wisconsin|Centerville, Wisconsin]], located at the intersection of Hwy 93 and Hwy 35.

A chapter of the book is written around [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem "[[The Raven]]".

==Plot summary==

A series of murders has begun to plague the town of French Landing, [[Wisconsin]]. The murderer is dubbed "[[Charles Burnside|The Fisherman]]", due to a conscious effort by the killer to [[Copycat crimes|emulate the methods]] of [[serial killer]] [[Albert Fish]]. Like Fish, French Landing's killer targets children and indulges in [[cannibalism]] of the bodies. Two victims have already been discovered as the story opens, with a third awaiting discovery. The nature of the crimes, and the local police's inability to capture the killer, have led people all over the region to become more anxious with each passing day, and certain elements of the local media exacerbate the situation with inflammatory and provocative coverage.

After the events of ''[[The Talisman (King &amp; Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'', Jack Sawyer has repressed the memories of his adventures in The Territories and his hunt for the Talisman as a twelve-year-old boy, though the residue of these events has served to subtly affect his life even after he has forgotten them. Jack grew up to become a lieutenant in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], where his professionalism and uncanny talent have helped him establish a nearly-legendary reputation.  When a series of murders in Los Angeles are traced to a farm insurance salesman from French Landing, Wisconsin, Jack cooperates with the French Landing Police to capture the killer. While in Wisconsin, Jack is irresistibly enraptured by the natural beauty of the Coulee Country, echoing his reaction to The Territories as a child.  When he later intrudes upon a homicide investigation in [[Santa Monica]], certain aspects of the crime scene threaten to revive his repressed memories. He subsequently resigns from the LAPD, and he moves to French Landing to enjoy his early retirement.

When the Fisherman begins to terrorize French Landing, the police all but beg "Hollywood" Jack Sawyer for his assistance and are surprised when he flatly refuses. Memories of the Santa Monica event threaten to overwhelm Jack, and he fears that involving himself in the investigation may break his sanity. When a fourth child is taken by the Fisherman, events no longer allow Jack to remain aloof. It quickly becomes apparent to him that the Fisherman is much more than a serial killer. In fact, he is an agent of the [[Crimson King]], and his task is to find children with the potential to serve as [[Breakers (Stephen King)|Breakers]]. The fourth victim, Tyler Marshall, is one of the most powerful Breakers there has ever been, and he may be all the Crimson King needs to break the remaining beams of the [[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]] and bring an end to all worlds. As the Fisherman also proves capable of "flipping" into The Territories, Jack Sawyer is the only hope of not just French Landing, but all existence.

==Terms==
* '''Abbalah''': The [[Crimson King]].
* '''Coppiceman''': A word that Jack uses to refer to [[policemen]], most notably himself. The word was taken from Wolf's erroneous pronunciation of policeman in the previous book, ''[[The Talisman (King &amp; Straub novel)|The Talisman]]''.
* '''D'Yamba''': A magic word Jack uses that invokes the power of good.
* '''[[Opopanax]]''': Jack is almost haunted by the word opopanax at the beginning of the story. Its meaning is given as: "describing a word that cannot be found in the dictionary." It is also the name of the feather in ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' that is used to summon the Calla folken to a palaver - and also passed to anyone desiring to speak during the palaver. 
*'''Twinner''': A twinner is a person's counterpart or double in another world.  In the language of the Territories, "twinner" translates as "harp," which in Jack's mind conjures the image of two strings "a finger touch away".

[[File:Budapest-Pride2013.jpg|thumb|240px|Budapest Pride 2013]]
'''Budapest Pride''', or '''Budapest Pride Film and Cultural Festival''', is [[Hungary]]'s largest annual [[LGBT]] event. Of the week-long festival, the march is the most visible event. The march has historically been known under several names, including ''Budapest Gay Dignity Procession'' ({{lang-hu|Meleg Méltóság Menet}}), and has taken place each year since 1997, usually on the first Saturday of July, proceeding along [[Budapest]]'s most expansive thoroughfare, [[Andrássy Avenue]], between the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]] (Városliget) and Elizabeth Square (Erzsébet tér). Though much smaller in scale than similar [[gay pride]] [[Pride parade (LGBT community)|parades]] in [[Western Europe]] and the [[Americas]], around one to two thousand marchers typically participate in the Budapest procession. [[Far right|Radical right-wing]] demonstrators and hooligans have severely disrupted the Budapest Pride marches held in 2007 and 2008, casting uncertainty over the future of the event. Budapest Pride however has been held successfully in the intervening years, with minimal incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://queerintheworld.com/gay-budapest-hungary-travel-guide/|title=Gay Budapest Guide: The Essential Guide To Gay Travel In Budapest Hungary 2018|date=2018-05-29|work=Queer In The World|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival==
Although the march is the best known aspect of the festival, the Budapest Pride Film and Cultural Festival includes many other events, such as its film festival, discussions, exhibitions, theater productions, author readings, picnics, speeches, religious events, concerts, and parties. In 2011, the festival had over 100 events.

==Counterprotests==
===Early years===

There was only a smattering of public protest against the first eleven Budapest gay parades, until the one held in July 2007.  In 2003, prominent right-wing radical [[György Budaházy]] and a group of about 30 [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] protestors blew whistles and chanted [[anti-LGBT slogans|slogans]] such as "dirty queers" at marchers as the parade crossed the [[Erzsébet Bridge|Elizabeth Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/meleg0705/ ''Köpködtek az ellentüntetők''] (in Hungarian only)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a few activists from the [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[Christian democracy|Christian-Democratic]] [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] political party stood along the route of the procession blowing whistles and holding signs displaying quotations from the Bible, while police took one man into custody for throwing a rock at an officer at the beginning of the parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/leszb0703/ ''Rendben zajlott a melegfelvonulás''] (in Hungarian only)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, about 10 [[neo-Nazi]]s taunted paraders at one point along the route,&lt;ref&gt;[http://velvet.hu/trend/pride0709/ Nagy vörös bránert szopogattunk az Andrássyn] (in Hungarian only)&lt;/ref&gt; while the notorious [[blog]]ger, inciter and media manipulator [[Tamás Polgár]] (known by the alias "Tomcat") rigged to a pillar of the [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge|Chain Bridge]] a rolled-up, egg-filled sign, which he intended to unfurl via [[remote control]] as the procession crossed the bridge, thus dropping its contents down onto the marchers. However, the remote-control malfunctioned, forcing Tomcat and an accomplice to climb up the pillar to manually disengage the sign reading "stupid queer gays" (hülye buzi melegek), though only after the parade had passed underneath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/gtmc050710/ ''Besült a buzibomba a Lánchídon''] (in Hungarian only)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, about a dozen activists from the radical right-wing [[Jobbik]] (Movement for a Better Hungary) political party and another dozen protestors affiliated with the right-wing extremist [[Hungarian Self-Defense Movement]] (Magyar Önvédelmi Mozgalom) heckled participants in the parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nol.hu/cikk/408642/ ''Ne ítélj, hogy ne ítéltess!''] (in Hungarian only)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
{{Original research|section|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Budapest Gay Parade 2007 842.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Participants in the 2007 Budapest Gay Dignity Procession]]
The 12th Budapest Gay Dignity Procession held on July 7, 2007 was the first to encounter substantial, belligerent protest. Some 2000 participants marched from Procession Square (Felvonulási Tér) past [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]] down Andrássy Avenue. Several balloon-decorated flatbed trucks marshaled the parade down the avenue, blaring techno-pop from mounted speakers and carrying the standard array of shirtless young men, [[transvestism|transvestites]], neo-[[Punk subculture|punk]] [[lesbian]]s and [[Camp (style)|camp]]y-costumed figures, including a man in tight shorts, a black shirt, and a [[clerical collar]], who held a big pink book bearing a [[cross]] and was later to become the focus of attacks from the far-right media, particularly Kuruc.info.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Much of the description of both the 2007 and 2008 Budapest gay parades in this article is based on eyewitness account of author.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this is original research.--&gt;

Several hundred police escorted the procession in full [[Riot control|riot gear]], ready to protect participants from expected aggression en route to the parade’s destination at a [[Nightclub|dance club]] located on the [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] side of the [[Danube]] called Buddha Beach. Just as in 2006, the extraparliamentary Jobbik party and the Hungarian Self-Defense Movement had organized demonstrations against the gay parade. However a culture of right-wing public protest and violent [[hooliganism]] had emerged in Hungary during the intervening year with the outbreak of massive anti-government demonstrations known collectively as the [[2006 protests in Hungary|"fall disturbances"]] (''őszi zavargások'') in September and October 2006, prompting police to expect that the 2007 protests against the gay parade would be much more extensive and aggressive.

Approximately 500 protesters awaited the parade behind a metal-fence barrier erected at the site of Jobbik’s officially announced anti-gay demonstration at the corner of the Oktogon, chanting "dirty queers!" and pelting marchers with eggs as they turned south onto the [[Grand Boulevard (Hungary)|Grand Boulevard]] (Nagy Körút) on their way toward Buddha Beach. A rank of riot police wedged between the procession and the protesters, who had begun to bombard participants with, in addition to eggs, empty beer cans, [[smoke bomb]]s and [[plastic bag]]s filled with [[petroleum jelly]] and [[sand]], the latter alluding to the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] slang word {{lang|hu|homokos}}, literally "sandy", for "gay". Police chased those seen throwing these objects at marchers up to several hundred yards down the sidewalk, eventually arresting and charging 8 protesters for [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]].&lt;ref&gt;http://index.hu/politika/belfold/mel85/&lt;/ref&gt; Police narrowly averted a more brutal assault on the parade, chasing off a group of approximately 30 hooligans, who discarded bags full of empty bottles and fist-sized rocks as they fled down a side street. Jeering protesters accompanied the parade all the way to its terminus, dispersing following a brief standoff with riot cops and [[police dog]]s during which they changed slogans such as "Queers into the Danube, [[Jew]]s after them!" and "[[Ferenc Gyurcsány|Gyurcsány]] [Hungary’s prime minister] get out!"

The Budapest police, after effectively buffering marchers from the protesters during the procession, failed to protect people leaving Buddha Beach later that evening, when, according to parade organizers, 11 attacks took place in the vicinity of the club against gays, two of whom required medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://index.hu/politika/bulvar/ver7655/&lt;/ref&gt; A freelance photographer for the Hungarian [[News agency|News Agency]] [[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]] won 2nd place in the 2007 [[World Press Photo]] contest with his photograph of two gay [[Germany|German]] [[tourism|tourists]] who were among those attacked following the parade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2008/contemporary-issues/zsolt-szigetv%c3%a1ry&lt;/ref&gt; Several civil organizations in Hungary and [[Amnesty International]] criticized the Budapest police (BRFK) for failing to sufficiently protect participants in the 2007 Budapest gay parade, both during and after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/008/2007/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BRFK subsequently initiated disciplinary procedures against one officer for failing to respond to a call for [[Police|police protection]] following the parade.&lt;ref&gt;http://index.hu/politika/belfold/toth36282/&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===

Budapest [[Chief of police|Police Chief]] [[Gábor Tóth]], evidently aware that the 2008 Gay Dignity Procession was likely to elicit even greater protest than that in 2007, on June 11 informed the event's organizer, the Rainbow Mission Foundation [Szivárvány Misszió Alapítvány], that the BRFK had prohibited its request to hold the 2008 parade along Andrássy Avenue on July 5 on the grounds that it would "impede the circulation of [[Public transport|mass transit]] and vehicle traffic". Fifteen Hungarian [[List of gay-rights organizations#Hungary|gay organizations]], including the Rainbow Mission Foundation, sent a letter to the BRFK the following day protesting the decision, urging the Budapest police "not to try to prevent expected right-wing extremist attacks on the parade by forbidding it, but to do its duty to defend the marchers from expected aggression."&lt;ref name="index.hu"&gt;http://index.hu/politika/belfold/melmelt0612/&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Liberalism|liberal]] Budapest Mayor [[Gábor Demszky]] refuted Chief Tóth's claim that the parade would unduly obstruct traffic in the vicinity of Andrássy Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;http://velvet.hu/blogok/gumicukor/2008/06/12/demszky_kiall_a_melegfelvonulas_mellett&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Hungarian Civil Liberties Union]] (known in its Hungarian-language [[acronym]]ic form as TASZ) and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee [Magyar Helsinki Bizottság] [[human rights]] organization also denounced the BRFK's prohibition of the parade. (TASZ announced that it would provide Hungarian gay organizations with legal services in the event that they chose to file a lawsuit against the BRFK for banning the parade, noting that the Budapest police routinely closes Andrássy Avenue to vehicle traffic for weekend events, most recently for the National Gallop [[Horse show|equestrian show]] held on the weekend of May 31-June 1, 2008.)&lt;ref name="index.hu"/&gt; The BRFK retracted its prohibition of the gay parade the very same day, on June 12, announcing one week later that it had approved the Rainbow Mission Foundation's original request to hold the event along the established route on the customary first Saturday of July.&lt;ref&gt;http://index.hu/politika/belfold/budapest/meleg4271/&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential right-wing [[Extremist Groups|extremist groups]] and websites immediately went on the offensive following the announcement that the Budapest gay parade would be held as usual in 2008. On June 18, Budaházy and his close associate, the leader of the radical-nationalist [[64 Counties Youth Movement]] [64 Vármegye Ifjúsági Mozgalom] [[László Toroczkai]], issued a joint communiqué regarding the parade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We will not permit aberrant foreigners of this or that color to force their alien and sick world on Hungary. We hereby publicly declare that we, ourselves, will defend the Hungarian capital. Every Hungarian patriot is needed! Stand among the defenders, or form defensive forces from among your groups and organizations, and come to the [[Oktogon (intersection)|Oktogon]] in Budapest at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of July 5.! It is our moral duty to act....

The Rainbow Rampage, the aggressive [[pederasty|pederast]] caravan of degenerate foreigners that is traversing Europe, will arrive to its final stop in Budapest on July 4, Freemasonry's biggest holiday and the anniversary of the signing of America's [[Declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]], in order to celebrate queerdom in our capital for several days on end. Beginning at 4 p.m. on July 5, this [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] queer rabble will hold a public procession and street ball, trampling under foot all fundamental traditional [[moral value]]s and proclaiming Hungary's occupation by aberrants and foreigners.

HOWEVER.

During these days, we Hungarian patriots will recall the [[Battle of Pressburg]] in which the forces of our founding father, [[Prince Árpád]], inflicted a crushing defeat upon the western armies....

The army of Hunnia will defend the capital of the Hungarians on July 5, 2008!.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://szentkoronaradio.com/belfold/2008_06_18_toroczkai-budahazy-2008-julius-5-en-meg-kell-vedenunk-magyarorszag-becsuletet?page%3D5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181505/http://szentkoronaradio.com/belfold/2008_06_18_toroczkai-budahazy-2008-julius-5-en-meg-kell-vedenunk-magyarorszag-becsuletet?page=5 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the major right-wing radical websites in Hungary published this announcement, whose authors arguably command the greatest capacity in the country to mobilize right-wing extremists for engagement in violent street action. Also on June 18, the Hungarian Self-Defense Movement (known in its Hungarian-language acronymic form as MÖM), which had been involved in organizing protests against the previous two gay parades, published an appeal on the organization's website under the heading "On July 5 we will attack out of self-defense!":
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We summon all Hungarians, responsibly minded families, fathers and mothers,
to all come and expel the pederast horde once and for all! We cannot simply watch passively as  such genetic trash shows a bad example for our children! ... We call upon all Hungarian self-defenders to resist on Saturday afternoon on July 5, we will meet at the designated place! We will unite our forces at the Oktogon!&lt;ref name="magyaronvedelem.hu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magyaronvedelem.hu/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913143206/http://www.magyaronvedelem.hu/index.php |archivedate=2008-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 28, an anonymous self-described founding member of a [[fan club]] for the Budapest [[Football team|soccer team]] [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencváros]], whose supporters have a highly publicized history of hooliganism and participation in right-wing extremist street aggression,  published a letter on MÖM 's website stating that "we are answering the Hungarian Self-Defense Movement's appeal":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We will be there! With weapons if we must, with bare hands if we must, but we will not let things stand as they are! Let those who oppose us tremble with fear!&lt;ref name="magyaronvedelem.hu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 19, Tomcat proposed on his website Bomb Factory (Bombagyár) that a straight parade be held at the same time as the gay parade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The annual "gay pride" day is coming as usual. The queers spend millions on their exhibitionism so that a few hundred people can put their perversions on display for the world. Are there enough healthy, heterosexual people out there, who marching opposite them, not shouting, not throwing things (we don’t need a parade to do this), perhaps [[holding hands]] with their partners, to show that the love of the opposite sex is worth more?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bombagyar.hu/index.php?post=1067&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 26, Hungary’s primary right-wing extremist website, Kuruc.info, published a list of [[gay bar]]s, cafés, saunas, guest houses and hotels in Budapest. This was an ominous development, since beginning in December 2007 a group called the Arrows of the Hungarians National Liberation Army (Magyarok Nyilai Nemzeti Felszabadító Hadsereg) had [[firebombing|firebombed]] several residences and other locations implicitly identified as targets on the website. Early the following morning, a [[Molotov cocktail]] was thrown into the entry of the gay-frequented Action Bar in Budapest, while on the morning of July 2, four Molotov cocktails were tossed into one of the city's sauna [[Gay bathhouse]] in Budapest, slightly injuring one of the establishment’s employees. On July 3, Kuruc.info reported on the latter firebombing under the title Cleansing Fire Licks Another Mini Sodom in which the website noted that "Incidentally, we drew the attention of our readers to the sauna, just in case they wanted a little hot air." Though the Arrows of the Hungarians did not claim responsibility for the firebombings as the organization had done in previous cases, usually publishing video recordings of the attacks, Kuruc.info asked the largely [[rhetorical question]] following the assault on the Action Bar "has the Arrows of the Hungarians National Liberation Army struck again?" Kuruc.info further prepared its readers for the gay parade with the publication of detailed instructions, including pictures, two days before the event, on how to fill eggs with dye for throwing at the marchers in the procession.&lt;ref&gt;Reference links for Kuruc.info currently unavailable (see explanation later in entry)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomcat, meanwhile, began the process of organizing his heterosexual counter-procession, though he was first compelled to explain how it was that he had actually marched in the 2004 Gay Dignity Procession:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
. . . I participated carrying a "NOT ME" sign, though I did not want to eliminate or throw things at anybody. In fact, I found the events that took place there to be absolutely acceptable.... Yes, I observed the 2004 queer parade from the inside. I also took photos and chatted with the queers. I met among them some old buddies as well. And I still maintain that there was no problem with that parade. But I also maintain that now, in 2008, go ahead and bombard them with all sorts of stuff and eradicate their organizers. . . In 2004, and earlier I think, there were neither fags running around half naked, nor pink-Bible-licking obscenities, nor rump rummagers jumping all over each other in public.... However, one year later the Pride had totally changed and was not simply a party for queers. Politics had got hold of it by that time, the lackey media did the job of vilifying the "[[Homophobia|homophobes]]," and the whole thing degenerated into an unprincipled advertisement for wild-liberal values.... The standard has been sinking ever since. It is no accident that fewer and fewer normal homos support the parade.... With regard to my allegedly boundless homophobia, it is enough to note that Bomb Factory has a gay editor as well. He doesn’t make any particular secret out of it. And I have several gay friends and acquaintances besides him as well. None of them will be there [at the gay parade] on Saturday. Surely they are "far-right extremists" too.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bombagyar.hu/index.php?post=1101&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On July 1, Tomcat summoned his so-called "factory dwellers" to prepare for the Bomb Factory counter-procession:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are only a couple of days left until the Saturday street battles, so it is time that we began getting ready. Of course, we would not for the world harm those dear homosexual people, who want to truck down the entire length of Andrássy Avenue, but let’s at least show them that we are here on this world as well.... We welcome all our healthy, heterosexual friends and also those homos who condemn those lunatics dressed in their disgusting garb and kindly decline to have these people represent them. Our procession will travel along the same route as that of the queers, and we will proceed down Andrássy Avenue opposite them. We won’t yell, we won’t throw things, we won’t murder—the Kuruc people will do that in our place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bombagyar.hu/index.php?post=1105&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And finally, on the night before the parade, Tomcat issued a last reminder:
	
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
You haven’t forgotten have you? ... We welcome everybody, and bring your partners with you. Those who would like to beat up queers can join Budaházy’s group, though I don’t see a very good opportunity to do this with so many cops around.... Our demonstration will not be violent, we aren’t going to throw things or fight. Of course, it is still possible to thwart the queer parade. A kind Bomb Factory dweller is organizing an egg-throwing team. Those interested should contact....&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bombagyar.hu/index.php?post=1120&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The far-right Movement for a Better Hungary ([[Jobbik]]), which had led efforts to organize demonstrations against previous Budapest Gay Dignity Processions, remained inactive with regard to the 2008 parade until the morning of the event, when the party published the following communiqué on its website:
	
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ban the Queer Procession from Budapest!
	
The instigators motivated in the force field of the extreme-liberal [[Alliance of Free Democrats|SZDSZ]] are marching on the streets to demonstrate in favor of their deviant views this year as well.... We inform the misguided people preparing to take to the streets: you can still turn back before you collide the walls of awakening and organizing social resistance!

There is currently a government-inspired show-like trial taking place against the [[Hungarian Guard]] [Magyar Gárda], while liberals and left-wingers within several [[Local government|local councils]] have initiated the prohibition of this [[charitable organization]] from their territory, including Budapest. At the same time, the police, in conformity with [Budapest Mayor] [[Gábor Demszky]]’s expectations, chose to review their original decision and permitted the initially banned homosexual event....

We request that the self-defined Christian-conservative [[Hungarian Democratic Forum|MDF]] and [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz-KDNP]] not distance themselves from Jobbik and the Hungarian Guard, but from the true extremists. We urge them to read [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]], [[The Bible and homosexuality#Leviticus 18 and 20|Leviticus 20:13]]: "If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be [[Capital punishment|put to death]]; their blood will be on their own heads."&lt;ref&gt;http://jobbik.hu/node/4724&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The BRFK had good reason to suspect, as the political daily [[Népszabadság]] reported on June 25, that "marchers would be exposed to more and increasingly brutal attacks than last year."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nol.hu/cikk/496821/&lt;/ref&gt; All of Hungary's main right-wing extremist leaders, organizations and media—Budaházy, Torockai, Tomcat, the Hungarian Self-Defense Movement, the Hungarian National Committee Jobbik, ostensibly the Arrows of the Hungarians Liberation Army, Kuruc.info, Bombagyár, Holy Crown Radio (Szent Korona Rádió), Barikád.hu—had rallied with an exceptional degree of unity and purpose behind the cause of "defending the capital" against the "pederast horde." (Already in June, the main pages of the Kuruc.info and the Hungarian Self-Defense Movement websites had displayed countdown clocks showing the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the start of the 2008 Budapest gay parade.) Far-right attacks on gay parades held the previous weekend in [[Brno]] Czech Republic and [[Sofia]], Bulgaria, both of which resulted in a considerable number of arrests, were also a powerful portent of what was likely to take place at the 13th Budapest Gay Dignity Procession.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080628/ts_afp/gayrightseurope_080628210220{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the parade, as police helicopters hovered overhead, protesters broke down the tall metal fences surrounding the parade's endpoint at Heroes' Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aGYA.CsevqEE&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Hungarian Police Arrest 49 in Clashes With Anti-Gay Protesters | date=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They threw eggs, bottles, rocks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/06/europe/gays.php&lt;/ref&gt; and [[firecrackers]] at the marchers, and [[cobblestone]]s and [[gasoline bomb]]s at police.

The police protection of the parade had an estimated cost of 500 000 dollars (100 million HUF) for the protection of ~200 gay demonstrators witch became an unusually high cost per person in Hungary.

===2009===
The police kept protestors, but also other onlookers and well-wishers, one block away from Andrássy Road, so that the march had no contact to the public, although it was extensively covered by television. An infiltrator attempted to disrupt the march by bursting balloons, but was frightened away by booing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Gay Dignity in Budapest as Security Services Thwart Homophobic Extremists | work =Hungary | publisher =UK Gay News | date =5 September 2009 | url =http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/09/Sep/0504.htm | accessdate =2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Calico Captive''''' is [[Elizabeth George Speare]]'s first [[historical fiction]] children's novel. It was inspired by the true story of [[Susanna Willard Johnson]] (1730–1810) who, along with her family and younger sister, were kidnapped in an [[Abenakis]] Indian raid on [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]] in August 1754.

The main events in ''Calico Captive'', which occurred on the brink of the [[French and Indian War]], were taken from Johnson's narrative diary ''A Narrative of the Captivity of Mrs. Johnson'', which was first published in 1796. ''Calico Captive'' is told through the eyes of Miriam, Johnson's younger sister, and her imagined adventures.

==Plot summary==

In August 1754 Miriam Willard, along with her older sister Susanna, her sister's husband James Johnson, and their three children; two-year-old Polly, four-year-old Susanna, and six-year-old Sylvanus, are kidnapped from Number Four, a fort in Charlestown. Miriam and her family are forced to march north by their Indian captors, never knowing whether they will be killed or taken into slavery.

Throughout the journey Miriam finds she cannot keep her mind off Phineas Whitney, her sweetheart planning to attend [[Harvard College]]. On the way north Susanna gives birth to a girl and names the infant Captive. The rugged trail is made far more difficult for Miriam by the miserable crying of Captive, the damp cold and hunger, and the sight of her exhausted sister. Fortunately, a horse named Scoggins is captured for Susanna so that she does not have to walk and carry the infant. Eventually the group reaches the Indian village where, upon surviving a half-hearted [[Fustuarium|gauntlet]] while being forced to dance and sing, they are adopted into the tribe.

After many months the Indian tribe’s [[Sachem]] decides to sell his English captives to the French in [[Montréal, Quebec]]. However, Susanna's master forces her to stay behind and Sylvanus, who has taken a liking to the Indian culture, willingly chooses to go on a hunting trip with the Indians and then stays at a different Indian village. Upon arriving in Montréal Miriam finds to her horror that they are all to be privately purchased off to separate owners and held on ransom. James is thrown in jail for a short time but is finally forced to retrieve money from the English governor to pay for his family’s release. Polly captures the interest of the mayor's wife, who is unable to have a child of her own, while little Susanna is sold to another French household and Miriam meets the prominent Du Quesne family.

Although working as a servant, Miriam quickly finds herself living a life she has never imagined. She meets an amiable French girl named Hortense and the two quickly become friends. One day Miriam is asked by Madame Du Quesne to teach her daughter, Felicité, to read and write proper English. Miriam finds she is intrigued by Felicité’s friendliness and wealthy lifestyle. Meanwhile, James makes a petition to the French governor and is allowed to return to English territory and ask for money and a passport.

Susanna is eventually released by her Indian captors and joins Miriam. Meanwhile James goes to Boston to get money in order to buy the liberty of the rest of his family. The two sisters are invited by Felicité to join her at a [[Ball (dance)|ball]] wherein Miriam unintentionally draws the attention of Pierre Laroche, a grandson of a wealthy nobleman. Miriam dances with the young man, which angers and embarrasses Felicité, who had her heart set on marrying Pierre. The Du Quesne family, feeling disgraced and insulted and because they believe James broke his bond and escaped from captivity, throws out Miriam and Susanna.

After several hours in the snowy streets Hortense finds the two and informs them they can stay with her family. Miriam realizes that the Hortense family cannot support three more occupants and conjures a plan to make some money. She decides to use her talent for dressmaking to craft a fashionable dress for Madame Du Quesne and Felicité. The plan works, although she is told to keep her services a secret. However, the governor’s wife, Marquise De Vaundreuil, finds out Miriam had designed the Du Quesne dresses and hires her.

When James finally returns the French governor has been replaced. The new authority refuses to recognize the agreement. Worse yet, Polly, who was unable to adjust to her new family, runs away and is eventually allowed to stay with her mother. Instead of earning their freedom Susanna, James, Polly and Captive are thrown in jail. Miriam, as a dressmaker for a notable family, is spared jail time.

Miriam eventually succeeds in gathering her courage and asks Marquise De Vaundreuil about her relatives. Marquise De Vaundreuil promises she will talk with her husband. Meanwhile, Pierre asks Miriam to marry him although, after much consideration, she realizes she truly does not love him.

Marquise De Vaundreuil keeps her promise to speak with her husband and eventually Miriam, Susanna, James, Polly and Captive are released from prison. They board a small sailing vessel to cross the Atlantic to [[Plymouth, England]] and from there they sail back to America, finally as free people. Two years later Sylvanus is brought home by a redeemed Indian captive. Another redeemed prisoner from Montréal brings home little Susanna. Phineas Whitney, after graduating from Harvard, marries Miriam.

[[File:Swatch Jewlry and its casing.JPG|thumb|Case for jewellery]]
A '''case''' of some [[merchandise]] is a collection of items packaged together.  A case is not a strict unit of measure. For consumer foodstuffs such as [[canned goods]], [[soft drink|soda]], [[cereal]], and such, a case is typically 24 items, however cases may range from 12 to 36, typically in multiples of six. For larger bottles such as [[gallon]] jugs, a case is typically 4.  

==Examples==
*The standard case for 32 [[Fluid ounce|oz]] bottles of soda and [[Powerade]] contains 15 bottles due to their peculiar shape and size. 
*Cases of [[video tape]] are typically packed 10 to a case. 
*The standard for cases of [[wine]] is 12 bottles.

==Book manufacture==
[[File:Printing and bookbinding for schools (1914) (14782995955).jpg|thumb|150px|Illustration from ''Printing and Bookbinding for Schools'' (1914]]
The term ''case binding'' in the book manufacturing industry refers to a collection of pages contained in a ''case'' which is attached to it. (There are also cases for books e.g. slipcases which merely enclose a book.) The original ''case'' is often now called simply the ''binding'', although the integrated manufacturing process still uses the term ''case'' to refer to the hard cover and spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Case_Binding.htm |title=What is Case Binding? |publisher=Desktoppub.about.com |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chitti''' is a fictional character and the primary [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] of the films [[Enthiran]] and [[2.0 (film)|2.0]]. The character was portrayed by [[Rajinikanth]] in ''[[Enthiran]]'', a non-canon [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Ra.One]]'', and in ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘2.0’ Teaser Review: Chitti, Chitti, Bang Bang.

==Design ==
The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the [[G.I. Joe]] [[action figure]]s. For Chitti's [[2.0 (film)|2.0]] version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its "good robot" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of [[Yak]] hair,&lt;ref name="Banu Sify"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | title=Banu&amp;nbsp;– I give full credit to Rajini sir | publisher=Sify | date=9 October 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221074710/http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | archivedate=21 February 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt.&lt;ref name="Banu Sify" /&gt; To make Vaseegaran look mature, the team made Rajinikanth sport an [[Beard#Styles|Oakley beard]].{{refn|According to Banu, an Oakley beard is "neither a French beard not a full beard".

==Abilities==
Chitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced "[[Humanoid robot|andro-humanoid]]" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.

Initially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. 
Underneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid-resistant. 

In his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him.  As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed.

Chitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light.

Chitti is able to adhere to metal objects through his selective magnetism. This allows him to both render his foes weaponless, as well as fly for a certain distance to any nearby metallic structure. He is physically able to exert superhuman speed, agility and strength; he is at least able to lift with ease a convertible car, and even pull two trucks towards himself while they are in motion. In the second half of ''Enthiran'' as well as in ''2.0'', he designs and equips himself with a "handgun", which is basically a retractable firearm within his right hand.

Chitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights, which temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.

==Appearances==
In the first film, ''[[Enthiran]]'', Chitti (played by [[Rajnikanth]]) is an android robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about them. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fiancée, Sana (played by [[Aishwarya Rai]]) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by [[Danny Denzongpa]]) and upgrade into 2.0 because of a red chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hindu : Entertainment Chennai : Director's dream project |url=https://www.thehindu.com/fr/2005/03/11/stories/2005031101810100.htm |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converts it into a ruthless killer and turned into an evil destructive killing machine and killed Bohra. He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. He caused so much damage and destruction to the city. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Script decides the fate of the movie' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lsquoScript-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article15609945.ece |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=27 December 2010 |language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitti reappeared in the film ''[[Ra.One]]'' in a special appearance and communicated with [[G.One (character)|G.One]] (played by [[Shah Rukh Khan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Revealed! What Rajinikanth’s Chitti does in Ra.One's Chammak Challo |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-revealed-what-rajinikanth-s-chitti-does-in-raone-s-chammak-challo-1594868 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=dna |date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rajnikanth reprising his role. This appearance is non-canon, meaning both this and Chitti's film franchise don't share the same continuity.

In the 2018 film ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'' with Rajnikanth reprising his role one more time, Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, [[Fifth force]], which is controlled by Pakshi Rajan, an [[Ornithologist]] (played by [[Akshay Kumar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0: Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar film trailer to release on Diwali 2018? |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/2point0-trailer-on-diwali-2018-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-1346962-2018-09-23 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=India Today |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Rajinikanth Effect: 2.0 Teaser Gets Blockbuster Welcome - 32 Million Views in 24 Hours |url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/the-rajinikanth-effect-2-0-teaser-gets-blockbuster-welcome-32-million-views-in-24-hours-1916413 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0 Movie Review : Is 2.0 worth for watching or not? |url=https://www.indianpeopletimes.com/entertainment/2-0-movie-review-is-2-0-worth-for-watching-or-not|accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=indianpeopletimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by [[Amy Jackson]]), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as "Kutty Chitti" (3.0) which is a microbot capable of shape-shifting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31366">A '''Collections Management System''' ('''CMS'''), sometimes called a '''Collections Information System''', is [[software]] used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts.  Collecting institutions are primarily [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies.  Secondarily, [[libraries]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are also collecting institutions.   Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Sully | first=Perian | date=8 July 2006 | url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf | title=Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software | publisher=[[John F.

All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010).

==Development and history of collections management systems==
Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1967, the [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[IBM]] conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, pp. 23-24. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,"&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this time some of today’s popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio] for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s [[Monticello]] — before being released as commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 19. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, with computers becoming faster and cheaper and with the rise of the Internet, collections management software became much more sophisticated, able to “present images, sort information in any one of a myriad of configurations, record exhibition information, track locations, and interface with a museum Website."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 40. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the goal during the 1960s was to use computers for collections record-keeping for purposes of accountability, MCN Executive Director [[Everett Ellin]] warned that museum professionals should include public access as a goal because it would “not be worth the effort if museums only create a glorified record-keeping system."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems have become crucial tools in increasing public access to collections information, expanding the types of information that are recorded. What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects," including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “[[Content management system|Content Management System]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

==Information managed in collections management systems==
In 1997, art historian and museum information studies consultant Robert A. Baron outlined the requirements for Collections Management Systems, not as a list of the kinds of collections object information that should be recorded, but rather as a list of collections activities such as administration, loan, exhibition, preservation, and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;Swank, Annamaria Poma (September 2008).

Retrieved 15 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN) Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist (CMSCC), which aims to be a comprehensive list of the kinds of information that a museum may want to record in a CMS, organizes that list by processes and actions rather than type of information. The checklist “outlines a number of features commonly included in a commercial CMS, which can assist a museum in determining which features have priority.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

===Object entry===
Managing and documenting information and tasks related to objects entering the museum, including acquisition or loan records, receipts, record of the reason for the deposit of the object, and record of the object’s return to its owner.

===Acquisition===
The management and documentation of objects added to the institution’s collection, including [[Accession number (library science)|accession numbers]], catalog numbers, object name or title, acquisition date, acquisition method, and transfer of title. There are many different accession numbering systems, and a CMS should allow an institution to use its existing numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory control===
Identification of objects for which the institution has a legal responsibility, including loaned objects and objects that have not been accessioned. Information recorded includes object location and status.

===Location and movement control===
Records of an object’s current and past locations within the institution's premises so that it can be located, including dates of movement and authorizations for movement.

===Catalog description===
Information that describes and identifies objects, including creator/maker/artist, date(s) of creation, place of creation, provenance, object history, research on the object, and connections to other objects.

===Conservation management===
The management of information about an object’s conservation “from a curatorial and [[Collections management (museum)|collections management]] perspective," including conservation requests, examination records, condition reports, records of preventative actions, and treatment histories.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

===Risk management===

Management of information about potential threats to collections objects, including documentation of specific threats, records of preventative measures, disaster plans and procedures, and emergency contacts.

===Insurance management and valuation control===

Documentation of insurance needs for objects for which the institution is responsible (included loaned objects) as well as the monetary value of objects for insurance purposes. This may include the names and contact information of appraisers as well as appraisal history.

===Exhibition management===
Management of an object’s exhibition or display, including exhibition history and documentation of research done on an object for an exhibition. More advanced Collections Management Systems may have the ability to present information from the system on a museum’s website or in an online exhibit.

===Dispatch/shipping/transport===
Management of objects leaving the institution’s premises and being transferred to a different location, including location information, packing notes, crate dimensions, authorizations, customs information and documenting the means of transportation (including courier information).&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 26. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loaning and borrowing===

==Features of collections management systems==

===Functionality===

A Collections Management System should be able to store data, edit data, delete data, access data through queries, sort data, and output data in the form of reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), pp. 117-118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Data is stored in the form of tables and is entered into the system (and sometimes edited) using forms. Queries are searches that help retrieve specific data from the system, and reports “are the means by which the results of a query are displayed or printed."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file’s location recorded in the CMS.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed.

===Backup and redundancy===
A CMS should have "a built in backup and recovery process" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data standards===
Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and [[metadata standards]] should be applied in a Collections Management System.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise [[information retrieval]] and for easier exchange of data between different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value:

* Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DC), [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), the [[MARC standards|MARC]] formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA ([[Visual Resources Association]]) Core Categories.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]] (DACS).
* Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of [[authority lists]], lexicons, [[Data Dictionaries|data dictionaries]], and thesauri. Examples include the Getty’s [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) and [[Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and [[Iconclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the [[Darwin Core]] standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.&lt;ref&gt;Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin Core]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘[[CIDOC]]’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”&lt;ref&gt;Adlib Software. [http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software Adlib Museum]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and access===
A Collections Management System should have security measures that “ensure that only authorized persons are able to enter, edit, or view” information contained in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The system should allow the public to be able to make and refine searches of publicly accessible information in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and reproductions===

A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or [[Creative Commons license]]), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when selecting a system==
Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a [[needs assessment]] before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), [https://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?] ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/select-museum-cms-start-with-needs-assessment/|title=Start Your Museum CMS Selection Process with a Needs Assessment |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation information management systems==
Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

Many Collections Management System developers have responded to this need by adding requested conservation features to their products. For example, in 2009, Gallery Systems, the developer of The Museum System (TMS), formed a consortium of stakeholders called the Conservation Working Group, to create a set of features to add to the conservation module of TMS.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems (2015). [http://www.gallerysystems.com/a-brief-history-of-conservation-studio/ A Brief History of Conservation Studio]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservators and institutions have taken a different approach, customizing existing software so that the system can manage conservation workflows. For example, at the [[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]] in 2012, former collections database administrator Kate Collen modified The Museum Systems’ conservation module so that it could manage object treatment processes, including assigning roles and responsibilities to multiple staff, ordering and prioritizing conservation tasks and treatments, separating treatment images from object images, automating registrar and lender approvals for treatments, and even tracking staff hours. This was achieved by renaming and remapping fields in the existing system, in some cases using fields for different purposes than originally intended by the software developer.&lt;ref&gt;Collen, Kate (2012). [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vsnd3jf5g7rssr/Collen%2C%20Kate%20%282012%29.%20Making%20Conservation%20Work.pdf?dl=0 Making Conservation Work: Configuring the Conservation Module for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum]. Retrieved 14, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software developers have been developing standalone systems specifically for the purpose of managing conservation information and tasks. Since 2000, Inventive Software Solutions has been developing the Conservation Tracker System for the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to be “a comprehensive digital management tool for art conservation documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Inventive Software Solutions. [http://www.inventivesoftware.net/Products/ConservationTracker.aspx Conservation Tracker System Overview]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed since 2009 as a program of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], ConservationSpace is a project “to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared solution to the problem of documentation management.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationspace.org/Home.html ConservationSpace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219041630/http://conservationspace.org/Home.html |date=2014-12-19 }}. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gallery Systems decided that adding incremental conservation features to The Museum System was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of conservators and began to develop a standalone web-based system to manage conservation processes called TMS Conservation Studio, which was released in summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems.

'''Common Turkic''' or '''Shaz Turkic''' is a [[taxon]] in some of the classifications of the [[Turkic languages]] which includes all languages except the [[Oghur languages]]. Lars Johanson's proposal contains the following subgroups:&lt;ref&gt;Lars Johanson (1998) The History of Turkic. In Lars Johanson &amp; Éva Ágnes Csató (eds) The Turkic Languages. London, New York: Routledge, 81–125. [http://www.turkiclanguages.com/www/classification.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

* [[Oghuz languages|Southwestern Common Turkic (Oghuz)]]
*[[Kipchak languages|Northwestern Common Turkic (Kipchak)]]
* [[Karluk languages|Southeastern Common Turkic (Karluk)]]
* [[Siberian Turkic languages|Northeastern Common Turkic (Siberian)]]
*[[Khalaj language|Khalaj]]

In that classification scheme, Common Turkic is opposed to '''[[Oghur languages|Oghur Turkic]]''' ('''Lir-Turkic'''). The Common Turkic languages are characterized by sound correspondences such as Common Turkic ''š'' versus [[Oghur languages|Oghuric]] ''l'' and Common Turkic ''z'' versus [[Oghur languages|Oghuric]] ''r''.

In other classification schemes (such as [[Alexander Samoylovich]] and [[Nikolai Baskakov (linguist)|Nikolay Baskakov]]), the breakdown is different.

A '''''cong''''' ({{zh|c=琮|p=cóng|w=ts'ung2}}) is a form of ancient [[Chinese jade]] artifact.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Taotie+jade+cong|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later also used in ceramics. 

== History ==
The earliest ''cong'' were produced by the [[Liangzhu culture]] ([[3400 BC|3400]]-[[2250 BC]]); later examples date mainly from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/32Arts1376.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328174104/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/32Arts1376.html |archivedate=2016-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the jade shape developed during the 12th-13th century [[Song dynasty]]. The shape continued to be used in ceramic and metalwork for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] TV documentary: ''China in Six Easy Pieces'' (2013) presented by [[Lars Tharp]] http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036r5cx&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
In form, a ''cong'' is a tube with  a circular inner section and squarish outer section.  The outer surface is divided vertically or horizontally such that the whole defines a hollow cylinder embedded in a partial rectangular block.  Proportions vary - a ''cong'' may be squat or taller than it is wide.  The outer faces are sometimes decorated with mask-like faces, which may be related to the ''[[taotie]]'' designs found on later bronze vessels.

Although generally considered to be a ritual object of some sort, the original function and meaning of the ''cong'' are unknown.  Later writings speak of the ''cong'' as symbolizing the earth, while the ''[[bi (jade)|bi]]'' represents the heavens. The square represents the earth and a circle represents the heavens.

==Premise==
Howard Silk has been working for a [[United Nations]] agency based in [[Berlin]] for thirty years; however, his rank is too low for him to be told what his work really involves. In fact, the agency oversees a crossing point to a parallel Earth (the "Prime world"), a copy of Silk's world, which was created by [[East Germany|East German]] scientists in 1987, and which has been diverging ever since. 

Silk's "other" self, his counterpart from the Prime world, is, among other things, a field agent who regularly makes crossings to Silk's world (the "Alpha world") to retrieve "others" who have gone rogue. Factional in-fighting in the agency in the Prime world spills over to the Alpha world, endangering Silk and his comatose wife, Emily.

 |ShortSummary = Howard Silk is a low-level bureaucrat in a Berlin-based UN agency called the Office of Interchange, where he works in the Interface division, exchanging coded call-and-response messages with another agent. Despite his long tenure, Howard has never learned the purpose of Interface or OI. Peter Quayle, OI's Director of Strategy, later denies Howard a promotion to his department, citing Howard's age and lackluster career. After work, Howard visits his comatose wife Emily, who was struck by a car. The next day, Howard is taken to a room with Quayle and Aldrich, the Director of Housekeeping. A man identical to Howard is brought in: Howard Prime.{{efn|name=Howard|Per series creator Justin Marks, the "other" Howard is referred to as Howard Prime, and "our" Howard is referred to as Howard Alpha, or simply Howard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/counterpart-interview/ |title=How 'Counterpart' Creator Justin Marks Created Two Worlds With Very Specific Rules [Interview] |work=/Film |last=Fred |first=Topel |date=January 19, 2018 |accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Quayle explains that during the final years of the Cold War, the East Germans accidentally created a portal to a divergent parallel universe in the basement of what would become the OI building.

 |ShortSummary = Upon learning of imminent negotiations for Baldwin's return, Howard Prime visits Prime world ambassador Claude Lambert to have him stall for time while Aldrich and Howard Alpha interrogate Baldwin. Lambert dismisses Howard Prime's request, and Emily Prime and Ian cross over to question him about the Baldwin fiasco. At the negotiations between Lambert and Alpha OI Diplomacy director Roland Fancher, lingering tensions over the cause of a deadly pandemic that devastated the Prime world initially block progress. Emily Prime explains to Howard Prime that Pope ordered his rendition, while Howard Prime reveals his source on the schism in Prime OI's Management is from the Alpha world. The negotiations wrap up, but Baldwin fails to crack and is later freed in an ambush engineered by Clare. Howard Prime realizes the negotiations were a ploy and suspects Lambert's involvement. To circumvent the revocation of his crossing privileges, Prime decides to switch identities with Howard Alpha. In the Prime world, Emily Prime discovers Howard Prime's source was Emily Alpha, who asked Howard Prime to reach out to her husband if she was harmed. At her apartment, Emily Prime is drugged by intruders, who stage the drugging to look like a self-inflicted overdose.

Howard Alpha encounters Pope, who is aware that Alpha and Prime switched and attempts to sow distrust between Alpha and Emily Prime; Alpha informs Emily, who believes Pope was behind her "overdose". They seek out a diplomatic courier linked to the fanatics and Lambert. Emily elaborates that the Prime world's pandemic was a form of flu that killed half a billion people in the early 1990s. Prime world defector Alice explains to Quayle and Aldrich that Prime OI's Strategy implemented an unauthorized program called Indigo, which set up "the School" to train sleeper agents from childhood; Indigo was funded off-the-books by Prime OI staff who blamed Alpha OI for the pandemic. Alice also mentions an agent codenamed Shadow may have been sent to infiltrate Alpha OI five years ago.

When questioned by his compatriot, Ringleader, he reaffirms that the people of the Alpha world are "filthy" and deserve to die. Anna discusses her father's odd behavior with Emily Prime. Ian is told of Emily and Howard Alpha's encounter with the courier and submits Howard to a lie exam, which Howard "beats" because he has no knowledge of Howard Prime's activities. Emily Prime shares a Potsdam address gleaned from the courier with Ian. They, Howard Alpha, and a squad of agents travel there, but Pope is tipped off by the lie exam administrator and alerts the building's residents. Baldwin attends her other's funeral, then strikes a bargain with Clare to finish her contract. She later develops feelings for Greta, a barista.

 |ShortSummary = In 1997 in the Prime world, Clare Fancher is taken in by the School after her parents succumb to the flu epidemic. She is ruthlessly molded into a copy of her other, and taught by supervisor Mira to hate the Alpha world for unleashing the flu virus. In 2013, Clare crosses over after her other becomes engaged to Quayle, then a Deputy Director in OI, and observes her in preparation for assuming her identity. When Clare Alpha breaks the engagement off after Quayle cheats on her, Clare Prime kills her, replaces her, and sets the marriage back on track. In the present, Quayle sends Clare on an errand and has Howard Prime search his house for evidence of her duplicity. They find a cyanide capsule in Clare's medicine cabinet, and realize Clare has been tracking Quayle's whereabouts through his phone. Since Clare is unaware she has been exposed, Quayle is forced to play innocent during his birthday party, but drinks heavily. After the guests depart, an agitated Quayle openly accuses his wife of being a spy and tries to get her to swallow the cyanide, but Clare confesses that she let the pill expire because of her baby, the first thing in her life which is truly hers.

 |ShortSummary = Howard Prime eludes capture by Aldrich, as well as a clumsy attempt by Quayle to capture or kill him. Aldrich is skeptical that either Quayle or Prime is Shadow.

While being pressured to flip, Kaspar reveals that Pope arranged Emily Alpha's accident to end her snooping. Howard Alpha decides to return to the Alpha world.

 |ShortSummary = Security forces monitor Angel Eyes from both sides of the crossing. Quayle and Clare survive the collision with minimal injuries. Clare explains the attack was just the beginning. The Management departments of both OIs order their staff to leave Angel Eyes untouched; Alpha OI wants Prime OI to claim him in order to demand reparations, while Prime OI wants to avoid culpability for the unsanctioned Indigo program. When Angel Eyes dies unclaimed, Alpha OI seals off the crossing. Howard Alpha begs Pope for help crossing back, but he kills Pope when the latter pulls a gun on him, and Ian uses the opportunity to have Howard put in solitary confinement. Greta rejects Baldwin after connecting her to the late Nadia Fierro. Aldrich uses Emily Alpha as bait to trap both Howard Prime and Baldwin, but Prime outwits him and bribes Baldwin into walking away from the contract killing. Baldwin then kills Aldrich to avenge Nadia. Meanwhile, Clare kills Cyrus in her house when he confronts her. Howard Prime calls a truce with Quayle, agreeing to keep Clare's secret in exchange for Emily Alpha's safety. Later, as Prime takes up Howard Alpha's life in earnest, Emily Alpha regains consciousness.

==Background==

De Kerckhove received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in French Language and [[French literature|Literature]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1975 and a Doctorat du 3e cycle in [[Sociology]] of [[Art]] from the University of [[Tours]] ([[France]]) in 1979. He was an associate of the Centre for Culture and Technology from 1972 to 1980, and worked with [[Marshall McLuhan]] for over ten years as translator, assistant and co-author.

==Publications==

He edited ''Understanding 1984'' ([[UNESCO]], 1984) and co-edited with [[Amilcare Iannucci]], ''McLuhan e la metamorfosi dell'uomo'' (Bulzoni, 1984) two collections of essays on McLuhan, [[culture]], technology and [[biology]]. He also co-edited with [[Charles Lumsden]] ''The Alphabet and the Brain'' (Springer Verlag, 1988), a book which scientifically assesses the impact of the [[English alphabet|Western alphabet]] on the [[physiology]] and the [[psychology]] of human [[cognition]]. Another publication, ''La civilisation vidéo-chrétienne'' appeared in France in December 1990 and in [[Italy]] the following year (Feltrinelli, 1991).

''Brainframes: Technology, Mind and Business'' (Bosch &amp; Keuning, 1991) addresses the differences between the effects of [[television]], [[computer]]s and [[hypermedia]] on [[corporate culture]], business practices and economic markets. ''The Skin of Culture'' (Somerville Press, 1995) is a collection of essays on the new electronic reality which stayed on [[Canadians|Canadian]] best-sellers lists for several months. It was translated into a dozen languages including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]].

''Connected Intelligence'' (Somerville, 1997) introduced his research on new media and cognition. His latest book, ''The Architecture of Intelligence'', was first issued in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in December 2000, and in [[English language|English]] (June 2001), [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]] in September 2001.  It was later translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and Japanese. He collaborated with [[Mark Federman]] on ''McLuhan for Managers: New Tools for New Thinking'',  published in September 2003. De Kerckhove is also contracted to work on a book about the history of stage performance from early [[Greek theatre]] to modern [[Opera]], in collaboration with [[Francesco Monico]].

==Other works==
''The Point of Being'' co-edited with [[Cristina Miranda de Almeida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Point of Being|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-point-of-being}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores the research question: what are the psycho-physiological dimensions of the ways people experience their presence in the world and the world’s presence in them? There is in all chapters an invitation to experience a shift of perception. An embodied sensation of the world and a re-sensorialization of the environment are described to complement the visually-biased perspective with a renewed sense of humans’ relationship to their spatial and material surrounding. As such, this book presents the topological reunion of sensation and cognition, of sense and sensibility and of body, self and world. The perception of the "Point of Being", to which the various chapters of this book invite the reader, proposes an alternative to the "Point of View" inherited from the Renaissance; it offers a way to situate the sense of self through the physical, digital and electronic domains that shape physical, social, cultural, economic and spiritual conditions at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Nine authors explore different ways in which the paradigm of the Point of Being can bridge the interval, the discontinuity, between subjects and objects that began with the diffusion of the phonetic alphabet. The Point of Being is a signpost on that journey.

'''DesignTide Tokyo''' was an annual design event held from 2005 until 2012. It was held in the Autumn as part of [[Tokyo Designers Week]] and concurrent with 100% Design Tokyo, as part of loosely coordinated design event season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/30/talent-spot/|title=Talent spot - Tokyo|last=Balmond|first=Sarah|date=2010-02-10|website=Monocle Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-06|edition=Issue 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After  organization that planned a similar series of events, [[Tokyo Designers Block]], was dissolved after its 2004 events due to financial concerns.

==Founding==
DesignTide was founded in the wake of the dissolution of [[Tokyo Designers Block]], a similar event which ended in 2004 due to financial troubles, with the hope of continuing to support design in Japan. DesignTide's original founders were many of the same people that were involved with Tokyo Designers Block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtide.jp/05/en/about/advisory.html DesignTide Advisory Board Introduction 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it originally followed a similar focus as Tokyo Designers Block, emphasizing designers' creativity over the functional requirements of a trade show. Starting in 2007, DesignTide sought to develop a trade show component to the event to achieve a more equitable balance between design as creative vision and the need to support commercial activity in the field.

==Location==
In 2005, DesignTide took place at shops, museums and art galleries throughout Tokyo's design-centric districts, including [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]] and [[Harajuku]], Daikanyama, [[Marunouchi]] and [[Roppongi]].

Starting in 2006, a main exhibition site was added, organized as a design show curated by DesignTide's directors from a pool of applicants. In 2006 the main exhibition took place in a soon-to-be-demolished building in Harajuku; in 2007, in a gymnasium at the [[Olympic Stadium (Tokyo)|National Olympic Stadium]]; in 2008 and 2009 in the meeting hall of [[Tokyo Midtown]]. The main exhibition site eschewed cubicle-shaped booths in favor of unique architectural elements designed in response to each exhibitor space, thus turning the exhibition space itself into work of design.

The '''Eberswalde Hoard''' or '''Treasure of Eberswalde''' ({{lang-de|Schatz von Eberswalde}} or {{lang|de|Goldfund von Eberswalde}}) is a [[Bronze Age]] [[hoard]] of 81 [[gold]] objects with a total weight of {{convert|2.59|kg|ozt|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2004/02/01/brandenburg/656911.html|newspaper=Berliner Morgenpost|date=February 1, 2004|title=unknown/missing}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest prehistoric assembly of gold objects ever found in [[Germany]], it is considered to be one of the most important finds from the [[Central Europe]]an Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Carmen|title=Erbeutetes Gold als heißes Eisen|url=http://www.deutsche-allgemeine-zeitung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=885&amp;Itemid=29|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|date=March 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, it is in Russia, as part of the [[Looted_art#Looting_of_Germany|group of artifacts and works of art looted from Germany]] at the end of the [[Second World War]].

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) below the ground surface on May 16, 1913, during excavations for a house within the grounds of a brass factory at Finow ([[Oberbarnim]]), part of [[Eberswalde]] in [[Brandenburg]]. The factory supervisor alerted [[Carl Schuchhardt]], the director of the [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Prehistoric Department of the Royal Museums]] at [[Berlin]], who acceded the hoard to that collection.

==Description==
The hoard had been deposited in a globular vessel with a lid. In it were eight gold bowls, which contained another 73 gold objects. The bowls were thin-walled chased gold vessels with copious [[Ornament (art)|ornamental decoration]]. The other objects included neck rings, bracelets and 60 wire arm spirals. 55 double spirals were tied into bundles. A gold [[ingot]], a piece of metal shaped like a [[crucible]] and two smaller pieces probably represent raw material for the production of such objects. The treasure belongs to the goldsmith known as Villena-type, for its resemblance to the [[Treasure of Villena]].

==Origin, date==
The hoard used to be thought to represent the stores of a merchant.{{cn|date=November 2013}} More recent research suggests that it was of religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eluère|first=Christiane|authorlink=Christiane Éluère|title=Goldwork of the Iron Age in `Barbarian' Europe|journal=Gold Bulletin|date=December 1985|volume=18|issue=4|page=150|doi=10.1007/BF03214697|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03214697|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard is dated to the 9th century BC. &lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickley|first=Catherine|title=Gold Hoard, Trophy Art Stay in Russia as Ties With Germany Cool|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=anWdULPhvgxE|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
After the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, the Eberswalde Hoard disappeared from the Berlin museum, along with the so-called [[Priam's Treasure|"Treasure of Priam"]]. The suspicion that the [[Red Army]] might have removed both finds was denied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] for decades. After Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted that "Priam's Treasure" was in Russian hands, the authorities ceased to explicitly deny that they also held Eberswalde Hoard. In 2004, a reporter from German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' located it in a secret depot within [[Moscow]]'s [[Pushkin Museum]]. Germany has request return of the materials, and the issue has caused tension between the German and Russian governments.&lt;ref name=WhatIsIt&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Rupert|title=The Eberswalde Hoard: what exactly is it?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10135355/The-Eberswalde-Hoard-what-exactly-is-it.html|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductions of the hoard are on display at the [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]] in Berlin and the [[Stadt- und Kreismuseum]] in [[Eberswalde]]. The Eberswalde replica is by local goldsmith Eckhard Herrmann.&lt;ref&gt;Märkische Oderzeitung, October 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmond Roudnitska''' (1905–1996) was a [[France|French]] master [[perfumer]] and author. He is known for creating perfumes such as [[Dior]]'s Eau Sauvage and [[Diorissimo]], and [[Rochas]]'s Femme. Many of his creations are still in production today. He was the father of perfumer Michel Roudnitska.

In 1926, he started his training in perfumery in [[Grasse]]. In 1942, he met Thérèse Delveaux, who became his wife.&lt;ref name='ellena'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-et-parfum.com/textes/ellenaus.htm |title=Portrait Ellena US |accessdate=2009-11-24 |last=Ellena |first=Jean Claude |date=May 1999 |work=Portrait d'un compositeur de parfum |publisher=Art et Parfum |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he founded Art et Parfum, a private lab for creating perfumes.&lt;ref name='art'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-et-parfum.com/roudnitska.htm |title=Tribute to Edmond Roudnitska |accessdate=2009-11-20 |work=Art et Parfum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diorissimo]], based on  [[lily of the valley]], was a notable achievement in the field of perfumery. Unlike [[rose]] or [[jasmine]], the smell of lily of the valley cannot be extracted from [[essential oil]] of the flower. Roudnitska circumvented the problem by using aroma chemicals like [[hydroxycitronellal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Turin | first = Luca | authorlink = |author2=Tania Sanchez | title = Perfumes: the guide | publisher = Viking | year = 2008 | location = New York, New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-670-01865-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142}}

{{nihongo|'''''Gamera vs. Jiger'''''|ガメラ対大魔獣ジャイガ|''Gamera tai Daimajū Jaigā''|{{literal translation|Gamera vs. Giant Devil Beast Jiger}}}} is a 1970 ''[[kaiju]]'' film directed by [[Noriaki Yuasa]]. It is the sixth entry in the ''[[Gamera]]'' film series.

==Plot==
In ''Gamera vs. Jiger'', [[Gamera]] has his hands full right from the very beginning. [[Japan]] is preparing for [[Expo '70]], to be held in [[Osaka]]. Construction of the various buildings and pavilions is well under way. On Wester Island in the [[Pacific Ocean]], a large statue of mysterious origin (called the Devil's Whistle) is located by scientists. Workers from the Expo are interested in returning the statue for display and try to remove it for transport by ship. The removal of the statue is hampered first by a tribal member of the Wester Island people, then by the unexpected arrival of Gamera, who aggressively attempts to prevent the removal of the statue, only to be shot at by the crew instead. The statue is removed from the island successfully after a volcano erupts. Shortly after departing the island, members of the ship's crew begin to fall ill. The statue appears to be the source of the outbreak, as it makes a continuous piercing sound, driving many of the crew members insane. Later analysis reveals the presence of a central shaft that runs nearly the length of the statue top-to-bottom. The position of the opening on the statue is creating the high-pitched "squeal" as air passes through it.

After the statue is removed, Jiger makes her first appearance and gets Gamera's immediate attention. The first of several fights ensues and Jiger wins by shooting projectile quills from her face. The quills impale Gamera's arms and legs, piercing all the way through and preventing Gamera from withdrawing his limbs into his shell and taking flight. To make matters worse, Gamera is on his back and cannot move. He pulls himself up with his tail using a large rock, then removes the embedded quills from his limbs and is finally able to fly after Jiger.

Meanwhile, Jiger is actively seeking the statue, because it is making a horrible ringing sound that is causing her tremendous pain. Jiger lets nothing impede that hunt as she splits two ships in half and starts tearing through [[Osaka]]. Scientists are beside themselves as Jiger displays another weapon: a heat ray that vaporizes not only flesh but entire city blocks. The [[JSDF]] does make a token effort to kill the [[kaiju]], but her quills knock down the [[F-104 Starfighter]]s, ending that involvement.

Gamera returns for round two as the fight is witnessed by several children. Gamera knocks Jiger around and has the upper hand until Jiger pulls Gamera to her. Jiger extends a stinger from her tail and inserts the barb into Gamera's chest, laying an egg inside his lung. Gamera staggers away, roaring in agony. Finally, he barely makes it to the bay and his body turns a chalky white color, almost like ice. Gamera is presumed to have been killed at this point as Jiger heads straight to Expo '70. Jiger finally obtains the statue and throws it into the ocean, ending the painful noise.

The scientists are checking out possible causes of the noise, as it has affected humans, causing temporary insanity. The children convince them to do a medical exam on the comatose Gamera, where it is discovered that there is a dark spot on one of his [[lungs]]. One of the scientists served as a zoo director and realises that the spot might not be a fast spreading cancer, but actually a parasitic infant Jiger growing inside Gamera. An operation is needed to remove the threat, so the children take the initiative by taking a walkie talkie and a mini-sub. Communication is established with the kids and they enter Gamera through his open mouth, and after almost going into his [[stomach]], they arrive at the problem lung. The children are able to exit the sub and walk around in the lung. There, they discover the baby.

The baby looks like a tiny version of its mother, except that instead of shooting quills, it squirts a sticky goo. The baby attacks them, but it has a weakness just like its mother: [[white noise]]. The kids discover this is actually a fatal weakness and manage to kill the baby using static from their walkie talkie. They leave Gamera's body and report their findings to the scientists. They rig up large speakers to keep Jiger at bay, as well as figure out that power would have to also be run into Gamera, who seemingly cannot recover on his own. The children make a final trip inside Gamera to hook up a set of power lines directly to his [[heart]].

Jiger is kept immobile by the speakers playing the white noise. It is not enough to kill her, but buys enough time for the other plan to get started. Gamera is subjected to high voltage shock before the electrical grid overloads. It is enough that Gamera does revive on his own.

Gamera flies over to the World's Fair for the final battle. Jiger tries every weapon she has got, but Gamera has learned from his previous battles with her. After her spears fail to affect him, Jiger then uses her heat ray, the one weapon she has yet to use on him. It does not affect Gamera's shell or even skin (likely due to Gamera's resistance to heat), but the sound it generates threatens to rupture his eardrums. Luckily, Gamera is able to put telephone poles into his ears to protect them from the sound. After trying all her other attacks, Jiger resorts to her tail stinger again, but Gamera is prepared for it this time and uses a building to smash her tail and destroy the stinger. Gamera body-slams Jiger several times from great heights, but Jiger is not affected. However, it buys Gamera the time needed to go into the ocean and retrieve the statue from the ocean floor. Jiger, enraged by the statue's return, attempts to catch the flying Gamera. Gamera taunts Jiger with the statue, who tries in vain to catch Gamera and retrieve it. Gamera finally ends the fight by throwing the statue at Jiger, which embeds itself in Jiger's skull, killing her. Gamera then returns the devil beast's carcass to Wester Island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5864">[[Image:Partial Map of downtown Rome during the Roman Empire large with scalae Gemoniae marked.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[Capitoline Hill]], indicating the probable location of the Gemonian Stairs at the time of the [[Roman Empire]].]]

The '''Gemonian Stairs''' ({{lang-la|Scalae Gemoniae}}, {{lang-it|Scale Gemonie}}) were a flight of steps located in the ancient city of [[Rome]]. Nicknamed the '''Stairs of Mourning''', the stairs are infamous in Roman history as a place of [[Execution (legal)|execution]].

== Location ==
[[File:S. Pietro in Carcere.JPG|thumb|left|Via S. Pietro in Carcere close to the Campidoglio]]
The steps were situated in the central part of Rome, leading from the Arx of the [[Capitoline Hill]] down to the [[Roman Forum]]. As viewed from the Forum, they passed down the [[Tabularium]] and the [[Temple of Concord]] on the left side, and past the [[Mamertine Prison]] on the right side.&lt;ref name="platner-rome"&gt;Platner (1929). ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/home*.html A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Scalae_Gemoniae.html Scalae Gemoniae], p466. London. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the location of the steps roughly coincides with the current [[Via di San Pietro in Carcere]], past the ruins of the Mamertine prison.&lt;ref name="platner-rome"/&gt;

It is believed the stairs were built some time before the rule of [[Tiberius]] (14–37), as they were not mentioned by name in any ancient texts that predate this period.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest references comes from Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 3#14|Book 3, 14]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their first use as a place of execution is primarily associated with the paranoid excesses of Tiberius' later reign.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#61 61]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Executions ==
The condemned were usually strangled before their bodies were bound and thrown down the stairs. Occasionally the corpses of the executed were transferred here for display from other places of execution in Rome. Corpses were usually left to rot on the staircase for extended periods of time in full view of the Forum, scavenged by dogs or other carrion animals, until eventually being thrown into the [[Tiber]].

Death on the stairs was considered extremely dishonourable and dreadful, yet several [[Roman Senate|senators]] and even an [[Roman_emperor|emperor]] met their demise here. Among the most famous who were executed on this spot were the [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]] [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] and the emperor [[Vitellius]]. Sejanus was a former confidant of emperor Tiberius who was implicated in a conspiracy in AD 31. According to [[Cassius Dio]], Sejanus was strangled and cast down the Gemonian stairs, where the mob abused his corpse for three days.&lt;ref name="dio-history-lviii-11"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#11 LVIII.11]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, his three children were similarly executed in this place.&lt;ref name="dio-history-lviii-11"/&gt;

Vitellius was a Roman general who became the third emperor in the so-called [[Year of the Four Emperors]] in AD 69. He succeeded [[Otho]] upon his suicide on April 16, but lived to be emperor for only eight months. When his armies were defeated by those of [[Vespasian]], he agreed to surrender but the Praetorian Guard refused to let him leave the city. On the entrance of Vespasian's troops into Rome he was dragged out of his hiding-place, driven to the Gemonian stairs and struck down. His last words were "Yet I was once your Emperor".&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#84|III.84]], [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#85|III.85]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On those same stairs, [[Decebal]]'s head was thrown along with his right hand in 106 A.D.

During [[Roman Republic|Republican times]], the [[Tarpeian Rock]], a steep cliff at the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, was used for similar purposes. Murderers and traitors, if convicted by the ''quaestores parricidii'', were flung from the cliff to their deaths. Infants who suffered from significant mental or physical disabilities sometimes suffered the same fate, as they were thought to have been cursed by the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Platner |date=1929| url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/home*.html |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|pages=509–510|location= London|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Platner |date=1929| url= http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Tarpeius_Mons.html |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome: Tarpeius Mons|pages=509–510|location= London|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Forum for Art History Paris''' ('''Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte''' (DFK; Centre Allemand d'Histoire de l'Art de Paris; German Center for the History of Art, Paris) is a [[Germany|German]] research institute specialized in [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] art and currently situated in the Hôtel de Lully in [[Paris]], the former residence of the French composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. It organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops, undertakes research projects, and has published many books on art.

The DFK was founded in 1997 with German, French, and Swiss colleagues by [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]]. It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Until October 2007, the institution was headed by Gaehtgens, from 2009 to 2014 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Beyer|de}} and since February 2014 by the current director, {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Kirchner (Historiker)|de}}. From 2006, the Forum is part of the "Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad", which is now called "Max Weber Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad".

The DFK supports research by [[Germany|German]] scholars on [[France|French]] subjects. It also promotes the research of French scholars on German art and German art history and endeavors to include other [[Europe]]an and [[Americas|transatlantic]] countries and academic disciplines to participate in its research programs.

The DFK cooperates with the [[Institut national d'histoire de l'art]] (INHA) in Paris, the [[Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History]] in Rome, the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]] and the [[Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte]] in Munich.

'''Pirates''', despite being criminals, were very organized. As well as having crew members assigned certain duties, [[pirate]]s found a way to reduce conflict among themselves and maximize profits. They used a democratic system, spelled out by written “[[articles of agreement]],” to limit the captain’s power and to keep order on board the ship.

==Roles and duties on a pirate ship==

The '''captain''' was elected by all the men in the crew and could be replaced by a majority vote by the same. Cowardly or brutal captains were quickly voted out of their position.&lt;ref&gt;Ossian, Robert. "Roles and Duties On Board a Ship." Pirate's Cove. http://www.thepirateking.com/historical/ship_roles.htm (accessed November 27, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Captains were expected to be skilled and dependable seamen. They were also expected to be bold and decisive leaders&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ossian, Robert. "Roles and Duties On Board a Ship."&lt;/ref&gt; since they made the most important decisions including how to engage a target, how to pursue prey, how to escape the authorities and how to deal with an attack. In the latter situations, there was no time for taking a vote and settling conflicting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Leeson, Peter T. An-arrgh-chy: The law and economics of pirate organization. The Journal of Political Economy 115 (6) (Dec. 2007): pp. 1049-1094 {{doi|10.1086/526403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quartermaster''' had the same authority as a captain (except during battle). The crew elected him to represent their interests. He commanded the captain and the rest of the crew. His other jobs included keeping order, settling conflicts between crew members and determining the amount of food and drink distributed to each crew member.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The '''sailing master''' oversaw the navigation and sailing of the ship. Often, because of their skills, they were forced into service for pirates. The '''boatswain''' took care of the boat by supervising supplies, inspecting the ship every morning and reporting the condition of the ship to the captain. He also supervised deck activities including the handling of the sails and the weighing and dropping of the anchor. The '''carpenter''', under the boatswain and quartermaster’s directions, repaired the ship. Sometimes, the carpenter would also be the surgeon on the ship. The '''master gunner''' ensured that the cannons and weapons were in working order. The '''mate''' (often there were first and second mates) usually worked under the ship’s master, boatswain, gunner or carpenter as an apprentice. Mates also outfitted the ship with ropes, pulleys, sails and other rigging as needed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Other roles===

The '''common sailor''' would be familiar with the [[rigging]], sails and the steering of the ship. They kept watches and handled cannons during battle. A '''rigger''' worked the running rigging and furled and released sails. Young boys or men on a pirate ship were often servants known as '''cabin boys'''. During battles, '''powder monkeys''' ran gunpowder from below deck to cannon crews and also relayed messages.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Organization on board===

Watches were kept all day long. There was a larboard (left side) watch and a starboard (right side) watch; the quartermaster ran one watch, the sailing master the other. Most watches were 4 hours long except for the two [[dog watch]]es, which were two hours long. The shorter watches prevented crew members from ending up with the same watch day after day.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Benerson. The Buccaneer's Realm: Pirate Life on the Spanish Main, 1674-1688. (Washington, D.C: Potomac Books, 2007), 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The quarter bill, which listed duties in battle, was written before any battles took place and posted in a public place on the ship. During an actual battle, most of the crew stayed flat on their stomachs, under cover, until the time came to engage with the target, with the exception of those commanding and sailing the vessel. Once the target was close enough, the captain often remained on the quarter-deck, poop-deck or near the tiller. The sailing master, boatswain and mates managed the sailing of the vessel while the rest of the crew handled small arms or took responsibility for the cannons. A gun crew was responsible for two cannon, one on the [[starboard]] and its opposite cannon on the larboard). Ship’s boys carried cartridges and gunpowder up to the deck.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Benerson. The Buccaneer's Realm: Pirate Life on the Spanish Main, 1674-1688. 233-234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles of agreement==
{{see also|Pirate code}}
Pirate articles were based on the ''chasse-partie'' created on [[buccaneer]] ships in the 17th century. The ''chasse-partie'' determined the division of plunder among the crew as well as other rules. 18th-century pirates built upon this concept and created their own version of "Articles of Agreement." Before setting out on their expedition, pirates wrote their articles alongside the election of a captain or quartermaster. The articles needed the consent of every crew member, and “all [pirates] swore to ‘em” sometimes on a Bible or whatever was at hand.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Leeson, Peter T. An-arrgh-chy: The Law and Economics of Pirate Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; During the election of a new captain, men who wanted another leader often drew up separate articles and sailed away from their former crew-mates. Pirate democracy was flexible but unable to deal with long-term dissent from the crew.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death": The Social World of Anglo-American pirates, 1716 to 1726. The William and Mary Quarterly 38 (2) (Apr. 1981), 212&lt;/ref&gt;

One description of the ritual of the pirate’s code was in [[Alexandre Exquemelin|Alexandre Exquemelin's]] ''Buccaneers of America'', published in 1678. Pirates called a first council (which included all crew members) to decide where to get provisions. Then they raided for supplies. Afterward, food rations were determined (with the captain receiving no more than any man). A second council decided on the articles of agreement, which were put in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. 1996. Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates. (New York: Random House, 1996.), 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

These articles of agreement served four purposes:

*They specifically designated shares of the plunder for each crew member. Shares of the plunder were spelled out on the basis of each crew member's skills and duties. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] and [[quartermaster]] typically received one and a half or two shares; [[gunner (rank)|gunner]]s, [[boatswain]]s, [[shipmate]]s, [[carpenter]]s, and [[Ship's doctor|doctors]] typically received one and a quarter or one and a half shares, and all others one share each.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 210&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the plunder went into a "[[Mutual aid (organization theory)|common fund]]" to provide for severely injured men (who had [[Blindness|lost their sight]] or their [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]]). This, in turn, promoted loyalty among the crew because they knew they would be taken care of.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 211&lt;/ref&gt; If the value of the plunder was questionable, they would sell it before dividing the money among themselves. This prevented conflict between crew members and also prevented the quartermaster from hoarding the most valuable items.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*The articles prohibited activities that would cause conflict between crew members, such as excessive [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]], [[gambling]], [[Theft|stealing]] and bringing women (or boys) on board. Some, like [[Bartholomew Roberts]]' articles, also prevented crew members from settling arguments with [[duel]]s while on board the ship.
*They outlined punishments for various offenses. Punishments included [[marooning]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], slitting of ears and noses, and for severe crimes, [[Capital punishment|death]].  
*They created rules for the general safety of the ship. Usually, articles also required members to keep their [[weapon]]s in good working order. Also, since [[Conflagration|fire]] was especially dangerous on ships, some pirate articles forbade activities such as firing guns or [[smoking]] in areas of the ship that carried [[Flammability|flammable]] goods, such as [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Articles also described incentives like bonuses for productive crew members and thus prevented each man from allowing everyone else to pick up the slack.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Two examples of pirate articles==
{{quote|'''Bartholomew Roberts' articles on the ''Royal Fortune'' (1720)'''

#Every Man has a Vote in Affairs of Moment; has equal title to the fresh Provisions, or [[Distilled beverage|strong Liquors]], at any Time seized, and use of them at Pleasure unless a Scarcity…make it necessary, for the good of all, to Vote a Retrenchment [economizing].
#Every Man to be called fairly in turn, by Lift, on Board of Prizes, because, [over and above their proper share] they were on these Occasions allowed a shift of Cloaths: But if they defrauded the Company to the Value of a Dollar, in [[Silver (household)|Plate]], [[Gemstone|Jewels]] or Money, [[Marooning|MAROONING]] was their Punishment. If the [[Robbery]] was only between one another, they contented themselves with slitting the Ears or Nose of him that was Guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited Place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter Hardships.
#No Person to Game at Cards or [[Dice]] for Money
#The Lights and Candles to be put out at eight o’Clock at Night: If any of the Crew, after that Hour, still remained inclin’d for Drinking, they were to do it on the open Deck.
#To keep their [[Firearm|Piece]], [[Pistol]]s, and [[Cutlass]] clean, and fit for Service.
#No Boy or Woman to be allowed amongst them. If any Man were found seducing any of the latter Sex, and carried her to Sea, disguised, he was to suffer Death.
#To [[Desert]] the Ship, or their Quarters in Battle, was punished with Death, or Marooning.
#No striking one another on Board, but every Man’s Quarrels to be ended on Shore, at Sword and Pistol.
#No Man to talk of breaking up their Way of Living, till each had shared 1000 pounds. If in order to this, any Man should lose a Limb, or become a Cripple in their Service, he was to have 800 Dollars, out of the publick Stock, and for lesser Hurts, proportionably.
#The Captain and the [[Quartermaster|Quarter-master]] to receive two Shares of a Prize; the Master, Boatswain, and Gunner, one Share and a half, and other [[Ship's officer|Officers]], one and a Quarter.
#The [[Musicians]] to have Rest on the [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]] Day, but the other Six Days and Nights, none, without special Favour.&lt;ref&gt;Antony, Robert J. Pirates in the Age of Sail. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007.), 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1723, a man named John Phillips and four companions seized a schooner owned by William Minott of Boston. They named the ship the ''Revenge'', chose officers and swore to their articles on a [[hatchet]], since they did not have a Bible:

{{quote|
#Every Man shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share and a half in all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.
#If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be maroon’d, with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm and Shot.
#If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game to the Value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be maroon’d or shot.
#If at any Time we should meet another Marrooner [pirate], that Man that shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.
#That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive Moses's Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare Back.
#That Man that shall snap his Arms, or [smoke] Tobacco in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a [[Lantern|Lanthorn]], shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.
#That Man that shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.
#If any Man shall lose a [[Joint]] in Time of Engagement, he shall have 400 Pieces of Eight, if a Limb, 800.
#If at any Time we meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death.&lt;ref&gt;Antony, Robert J. Pirates in the Age of Sail, 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anything not covered in the articles would be settled by crew members, who would act as a type of judiciary body to interpret the articles and apply them to the situations not found in the articles. For the most part, pirates strictly followed their articles. It appears that “pirates were more orderly, peaceful and well-organized among themselves than many of the colonies, merchant ships, or vessels of the Royal Navy.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Counter-culture to normal maritime life and labor==

Piracy was usually voluntarily chosen, and it was a way of life that challenged the society pirates left behind. Most pirates came from the lowest social classes and went out to sea in search of a better life as well as loot and treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 204, 208&lt;/ref&gt; As well as these pragmatic and economic reasons, the “spirit of revolt against common oppressors,” the oppressors being the governments and societies of nations, helped create pirate democracy. Pirate democracy was a counter-culture, created by common sailors, to the traditional organization of maritime life and labor.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

On most merchant and Navy vessels, there was a hierarchy with captains holding the highest authority, then officers and at the bottom, ordinary sailors. On these ships, a captain had complete control over every aspect of life on his ship, including the division of food, wages, labor assignment and discipline. Thus, it was easy for a captain to become abusive and use his authority to take advantage of his crew.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; John Archer who sailed with [[Edward Teach]] said before his execution explained his stint as a pirate: “I could wish that Masters of Vessels would not use their Men with so much Severity, as many of them do, which exposes us to many Temptations.”&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Benjamin Bennet wrote of pirates to the Council of Trade and Plantations in 1718: “I fear they will soon multiply for so many are willing to joyn with them when taken.” Sailors on seized ships joined pirates because of the appealing “prospect of plunder and ‘ready money,’ the food and the drink, the camaraderie, the democracy, equality, and justice, and the promise of care for the injured.”&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Another appeal of piracy came in the limiting of the captain’s power over the crew. Pirate Francis Kennedy puts it succinctly: “most pirates, ‘having suffered formerly from the ill-treatment of their officers, provided carefully against such evil’ once they arranged their own command.”&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 209&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, pirate democracy came with a series of check and balances that protected the rights of the crew.

==Checks and balances==
Piratical checks and balances proved quite successful. According to Captain Charles Johnson, owing to the institution of the quartermaster, aboard pirate ships "the Captain can undertake nothing which the Quarter-Master does not approve. We may say, the Quarter-Master is a humble Imitation of the [[Tribune|Roman Tribune of the People]]; he speaks for, and looks after the Interest of the Crew."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[dual executive]] was a distinctive feature of pirate organization.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. ''Under the Banner of King Death'', 210&lt;/ref&gt; A quartermaster, along with the captain, was elected by the crew. The presence of the quartermaster divided the immediate authority on the ship into two, so one man couldn't have complete control over the crew. Also, the captain had to keep in mind that he only ruled because his crew allowed him to. A captain could be pulled from his position by a majority vote of the crew for various reasons, including: cowardice, poor judgment, abusive or [[controlling behavior]] (called predation) and other behavior that the crew believed infringed on their interests. The captain also lived like the rest of the crew; he had no privileges in lodgings or food and drink.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

However, the ultimate, highest authority on the ship was the pirate council, a group that included every man on the ship. The council determined where to go for the best prizes and how arguments were to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,”210&lt;/ref&gt; Also, discipline was dealt out on the basis on "what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company [believed] fit."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Pirates took their democracy beyond their ship as well. Upon seizing a prize, pirates administered the "[[distribution of justice]]" and asked the crew of the captured ship about their Captain’s nature. If the crew complained that their Captain had been cruel, the pirates tortured and then executed the captain. A kind captain was often released and rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brotherhood on the seas==

For the most part, Western pirates did not prey on one another and were always willing to help out fellow pirates. For example, in April 1719, [[Howell Davis]] and his crew sailed into the Sierra Leone River, alarming the pirates commanded by [[Thomas Cocklyn]] until they saw the Jolly Roger. After a while, they saluted each other with cannon. Other crews “often invoked an unwritten code of hospitality to forge spontaneous alliances.”&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jolly Roger]], the most famous symbol of every pirate’s experience of death, violence and limited time on Earth, was used to terrify targets but also to identify fellow pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 222-223&lt;/ref&gt; Pirate fraternity was further expressed by threats and acts of revenge against nations targeting pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rediker, Marcus. "Under the Banner of King Death,” 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dream of Libertalia==

''Also see'': [[Libertatia]]

“Pirates and other social bandits adopted social mechanisms which can be summarized as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Federalism|federal]], [[egalitarian]], [[Fraternity|fraternal]], and [[Communalism|communal]]. It may well be argued that these 'floating commonwealths' are examples of a form of pre-Enlightenment radicalism.” They were also far less conscious of national, religious and racial differences than what was common.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David E. Review: Of Pirates, Captives, Barbarians, and the Limits of Culture. American Literary History 14 (2) (Summer 2002): pp. 358-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Even women, like the pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, as could enjoy the freedoms of life aboard a pirate ship.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea. (Atlanta;Kansas City, Mo.: Turner Pub. ; Distributed by Andrews and McMeel, 1996.), 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd volume of ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' (published 1728), [[Captain Charles Johnson]] tells the tale of Captain Mission and his pirates, who established a utopian republic on the island of Madagascar. They called it “Libertalia,” where societies would be based on the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity. Mission’s pirates were determined to guard the common people’s rights, fight the power of monarchies and allow people to make and judge their own laws and elect and rotate their leaders. They chose a council without distinguishing between nationality or race. They opposed labor and condemned slavery. The tale goes that Mission and his men integrated slaves from captured ships into their society as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, Captain Mission and Libertalia probably never existed except as an expression of the “living traditions, practices and dreams of an Atlantic working class, many of which were observed, synthesized and translated into discourse by the author of A General History of Pyrates…[which also included] utopian practices of the early 18th century pirate ship.”&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in 1713, English pirates Thomas Barrow and [[Benjamin Hornigold]] did proclaim themselves the governors of a tangible pirate republic on the island of [[New Providence]] in [[the Bahamas]]. They were joined by pirate captains like [[Charles Vane]], Thomas Burgess, [[Calico Jack]] and [[Blackbeard]]. However, this republic was soon eliminated in 1718, by Captain Woodes Roger with his appointment as the Royal Governor of the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

The English ruling class recognized the influence of Libertalia and its alternative social order, and they soon put their efforts into quashing it. There were worries of a pirate “Commonwealth” (such as the one Barrow and Hornigold set up), especially one in areas where no nation would be able to fight them.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David. Pirates : Terror on the High Seas, from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, 135&lt;/ref&gt; English rulers responded by hanging sea robbers by the hundreds, and the English Parliament passed new legislation persecuting pirates.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Finally, with the hanging of Captain Bartholomew Roberts’ men at Cape Coast Castle on the African coast in 1722, the Golden Age of Piracy was brought to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David.

[[File:Hand of Glory.jpg|thumb|right|The hand of glory on display at Whitby Museum]]
The '''Hand of Glory''' is the dried and [[Pickling|pickled]] hand of a man who has been [[hanging|hanged]], often specified as being the left ({{lang-la|sinister}}) hand, or, if the man were hanged for murder, the hand that "did the deed."

Old European beliefs attribute great powers to a Hand of Glory combined with a candle made from fat from the corpse of the same malefactor who died on the gallows. The candle so made, lighted, and placed (as if in a candlestick) in the Hand of Glory, would have rendered motionless all persons to whom it was presented. The process for preparing the hand and the candle are described in 18th century documents, with certain steps disputed due to difficulty in properly translating phrases from that era. The concept inspired short stories and poems in the 19th century.

==History of the term==
Etymologist [[Walter William Skeat|Walter Skeat]] reports that, while folklore has long attributed mystical powers to a dead man's hand, the specific phrase ''Hand of Glory'' is in fact a [[folk etymology]]: it derives from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|main de gloire}}'', a corruption of ''mandragore'', which is to say [[mandrake]].&lt;ref name="Skeat"&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter William |last=Skeat |authorlink=W.W. Skeat |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5oVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Notes on English Etymology, chiefly reprinted from the Transactions of the Philological Society |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1904 |chapter=Glory, Hand of |page=109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeat writes, "The identification of the ''hand of glory'' with the ''mandrake'' is clinched by the statement in [[Thomas Oswald Cockayne|Cockayne]]'s Leechdoms, i. 245,&lt;ref name="Cockayne"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas Oswald |last=Cockayne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA245 |title=Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England |location=London |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, &amp; Green |year=1864 |chapter=Mandrake |page=245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the mandrake "shineth by night altogether like a lamp". Cockayne in turn is quoting ''[[Pseudo-Apuleius]]'', in a translation of a Saxon manuscript of his ''{{lang|la|Herbarium}}''.&lt;ref name="Skeat"/&gt;

==Powers attributed==
According to old [[Europe]]an beliefs, a candle made of the fat from a [[:wikt:malefactor|malefactor]] who died on the [[gallows]], lighted, and placed (as if in a candlestick) in the Hand of Glory, which comes from the same man as the fat in the candle, would render motionless all persons to whom it was presented. The method for holding the candle is sketched in ''{{lang|fr|[[Petit Albert]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/petitalb.htm#chap45  |trans-title=The Hand of Glory, and its effects |title=La main de gloire, &amp; ses effets |at=Chapter 45 |language=French |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The candle could be put out only with milk. In another version, the hair of the dead man is used as a wick, and the candle would give light only to the holder. The Hand of Glory also purportedly had the power to unlock any door it came across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Frank |year=1888 |title=Anthropologocal Notes on the Human Hand |journal=[[American Anthropologist]]  |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=51–76 |jstor=658459 |doi=10.1525/aa.1888.1.1.02a00040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of making a Hand of Glory is described in ''{{lang|fr|Petit Albert}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Joseph H.

[[File:Paper mache "Hand of Glory" Folk Lore Superstition by the Kuriologist.jpg|thumb|A papier-mâché hand of glory]]
The 1722 ''{{lang|fr|Petit Albert}}'' describes in detail how to make a Hand of Glory, as cited from him by {{lang|fr|[[Grillot de Givry]]}}:&lt;ref name=PetitAlbert/&gt;

{{quote|Take the right or left hand of a felon who is hanging from a [[gibbet]] beside a highway; wrap it in part of a funeral pall and so wrapped squeeze it well. Then put it into an earthenware vessel with zimat, nitre, salt and long peppers, the whole well powdered. Leave it in this vessel for a fortnight, then take it out and expose it to full sunlight during the [[dog days|dog-days]] until it becomes quite dry. If the sun is not strong enough put it in an oven with fern and [[vervain]]. Next make a kind of candle from the fat of a gibbeted felon, virgin wax, sesame, and ponie, and use the Hand of Glory as a candlestick to hold this candle when lighted, and then those in every place into which you go with this baneful instrument shall remain motionless}}

De Givry points out the difficulties with the meaning of the words ''zimat'' and ''ponie'', saying it is likely "ponie" means horse-dung. De Givry is expressly using the 1722 edition, where the phrase is, according to [[John Livingston Lowes]] "{{lang|fr|du Sisame et de la Ponie}}" and de Givry notes that the meaning of "ponie" as "horse dung" is entirely unknown "to us", but that in local Lower Normandy dialect, it has that meaning. His reason for regarding this interpretation as "more than probable" is that horse-dung is "very combustible, when dry".&lt;ref name=PetitAlbert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowes |first=John Livingston |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7imakKYtPIC |isbn=1443738115 |publisher=ReadBooks |edition=Second |origyear=1930 |year=2008 |title=The Road to Xanadu, A Study in the Ways of the Imagination |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the French 1752 edition (called ''{{lang|fr|Nouvelle Édition, corrigée &amp; augmentée}}'', i.e., "New Edition, corrected and augmented"), however, this reads as "{{lang|fr|..du sisame de Laponie..}}", that is, in [[Francis Grose]]'s translation from 1787, "sisame of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]]", or Lapland sesame. This interpretation can be found many places on the Internet, and even in books published at university presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucius Parvus Albertus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9MfIypxkvAC |isbn= |publisher=Les heritiers de Beringos frates |year=1752 |title=Secrets merveilleux de la magie naturelle et cabalistique du Petit Albert |location=Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grose |first=Francis |title=A provincial glossary:with a collection of local proverbs, and popular superstitions |isbn= |publisher=S. Hooper |year=1787 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31oJAAAAQAAJ |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two books, one by Cora Daniels, another by Montague Summers, perpetuate the Lapland sesame myth, while being uncertain whether zimat should mean [[verdigris]] or the Arabian sulphate of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Cora L. |last2=Stevans |first2=C.M. |title=Encyclopedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World |isbn=9781410209160 |publisher=University of the Pacific Press(The Minerva Group, Inc)|year=2003 |origyear=1903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d29Yo-UIBSwC |location=Honolulu, HA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Montague Summers |authorlink=Montague Summers |title=A Popular History of Witchcraft |isbn=9781136740183 |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9Q9kzcpkt8C |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|fr|Petit Albert}}'' also provides a way to shield a house from the effects of the Hand of Glory:&lt;ref name=PetitAlbert&gt;{{cite book |pages=181 |last1=De Givry |first1=Grillot |last2=Locke |first2=J.Courtenay (tr)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzVYG-bWNssC |isbn=9780486224930 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1931 |title=Witchcraft: Magic and Alchemy |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Hand of Glory would become ineffective, and thieves would not be able to utilize it, if you were to rub the threshold or other parts of the house by which they may enter with an [[unguent]] composed of the [[gall]] of a black cat, the fat of a white hen, and the blood of the [[screech-owl]]; this substance must be compounded during the dog-days}}

An actual Hand of Glory is kept at the [[Whitby Museum]] in [[North Yorkshire]], England, together with a text published in a book from 1823.&lt;ref name=Whitby&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbymuseum.org.uk/collections/hogg.htm |work=Whitby Museum Miscellany |date=15 September 2011 |title=Hand of Glory |publisher=Whitby Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manuscript text, the way to make the Hand of Glory is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=455–456 |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Stephen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC|isbn=9780192100191 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |title=A Dictionary of English Folklore |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It must be cut from the body of a criminal on the gibbet; pickled in salt, and the urine of man, woman, dog, horse and mare; smoked with herbs and hay for a month; hung on an oak tree for three nights running, then laid at a crossroads, then hung on a church door for one night while the maker keeps watch in the porch-"and if it be that no fear hath driven you forth from the porch ... then the hand be true won, and it be yours"}}

==Cultural references==

=== In comics ===
In [[Hellboy]]'s ''Box Full of Evil'' story and ''Being Human'' story, a Hand of Glory is used to paralyze everyone except the holder of the hand.

In ''[[The Invisibles]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] large parts of the plot surround attempts from both the Invisibles and the Outer Church to obtain, and find out how to control, a Hand of Glory. In the comic, it is seen has having the propensity to open doors in timespace - i.e. open gates to other worlds and ages.

In ''[[Black Magick]]'' by [[Greg Ruka]], a hand of glory is crafted from the corpse of a hanged rapist and murderer, Bruce Dunridge. The body was found washed on shore, missing his sinister hand.

=== In crime ===
A Hand of Glory was proposed as one of the motives for an unsolved murder that occurred in wartime England some time in mid-late 1941. The case was made more mysterious by numerous graffiti that appeared later stating "''[[Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?]]"'', referring to the woman's corpse which was found inside a tree.

===In literature===
Severed hands in an occult context occur as early as [[Herodotus]]'s "Tale of [[Rhampsinit|Rhampsinitus]]" (ii, 121), in which a clever thief leaves a dead hand behind in order to avoid capture. They also appear in early stories of [[lycanthropy]], such as [[Henry Boguet]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Discours exécrable de sorciers}}'' in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/sel.2004.0023 |last=Tricomi |first=Albert H. |year=2004 |title=The Severed Hand in Webster's 'Duchess of Malfi' |journal=Studies in English Literature 1500–1900 |volume=44 |issue=Spring, Tudor and Stuart Drama |pages=347–358 |publisher=Rice University |jstor=3844634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Schwob]] wrote an uncollected short story about it: "{{lang|fr|La Main de gloire}}" ("The Hand of Glory"), which was published in ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Écho de Paris]]}}'' in March 11, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=De Meyer, Bernard |title=Marcel Schwob, conteur de l'imaginaire |publisher=Peter Lang |page=127 |year=2004 |isbn=3039103687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/revue_romane/article/view/12148/23131 |title=La main coupée.» ou la forme d'un récit bref chez Nerval, Maupassant et Schwob |trans-title=The Hand of Glory, the Structure of Short Stories by Neval, Maupassant and Schwob |last=Hillen |first=Sabine Madeleine |journal=Revue Romane |year=1994 |volume=29 |issue=1 |language=French |quote=During the nineteenth century, the image of the severed hand stimulated the production of several short fantasy stories.

P. Lovecraft]] in February 1924. Commissioned by ''[[Weird Tales]]'' founder and owner [[J. C. Henneberger]], the narrative tells a fictionalized account in the first-person perspective of an allegedly true experience of escape artist [[Harry Houdini]]. Set in 1910, in Egypt, Houdini finds himself kidnapped by a tour guide, who resembles an ancient pharaoh, and thrown down a deep hole near the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]. While attempting to find his way out, he stumbles upon a gigantic ceremonial cavern and encounters the real-life deity that inspired the building of the Sphinx.

Lovecraft accepted the job because of the money he was offered in advance by Henneberg. The result was published in the May–June–July 1924 edition of ''Weird Tales'', although it was credited solely to Houdini until the 1939 reprint. Despite Lovecraft's use of artistic license, Houdini enjoyed the tale and the two men collaborated on several smaller projects prior to the latter's death in 1926. "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" has been suggested as an early influence on author [[Robert Bloch]] and as anticipating the cosmic themes in Lovecraft's later work, including "[[The Shunned House]]".

==Synopsis==
Told from the [[first-person narrative|first-person perspective]] of [[escapology|escape artist]] [[Harry Houdini]], "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" is a fictionalized account of an encounter that he claims to have experienced while on vacation in [[Egypt]] in January 1910. Enlisting the services of a guide named Abdul Reis el Drogman, Houdini is taken on a tour of [[Cairo]] and eventually forced to break up a conflict between his guide and a [[Bedouin]] leader by the name of Ali Ziz. Drogman enlists Houdini to help him settle the fight by way of a "custom of great antiquity in Cairo":&lt;ref name="Unabridged"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Lovecraft|first = H. P.|authorlink = H. P. Lovecraft|title = H. P. Lovecraft: Complete and Unabridged|publisher = [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]|year = 2008|location = [[New York City]]|pages = 1098|isbn = 978-1-4351-0793-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; a boxing match atop the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. Houdini soon discovers, however, that the entire argument was merely a ruse designed to lure him into the desert at night and kidnap him. The escape artist is tied up, taken to an unknown location, and dropped down a deep pit.&lt;ref name="Unabridged"/&gt;

After dreaming of spectacular horrors, Houdini awakens at the bottom of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal [[Mummy (monster)|mummies]], led by the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s [[Khafra|Khephren]] and [[Nitocris|Nitokris]], leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.&lt;ref name="Unabridged"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Harry Houdini head.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Harry Houdini was pleased with the result of Lovecraft's work and collaborated on several other projects with him prior to Houdini's death in 1926.]]
Facing financial problems, [[J. C. Henneberger]], the founder and owner of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', wanted to associate the popular Harry Houdini with the magazine in order to boost its readership. Following the introduction of an "Ask Houdini" column, as well as the publication of two short stories allegedly written by the escape artist, Henneberger sought out Lovecraft in February 1924 and commissioned him to write the tale of a supposedly true experience that Houdini had had in Egypt. Lovecraft was paid $100 (approximately ${{Inflation|US|100|1924}} in present-day terms) to [[ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] the story,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Joshi|first = S.

This was a major factor in motivating him to take the job&lt;ref name="Dream"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Tyson|first = Donald|title = The Dream World of H. P.

After receiving clearance from the editor, he began his writing by spending considerable time researching the setting in books issued by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] as well as by frequently visiting the museum's Egyptian exhibits.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Lovecraft completed "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" in February 1924 but lost his original typescript of the story at [[Union Station (Providence)|Union Station]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] when he was on his way to [[New York City|New York]] to get married. He was forced to spend much of his honeymoon in [[Philadelphia]] retyping the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Horizon"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Schweitzer|first = Darrell|authorlink = Darrell Schweitzer|title = The Fantastic Horizon: Essays and Reviews|publisher = [[Wildside Press]]|year = 2009|location = [[Rockville, Maryland]]|pages = 240|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HG-vjhQqE_cC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22Under+the+Pyramids%22+Lovecraft&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C22PTbzSDoK2tgf9xKzDDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Under%20the%20Pyramids%22%20Lovecraft&amp;f=false|isbn = 1-4344-0320-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work's original title, "Under the Pyramids", is known only from the lost and found advertisement that he placed in ''[[The Providence Journal]]''. The tale was printed in the May–June–July 1924 edition of ''Weird Tales'' as "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" and without credit to Lovecraft in the byline, as Henneberger thought that this would confuse the readers, as the narrative was told entirely from Houdini's first-person perspective. Lovecraft would later receive credit in the editor's note of the 1939 reprint.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" became a popular story and was received favorably by Houdini. The escape artist was so impressed that, until his death, he continued offering the writer jobs and ghostwriting opportunities. Among them was an article criticizing [[astrology]] (for which he was paid $75 &amp;ndash; approximately ${{Inflation|US|75|1924}} in present-day terms)&lt;ref name="Dream"/&gt; and a book entitled ''The Cancer of Superstition'', of which Lovecraft had completed an outline and some introductory pages prior to Houdini's 1926 death. To thank the author for his work, Houdini gave Lovecraft a signed copy of his 1924 book ''A Magician Among the Spirits''.&lt;ref name="Necronomicon"/&gt; Lovecraft scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] praised the tale, calling it "surprisingly effective and suspenseful, with a genuinely surprising ending".&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; Science fiction and fantasy author, editor, and critic [[Lin Carter]], in his 1972 work ''[[Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos]]'', refers to the story as "one of the best things Lovecraft had written up to that time".&lt;ref name="Mythos"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Carter|first = Lin|authorlink = Lin Carter|title = [[Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos]]|publisher = [[Panther Books]]|year = 1975|pages = 189|isbn = 0-586-04166-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" has been cited as an early influence on [[Robert Bloch]], which is particularly evident in his tale "Fane of the Black Pharaoh". Although Lovecraft himself refers to the real sphinx as a god of the dead, Bloch expanded upon the mythos and claimed that the sphinx in "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" was actually [[Nyarlathotep]], an [[Outer God]] and Lovecraft creation.&lt;ref name="Nyarlathotep"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Lovecraft|first = H. P.|authorlink = H. P. Lovecraft|author2=R. M.

In this tale, the protagonist digs into the cellar of the eponymous dwelling only to find that the thing he believed to be the monster of the tale is only the beast's elbow.&lt;ref name="Subtler"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Joshi|first = S.

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community.

The term ''black pill'' was first popularized on the blog Omega Virgin Revolt, where the term commended despondency in order to distinguish incels from the pickup artist communities.&lt;ref name="qz" /&gt; On the incel subreddit /r/braincels, "blackpills" are [[Internet meme|memes]] (usually images) that users share to describe a user's thoughts, many of which criticize women as egocentric, cruel, and shallow.&lt;ref name="Hosford"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/incel-3979342-Apr2018/|title=What is the 'incel rebellion'?

==Lexicology==
The term "involuntary celibate" (shortened to "incel") refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, a state they describe as ''inceldom''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; or ''incelibacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/incel-meaning-rebellion-alex-minassian-elliot-rodger-reddit.html|title=When a Mass Murderer Has a Cult Following|last=Futrelle|first=David|date=April 27, 2018|website=The Cut|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms, such as "love-shy" (describing those with [[social anxiety]] or excessive shyness preventing romantic success),&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Jennifer L.|last2=Rapee|first2=Ronald M.|date=2000|title=The Origins of Social Phobia|journal=[[Behavior Modification (journal)|Behavior Modification]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=102–129|doi=10.1177/0145445500241006|pmid=10641370}}&lt;/ref&gt; "FA" (short for "forever alone"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/05/04/loneliest-generation-social-media/581306002/|title=Andreatta: Feeling lonely?

In his journal writings, he had related with Elliot Rodger and other mass shooters, describing them as "people who stand with the gods".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Before the attack, when someone on an online message board had speculated he was "saving himself for someone special", Harper-Mercer had replied: "Involuntarily so."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/chris-harper-mercer-umpqua-community-college-shooting.html|title=Oregon Killer Described as Man of Few Words, Except on Topic of Guns|last=Healy|first=Jack|date=October 2, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|last2=Lovett|first2=Ian|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{Google books|y-MlDwAAQBAJ|page=|keywords=incel|text=involuntary celibacy|plainurl=yes}}|title=Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars From 4Chan And Tumblr To Trump And The Alt-Right|last=Nagle|first=Angela|date=June 7, 2017|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=9781785355448|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=In a 2016 essay 'The New Man of 4chan', I wrote an account of the racist and misogynist incel mass shooter Chris Harper Mercer...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/probe-in-college-slayings-peers-into-web-rants-and-possible-religious-rage/2015/10/02/d250007a-68ea-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html|title=Probe in college slayings peers into Web rants and possible religious rage|last=Shapiro|first=T.

On July 31, 2016, Sheldon Bentley robbed and killed an unconscious man in an alleyway in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]].

On December 7, 2017, William Atchison killed two people before killing himself in [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]], [[New Mexico]], in a [[Aztec High School shooting|shooting at Aztec High School]], where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym "Elliot Rodger" on several online forums, and praised "the supreme gentleman" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since been adopted as a moniker by incel communities).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|last=Hankes|first=Keegan|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|access-date=May 14, 2018|last2=Amend|first2=Alex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (who banned the /r/incels community in 2017 but has declined to ban another incel subreddit) and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; [[Cloudflare]], which provides services including [[DDoS mitigation|DDoS protection]] and [[Cache (computing)|caching]] so that webpages are still accessible when a site is offline, has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against [[downtime]] even when webhosts have terminated service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-cloudfare-online-content-protection_us_5b491632e4b022fdcc597327|title=From Nazis To Incels: How One Tech Company Helps Hate Groups Thrive|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 25, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its "breathless" coverage, normalizing incel communities by describing them as "sexually frustrated", and directing readers to incel communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/toronto-attack-incel-alek-minassian|title=After the Toronto attack don't explain Incel ideology, ban it|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporting has also been criticized for [[victim blaming]] by implying that women and peers who rejected the attackers held some responsibility for provoking the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/21/no-girls-and-women-dont-provoke-mass-murderers/|title=No, girls and women don't 'provoke' mass murderers|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=May 21, 2018|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44321469|title=The problem with mass shootings and the media|last=Cooper|first=Kelly-Leigh|date=May 31, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krip-Hop''' is a movement demonstrating alternate arrangements by which [[hip hop]] artists with disabilities can communicate through social media, including [[Education|educators]],  [[journalist]]s and conferences. The movement uses hip hop music as a means of expression for the disabled, providing them an opportunity to share their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choy|first1=Allie|date=February 12, 2012|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues|title=Krip-hop nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Not History}}History==
Krip Hop was founded by [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.]], an African American writer, [[poet]], community [[Activism|activist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] who was diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]]. Moore was born in New York in 1967 to an activist father loosely connected to the Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayabolition.com/2013/02/23/leroy-moore/|title=Interview with Leroy Moore |publisher=Everyday Abolition/Abolition Every Day |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing sensitized Moore to the challenges faced by African Americans and the disabled.&lt;ref name="amoeba"/&gt; As a youth, Moore discovered that most people had little knowledge of the historical impact of disabled African Americans. This led him to begin research, initially in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2008/07/jamoeblog/krip-hop-project-s-leroy-f-moore-on-being-black-disabled.html |title=Krip-Hop Project's Leroy F Moore On Being Black &amp; Disabled |publisher=The Amoeblog |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore first spotlighted disabled hip hop artists in the early 2000s. He co-produced and co-hosted a three-part series on what he called "Krip Hop" for a Berkeley, California radio station. The "Krip Hop" series appeared on [[KPFA]]'s ''Pushing Limits'', which focuses on news, arts, and culture for the disabled community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hix |first=Lisa |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/performance/article.jsp?essid=43903 |title=Interview with Leroy Moore, Founder of Krip Hop Nation |publisher=KQED Public Media |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' popularity inspired Moore to create Krip Hop Nation for disabled musicians, since little cultural work or music by people with disabilities had been recognized.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; "The Krip-Hop movement really makes the pain of the people feel visible", Moore said. "It goes a lot deeper than what people can see."&lt;ref name="uwdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues#.UoBI-ZTF1mk |work=The Daily |publisher=University of Washington |author=Allie Choy |date=12 February 2012 |title=Krip-Hop Nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111040926/http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Krip Hop Nation==
The primary goal of Krip Hop Nation is to increase awareness in music and media outlets of the talents, history and rights of people with disabilities in the hip-hop industry. In an interview, Moore expressed the hope that by listening to his music the audience would understand the need to question authority and the information provided to them. He said he wanted his listeners to learn about their community and to become open to all people. Issues such as racism and sexism are commonly discussed, and Moore hoped that people would examine possible [[ableism]] in their attitudes.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt; According to Moore, Krip Hop Nation goes beyond producing music and the [[bling-bling]] associated with hip hop; the movement is about advocacy, education and overcoming oppression. For Moore the movement has sought to reclaim negative terms associated with the disabled (such as "crazy", "lame", "retarded" and "cripple"), using them to shock people into understanding and respecting the disabled African American community.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt; Krip Hop Nation addresses discrimination against disabled artists in hip hop by publishing articles and hosting events, lectures and workshops. It has over 300 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is self-published.|date=March 2015}}

Moore has explained that "Krip Hop" is a play on "Hip Hop." Although the "Krip" part of the name refers to "crippled", it is spelled with a "k" to avoid association with the [[Crips]].&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Krip Hop Nation has released two mixtape CDs, held conferences with the PeaceOut HomoHop organization at UC Berkeley and New York University, organized and hosted a six-artist performance in Sacramento, California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 2011 End of the Year Accomplishments.] Accessed 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; staged a show at Disability and Deaf Arts (DADA) in [[Liverpool]] and hosted a Krip Hop Nation conference in Atlanta, Georgia for [[Black History Month]] in 2011 featuring musicians, writers and activists.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

In February 2012, DJ Quad of 5th Battalion joined Krip Hop Nation to co-produce a CD with 17 disabled artists from the UK, the US and Germany on police brutality and profiling. Among the collaborators was Emmitt Thrower of Artist Magnet. The documentary was scheuled for release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leroy |url=http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 |title=Krip-Hop Nation End of the Year Accomplishments 2012 |publisher=POOR Magazine/Prensa POBRE |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable musicians==
Krip Hop Nation includes artists such as Counterclockwise, Preach-man, Wheelchair Sports Camp, Miss Money and Fezo.&lt;ref name="wheres-lulu"/&gt; [[Kalyn Heffernan]] is a rapper from [[Denver]], Colorado. With [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]], Heffernan is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|cm}} tall and uses a wheelchair. She heads Wheelchair Sports Camp, an experimental hip-hop group with jazz and avant-garde influences.

The '''Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion''' was a television signal hijacking occurring in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, on the evening of November 22, 1987, involving at least two unknown individuals. It is an example of what is known in the television business as [[broadcast signal intrusion]]. Two [[Chicago]] television stations had their broadcast signals hijacked by an unknown person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses. A homemade Max Headroom background rocked back and forth in the background.

The intruder was successful in interrupting two broadcast [[television station]]s within the course of three hours. The first incident took place for 25 seconds during the sportscast on the 9:00 PM news on [[WGN-TV]] Channel 9, and the second, two hours later, after 11:00 PM on [[PBS]] affiliate [[WTTW]] Channel 11 for about 90 seconds during a broadcast of an episode of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]''.

The second pirate broadcast, which lasted 90 seconds and pre-recorded on videotape, featured the individual parodying WGN and television in general. The hacker rambled on making reference to Headroom's endorsement of Coke, the series ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and WGN anchor [[Chuck Swirsky]], then pretended to defecate as a "masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds", a reference to WGN's call letters ("[[WGN-TV#History|World's Greatest Newspaper]]"). The video ended with the hacker’s exposed buttocks being spanked with a flyswatter by an accomplice before normal programming resumed.

The incident made national headlines&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | title = Bogus 'Max Headroom' Interrupts Broadcasts On 2 Chicago Stations | newspaper = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | publisher = Inquirer Wire Services | via = philly-archives | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160626221203/http://articles.philly.com/1987-11-24/news/26174863_1_max-headroom-video-pirate-broadcasts | archivedate = June 26, 2016 | dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people responsible have never been identified.

==Signal intrusion==
===WGN-TV===
The first occurrence of the signal intrusion took place during [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9)'s live telecast of its primetime newscast, ''The Nine O'Clock News'' (now known as ''WGN News at Nine''). During highlights from the [[Chicago Bears]]' 30–10 home victory over the [[Detroit Lions]] that afternoon in the sports report, the screen went black for 15 seconds, then returned with a person wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask and sunglasses,&lt;ref name="interruptedtothemax"&gt;{{cite news | first = Don | last = Hayner | title = 2 channels interrupted to the Max | newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | id = CHI265386 | page = 3 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3857222.html | subscription = yes | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; moving around and acting in a similar manner to Max Headroom. His head was in front of a sheet of moving corrugated metal, which imitated the electronic background effect used in the Max Headroom TV and movie appearances. There was no audio other than a buzzing noise and an oscillating sound. The hijack was stopped after engineers at WGN switched the [[frequency]] of their [[Studio/transmitter link|studio link]] to the [[John Hancock Center]] transmitter.&lt;ref name=jailroom&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Camper | first1 = John | last2 = Daley | first2 = Steve | url = http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/203310798/ | url-access = subscription | title = A powerful video prankster could become Max Jailroom | department = Chicagoland | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 21 | quote = Strutzel said an engineer quickly changed the frequency of the signal that was transmitting the news show to the Hancock building, thus breaking the lock established by the video pirate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident left sports anchor Dan Roan bemused, saying, "Well, if you're wondering what's happened, so am I", and that the computer running the news "took off and went wild", then repeating his report on the Bears' victory earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKnwhokvgxE|title=WGN Channel 9 – The Nine O'Clock News – "The 1st 'Max Headroom' Incident" (1987)|date=23 November 2017|publisher=[[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|via=YouTube|type=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTTW===
[[File:Max Headroom broadcast intrusion.webm|thumb|video of the WTTW signal intrusion]]
Later that night, around 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]], during a broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'', [[PBS]] member station [[WTTW]]'s signal was hijacked by the same person, apparently, who had broadcast the [[WGN-TV]] hijack, this time with distorted and crackling audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycVTXtm0U0|title=WTTW Chicago – The Max Headroom Pirating Incident (1987) – Original Upload
|date=30 October 2007|publisher=[[The Museum of Classic Chicago Television]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|via=YouTube|type=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was interrupted by television static, after which the unidentified man wearing the Max Headroom mask and sunglasses appeared, saying "That does it. He's a fricking nerd." He mentioned WGN sports pundit [[Chuck Swirsky]], whom he said he was "better than", going on to call Swirsky a "fricking [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]". The man started to moan, scream and laugh. He continued to laugh and utter various random phrases, including [[New Coke]]'s advertising slogan "Catch the Wave" while holding a [[Pepsi]] can (Max Headroom was a [[Coca-Cola]] spokesperson at the time), then tossed it out of sight, leaned towards the camera and presented [[the finger]] wearing a [[sex toy|rubber extension]] over his [[middle finger]], though the gesture was partially off-screen. The man then retrieved the Pepsi can, and sang "[[Lou Pride|Your love is fading]]", removed the rubber extension, and then began humming the theme song to ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', pausing to say "I still see the X" (often misheard as "I stole [[CBS]]"), which referred to the final episode of the series, before resuming humming again. He then began to moan painfully, exclaiming about his [[Hemorrhoid|piles]] (again, the muffled audio, or perhaps as a deliberate computer pun, makes it sound as if he is saying "files"), after which a flatulence sound was heard and he gyrated. He then stated that he had "made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds" (the WGN [[call letters]] used by the Chicago television station as well as its [[WGN (AM)|sister radio station]] are an acronym for "World's Greatest Newspaper", in reference to the flagship newspaper of their corporate parent, the [[Tribune Company]]'s ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''). He then held up a gardening [[glove]] and said, "My brother is wearing the other one." After putting the glove on, he continued, "But it's dirty! It's like you got bloodstains on it!" He then removed the glove and threw it away in disgust.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The picture suddenly cuts over to a shot of the man's lower torso. His [[buttocks]] were partly exposed, and he was holding the now-removed mask up to the camera with the rubber extension now placed in the mouth of the mask, howling, "They're coming to get me!" An unidentified accomplice wearing a [[French maid]] costume then told him to "bend over, bitch." The accomplice then started to [[spanking|spank]] the man with a [[flyswatter]] as the man screamed loudly, shouting "Oh, do it!" part way. The transmission then blacked out for a few seconds before resuming the ''Doctor Who'' episode in progress; the hijack lasted for about 90 seconds.&lt;ref name="remember"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160515162926/http://www.damninteresting.com/remember-remember-the-22nd-of-november/ | dead-url = no | archive-date = May 15, 2016 | title = Remember, Remember the 22nd of November | first = Alan | last = Bellows | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | date = November 22, 2016 | publication-date = January 9, 2007 | publisher = Damn Interesting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WTTW, which maintained its transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]], found that its engineers were unable to stop the hijacker due to the fact that there were no engineers on duty at the Sears Tower at the time of the hijacking. According to station spokesman Anders Yocom, technicians monitoring the transmission from WTTW headquarters "attempted to take corrective measures, but couldn't".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/306943044.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+24%2C+1987&amp;author=Carmody%2C+John&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=d.01&amp;desc=NBC+Lands+Gorbachev+Interview | first = John | last = Carmody | title = NBC Lands Gorbachev Interview | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | id = 95520 | page = D1 | date = November 24, 1987 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes | via = [[ProQuest#Archived newspapers|ProQuest Archiver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By the time our people began looking into what was going on, it was over," he told the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref name=jailroom/&gt; WTTW was able to find copies of the hijacker's telecast with the help of ''Doctor Who'' fans who had been taping the show.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Reaction==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
The Max Headroom incident made national headlines and was reported on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' the next day. WTTW received numerous phone calls from viewers who wondered what had occurred for the duration of the intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = The Associated Press | title = Bogus Max Headroom pirates 2 TV stations, drops his pants | newspaper = [[The Palm Beach Post]] | date = November 24, 1987 | page = 3A | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigating [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] engineer quoted at the time said the perpetrators of the intrusion faced a maximum $10,000 fine, up to a year in prison, or both.&lt;ref name="jailroom" /&gt;

Not long after the incident, [[WMAQ-TV]] humorously inserted clips of the hijacking into a newscast during [[Mark Giangreco]]'s sports highlights. "A lot of people thought it was real – the pirate cutting into our broadcast. We got all kinds of calls about it," said Giangreco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ruane | first = John | title = Casting final look at '87 // Local sportscasters recall year's memorable events | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3863222.html | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = January 1, 1988 | page = 94 | accessdate = June 26, 2016 | subscription = yes  | via = HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture''' ({{lang-hr|Ministarstvo kulture}}) is a ministry of the [[Croatian government]] in charge of preserving the country's [[Natural and Cultural Heritage of Croatia|natural and cultural heritage]] and overseeing its development. The ministry in its present form was created in 1994 in the [[Cabinet of Nikica Valentić]], as the culture portfolio had previously been part of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (1990–93) and the Ministry of Culture and Education (1993–94).

The '''Museum of Spirits''' ({{Lang-sv|Spritmuseum}}) is situated on the island of [[Djurgården]] in Stockholm, Sweden. The museum has permanent and temporary exhibitions related to the [[drinking culture]] of Sweden. The museum also functions as an art gallery, as it houses and displays the Absolut Art Collection.

The museum houses three exhibition venues, including the permanent, interactive exhibition Sweden: Spirits of a Nation (''Spritlandet Sverige'').

The Museum of Spirits was opened as the '''Wine &amp; Spirit Historical Museum''' in the [[Grönstedtska palace]], in [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastaden]], Stockholm, in 1967, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state-owned company [[AB Vin &amp; Sprit]].

In 2014, Petter Nisson, who had previously operated La Gazzetta (described by the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "one of the most celebrated creative neo-bistros in Paris"), opened a restaurant at the museum.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/travel/restaurant-report-museum-of-spirits-in-stockholm.html|title=Restaurant Report: Museum of Spirits in Stockholm|last=Cheses|first=Jay|date=April 8, 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nukak''' {{IPA-xx|nɨkâk|}} people (also '''Nukak-Makú''')  live between the [[Guaviare River|Guaviare]] and [[Inírida River|Inírida]] rivers, in the depths of the tropical humid forest, on the fringe of the Amazon basin, in [[Guaviare Department]], Republic of [[Colombia]]. They are nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s with seasonal nomadic patterns and in addition they practice a shifting horticulture in small scale. An "[[uncontacted people]]" until 1981,&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ideas-innovations/The-Lost-Tribes-of-the-Amazon-192124351.html|title=The Lost Tribes of the Amazon|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|date=March 2013|work=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have since lost half of their population, primarily to disease.&lt;ref name=ElMundo2006&gt;"[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/10/26/solidaridad/1161870184.html Se suicida un líder indígena, desesperado por la inminente extinción de su pueblo en Colombia]," ''El Mundo'', October 2006. [This appears to be a translated press release from Survival.]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of their territory has been used by coca growers, ranchers and other settlers and occupied by guerrillas, army and paramilitaries. Responses to this crisis include protests, requests for assimilation, and the suicide of leader Maw-be'.&lt;ref name=ElMundo2006 /&gt; Some 210–250 are estimated to live in provisional settlements at [[San José del Guaviare]], while about as many live nomadically in the Nukak Reservation (''Resguardo'').

Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt using blowguns, with darts coated with curare "manyi", a poison made from different plants ([[curare]]s). They specially hunt several species of monkeys (''[[Alouatta]]'' spp., ''[[Cebus]]'' spp., ''[[Saimiri]]'' sp., ''[[Lagothrix]]'' spp., ''[[Ateles]]'' sp., ''[[Saguinus]]'' spp., ''[[Callicebus torquatus]]''), and birds ([[Muscovy duck]], [[chachalaca]]s, [[guan]]s, [[curassow]]s, [[grey-winged trumpeter]] and [[toucan]]s). Also they use javelins of ''[[Socratea exorrhiza]]'' palm wood to hunt two species of [[peccary|peccaries]] (''[[Tayassu pecari]]'' and ''[[Tayassu tajacu|T. tajacu]]'') and [[spectacled caiman]]s, whose eggs they consume too. Nukak neither hunt nor eat [[brocket deer]],  ''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]'' and [[tapir]]s (''[[Brazilian tapir|Tapirus terrestris]]''); these animals are considered by them as part of the same group of origin as human beings.

The Nukak also capture [[rodent]]s (''[[Paca|Cuniculus]]'' sp., ''[[Dasyprocta]]'' spp.); [[armadillo]]s (''Dasypus'' sp.) [[tortoise]]s (''Geochelone'' sp); [[frog]]s (in large quantities); [[crab]]s; [[shrimp]]s; [[snail]]s; larvae of [[Rhynchophorini|palm weevils]] (mojojoy, "mun", ''[[Rhynchophorus]]'' spp.); larvae of several species of wasps and caterpillars.

== Fishing ==
The Nukak eat several species of fish, like ''[[Hoplias]]'' sp., ''[[Myloplus]]'' spp., ''[[Mylossoma]]'' spp., ''[[Hydrolycus]]'' sp., ''[[Cichla]]'' sp., [[surubí]] (''[[Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum]]''), [[catfish]]es (''Brachyplatystoma'' spp.),  [[piranha]]s (''Serrasalmus'' spp., ''Pygocentrus'' spp.) and [[Potamotrygonidae|river rays]] (''Potamotrygon'' sp.). Lately, part of this activity is done using cord and metal fishooks, although the Nukak, to this day, still catch their fish in the traditional way, with bow and arrow or harpoons, traps or baskets ("mei", water cages). They also use a very sophisticated technique that has been reported in several cultures. This technique uses ''nuún'', the root of a ''[[Lonchocarpus]]'' sp. that contains a number of substances that when dissolved in the water streams stun the fish, making them an easy catch for the Nukak.

They collect honey of twenty species of bees and many fruits: [[Arecaceae|palm]] fruits (''[[Jessenia bataua]]''), ''[[Oenocarpus]]'' spp., ''[[Attalea (plant)|Attalea]]'' spp., ''[[Mauritia]]'' sp., ''[[Phenakospermum guyannense]]'', ''[[Aechmea]]'' sp., ''[[Inga]]'' sp., ''[[Couma macrocarpa]]'', ''[[Iryanthera]]'' sp., ''[[Theobroma]]'' spp., ''[[Pourouma]]'' spp., ''[[Parinari]]'' sp., ''[[Micrandra]]'' sp., ''[[Helicostylis]]'' sp., ''[[Caryocar]]'' sp., ''[[Talisia]]'' sp., ''[[Hymenaea]]'' sp., ''[[Dacryodes]]'' spp., ''[[Abuta]]'' sp., ''[[Eugenia]]'' spp., ''Touraleia'' sp., ''Perebea'' spp., ''Protium'' sp., ''Cecropia'' sp., 'Batocarpus'' sp., ''Hyeronima'' sp., ''Brosimum'' sp., ''Dialium'' sp., ''Garcinia'' sp., ''Manilkara'' sp., ''Naucleopsis'' spp., ''Pradosia'' sp., ''Pouteria'' sp., ''Salasia'' sp., ''Passiflora'' spp., ''Duroia maguirei'', ''Duroia hirsuta'', ''Mouriri'' sp., ''Alibertia'' sp..

Nukak take the sweet resin from "mupabuat" (''Lacunal'' sp.) and the rattan water (''Doliocarpus'' sp.). They collect vegetal materials like the elements necessary to cover their encampments "wopyi" (with leaves of ''[[Phenakospermum guyannense]]'' and palms); to make their hammocks (with fiber of the cumare palm  ''Astrocaryum'' sp.), moorings (''Heteropsis tenuispadix'', ''Eschweilera'' sp., ''Anthurium'' sp.), blowguns (''[[Iriartella]] stigera'', ''Bactris maraja''), bows (''Duguetia quitarensis''), axe ends (''Aspidosperma'' sp.), darts (thorns of ''Oneocarpus'' sp.), quivers for the darts (leaves of ''Calathea'' sp.), milkweed to assure the darts (''Pachira nukakika'', ''Ceiba'' sp., ''Pseudobombax'' sp.), loinclothes for men (''Couratari guianensis''), baskets (''Heteropsis'' spp.), disposable bags (''Ischnosiphon arouma'', ''Heliconia'' sp.), soap (''Cedrelinga'' sp.), perfumes (''Myroxylon'' sp., ''Justice pectoralis'') and diverse objects.

They make blades with the teeth of piranha, but lately they also use metallic ones. Until 1990 they practised pottery in small scale, producing a small kind of pot to take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their key camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When they do not have matches or lighters, they use special wood (''Pausandra trianae'') to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of ''Trattinickia glaziovii'' nor stone axes like they did in past times.

== Social aspects ==
The [[marriage]], base of the domestic group, is settled after the man has formally courted the woman with accepted gifts and she has acceded to live with him. In order to look for a pairing, a man must have gone through an initiation [[ritual]] in which he endures several penalties and difficulties, to demonstrate the fundamental abilities for the subsistence and consumes a [[hallucinogen]] (''[[Virola]]'' sp.).

The most suitable couple is one made up by crossed cousins. Parallel cousins marriage is forbidden, that being the reason why each man looks for a suitable woman in groups where his maternal sisters and aunts are married and therefore the unmarried are eligible. If the woman still lives in the home of the father, the gifts must include him. If the woman accepts, she settles down in the encampment of the man and if they have a child then they are considered a formal pair, which establishes mutual relations of [[kinship]], expressed in rights and duties of reciprocity.

A man can marry several wives, although a single wife is most common, and examples of three or more are rare. This [[polygyny]] coexists with a temporal [[polyandry]] during the pregnancy in order to improve the qualities of the baby.

Each domestic group is part of a territorial group and other groups that are established to perform specific duties like security measures, according to the different stations and situations. On the other hand, each Núkâk is considered as part of a paternal lineage, "nüwayi", named with an animal or plant.

Ten territorial Nukak groups have been identified, at least each one with 50 or 60 people, who most of the year do not remain together but form different groups for harvesting and/or hunting that are distributed in accordance with the climatic seasonal changes and the security situation. In certain special occasions different groups join, after they practice a special ritual, "entiwat", in which the groups dance face to face, striking and verbally injuring each other until the ritual reaches a climatic moment in which they all embrace, weeping while they remember their ancestors and express affection. The groups practice a form of exchange, "ihinihat", especially when all the resources are not in the same territory.

It is considered taboo for the Nukak to discuss dead people.

== Language ==
{{main|Nukak language}}
Nukak people speak a tonal [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup]] language.

== Endangered people ==
The Nukak have already suffered the devastation of their population by [[malaria]], [[measles]] and [[flu|pulmonary diseases]] since their contact with the [[New Tribes Mission]] and other outsiders beginning in 1981;&lt;ref name="hammer" /&gt; now, [[coca]] growers, left-wing [[FARC]] [[guerillas]], right-wing [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] [[paramilitaries]] and the Colombian army have occupied their lands. These aboriginals have therefore become embroiled in Colombia's armed conflict. In 2006, a group of nearly 80 Nukak left the jungle and sought assimilation along with cultural preservation. As one of the migrants, Pia-pe, put it: "We do want to join the white family, but we do not want to forget words of the Nukak."&lt;ref name=NYT2006&gt;Juan Forero, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/11/world/americas/11colombia.html?hp&amp;ex=1147406400&amp;en=fe910ad8020ef2d4&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage Leaving the Wild, and Rather Liking the Change]," ''[[New York Times]]'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, leader and Nukak Spanish speaker Maw-be' committed suicide by drinking poison; friends and the [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia]] (ONIC) described him as in desperation in his inability to secure supplies or a safe return to their homeland for the Nukak.&lt;ref name=ElMundo2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DARCY CROWE, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/colombia_nomads_in_distress Nomadic tribe struggles in Colombia], Associated Press, October 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Niall Ferguson]] cites them as an example of a hunter-gathering tribe which, hitherto ignorant of a money economy, has shown itself happy to exchange an arduous traditional life in their jungle homelands for a subsistence existence based on government handouts at the periphery of a globalized world of finance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]], ''The Ascent of Money: A Financial history of the world,'' (2008) Penguin Books, 2009 p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Patriotic Oath''' ({{lang-fil|Panatang Makabayan}}) is one of two national pledges of the [[Philippines]], the other being the [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag]] ({{lang-fil|Panunumpa ng Katapatan sa Watawat}}). It is commonly recited in schools during morning [[Flag-raising ceremony#Hoisting the flag|flag ceremony]] after the ''[[Lupang Hinirang]]'' is sung but before recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.

==Custom==
Recitation of the ''Panatà'' is required by law at all public and private educational institutions meant for Filipinos or containing a majority of Filipino nationals. This guideline was set in [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 1265, one of many national symbols laws, which was approved on 11 July 1955.&lt;ref name="ra1265"&gt;
{{cite web

|date=11 June 1955
|publisher=RP Government
|accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was implemented in schools through Department Order No. 8 of what is now the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], which was approved on 21 July 1955. The ''Panatà'' was revised in November 2001 by then Secretary of Education [[Raul Roco]], using shorter lines in less formal [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

Although Department Order No. 8 states that the ''Panatà'' may be recited in [[English in the Philippines|English]] or any [[Philippine languages|Philippine language]], the ''Panatà'' is usually recited today in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], of which two versions exist: the current text is a shorter, poetic (poetic meaning it's created under Roco's image or ideals, not the ideal of all) rendering of the English original, while the older version is a more direct translation.

==1993 JW students controversy==
In 1993, sixty-eight students from the sect [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (JW) were expelled from a school in Cebu for their failure to salute the flag, sing the Philippine National Anthem, and recite the patriotic oath. A teacher in the same school, also a JW adherent was fired from her job for the same offense. According to JW teachings, flag ceremonies, flag salutes, and patriotic oaths are viewed as acts of worship or religious devotion, the latter two of which they believe can only be rendered to God alone and not anyone nor anything. The JW's consider the flag an image and honoring the flag idolatry.

The case was brought to court wherein the Cebu Division Superintendent argued that the students and the teacher violated Republic Act No. 1265, the law that makes flag ceremony compulsory for all schools, citing the case of Gerona et al v. Secretary of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1959/aug1959/gr_l-13954_1959.html|title=Philippine High Court ruling in Genaro Gerona, et al. vs The Honorable Secretary of Education, et al.|date=August 12, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superintendent also argued of separation of church and state, stating the flag is devoid of religious significance and does not involve any religious ceremony, and that giving JW's right to exemption disrupt school discipline and demoralize the rest of the school population which by far constitutes the great majority.

The Court ruled in favor of the expelled JW students and the fired JW teacher, on the grounds that expulsion due to religious beliefs is invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1993/mar1993/gr_95770_1993.html|title=RP Supreme Court ruling in Roel Ebralinag, et al. vs Superintendent of Schools of Cebu|date=March 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated of [[Freedom of religion in the Philippines|freedom of religion]] in the [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines]]:

{{quote|Religious freedom is a fundamental right which is entitled to the highest priority and the amplest protection among human rights, for it involves the relationship of man to his Creator. [...] The right to religious profession and worship has a two-fold aspect, vis., freedom to believe and freedom to act on one’s belief. The first is absolute as long as the belief is confined within the realm of thought. The second is subject to regulation where the belief is translated into external acts that affect the public welfare. [...] The sole justification for a prior restraint or limitation on the exercise of religious freedom [...] is the existence of a grave and present danger of a character both grave and imminent, of a serious evil to public safety, public morals, public health or any other legitimate public interest, that the State has a right (and duty) to prevent.}}

Evidence also showed that even if they do not take part in the compulsory flag ceremony, they never engaged in “external acts” or behavior that would offend the people who believe in expressing their love of country through the observance of the flag ceremony. The expelled only quietly stood at attention during the flag ceremony to show their respect for the right of those who choose to participate in the solemn proceedings. 

The students were later allowed to re-enroll in the school they were expelled from and the teacher was allowed to resume her duties.

Peng’s Coefficient is an economic term which refers to the proportion of an individual’s spending on culture- and spirit-related products or services, such as books, movie, [[opera]], concert, travelling, training and so forth, to her/his total expenditure. Peng’s Coefficient is inversely proportional to Engel’s [[Coefficient]], because the more proportion people spend on food, the less proportion on culture and spirit.
The concept was named after its creator Peng Bing from China.


Equation: P=S/T
(P refers to Peng’s Coeffient, S refers to culture and spirit-related spending, T refers to total expenditure)

'''''Persona 4'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Persona 4'''''|ペルソナ4|Perusona Fō}}}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Atlus]] for [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], and chronologically the fifth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, itself a part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. The game was released in Japan in July 2008, North America in December 2008, and Europe in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;2014-04-01, [http://gematsu.com/2014/04/persona-4-coming-to-ps3-via-ps2-classics Persona 4 coming to PS3 via PS2 Classics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403203151/http://gematsu.com/2014/04/persona-4-coming-to-ps3-via-ps2-classics |date=April 3, 2014 }}, Gematsu&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persona 4'' takes place in a fictional Japanese countryside and is indirectly related to earlier ''Persona'' games. [[Yu Narukami|The player-named protagonist]] is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year. During his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders while harnessing the power of summoning Persona. The game features a weather forecast system with events happening on foggy days to replace the moon phase system implemented in the previous games.

The plot of ''Persona 4'' was inspired by the work of mystery novelists owing to its murder mystery premise. The rural setting was based on a town on the outskirts of [[Mount Fuji]] and intended as a "'nowhere' place" and is the central setting to have players sympathize with the daily life of the characters. The developers added many in-game events to prevent the game from becoming stale. During the localization, numerous alterations to names and cultural references were made to preserve the effect through translation, but some Japanese cultural references were altered or removed. The release of the game in Japan was accompanied by merchandise such as character costumes and accessories. The North American package of the game was released with a CD with selected music from the game, and, unlike ''[[Persona 3]]'', the European package also contained a soundtrack CD. The game's score was primarily composed by [[Shoji Meguro]], with vocals performed by Shihoko Hirata.

The game was positively received by critics and developed into a full franchise. An enhanced version of the game for the [[PlayStation Vita]], '''''Persona 4 Golden''''', was released in 2012. Various other [[manga]] and [[light novel]] adaptations and spin-offs have been produced. An [[anime]] television adaptation by [[Anime International Company|AIC ASTA]], titled ''[[Persona 4: The Animation]]'', began airing in Japan in October 2011, with an anime adaptation of ''Persona 4 Golden'' airing in July 2014. The game has also spawned two [[fighting game]] sequels, ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' and ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]'', and a [[rhythm game]], ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]''.

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Persona 3#Gameplay||l1=Gameplay of Persona 3}}
[[File:P4BattleScreen.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A standard battle in ''Persona 4''. Certain actions such as a successful attack will prompt a dialogue box on top. Players navigate between battle options listed in the box on the bottom-left of the screen, while the character portraits on the right hand of the screen indicates each member's health and magic points.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt;]]

''Persona 4'' blends traditional [[role-playing video game|RPG]] gameplay with [[Simulation video game|simulation]] elements. The player controls the game's protagonist, a teenage boy who is named by the player, who comes to the town of Inaba for a year.&lt;ref name="gs-review" /&gt; Gameplay is divided between the real world of Inaba, where the protagonist carries out his daily life, and the mysterious "TV World", where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await. With the exception of scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, players can choose to spend their day how they like, be it participating in various real world activities, such as joining school clubs, taking part-time jobs, or reading books, or exploring the TV World's dungeons to gain experience and items.&lt;ref name="gs-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xplay" /&gt; Days are broken up into various times of day, the most frequently recurring being "After School/Daytime" and "Evening", with most activities causing time to move on. Certain activities are limited depending on the time of day, days of the week, and the weather, with most evening activities unavailable if the player visits the TV World that day. Furthermore, some activities and dialogue choices may be limited by the protagonist's five attributes; Understanding, Diligence, Courage, Knowledge, and Expression, which can be increased by performing certain activities that build them.&lt;ref name=manual&gt;{{cite book |title=''Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4'' North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |page=5-28 (5-7, 10-11, 14-15, 19, 23, 25, 28) |id=SLUS-21782B |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Whilst the player is free to choose how to spend their time, if they fail to rescue someone who is trapped in the TV World by the time fog appears in town, which takes place after several days of consecutive rain, that person will get killed by the shadows and the game will end, forcing the player to return to a week prior.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt; As the game progresses, the protagonist forms friendships with other characters known as "Social Links", which are each represented by one of the [[Major Arcana]]. As these bonds strengthen, the Social Links increase in Rank, which grant bonuses when creating new Personas in the Velvet Room. Additionally, strengthening Social Links with the main party members grant them additional abilities, such as the ability to perform a follow-up attack or an additional ability for their Persona.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt;

===Personas===
The main focus of the game revolves around Personas, avatars projected from one's inner self that resemble mythological figures and represent the façades worn by individuals to face life's hardships. Each Persona possesses its own skills, as well as strengths and weaknesses to certain attributes. As Personas gain experience from battle and level up, that Persona can learn new skills, which include offensive or support abilities used in battle, or passive skills that grant the character benefits. Each Persona can carry up to eight skills at a time, with older skills needing to be forgotten in order to learn new ones. Whilst each of the main party members have their own unique Persona, which transforms into a stronger form after maxing out their Social Link, the protagonist has the "Wild Card" ability to wield multiple Personas, which he can switch between during battle to access different movesets. The player can earn new Personas from Shuffle Time, with the protagonist able to carry more Personas as he levels up.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt; Outside of the dungeons, the player can visit the Velvet Room, where players can create new Personas, or summon previously acquired Personas for a fee. New Personas are created by fusing two or more monsters to create a new one, which receives some of the skills passed down from its material monsters. The level of Personas that can be created are limited by the protagonist's current level. If the player has built up a Social Link relating to a particular Arcana, then a Persona relating to that Arcana will receive a bonus upon creation.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt;&lt;ref name="gs-review" /&gt;

===Combat===
Inside the TV World, the player assembles a party, consisting of the protagonist and up to three other characters, to explore randomly generated dungeons, each tailored around a victim who had been kidnapped. On each floor of a dungeon, the player may find roaming Shadows, as well as treasure chests containing items and equipment. Players progress through the dungeon by finding the stairs somewhere on each floor to progress to the next, eventually reaching the final floor where a boss enemy awaits.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt; The player enters battle upon coming into contact with a Shadow. The player can gain an advantage by attacking the Shadow from behind, whilst being attacked from behind themselves will give the enemy an advantage. Similar to the ''Press Turn'' system used in other ''[[Shin Megami Tensei]]'' games, battles are turn-based with characters fighting enemies using their equipped weapons, items, or the special skills of their Personas. Aside from the protagonist, who is controlled directly, the other characters can either be given direct commands or be assigned 'Tactics' which alter their battle AI. If the protagonist loses all of his HP, the game ends, returning players to the title screen.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt;

Offensive abilities carry several attributes, including Physical, Fire, Ice, Wind, Electricity, Light,  Dark and Almighty. As well as various enemies carrying different attributes, player characters may also have strengths or weaknesses against certain attacks depending on their Persona or equipment. By exploiting an enemy's weakness or performing a critical attack, the player can knock them over, granting the attacking character an additional move, whilst the enemy may also be granted an additional move if they target a player character's weakness. If the player knocks all of the enemies down, they may be granted the opportunity to perform an "All-Out Attack", in which all the players rush the downed enemies to inflict heavy damage.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt; Following a battle, players gain experience points, money, and items from their battle. Sometimes after a battle, the player may participate in a mini-game known as "Shuffle: Time" and "Arcana Chance", which can grant player new Personas or various bonuses respectively.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt;

{{Main|List of Persona 4 characters}}
''Persona 4'' takes place in the fictional, rural Japanese town of {{nihongo|Inaba|稲葉市|Inaba-shi}}, which lies among [[floodplain]]s and has its own high school and shopping districts. Unexplained murders have taken place in the small town, where bodies are found dangling from television antennas and their cause of death being unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level= |quote='''Dojima:''' We haven't found the cause of death for the first vic[tim], and now we've found a second one just like it…}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rumor has begun to spread that watching a switched-off television set on rainy midnights will reveal a person's soulmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Junes - Food Court |quote='''Chie:''' You're supposed to look into a TV that's switched off, alone, exactly at midnight on a rainy night.

The protagonist is a high school student, named Yu Narukami in later media, who has recently moved from the city to attend school at Inaba. At school, he quickly becomes friends with Yosuke Hanamura, the somewhat-clumsy son of the manager of the local Junes megastore; Chie Satonaka, an energetic girl with a strong interest in martial arts; and Yukiko Amagi, a calm and refined girl who helps out at her family's inn.&lt;ref name=manual /&gt; A few days into the game, the protagonist, Yosuke, and Chie follow the "Midnight Channel" rumor, which leads them to discover the TV World and meet Teddie, a friendly creature that appears as a hollow bear costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=TV World |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Personas, the students form an Investigation Team to investigate the connection between the TV world and the murders, and possibly capture the culprit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Inaba - Yasogami High School Rooftop |quote='''Yosuke:''' This guy and me are gonna catch the culprit ourselves!

===Story===
On April 11, 2011, the protagonist arrives in Inaba to live with the Dojimas, consisting of his uncle Ryotaro and his cousin Nanako, for one year, as his parents are working abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Dojima residence |quote='''Dojima''': I guess until your parents get back next year, you're part of this household.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just after his arrival, a TV announcer is found dead, her body hanging from an [[television antenna|antenna]]; Saki Konishi, the high school student who had discovered the body, is later found dead herself, hung upside-down from a telephone pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Yasogami High School - Ground Floor |quote='''Rumor-loving girl''': She died the same way as the announcer, right?

Then, you'd be dooooomed… Got it!? / '''Yosuke''': Well, pretty much. Now can you show us the way out? / '''Teddie''': Roger that! One exit comin' right up!}}&lt;/ref&gt; They awaken their Persona abilities, realizing that the murders stem from attacks by Shadows, beings native to the TV world created from repressed emotions, and are able to rescue several would-be victims. Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, and Teddie one by one come to accept the parts of their psyches they rejected, which manifest as giant Shadows in the TV world, allowing them to wield Personas whilst each joins the group in turn. Mitsuo Kubo, a student from another high school who disappears following the death of Kinshiro Morooka, the protagonist's foul-mouthed homeroom teacher, claims credit for the murders; it is eventually learned that Kubo only killed Morooka and played no part in the other murders, having murdered Morooka simply to gain credit for the other murders.&lt;ref name="broken pattern"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Junes - Food Court |quote='''Naoto''': Mitsuo Kubo's only victim was Mr. Morooka.

Events come to a head when Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being involved in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Dojima residence |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer.&lt;ref name="on the warnings"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Inaba - Junes Food Court |quote='''Rise''': Isn't that kinda odd?

If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.

The protagonist confronts the [[filling station|gas station]] attendant encountered at the start of the game, who reveals herself to be the Japanese goddess [[Izanami]], the "conductor" behind the game's events. The cause of the recurring fog is established as an attempt to create a world of illusion by merging the TV world with the human world, all for the "sake" of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=December 9, 2008 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] |level=Inaba - Shopping District |quote='''Yosuke''': You're saying this so-called Izanami is the conductor, and she's waiting for us in the other world?

====''Persona 4 Golden''====
''Persona 4 Golden'' adds two new Social Links to the game; Adachi and [[List of Persona 4 characters#Marie|Marie]], a mysterious girl who becomes an assistant in the Velvet Room and wishes to uncover her lost memories.

If the player advances Adachi's Social Link to a certain level, they are given the choice to withhold his identity as the killer from the rest of the Investigation Team, thus leaving the mystery unsolved. On the protagonist's final day in Inaba, he may choose to visit Adachi and destroy a crucial piece of evidence related to the case. Adachi then blackmails the protagonist, threatening to have him arrested for destroying evidence if he does not answer his calls. The game's ending then plays out the same, after the credits, the protagonist passes by Adachi at a level crossing. He clutches his phone in his hand as a smirk forms on Adachi's face.

After the Investigation Team defeats Ameno-sagiri, Marie disappears from the Velvet Room, and Margaret promises to find her for the protagonist. The Investigation Team decide to take a skiing trip together, during which time they stumble upon a cabin with a TV inside. The TV turns out to be a portal to the Hollow Forest, where Marie has fled to. With the Hollow Forest on the verge of collapsing, the Investigation Team rushes to save her; if they fail to do so, Marie disappears from their memories. They find Marie, who reveals that she is Kusumi-no-Okami, created to act as a spy for Ameno-sagiri in order to learn what humanity wished for; with Ameno-sagiri defeated, the fog has now been absorbed into her body. Marie's plan is to kill herself so that the fog will not spread over the world again, but the Investigation Team refuses to allow her to die, defeating her and freeing her from the fog's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Persona 4 Golden|developer=[[Atlus]]|publisher=Atlus|date=November 20, 2012|platform=[[PlayStation Vita]]|version=|scene=|level=Mountain Cabin|quote='''Yosuke''': Still, that ''was'' a surprise.

If you tried to introduce her like, "Oh, she's from another world," the "?" above my head could be seen from ''orbit.'' / '''Naoto''': The issue here is Marie-san's motive. Why would she risk her life to shut herself in a place like that? ''[…]'' / '''Protagonist''': Her memory is the key. / '''Kanji''': Yeah, [Margaret] did say Marie lost her memory. / '''Naoto''': Maybe she remembered something that made her do that. / '''Chie''': …Hey, I just thought of something.

She's erasing her own existence…!? / '''Teddie''': I think… Emmy-chan's like me. ''[…]'' I don't think Emmy-chan's a Shadow, but I think she feels the same way I did: that she…"shouldn't exist".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating Izanami-no-Okami, Marie reveals that she is actually Izanami-no-Mikoto, a goddess who originally wished to both protect humanity and grant it's wishes, but as people changed and stopped wishing for truth, her wishes splintered into her and Izanami-no-Okami. With Kunino-sagiri, Ameno-sagiri, and Izanami-no-Okami fused with her, she becomes whole again and disappears from the Velvet Room. The true ending then plays out, with the game then skipping a few months after the last scene of the true ending (and after the events of ''Persona 4 Arena Ultimax''), where the protagonist returns to Inaba for the summer. Upon exiting the train station, they discover that Namatame is running for mayor in order to atone for his previous actions. The protagonist will eventually meet up with his friends, who changed since the last time they all met, and will head to the Dojima household, where a surprise party was set up earlier by Dojima.

While eating, the protagonist learns about the recent changes in the neighborhood, is informed that Adachi has become a model prisoner, and sees Marie on the news as the popular new weather girl. Depending on the player's choices, she may also declare her love for him while the main group watches on, much to their disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Persona 4 Golden |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=Atlus |date=November 20, 2012 |platform=[[PlayStation Vita]] |version= |scene=Epilogue |level=Dojima Residence |quote='''Newscaster''': Thanks, Mariko!

As the rest of the Investigation Team starts to criticize Kanji for saying something different than everyone else, the protagonist responds by smiling brightly, and a new post-credits scene shows another group picture of the protagonist and his friends including Marie all smiling together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Persona 4 Golden |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=November 20, 2012 |platform=[[PlayStation Vita]] |level=Credits |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
According to the game director [[Katsura Hashino]], while "ideas [had been] thrown around earlier", development on ''Persona 4'' in Japan did not begin until after the release of ''Persona 3''.&lt;ref name="play-katsura" /&gt; The development team consisted of the team from ''Persona 3'' and new hires which included fans of ''Persona 3''.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-post" /&gt; Atlus intended to improve both the gameplay and story elements of ''Persona 3'' for the new game, to ensure it was not seen as a "retread" of its predecessor. Hashino said that "to accomplish that, we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game. The murder mystery plot was our way of doing that."&lt;ref name="play-katsura" /&gt; The plot of ''Persona 4'' was "greatly inspired", according to Hashino, by mystery novelists such as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Seishi Yokomizo]].&lt;ref name="1up-afterthoughts" /&gt; ''Persona 4'' was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' in March 2008. An article in the issue detailed the game's murder mystery premise, rural setting, and new weather forecast system. The game's North American release date was announced at the 2008 [[Anime Expo]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="1up-announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167012 |title=Atlus Unveils Persona 4 In Japan |first=Mark |last=Whiting |date=March 19, 2009 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AbnU1Hau?url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167012 |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlus would not make an add-on disc or epilogue for ''Persona 4'', as had been done with the ''[[Persona 3 FES]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/atlus-persona-4-fes |title=Atlus Says There Will Be No Persona 4: FES |date=June 11, 2008 |first=Kat |last=Bailey |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z5CojKrs?url=http://www.1up.com/news/atlus-persona-4-fes |archivedate=June 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persona 4'' allowed players full control of characters in battle. This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in ''Persona 3'' being controlled by the game's AI.&lt;ref name="P4guide"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 The Official Strategy Guide |publisher=DoubleJump Publishing |isbn=978-0979884863 |pages=302–303 |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life, character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc.&lt;ref name="P4sil"/&gt; The anime cutscenes were produced by [[Studio Hibari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-hibari.co.jp/animation/ |title=Studio Hibari Workds |publisher=[[Studio Hibari]] |accessdate=September 17, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917174110/http://www.st-hibari.co.jp/animation/ |archivedate=September 17, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of Inaba is based on a town on the outskirts of [[Mount Fuji]].&lt;ref name="1up-afterthoughts" /&gt; Its rural design was a source of conflict between ''Persona 4''{{'}}s developers, as "each staff member had their own image of a rural town", according to director Katsura Hashino. The entire staff went "location hunting" to determine Inaba's design.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-post"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116413/Exclusive_Behind_The_Scenes_Of_Atlus_Persona_4.php |title=Exclusive: Behind the Scenes of Atlus' Persona 4 |date=October 6, 2009 |author=''Persona 4'' Team |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=October 5, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510235353/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116413/Exclusive_Behind_The_Scenes_Of_Atlus_Persona_4.php |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaba does not represent "a country town that has tourist attractions", but rather a non-notable, "'nowhere' place". Hashino described the town as being "for better or for worse... a run-of-the-mill town".&lt;ref name="1up-afterthoughts" /&gt; Unlike other role-playing games, which may have large worlds for the player to explore, ''Persona 4'' mostly takes place in Inaba. This reduced development costs, and enabled Atlus "to expand other portions of the game" in return. A central setting also allows players to "sympathize with the daily life that passes in the game". To prevent the setting from becoming stale, the development team established a set number of in-game events to be created to "keep the game exciting".&lt;ref name="play-katsura"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mag.gomorning.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&amp;contentid=1413 |title=Interview - Katsura Hashino |first=Eric |last=Patterson |date=March 5, 2009 |publisher=[[Play (US magazine)|''Play'']] |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328002518/http://mag.gomorning.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&amp;contentid=1413 |archivedate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of Japanese mythical figures for the characters' Personas as opposed to the Graeco-Roman deities used in earlier games was directly inspired by the new setting.&lt;ref name="P4guide"/&gt; The appearances of Personas were based on the characters' personalities. The design team had a good deal of creative freedom while creating Personas, because although Japanese deities have well-defined character traits, their appearances are traditionally unspecified. The Shadows were created by Hashino without much outside consultation, although he had help from female staff for female Shadow selves.&lt;ref name="P4sil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/09/22/behind-the-design-of-persona-4/ |title=Behind The Design Of Persona 4 |author=Hou, Laura |publisher=Siliconera |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919065533/http://www.siliconera.com/2010/09/22/behind-the-design-of-persona-4/ |archivedate=September 19, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite living in the countryside, ''Persona 4'' characters were designed to look and sound "normal" and like "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being "more rural than was really called for". "The characters aren't really [[wikt:hick|hicks]]... They just happen to live in a place that's not a major metropolitan area."&lt;ref name="1up-interview-expo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/anime-expo-atlus-talks-persona |title=Anime Expo: Atlus Talks Persona 4, Trauma Center's Future |author=Fitch, Andrew |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JOrE1tSh?url=http://www.1up.com/news/anime-expo-atlus-talks-persona |archivedate=September 5, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While interviewing members of ''Persona 4''{{'}}s development team, [[1UP.com]] editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have "more stylish" hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country. "With Yosuke in particular, I gave him accessories, such as headphones and a bicycle, to make it more obvious that he was from the city."&lt;ref name="1up-afterthoughts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/persona-4-afterthoughts |title=Persona 4 Afterthoughts |author=Fitch, Andrew |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YfWZ67ui?url=http://www.1up.com/features/persona-4-afterthoughts |archivedate=May 20, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localization===
As with ''Persona 3'', the  [[Language localisation|localization]] of ''Persona 4'' was handled by Yu Namba and Nich Maragos of Atlus USA. In addition, there were four translators and two further editors. The Social Links were divided equally between the translators and editors.&lt;ref name= "1UPp4Details"/&gt; During localization of the game, character's names were altered for the international audience for familiarity, including Kuma being renamed Teddie. A similar change was done for Rise Kujikawa's stage name, {{nihongo|"Risechie"|りせちー|Risechī}} in Japan, to "Risette". Nanba also explained the change from "Community" to "Social Link", regarding the gameplay mechanic, as "community" has a different meaning in English, whereas Igor in his speeches often refers to "society" and "bonds". Names were also altered for pun and other linguistic effect including dungeon items' names, such as the "Kae Rail" becoming the "Goho-M", as the item's use of returning the player to the entrance was taken to be "go home". Some Japanese cultural references that would not transfer were also removed, such as references to [[Kosuke Kindaichi]]. There were also some issues regarding the translation of the names of Yukiko, Kanji and Rise's dungeons, as the English names were made to fit the original Japanese graphics, and the "Void Quest" dungeon's graphics were specifically made to harken back to the [[Famicom]]. He also remarked on how popular the interpretations of Kanji's Shadow were in the west, and how it did not change how the character was seen by the other audience.&lt;ref name="famitsuinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201302/02028096.html|script-title=ja:『ペルソナ4 ザ・ゴールデン』が北米でも大人気の理由・前編【翻訳担当者インタビュー】 |publisher=''[[Famitsu]]'' |language=Japanese |date=February 2, 2013 |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074917/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201302/02028096.html |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different change was the fact the main characters in the English dub referred to others members of the cast on a first-name basis, while the Japanese version differed in this regard. For the dub, the editors sometimes switched between first-name and last-name referral for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="FamitsuLocalJP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201302/09028245.html|script-title=ja:『ペルソナ4 ザ・ゴールデン』が北米でも大人気の理由・後編【翻訳担当者インタビュー |publisher=''[[Famitsu]]'' |language=Japanese |date=February 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024111121/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201302/09028245.html |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlus's senior project manager Masaru Nanba commented it was decided that "Shin Megami Tensei" was to be kept in the title of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', as it was believed that they were part of the same series as ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]''; however, the "Shin Megami Tensei" title was omitted from both ''Persona 4 Golden'' and ''Persona 4 Arena'', as it would have been much too long. Similarly, ''Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena'' and ''Persona 4: The Golden'' were shortened to the previously stated titles.&lt;ref name="famitsuinterview"/&gt; As with ''Persona 3'', the [[Japanese honorifics|honorifics]] used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along with the sounds of names, were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in ''Persona 3'' was [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. Though he had dubbed characters in ''Persona 3'', Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over ''Persona 3'': the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation.&lt;ref name="1UPp4Details"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3171546 |title=Persona 4 Localization Q&amp;A |author=Fitch, Andrew |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dzpuvfbZ?url=http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3171546 |archivedate=December 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Desp4Panel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-atlus-on-persona-4-94074.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Atlus on Persona 4 |author=North, Dale |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908022422/http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-atlus-on-persona-4-94074.phtml |archivedate=September 8, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The game's original score was primarily composed, arranged, and produced by [[Shoji Meguro]]. The soundtrack features songs with vocals by Shihoko Hirata, whom Meguro felt was able to meet the range of emotion needed for the soundtrack, with the lyrics being written by Reiko Tanaka.&lt;ref name="p4 music"/&gt; Meguro was given a rough outline of the game's plot and worked on the music in the same manner and simultaneously with the development of the story and spoken dialog, starting with the overall shape of the songs and eventually working on the finer details.&lt;ref name="p4 music"/&gt; According to Meguro, the songs "Pursuing My True Self" and "Reach Out to the Truth" were composed to reflect the inner conflicts of the game's main characters; the former song, used as the opening theme, helped to set an understanding of the characters' conflicts, while the latter, used in battle sequences, emphasized the "strength of these characters to work through their internal struggles."&lt;ref name="p4 music"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/05/sound_current_reaching_out_to_the_truth.php |title=Sound Current: 'Reaching Out to the Truth - Vocal Tracks in Persona 4' |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |publisher=GameSetWatch |author=jeriaska |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820214634/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/05/sound_current_reaching_out_to_the_truth.php |archivedate=August 20, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Aria of the Soul" theme used in the Velvet Room, a concept common to all the ''Persona'' games, remained relatively unchanged, with Meguro believing "the shape of the song had been well-defined" from previous games.&lt;ref name="p4 music"/&gt; Composers Atsushi Kitajoh and Ryota Kozuka also contributed music for the game.

==Remake and spinoffs==

===''Persona 4 Golden''===

{{anchor|Persona 4: The Golden|The Golden|Persona 4: Golden|Golden}}
''Persona 4 Golden'', released in Japan as ''Persona 4: The Golden'', was announced in August 2011 as a port of ''Persona 4'' for the portable [[PlayStation Vita]]. It was originally planned by Atlus to be a [[PlayStation Portable]] title, similar to ''[[Persona 3 Portable]]'', which would have required removing some of the features of the PlayStation 2 game. However, the Vita provided sufficient resources that allowed Atlus to expand the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/08/30/persona-4-the-golden-was-originally-planned-for-psp/ |title=Persona 4: The Golden Was Originally Planned For PSP |publisher=Siliconera |author=Spensor |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906063524/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/08/30/persona-4-the-golden-was-originally-planned-for-psp/ |archivedate=September 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an expanded version of the PlayStation 2 title, adding new features and story elements to the game. A new character named [[List of Persona 4 characters#Marie|Marie]] was added to the story. Additional Personas, character outfits, and expanded spoken lines and anime cutscenes are included as well as two new Social Links for Marie and Tohru Adachi. The game supports the wireless networking features of the Vita, allowing a player to call in help from other players to help in dungeon battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/persona-4-vita-changes-and-additions-detailed-210277.phtml |title=Persona 4 Vita changes and additions detailed |first=Dale |last=North |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230209/http://www.destructoid.com/persona-4-vita-changes-and-additions-detailed-210277.phtml |archivedate=October 8, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another new feature is a garden that produces items the player can use in the various dungeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/21/persona-4-the-golden-couldve-been-called-the-garden/ |title=Persona 4: The Golden Could’ve Been Called "The Garden" |publisher=Siliconera |date=February 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226035121/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/21/persona-4-the-golden-couldve-been-called-the-garden/ |archivedate=February 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released in Japan on June 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/21/persona-4-the-golden-shines-in-june-with-famitsu-dx-pack/ |title=Persona 4: The Golden Shines In June With Famitsu DX Pack |date=February 21, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |publisher=Siliconera |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225025717/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/21/persona-4-the-golden-shines-in-june-with-famitsu-dx-pack/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Persona 4: The Golden'' is also the first ''Persona'' game to be released in traditional Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.playstation.com/hk/cht/news/latestNewsDetail/281992/ |title=PS Vita『女神異聞錄 4 黃金版』繁體中文版 8月16日發售確定！ |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |publisher=SCEH |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819032512/http://asia.playstation.com/hk/cht/news/latestNewsDetail/281992 |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persona 4'' received critical acclaim from game critics upon release. [[Jeff Gerstmann]] of [[Giant Bomb]] described it as "one of the best times I've had with video games, whether I was playing by myself or watching someone else play it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game of the Year 2012: Jeff's Top 10 |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/game-of-the-year-2012-jeffs-top-10/2300-6907/ |website=GiantBomb |publisher=GiantBomb.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126022236/http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/game-of-the-year-2012-jeffs-top-10/2300-6907/ |archivedate=January 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'' pointed out that while "there isn't much new from the last game", it favored the changes over the battle system, where the pacing "is quick so it doesn't get to be a pain", and the ability to control party members "makes play that much easier".&lt;ref name="famitsu"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=November 15, 2009 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |author=Gifford, Kevin |date=February 7, 2008 |title=Famitsu Tackles Persona 4 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3168535 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AboI11t5?url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3168535 |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] on the other hand noted that "the pacing can be somewhat off", and "some things feel repurposed or unaffected from previous games", while praising the game as an "evolution of the RPG series, and an instant classic". It also noted that the soundtrack can be "a bit repetitive".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; RPGFan's Ryan Mattich recommended ''Persona 4'' as "one of the best RPG experiences of the year", noting that "among the cookie-cutter sequels and half-hearted remakes", the game is "a near flawless example of the perfect balance between 'falling back on what works' and 'pushing the genre forward'."&lt;ref name="rpgfan"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=February 20, 2010 |publisher=RPGFan |author=Mattich, Ryan |date=September 17, 2008 |title=RPGFan Reviews - Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/persona4/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124523/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/persona4/index.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Andrew Fitch summarized ''Persona 4'' as "some of this decade's finest RPG epics", although the reviewer criticized its "slight loading issues" and the time spent "waiting for the plot to advance".&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game a score of 9.3, stating it's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role-playing genre, and that it stands out of any other JRPG, including its predecessor, ''Persona 3''.&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the [[Xbox 360]] or [[PlayStation 3]], "the clever art style makes up for that". It also praised the game's soundtrack as "excellent, especially the battle music".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The game's setting garnered mixed reactions. IGN labeled ''Persona 4'' as "a murder mystery set against the backdrop of familiar ''Persona 3'' elements", and while this element adds "an interesting twist" to the dungeon crawl and social simulation gameplay, it also causes the plot to "slow down or suffer".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'''s Tim Henderson commended the game for "willfully embellish[ing] absurd urban legends and other ideas with such assured consistency that the resulting whole is unshakabl[y] coherent". However, he criticized it for the narrative's sluggish pace and for how he felt the game is "lacking in elaborate set-pieces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=Tim |date=April 2009 |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |journal=[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]] |publisher=[[Next Media]] |issue=187 |page=58 |issn=1320-7458}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1UP.com called ''Persona 4'' a "stylish murder mystery", the comparison given being a "small-town [[Scooby-Doo]]" adventure.&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;

The game is also noted for its "significant portion of the story revolving around sexual themes", as quoted from RPGFan's Ryan Mattich.&lt;ref name="rpgfan"/&gt; One of the playable characters given attention by reviewers is Kanji, who is considered to be one of the first characters in a mainstream video game to struggle with their [[sexual orientation]], and Atlus has been commended for the inclusion of that character.&lt;ref name="gamasutra sexuality"/&gt; Atlus USA has stated that they left Kanji's sexual preferences ambiguous and up to the player; however, there has been no word from developer Atlus Japan concerning the matter.&lt;ref name="gamasutra sexuality"/&gt; According to Dr. Antonia Levi, author of ''[[Samurai from Outer Space: Understanding Japanese Animation]]'', the questioning of Kanji's sexuality in the script is a "comment on [[homosexuality]] in a greater Japanese social context", in which "the notion of 'coming out' is seen as undesirable ... as it necessarily involves adopting a confrontational stance against mainstream lifestyles and values".&lt;ref name="gamasutra sexuality"/&gt; [[Brenda Brathwaite]], author of ''[[Sex in Video Games]]'', thought it "would have been amazing if they would have made a concrete statement that [Kanji] is gay", but was otherwise "thrilled" with the treatment of the character and the game's representation of his "inner struggles and interactions with friends".&lt;ref name="gamasutra sexuality"/&gt;

''Persona 4'' was awarded the "PlayStation 2 Game Prize" in the ''Famitsu'' Awards 2008, voted by readers of ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref name="Famitsu08"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 25, 2009 |url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1223669_1124.html |title=速報！　ゲームユーザーが選ぶ"FAMITSU AWARDS 2008"は、この作品！！ |work=[[Famitsu]] |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019133603/http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1223669_1124.html |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also recognized by the [[Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association]] as one of the recipients for the "Games of the Year Award of Excellence" in the Japan Game Awards 2009.&lt;ref name="JGA09"&gt;{{cite web |date=September 24, 2009 |url=http://awards.cesa.or.jp/2009/en/press/090924_2.html |title=Japan Game Awards 2009 "Games of the Year Division" Award Winner Determined |work=Computer Entertainment Suppliers Association (CESA) |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722120653/http://awards.cesa.or.jp/2009/en/press/090924_2.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was given the award for its "high quality of work", "excellent story, automatically generated dungeons and impressive background music".&lt;ref name="JGAP4"&gt;{{cite web |date=September 24, 2009 |url=http://awards.cesa.or.jp/2009/en/prize/year/04.html |title=Japan Game Awards 2009: Persona 4 |work=Computer Entertainment Suppliers Association (CESA) |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722120659/http://awards.cesa.or.jp/2009/en/prize/year/04.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[GamesRadar]] ranked it fifth "best videogame stories ever", saying its "greatest strength comes from pacing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-videogame-stories-ever/ |title=The best videogame stories ever |date=July 12, 2013 |publisher=[[Games Radar]] |accessdate=December 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422042037/http://gamesradar.com/the-best-videogame-stories-ever/ |archivedate=April 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, GamesRadar named ''Persona 4 Golden'' the 53rd best game ever on its "The 100 best games ever" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 100 best games ever |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-ever/ |website=[[GamesRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=August 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720222846/http://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-ever/ |archivedate=July 20, 2015 |date=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, USgamer placed the game fifth on its "The 15 Best Games Since 2000" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mackey |first1=Bob |title=The 15 Best Games Since 2000, Number 5: Persona 4 |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-15-best-games-since-2000-number-5-persona-4 |website=USgamer |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |date=August 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805132937/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-15-best-games-since-2000-number-5-persona-4 |archivedate=August 5, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

==Fictional character biography==

===Primus and Unicron===
According to transformers lore, before the dawn of time, Order and Chaos existed within an extra-dimensional entity known as The One. To explore the fledgling universe, he created the astral being known as Unicron, and then subdivided him, creating his twin, Primus. Both brothers were multiversal singularities, unique in all realities, but where as Unicron could only exist in one universe at a time, moving between them at will, Primus existed simultaneously in all realities at once. It is suggested, in fact, that the two brothers embody the basic concepts of reality—good and evil, order and chaos—and that their continued existence is necessary for the stability of the multiverse.

As Unicron and Primus ventured through the cosmos, it became apparent to Primus that Unicron was a corrupt being, and then confronted the threat his sibling posed. In combat, Primus was no match for Unicron. In cunning, however, he proved himself to be his brother's superior when he shifted their battle to the astral plane, and then back to the physical world once more, sacrificing most of his strength to manifest their essences within metallic planetoids, leaving them both trapped. It was with this act of sacrifice that Primus hoped to contain the evil force forever. Unfortunately, over time, Unicron learned to physically shape his prison into a giant metallic planet, and Primus followed suit, becoming the mechanical world of [[Cybertron]]. When Unicron then learned to transform his planetary form even further, into a gigantic robot form, Primus could also, but adapted the idea, and created [[Thirteen Primes|The Thirteen]], a group of robotic beings that possessed the ability to change shape, like Unicron.

The war between Unicron and Primus came to its seeming end during a climactic battle in which one of the Thirteen, Megatronus Prime, who would forever afterwards be known as [[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]], betrayed Primus and became an acolyte of Unicron. The battle ended when the Fallen and Unicron were sucked into a black hole and disappeared from reality. With Unicron gone for now, Primus entered an eons-long slumber, preventing Unicron from detecting him through the mental link the brothers shared.

The Primus/Unicron backstory has evolved and been rewritten a number of times since it originated in the [[Marvel Comics]] series. The version recounted above is the current iteration, which has slowly solidified across a wide swath of media (beginning around the time of ''[[Transformers: Armada]]''). Before the Primus/Unicron mythos reached its present form it went through several distinct versions in the Marvel Generation 1 comics and elsewhere.

===Retellings===
The first time the Primus/Unicron backstory appeared was in the UK comic continuity, from Unicron himself, in the story "The Legacy of Unicron!", when he recounted it to [[Death's Head]]. Per Unicron's telling of events, he was a primal force of evil at the dawn of the universe, who led a legion of Dark Gods against his mortal foe, Primus, Lord of the Light Gods. Events proceeded to play out basically as described above, though the role of the Light and Dark Gods would diminish with each subsequent retelling of the story, until the current version, in which Primus and Unicron are alone, and have a unique origin.

The second time the story was told was in the United States book by the Keeper, an ancient mechanoid who guarded Primus's head at the center of Cybertron. This telling is effectively the same as the previous UK story, but mentions that their battle was towards the end of the era of gods, that Primus and Unicron were the last of their respective pantheons, and Primus had to defeat Unicron before he could take his place with the other gods in the "[[Matrix of Leadership|Omniversal Matrix]]".

The third time the story was told was also in the United States Marvel series, this time by Primus, when he gathered all his children together to prepare for Unicron's coming. It was with this telling that we learned that Unicron predated the [[universe|current universe]], and had destroyed the previous universe which existed before the current one. He had slept peacefully, alone in the [[void (astronomy)|void]] of un-creation that remained, until fragments of the old universe that he had overlooked reacted, causing the Big Bang and birthing the current universe. The "sentient core" of this new universe recognized the threat that Unicron posed, and so created Primus to counter his evil and be guardian of the new creation.

The first modern retelling of the origins of Primus and Unicron did not come from Generation 1-oriented media, but from a set of ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'' trading cards released by Fleer. It was the backstory printed on Unicron's card which introduced the concept of the two being brothers created to explore the new universe by an extra-dimensional entity, here named the "[[Allspark]]".''

This was subsequently expanded on and combined with aspects of the various Marvel Comics stories in ''[[Transformers: The Ultimate Guide]]'', published by Dorling Kindersley and written by [[Simon Furman]], who had written all three prior tellings in the first place. Here, the entity Fleer had called the "Allspark" was redubbed "The One", and the modern iteration of the myth detailed above was firmly established, and went on to form the backbone of subsequent fiction such as ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' and [[Fun Publications]]' ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' comics.

===Across the Multiverse===
Although many of the official television and comics appearance of Unicron appear to present separate and distinct incarnations of the character, some writers have presented an interpretation of the sources that ties all the versions of Unicron together into a single continuity. Likewise, Primus is also a "multiversal singularity", but while Unicron is limited in this ability, and can only exist in one reality at a time, travelling between them, Primus co-exists in all realities simultaneously.

This concept began with the release of a series of ''Transformers: Armada'' trading cards by [[Fleer]]. The biography printed on Unicron's card presented him to be one of two heralds created by the [[Allspark]] to explore the newly birthed universe. Inspired by his Marvel Comics origin, the other herald was Primus, and the brothers set about this task, until they came upon a region of space teeming with pure Energon. Unicron wanted this power for himself, and cut Primus down before he could report it to the Allspark, casting his brother's body into the orbit of a nearby star. And so Unicron went on to become the engine of destruction that menaced the universe in recent years.

Not long after this, the publication of ''Transformers: The Ultimate Guide'' by [[Dorling Kindersley]] cemented this notion. Writer Simon Furman incorporated the various aspects of the Dreamwave comics story, some elements of the Fleer storyline and his original Marvel Comics origin to create what is now essentially the "definitive" origin for Unicron.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In this version of events, Unicron and Primus were again twin heralds, giant metal planetoids created by the "One", who were sent to explore the universe. But Unicron was an imperfect being and turned to evil, adapting his form to transform into a giant robot. To battle him, The One gave Primus this power also, but Primus opted to remain in planet mode, and passed the transforming abilities on to thirteen robots that he created from himself; the first Transformers. One of the thirteen turned on Primus and sided with Unicron, however, and the war culminated in a battle that saw Unicron and this traitor, the "[[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]]", sucked through a black hole into another universe.

This new origin is part of the G1 timeline laid down by the Ultimate Guide, which is apparently being taken as the "official" G1 timeline for future projects that require it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This means that there is only one Unicron who has travelled from universe to universe across all the assorted ''Transformers'' continuities. This interpretation of the character is evidenced by the parallel universe spanning ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' toyline and convention-exclusive comic books — in which the singular Unicron captured Transformers from various alternate realities and pitted them against each other, feeding off the energies released — and the ''Transformers: Cybertron'' comic strip in the Transformers Collectors' Club fan magazine, which depicts Unicron's actions in the various realities in a chronological order and claims that Cybertron is the stable heart of the Multiverse.

===Physical Dimensions===
Unicron's size is never specified in any canon materials, aside from the vague term "planet size". In ''Transformers: The Movie'', Unicron's height appears to be anywhere from several kilometers (as when handling Galvatron) to several hundred kilometers (as when attacking and destroying Lithone and Cybertron's moons, and attacking [[Cybertron]]). A planet-mode diameter of 1000&amp;nbsp;km has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merzo.net/2000mpp.htm|title=2000 Meters per Pixel|website=www.merzo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robot-mode dimensions would follow from that estimate, provided that there is no change in size (compression or expansion) common among so many Transformers. In fact, one scene in the movie shows Jazz driving out of one of Unicron's eyes, just small enough to fit through them, though in another scene the Quintesson ship Hot Rod arrived is tiny compared with the eye. Unicron is also small enough to stand on Cybertron's surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XdCd6K2ACdc/TngtSicr9iI/AAAAAAAAKgY/b3bPP8sqrYQ/s1600/Unicron.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pics.livejournal.com/shortpacked/pic/0003wr79&lt;/ref&gt; In season 3, it is shown that the eyes from [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]] and [[Trypticon]] (both city-sized Transformers) are the perfect size to use as replacement parts when Unicron orders the ghost of Starscream to steal them. However later in the episode when Trypticon moves Unicron's head, the head is larger than Trypticon's entire body. (Note: However, the eyes could be only small components for his Optic Sensors to be reformed and/ or completed.) In the storyline "The Ultimate Doom", Cybertron appeared to be smaller than Earth's own moon (and by extension, this would indicate Lithone would be too small to be a planet), making Unicron's dimensions in the cartoon harder to define.

The comic version of Unicron may be far larger. In the first issue of [[Marvel Comics]] [[Generation One]] ''Transformers'' comic, Cybertron is said to be around the size of [[Saturn]] (which has a diameter of roughly 120,000&amp;nbsp;km at the [[equator]]). As Unicron's planet mode is seen to be as large as Cybertron (if not larger) in the comics, this would suggest a diameter of 120,000+ km. The Dreamwave equivalent of Unicron may be the same size, as the Cybertron of the Dreamwave universe was also said to be the size of Saturn.

In the ''Transformers: Cybertron'' comics, the tank version of Unicron is only the same size as an average Transformer, and is shorter than the Autobots [[Sentinel Maximus]] and [[Omega Prime]], whom he fought.

The ''Transformers Prime'' iteration of Unicron depicts him as the center of Earth, making him a planet with sustainable life, though it has not been seen if Unicron wishes to consume other planets like his other incarnations.

==Animated series==

===Beast Wars===
Although Primus was never mentioned in the original U.S. Transformers television series, the writers of ''[[Beast Wars]]'' included Primus to the television mythos with mention of Primus by the Transformers in that series, and the creation of the [[Covenant of Primus]] in the series finale. The character itself never appeared in those two series.

===Unicron Trilogy===
When the ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'' series came to feature a new incarnation of Unicron, the [[Fleer]] series of trading cards included on this Unicron's card a biography that mentioned Primus and told an entirely new story for this universe. Here, Primus and Unicron were brothers, twin heralds created by the [[Allspark]] to explore the universe. Unicron was a flawed being, and he eventually turned on his brother when they discovered a region of space rich in Energon. Unicron sought to use it for his own power, and to stop Primus telling the Allspark of this, he apparently slew him, and cast his body into the orbit of a nearby star. ''Armada'''s sequel series, ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', went on to feature a character named Primus, who dwelled at the core of Cybertron. Portrayed as an incandescent sphere of light, Primus is given no origin or explanation in the series, beyond apparently being the sentient energy core of Cybertron. Historical precedent would suggest a similar origin to the Marvel Comics, with the abandoned Primus somehow becoming Cybertron.

Primus' first noted act in ''Energon'' was to imbue the young [[Kicker (Transformers)|Chad "Kicker" Jones]] with the ability to sense Energon (presumably, this was to enable the Autobots to find the mineral, but seems like a very callous and self-serving act, which is in-line with the Marvel incarnation of Primus, but not how the Energon version of the character would go on to act). Subsequently, he bestowed upon the Autobots of this universe the "Spark of Combination", giving them the ability to [[Powerlink (Transformers)|Powerlink]] their bodies together for enhanced strength in the face of the attacks by [[Alpha Q]] and his [[Terrorcon]]s. When these battles eventually led to full-scale Decepticon attack upon Cybertron, Primus's chamber was infiltrated by Terrorcons who began to drain his energy. When the Autobots successfully repelled them, Primus reconstructed the injured guard, Wing Dagger, as [[Wing Saber]], who joined the battle, which resulted in a fissure being torn in space, hurling the Autobots far from Cybertron.

In this new region of space, the Decepticons succeeded in restoring and reanimating Unicron. Primus guided Kicker's father, Doctor Brian Jones, to a subterranean temple on Cybertron, where they awoke the legendary [[Omega Supreme]], who Powerlinked with [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] into "Optimus Supreme" to aid in fighting Unicron. Primus then transmitted the entirety of his energy across the gulf of space, enhancing the armor and power of [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]], [[Jetfire]], [[Ironhide]], [[Cliffjumper]] and [[Landmine (Transformers)|Landmine]], and allowing Optimus Supreme to grow to a colossal height, to battle and best Unicron one-on-one.

With Unicron defeated, the Autobots were afforded a brief moment of relaxation, but another Decepticon attack launched upon Cybertron soon shattered that. Having expended his energy, Primus was in "sleep mode", and had to be forcibly awakened by an infusion of Energon from the [[Omnicon]]s, only to find himself forced to use all his power to once again enhance Optimus Supreme so that he could stop the Decepticon-induced movement of Cybertron. The Omnicons quickly re-energized him with Super Energon from the reservoir beneath the planet's surface, while Optimus Prime struggled with a Unicron-possessed [[Galvatron]]. Primus merged himself with the reservoir of Super Energon, creating a foundling sun, into which Galvatron plunged himself, preferring to be destroyed, rather than manipulated by Unicron any further. With this act, the sun ignited, as Primus and Unicron together breathed new life into the stars.

For an unexplained reason, at the mid-point of the English-language version of the ''Energon'' series, much of Primus's presence and influence is written out. His lines are given to other characters, usually Rad or Dr. Jones, and he is often referred to as "the core", rather than by name. However, this is never consistent, as he would again eventually speak a line or perform an action, and by the show's final story arc, this strange trait had disappeared.

In ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', it is learned that Primus returned to [[Cybertron]] after the Energon sun collapsed into a black hole due to Megatron's interference. He was the one who created the [[Cyber Planet Key]]s, which awakened him after [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] absorbed their power to stop [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]]. Using the [[Mini-Con]] Jolt as a medium, he revealed the true nature of the black hole that threatens Cybertron and eventually the universe itself as a disruption of the natural order &amp; balance of the universe caused by the collapse of the Energon sun. Unfortunately, Primus grew weak since [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]] stole most of his spark power. He needed all the Cyber Planet Keys in order to return to true consciousness. Even with three Keys, Primus astonished everyone when he suddenly moved his hand and used his weapons. When the Autobots traveled to Gigantion, the Giant Planet, Primus tried to slow down the black hole until they could find the last key. Yet Primus fought against an even larger Starscream. Primus kept the black hole from expanding while the Autobots went looking for Gigantion. When the [[Omega Lock]] and Planet Keys reunited with him, all of his Spark becomes restored to him, making him strong again, and used the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'s (called ''Noah'' in Galaxy Force) main cannon to destroy the black hole. Considering this as a final victory for him and the Autobots, Primus then happily turns back into Cybertron, reforming himself into a much more healthier place to live by both Transformers and humans.

Primus has been made into a toy for the Cybertron toyline, with pictures of his initial look in both planet and robot mode having shown on various websites and an initial release date of 2006 for the toy itself. Since the toy's announcement, it was strongly hinted that there would be a change made between the American and Japanese figures that "would make fans want to buy both versions". Recently, that change has been made public; in its initial release, the American version of Primus will have a sculpt of a battle-damaged Unicron head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Covenant of Primus|url=http://www.transformersaction.com/books/transformers-the-covenant-of-primus/|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the inclusion of the [[Unicron]] head accessory, the toy had no differences otherwise from the Japanese release. The only part exclusive to the Japanese release was the packaging itself, which was designed to mimic the look and layout of a G1 toy box. When the toy was released, many fans found that their local shipments of Primus did not include the Unicron head, despite being the first received in their area. This led to many fans ordering Primus with Unicron head from [[Hasbro Toy Shop]].

===Transformers: Robots Heroes===
In the ''Robots Heroes'' animated short, Primus, considered to be the very first Transformer, created the Matrix of Leadership and personally gave it to Optimus Prime.

===Transformers: Prime===
{{Quote|Before the beginning, there was Primus and there was Unicron. One, the incarnation of creation; the other, of destruction. For eons, Primus and Unicron battled. The balance of power shifting between them more times than could be counted. Only by creating the Thirteen, the original Primes who preceded me, was Primus finally able to defeat Unicron and cast him out. Primus became one with the very core of our planet, creating life through the Well of All Sparks, while Unicron was never to be heard from again... until now.|Optimus Prime|"One Shall Rise, Part 1"}}

In the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' universe, Primus does not appear physically (though one could argue that the planet Cybertron and Primus are one and the same), though the "''Core of Cybertron''" which appears in ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'' may actually be Primus (if true then Primus would be the one who gave Optimus Prime the [[Matrix of Leadership]]). Like other incarnations, Primus is a mythical god-like figure and is likely believed to represent the [[Allspark]] (as his counterpart [[Unicron]] is believed to represent the Anti-spark). The Transformers' holy-text the [[Covenant of Primus]] also exists in this universe as well (and foretells of the rising threat of [[Unicron]]).

==Comics==

===Marvel Comics===
The first clash between brothers Unicron and Primus came when Unicron succeeded in his goal of consuming the universe. As he slumbered in the void it was revealed that he hadn't been thorough enough — tiny fragments of the universe remained and reacted with each other, leading to the creation of the current universe. The universe grew around [[Unicron]] and when he awoke he did not question it, he merely began to consume it again. The sentient core of the universe responded by creating Primus, a guardian to battle Unicron. The infant universe shook and quaked from the ferocity of their battles and Primus was eventually forced into a desperate gamble.&lt;ref&gt;Rise of The Fallen, New Straits Times, January 17, 2009 by Rizal Solomon&lt;/ref&gt;

He shifted the battle to the [[astral plane]] where he fared no better and then returned them to the physical universe, but instead of allowing them to materialize in their energy forms he entrapped both Unicron and himself in two metallic asteroids. [[Unicron]] would not be stopped, psionically shaping his asteroid into a massive metal world and then into a gargantuan robot. Primus, however, elected to create a race of guardians to defend the universe against Unicron, transforming his own asteroid into a metal world which would later be known as [[Cybertron]].&lt;ref&gt;Transformers and Philosophy by John R. Shook and  Liz Stillwaggon Swan&lt;/ref&gt;  On that world he gave birth to the [[Transformers (toyline)|Transformers]], bestowing the race with his distilled genetic [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Matrix]]. So Primus slumbered, shutting himself down to hide the world from Unicron.

In 1991, Primus was briefly awakened by a stray laser blast in the middle of a battle at the planet's core. He screamed once before falling back to sleep, but the scream echoed across existence reaching Unicron's ears. Unicron headed for Cybertron sending his herald, [[Galvatron]], ahead of him. Galvatron proved [[Betrayal|treacherous]] and awakened Primus who possessed the body of [[Emirate Xaaron]] and brought all the Transformers to Cybertron before Unicron destroyed him. Subsequently, Unicron was destroyed by [[Optimus Prime]] with the help of the Matrix, which contained the full measure of Primus' power. In the animated series, however, it is [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] who destroys Unicron.

The above is the story of Primus as related in the United States in [[Marvel Comics]] but the story was originally told in British comics. The Primus story is recounted three times under [[Simon Furman]] - in order: Transformers UK #150, Transformers US #61, and US #74, and while the Primus/Unicron battle and ultimate solution are always the same, the background to their fight differs in each telling.

The first (told by Unicron) has Primus and Unicron leading armies of similar beings at the dawn of the universe. The second (told by the Primus Chamber's Keeper) had the two as the last of their respective pantheons and Primus needing to stop Unicron before he could pass on from this realm. The third, told by Primus, has Unicron destroying the previous universe and trying to end the current one, with Primus being formed by the "sentient core" of this universe to stop him.

By the third re-telling, the idea that Unicron and Primus were related to similar entities had been dropped and was not picked up again.

===TFcon Comics===
The expanded fiction of the [[Botcon]] and [[OTFCC]] comic books suggest that Primus experimented with a small planet before actually transforming himself into Cybertron. This world, named Protos, was where he created the first 12 Transformers, each of them themed after an animal of the [[zodiac]]. Later, Primus created the [[Original Thirteen Transformers]].

===3h Enterprises===
Primus appeared with [[Alpha Trion]] in the ''Transformers: Universe'' comic, bringing back [[Optimus Primal]] and guiding him in his battles against Unicron allied Decepticons.

===Dreamwave Productions===
When [[Dorling Kindersley]] published ''Transformers: The Ultimate Guide'', the concept of Primus and Unicron as brother heralds created by an extra-dimensional entity, called the "[[AllSpark]]", as per the ''Armada'' trading card, was again referenced. Additionally, however, the book claimed that there was one, singular Unicron and Primus across all dimensions, retroactively adding these elements to the original Marvel Comic origin. This revised origin concept is now treated as the official take on the character by Hasbro, and has formed the core of the story in the ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' comic book exclusive to the Transformers Collectors Club.

The popularity of the idea is not universal within the Transformers fandom, and it notably flies in the face of the original animated show's version of events, where there was no Primus, and the Transformers were created by the [[Quintessons]]. An earlier convention-exclusive comic merged the two storylines in explanation; Primus created the transformers but then went to sleep; later the Quintessons invaded and conquered the planet and split the Cybertrons into two races. Worker/Builders (Autobots) Warrior/Soldier (Decepticon). This concept has been adopted by the majority of fans but is still met with mixed opinions by some.

The book also features an image of Primus as a transformed, robot-mode Cybertron (originally drawn by Don Figueroa for [[Dreamwave Productions]]' ''War Within'' comic book series), which received such positive reaction that the idea of a transforming Primus/Cybertron eventually made it into toy form for the ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' toyline.

===IDW Publishing===
[[Simon Furman]], creator of the Primus backstory for Transformers, has stated there will be "no Primus. No Unicron" in the IDW Generation 1 comics, and that if Cybertronian prehistory is featured it will be different from previous takes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.idwpublishing.com/viewtopic.php?t=2850 |title=IDW Publishing Forums :: View topic - Simon Furman Q&amp;A Volume 2 LIVE! |publisher=Forum.idwpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417024607/http://forum.idwpublishing.com/viewtopic.php?t=2850 |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDW's publisher confirmed there will be a story featuring Transformer prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/news/view.php?id=12209 |title=IDW Publishing going back to the very beginning? |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2008-01-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a character exclaims "Primus!" in ''Megatron Origin'' #4 (by a different writer), Furman stated in his blog comments "doesn't necessarily mean it's G1 Primus. There are still no plans to do feature [sic] Primus (as was)". He does say it is possible a different being called Primus could have existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simonfurman.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/all-this-and-devastation-4/ |title=ALL THIS AND DEVASTATION #4 « simon furman |publisher=Simonfurman.wordpress.com |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later confirmed, as a version of Primus appeared as a member of the '''Guiding Hand''', a group of five deities who were the first life on Cybertron. But, Primus and his noble fellows Adaptus, Epistemus, and Solomus were betrayed by their brother Mortilus, and the conflict left all five mortally wounded. They would give way to their descendants, the Knights of Cybertron, who would in turn be followed by IDW-G1 incarnation of the Thirteen.

In the ''live-action film series'' comics, the [[Allspark]] gave life to [[Cybertron#Transformers live-action films|Cybertron]] and Primus, who then created the [[Dynasty of Primes]]  and the rest of the Transformers race.

===Fun Publications===
In the ''Shattered Glass'' universe, the idea of Primus, the benevolent Creator, was unknown to the heroic Decepticons until [[Cliffjumper]], a visitor from the Positive Polarity universes, told them about him. Before long, Cliffjumper's "beliefs" were a subject of derision, especially among the evil Autobots. When Ultra Mammoth-the [[Ultra Magnus]] of Cliffjumper's reality-encountered the Vok on ''Shattered Glass'' prehistoric Earth, they took the form of Primus (mirroring the action of their counterparts in the ''Beast Wars'' cartoon) to mock Ultra Mammoth's attempts to bring order to a universe "founded on chaos."

Cliffjumper was eventually vindicated, however, when the [[Original thirteen Transformers#Nexus Prime|Nexus Prime]] gestalt members attempted to resurrect a recently assassinated [[Megatron]]. As they applied their powers to the body, they were transported to Primus' presence. There they chose for Primus to rebirth them as their original self, with Nexus returning to the battlefield and declaring himself to his enemies as being the "mighty fist of the lord of light". Megatron, meanwhile, received a vision from the other side of the Allspark of a healed Cybertron, before being reborn himself as Galvatron, with Nexus investing him with some of Primus' power by proxy.

However, the events of ''Another Light'' resulted in the Primus of this universe being separated from his manifestations in other realities and developing an evil persona. Regarding his inhabitants as an infestation (not unlike the Aligned continuity version of Unicron regarded humanity) he approached the villainous [[Rodimus Prime#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Rodimus Prime]] about helping him eliminate them after Rodimus was defeated by [[Nova Prime]], the formerly evil Optimus Prime who had been reborn through the power of the now noble Unicron.

===Binaltech===
Formerly the assistant to the Primacron, the ancient genius who created the giant mechanoid Unicron, the robotic being known as the Oracle was badly damaged when Unicron rebelled against his creator. His essence fled to a dead world at the centre of the galaxy, which he used his powers to transform into a verdant, green planet. However, the Oracle could sense that in the future, Primacron would go on to create another universal danger in the form of Tornedron, and so summoned a group of Primitive Transformers back through time from the year 2010 to his planet, where he instructed them in how to destroy the threat.

Later in his life, the Oracle also reached through time when he discovered that the evil [[Sparkbot]]s were attempted to recreate Unicron following the planet-eater's destruction in the year 2005. By this stage calling himself "Primus", the Oracle attempted to stop the villains and their unwitting pawns, the human [[Kiss Players]], appearing as a giant golden hand to snatch away the fragments of Unicron's lifeforce each time the Kiss Players recovered them. Unfortunately, this merely led the Kiss Players to pursue him through the timestream and resulted in them crashing into the "[[Wall of Time]]" and becoming scattered throughout the multiverse. Knowing that the Kiss Players were innocent in this whole affair, having been duped by the Sparkbots, the benevolent Primus rescued them from the different regions of time and space they had wound up in, and properly introduced himself, explaining the Sparkbots' treachery. He then took them back in time to prehistoric Earth, arriving just in time to witness the Sparkbots' successful restoration of Unicron to life. Primus transformed once more and unleashed the power of his mobile cannon platform, destroying Unicron's energy and sealing it and the Sparkbots deep within the planet. To ensure that Unicron would never be freed again, he created a mighty guardian, Brave Maximus, who would watch over it and the Earth. With the battle over, Shaoshao asked about the Kiss Players' future, but Primus did not reply. After sending the Kiss Players back to their home time, Primus transformed into the golden sphere of Vector Sigma and returned to his world to sleep.

Unfortunately for Primus, as he slumbered, his world was eventually discovered by the alien Quintessons, who shackled his powers and used them to both transform the planet into the metallic Cybertron, and to create the races of robots that would eventually become the Transformers. Additionally, the aliens acquired the shell that had held his essence, which became, through unknown means, the talisman that would be known to the Transformers as the Matrix of Leadership.

==Video games==
The '''Core of Cybertron''' that appears in ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'' may actually be Primus and if this is true, then Primus would be the one who gave Optimus Prime the [[Matrix of Leadership]].

==Toys==
*'''God Primus'''
:The First Primus figure was a Lucky Draw toy in Japan. It was a gold chrome recolored [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] that was given away as a contest prize from the collector book, ''[[The Transformers: Generations]]'' and it came with Rodimus Prime's accessories.
*'''''Cybertron'' Supreme Primus'''
:Released in the ''Cybertron'' toyline as described above, it is actually a [[triple changer]], transforming not only into Cybertron's planet form and Primus' robot form, but also into a large world-ship, a spaceship the size of a planet. Many of its parts can only be moved using the included [[Omega Lock]], which must be used to move the upper half of the planet mode out of the way so the lower half can transform. The Omega Lock has 4 slots of the Cyber Planet Keys included with other toys and has a small light that turns on when the Lock is inserted into any of the ports on the figure. A key hole is also located on each of Primus's arms and activates two non-firing double-barreled blasters on the toy's wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/toys/gallery.php?id=918&amp;size=0&amp;start=0 |title=Primus - Cybertron - Toy Gallery - Photos 1 - 25 |publisher=Seibertron.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastercollector.com/articles/reviews/primus-review.htm |title=Product Reviews |publisher=Mastercollector.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:While the figure is identical in both its Japanese and American releases, the American package comes in original style packaging, and the Japanese also included a battle-damaged Unicron head in its initial release. The Unicron head has half of the face removed, exposing a skull-like vestige underneath. Later releases of Primus were sold without the Unicron head, and the last versions of Primus instead included four Mini-Cons who were planned to be parts of the Cybertron line, but were late and so were included as bonus figures. These four Mini-Cons would later appear as Mini-Cons in the Transformers Classics line. Although the four Mini-Cons had no personal biographies, they would get some characterization on the Transformers Collectors Club web site. This toy was designed by [[Takara]]'s [[Takashi Kunihiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/universe-classics-20-29/transformers-generations-2009-takara-tomy-transformers-henkei-staff-interview-translation-167074/ |title=Transformers Generations 2009 Takara Tomy Transformers Henkei Staff Interview Translation - Transformers News |publisher=Tfw2005.com |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in Japan several months later with no alterations or deco changes.
*'''''Transformers 2010'' Creator Primus'''
:To be released in late 2010 as part of TakaraTomy's "Transformers 2010" promotion, which celebrates the year in which the [[The Transformers (TV series)#Season 3|third season]] of ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' was set in Japan, this figure is a redeco of the Cybertron Primus figure. Unlike the [[Unicron#Toys|Unicron]] figure being released under the same promotion, no remolding is visible in the pre-release photos. The figure is redecoed such that the planet mode is now predominantly Cybertron's classic metallic silver, in place of the previous blue and white, with gold spires replacing the black ones of the original version of the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redeco of the Cybertron Primus figure|url=http://www.transformersaction.com/action-figures/transformers-cybertron-supreme-class-cybertron-primus-figure/|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Last Knight'' Cybertron'''
:Released in 2017 as part of the [[Toys R Us]]-exclusive ''Mission to Cybertron'' sub-theme of the ''Last Knight'' toyline. A redeco of ''Cybertron'' Primus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4684">'''Proto-Iroquoian''' is the name given to the hypothetical [[proto-language]] of the [[Iroquoian languages]]. [[Floyd Lounsbury|Lounsbury]] (1961) estimated from [[glottochronology]] a time depth of 3,500 to 3,800 years for the split of South and North Iroquoian. At the time of first European contact, speakers of Iroquoian languages ranged from the [[Cherokee]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], to the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and [[Nottoway Tribe|Nottoway]] near the modern [[Virginia]]/[[North Carolina]] border, then further north the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] in [[Upstate New York]] and the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]] in modern-day [[Ontario]].

The Iroquoian languages are usually divided into two main groups: Southern Iroquoian ([[Cherokee]]) and Northern Iroquoian (all others) based on the great differences in vocabulary and modern phonology. Northern Iroquoian is then further divided by Lounsbury and [[Marianne Mithun|Mithun]] into Proto-Tuscarora-Nottoway and Lake Iroquoian, although Julian (2010) does not believe Lake Iroquoian to be a valid subgrouping.

Isolated studies were done by [[Wallace Chafe|Chafe]] (1977a), Michelson (1988), and Rudes (1995). There have also been several works of internal reconstruction for daughter languages, in particular with [[Seneca language|Seneca]] and [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]. A preliminary full reconstruction of proto-Iroquoian was not provided until [[Charles Julian]]'s (2010) work.

==Phonology==
Proto-Iroquoian as reconstructed shares the Iroquoian languages' notable typological traits of small [[consonant]] inventories, complex consonant clusters, and a lack of [[labial consonant]]s.

===Vowels===
The reconstructed vowel inventory for Proto-Iroquoian is:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! 
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|iː}}
| 
| {{IPA|u}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|uː}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|eː}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|ẽ}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|ẽː}}
| 
| {{IPA|o}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|oː}}  &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|õ}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|õː}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| 
| {{IPA|a}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|aː}}
| 
|}
Like later Iroquoian languages, Proto-Iroquoian is distinguished in having [[nasal vowels]] /õ/ and /ẽ/, although it has more than in its daughter languages.

===Consonants===
The reconstructed consonant inventory for Proto-Iroquoian is given in the table below. The consonants of all Iroquoian languages pattern so that they may be grouped as (oral) obstruents, sibilants, laryngeals, and resonants (Lounsbury 1978:337).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

The [[cempedak]] fruit is outside the fence,&lt;br /&gt;
Take a pole and poke it down;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm just a child trying to learn,&lt;br /&gt;
So if i'm wrong then please tell me.

Pandan Island far in midst,&lt;br /&gt;
With the three peaked Mount [[Daik]];&lt;br /&gt;
While the body decomposes in earth,&lt;br /&gt;
Good deeds remain to be remembered.

Two or three cats are running around,&lt;br /&gt;
With the striped one which can vie;&lt;br /&gt;
Two or three I can find,&lt;br /&gt;
Which girl can compare with you.

[[Cavendish banana|Pisang emas]] brought on a sailing trip,&lt;br /&gt;
One ripens on a box;&lt;br /&gt;
If gold is owed, it can be repaid,&lt;br /&gt;

Where cempedak tree grows without the fence,&lt;br /&gt;
Go prod them gently with a stake;&lt;br /&gt;
A youthful learner I, so hence,&lt;br /&gt;
Be please to point out each mistake.

The Pandan Isle is far from land,&lt;br /&gt;
Have three peaks does the Daik Mountain;&lt;br /&gt;
Though the self has rot in the sand,&lt;br /&gt;
The good deeds are never forgotten.

Two or three cats are running around,&lt;br /&gt;
The cat with stripes is the one superior;&lt;br /&gt;
Two or three (gals) can be easily found,&lt;br /&gt;
But not the same as having you, my dear.

With golden plantains sail away,&lt;br /&gt;
Whilst on a chest lies one that’s ripe;&lt;br /&gt;
The debts of gold we can repay,&lt;br /&gt;
But debts of kindness last through life.&lt;br /&gt;

Because this song is in ''[[pantun]]'' form, for each [[quatrain]], there is no relevance of the first two lines to the message conveyed by the last two except to provide the rhyming scheme.
There are a number of versions of the lyrics of "Rasa Sayang", but it usually starts with this refrain:

:''Rasa sayang, hey!''
:''Rasa sayang-sayang hey,''
:''Lihat nona dari jauh,''
:''Rasa sayang-sayang, hey''

The refrain is then followed by a wide variety of popular Malay ''[[pantun]]''

==Controversy==
Controversy over the song's provenance came to a head in 2007 when the Malaysian Tourism Board released the Rasa Sayang Commercial, an advertisement used as part of [[Malaysia]]'s "Truly Asia" tourism campaign.&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;[http://www.tourismindonesia.com/2007/10/folk-song-sparks-row-between-indonesia.html "Folk song sparks row between Indonesia, Malaysia."] ''Tourism Indonesia''. 3 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indonesians have accused Malaysia of heritage theft. Malaysia in return claimed that the song belongs to people of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], Malaysians and Indonesians alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|accessdate=21 January 2008|title=‘Rasa Sayang’ belongs to everybody, says minister|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/12/nation/19988592&amp;sec=nation|date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysian Tourism Minister Adnan Mansor stated, "It is a folk song from the [[Nusantara]] and we are part of the Nusantara."&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

==Trivia==
* in [[MNCTV]], the cooking show programme called name as ''Rasa Sayange'', Which the program was cooperating with tabloid Wanita Indonesia and broadcast every Saturday at 8:00 am. The opening features as the song of Rasa Sayange

== Origins ==
{{See also|Mods and rockers}}
[[File:Busy-Bee-rockers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|1960s Rockers under canopy outside Busy Bee Café, [[Watford]], England, UK]]
Until the [[post-war]] period motorcycling held a prestigious position and enjoyed a positive image in British society, being associated with wealth and glamour. Starting in the 1950s, the [[middle class]]es were able to buy inexpensive motorcars so that motorcycles became transport for the poor.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;

The rocker subculture came about due to factors such as: the end of post-war rationing in the UK, a general rise in prosperity for [[working class]] youths, the recent availability of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and financing for young people, the influence of American popular music and films, the construction of race track-like arterial roads around British cities, the development of transport cafes and a peak in British motorcycle engineering. The name “rocker” came not from music, but from the rockers found in 4-stroke engines, as opposed to the two stroke engines used by scooters and ridden by mods.

During the 1950s,&lt;ref name="perone"&gt;Mods, rockers, and the music of the British invasion. James E. Perone. Praeger, 2008. {{ISBN|0-275-99860-6}}. pp. 3, 65, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; they were known as "Ton-Up boys" because ''doing a [[Ton#Informal tons|ton]]'' is English slang for driving at a speed of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} or over. The [[Teddy boy]]s were considered their "spiritual ancestors".&lt;ref name="perone" /&gt; The rockers or ton-up boys took what was essentially a sport and turned it into a lifestyle, dropping out of mainstream society&lt;ref&gt;Skateboarding, Space and the City, Borden, Iain. Berg Publishers, (2003). {{ISBN|1-85973-493-6}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and "rebelling at the points where their will crossed society's".&lt;ref&gt;Dancin' in the streets!: anarchists, IWWs, surrealists, Situationists, Franklin Rosemont, Charles Radcliffe.  Charles H Kerr 2005 {{ISBN|0-88286-302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damaged the public image of motorcycling in the UK and led to the politicisation of the motorcycling community.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Suzanne McDonald-Walker, 'Bikers: Culture, Politics and Power' Berg Publishers, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85973-356-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass media started targeting these socially powerless youths and cast them as "folk devils", creating a [[moral panic]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]; (1972). ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics; The Creation of the Mods and Rockers'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-85965-125-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; through highly exaggerated and ill-founded portrayals.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Resistance through rituals: youth subcultures in post-war Britain By Stuart Hall, Tony Jefferson.

Bomb Culture Paladin, London 1969. pp. 27-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocker subculture was associated with 1950s and early-1960s [[rock and roll]] music by artists such as [[Gene Vincent]], [[Eddie Cochran]] and [[Chuck Berry]], music that [[George Melly]] called "screw and smash" music.&lt;ref name="sex" /&gt;

A café racer is a motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than for comfort.&lt;ref&gt;The Café Racer Phenomenon (Those were the days...), Alastair Walker. Veloce Publishing 2009. {{ISBN|1-84584-264-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features include: a single racing seat, low handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided clip-ons mounted directly onto the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing [[petrol]] tanks (aluminium ones were often polished and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without half or full race fairings.&lt;ref&gt;Reg Everett and [[Mick Walker (motorcycling)|Mick Walker]]. Rocker to Racer.  Breedon Books. 2010. {{ISBN|1-85983-679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These motorcycles were lean, light and handled various road surfaces well. The most defining machine of the rocker heyday was the [[Triton motorcycle|Triton]], which was a custom motorcycle made of a [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] [[Featherbed frame]] and a [[Triumph Bonneville]] engine. It used the most common and fastest racing engine combined with the best handling frame of its day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Seate|Seate, Mike]].

Bruckmann Verlag GmbH, 2008. {{ISBN|3-7654-7694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular motorcycle brands included [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]], [[Royal Enfield]] and [[Matchless]].

The term ''café racers'' is now also used to describe motorcycle riders who prefer vintage British, Italian or Japanese motorbikes from the 1950s to late 1970s.  These modern café racers do not resemble the rockers of earlier decades, and they dress in a more modern and comfortable style, with only a hint of likeness to the rocker style, nor do they share the passion for 50s rock'n'roll. These modern café racers have taken elements of the American greaser, British rocker, and modern motorcycle rider styles to create a look of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Mike. (1988) ''Cafe Racers: Rockers, Rock 'n' Roll and the Coffee-bar Cult''.

Crowood (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Rockers in the 2000s tend still to ride classic British motorcycles, however, classically styled European café racers are now also seen, such as [[Moto Guzzi]] or [[Ducati]], as well as classic Japanese bikes, some with British-made frames such as those made by [[Rickman Motorcycles|Rickman]].

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Aviakit Pudding basin helmet.jpg|thumb|[[Aviakit]] Pudding basin helmet]]
Rockers bought standard factory-made motorcycles and stripped them down, tuning them up and modifying them to appear like racing bikes. Their bikes were not merely transport, but were used as an object of intimidation and masculinity projecting them uneasily close to death,&lt;ref name="sex" /&gt; an element exaggerated by their use of skull and crossbone-type symbolism.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

First seen in the United States and then England,&lt;ref name="nuttal" /&gt; the rocker fashion style was born out of necessity and practicality. Rockers wore heavily decorated leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with metal studs, patches, pin badges and sometimes an [[Esso]] ''gas man'' trinket. When they rode their motorcycles, they usually wore no [[helmet]], or wore a classic open-face helmet, aviator goggles and a white silk scarf (to protect them from the elements). Other common items included: T-shirts, leather caps, [[Levi's]] or [[Wrangler (jeans)|Wrangler]] [[jeans]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeans: A Cultural History of an American Icon, James Sullivan, Gotham, 2006. {{ISBN|1-59240-214-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; leather trousers, tall motorcycle boots (often made by [[Lewis Leathers]] and Goldtop) or [[brothel creeper|brothel creepers/beetle crusher]]s. Also popular was a patch declaring membership of the [[59 Club]] of England, a church-based youth organization that later formed into a [[motorcycle club]] with members all over the world. The rocker hairstyle, kept in place with [[Brylcreem]], was usually a tame or exaggerated [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] hairstyle, as was popular with some 1950s [[rock and roll]] musicians.

[[File:Customised Lewis Leathers Rockers.JPG|thumb|Customised [[Lewis Leathers]] motorcycle jacket with [[Ace Cafe London|Ace Cafe]] details]]
Largely due to their clothing styles and dirtiness, the rockers were not widely welcomed by venues such as pubs and dance halls. Rockers also transformed rock and roll dancing into a more violent, individualistic form beyond the control of dance hall management.&lt;ref name="sex" /&gt; They were generally reviled by the British motorcycle industry and general enthusiasts as being as an embarrassment and bad for the industry and the sport.&lt;ref&gt;The Bsa Gold Star, [[Mick Walker (motorcycling)|Mick Walker]]. Redline Books, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9544357-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, many rockers opposed [[recreational drug use]], and according to Johnny Stuart:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They had no knowledge of the different sorts of drugs. To them amphetamines, cannabis, heroin were all drugs - something to be hated. Their ritual hatred of Mods and other sub-cultures was based in part on the fact that these people were believed to take drugs and were therefore regarded as sissies. Their dislike of anyone connected with drugs was intense.&lt;ref&gt;''Rockers! Kings of the Road'' by John Stuart, Plexus Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|0-85965-125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
[[File:Len-Paterson-Graham-Hullet-at-Enfield-Motorcycles.jpg|thumb|Len Paterson, founder of the Rocker Reunion movement, left, Father Graham Hullet of the [[59 Club]], seated on motorcycle, at [[Royal Enfield|Enfield Motorcycles]] factory, UK.]]
The rockers' look and attitude influenced pop groups in the 1960s, such as [[The Beatles]],&lt;ref name="perone" /&gt; as well as [[hard rock]] and [[punk rock]] bands and fans in the late 1970s. The look of the ton-up boy and rocker was accurately portrayed in the 1964 film ''The Leather Boys''. The rocker subculture has also influenced the [[rockabilly]] revival and the [[psychobilly]] subculture.

Many contemporary rockers still wear [[engineer boot]]s or full-length motorcycle boots, but [[Winklepickers]] (sharp pointed shoes) are no longer common. Some wear brothel creepers (originally worn by [[Teddy Boys]]), or [[combat boot]]s. Rockers have continued to wear leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with patches, studs, spikes and painted artwork; jeans or leather trousers; and white silk scarves. Leather caps adorned with metal studs and chains, common among rockers in the 1950s and 1960s, are rarely seen any more. Instead, some contemporary rockers wear a classic woollen [[flat cap]].

==Rocker reunions==
In the early 1970s, the British rocker and hardcore motorcycle scene fractured and evolved under new influences coming from California: the [[hippie]]s and the [[Hells Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, Brian (2006), Crossing the River, Edinburgh: Mainstream, {{ISBN|1-84018-976-2}}, OCLC 63400905&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining rockers became known as greasers, and the scene had all but died out.

In the early 1980s, a Rockers revival was started by Lennie Paterson and a handful of original rockers. Paterson organized rocker reunion dances called ''piss-ups'', which attracted individuals from as far as Europe. The first rocker reunion motorcycle run of 30 classic British motorcycles rode to Battersea Following runs went to other destinations with historic relevance to Rockers such as [[Brighton]].

In 1994 Mark Wilsmore&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cycleworld.com/2012/09/17/the-ace-cafe Cycle World: The Ace Café. Riding the Reunion]&lt;/ref&gt; and others organised the first [[Ace Cafe|Ace Cafe Reunion]] to mark the 25th anniversary of the closure of the famous transport cafe before going on to re-opening and established a series of events.&lt;ref&gt;Missy D.

{{nihongo|'''''Serial Experiments Lain'''''|シリアルエクスペリメンツレイン|Shiriaru Ekusuperimentsu Rein}} is a [[science fiction]] [[anime]] series directed by [[Ryūtarō Nakamura]], with character design by [[Yoshitoshi ABe]], screenplay written by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], and produced by [[Yasuyuki Ueda]] for [[Triangle Staff]]. It was broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] from July to September 1998. The series is influenced by themes such as [[reality]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[communication]],&lt;ref name="laineva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Susan J.|authorlink=Susan J. Napier|date=November 2002|title=When the Machines Stop: Fantasy, Reality, and Terminal Identity in ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' and ''Serial Experiments Lain''|journal=Science Fiction Studies|volume=29|issue=88|pages=418–435|issn=0091-7729|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/abstracts/a88.htm#Napier|accessdate=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it demonstrates them by using [[philosophy]], [[History of computing hardware|computer history]], [[cyberpunk]] literature and [[conspiracy theory]].

== Plot ==
The series focuses on Lain Iwakura, an [[adolescent]] [[middle school]] girl living in suburban Japan, and her introduction to the Wired, a global [[computer network|communications network]] which is similar to the Internet. Lain lives with her middle-class family, which consists of her inexpressive older sister Mika, her emotionally distant mother, and her computer-obsessed father; while Lain herself is somewhat awkward, introverted, and socially isolated from most of her school peers. But the status-quo of her life becomes upturned by a series of bizarre incidents that start to take place after she learns that girls from her school have received an e-mail from a dead student, Chisa Yomoda, and she pulls out her old computer in order to check for the same message. Lain finds Chisa telling her that she is not dead, but has merely "abandoned her physical body and flesh" and is alive deep within the virtual reality-world of the Wired itself, where she has found the almighty and divine "[[God]]". From this point, Lain is caught up in a series of cryptic and surreal events that see her delving deeper into the mystery of the network in a narrative that explores themes of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.

The "Wired" is a [[Virtual world|virtual reality-world]] that contains and supports the very sum of ''all'' human communication and [[Telecommunications network|networks]], created with the [[telegraph]], [[televisions]], and [[telephone]] services, and expanded with the [[Internet]], [[cyberspace]], and subsequent networks. The series assumes that the Wired could be linked to a system that enables unconscious communication between people and machines without physical interface. The storyline introduces such a system with the [[Schumann resonances]], a property of the Earth's magnetic field that theoretically allows for unhindered long distance communications. If such a link were created, the network would become equivalent to Reality as the general [[consensus reality|consensus]] of all perceptions and knowledge. The increasingly thin invisible line between what is real and what is virtual/digital begins to slowly shatter.

Masami Eiri is introduced as the project director on Protocol Seven (the next-generation Internet protocol in the series' time-frame) for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories. He had secretly included [[computer programming|code]] of his very own creation to give himself absolute control of the Wired through the wireless system described above. He then "uploaded" his own [[brain]], [[conscience]], [[consciousness]], memory, feelings, emotions – his very self – into the Wired and "died" a few days after, leaving only his physical, living body behind. These details are unveiled around the middle of the series, but this is the point where the story of ''Serial Experiments Lain'' begins. Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and "abandon the flesh", as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of [[unconditional love]], romantic seduction and charm, and even, when all else fails, threats and force.

In the meantime, the anime follows a complex game of hide-and-seek between the "[[Knights of the Lambda Calculus|Knights of the Eastern Calculus]]", hackers whom Masami claims are "believers that enable him to be a God in the Wired", and Tachibana General Laboratories, who try to regain control of Protocol Seven. In the end, the viewer sees Lain realizing, after much [[introspection]], that she has absolute control over everyone's mind and over reality itself. Her dialogue with different versions of herself shows how she feels shunned from the material world, and how she is afraid to live in the Wired, where she has the possibilities and responsibilities of an almighty goddess. The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone's memories. She is last seen, unchanged, encountering her oldest and closest friend Alice once again, who is now married. Lain promises herself that she and Alice will surely meet again anytime as Lain can literally [[Omnipresence|go and be anywhere she desires between both worlds]].

== Characters ==
;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Lain Iwakura}}|岩倉 玲音|Iwakura Rein}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Kaori Shimizu (voice actress)|Kaori Shimizu]]|[[Bridget Hoffman]]}}
:The titular character of the series. Lain is a fourteen-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through the series. She is first depicted as a shy [[Middle school|junior high school]] student with few friends or interests. She later grows multiple bolder personalities, both in the physical world and the Wired, and starts making more friends. As the series progresses, she eventually comes to discover that she is, in reality, merely an [[Autonomy|autonomous]], [[Sentience|sentient]] [[computer program]] in the physical and corporeal form of a human being, designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real world. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a ''de facto'' [[goddess]] for the Wired, having become an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]] virtual being with worshippers of her own, as well as an ability to exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Masami Eiri}}|英利 政美|Eiri Masami}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Shō Hayami]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}
: The key designer of Protocol Seven. While working for Tachibana General Laboratories, he illicitly included codes enabling him to control the whole protocol at will and embedded his own mind and will into the seventh protocol. Because of this, he was fired by Tachibana General Laboratories, and was found dead not long after. He believes that the only way for humans to evolve even further and develop even greater abilities is to absolve themselves of their physical and human limitations, and to live as virtual entities—or [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]]—in the Wired for eternity. He claims to have been Lain's creator all along, but was in truth standing in for another, who was waiting for the Wired to reach its more evolved current state.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Yasuo Iwakura}}|岩倉 康男|Iwakura Yasuo}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ryūsuke Ōbayashi]]|[[Barry Stigler]]}}
:Lain's father. Passionate about computers and electronic communication, he works with Masami Eiri at Tachibana General Laboratories. He subtly pushes Lain, his "youngest daughter", towards the Wired and monitors her development until she becomes more and more aware of herself and of her ''raison d'être''. He eventually leaves Lain, telling her that although he did not enjoy playing house, he genuinely loved and cared for her as a real father would. Despite Yasuo's eagerness to lure Lain into the Wired, he warns her not to get overly involved in it or to confuse it with the real world.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Miho Iwakura}}|岩倉 ミホ|Iwakura Miho}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Rei Igarashi]]|[[Petrea Burchard]]}}
:Lain's mother. Although she dotes on Mika, she is indifferent towards Lain. Like her husband, she ends up leaving Lain.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Alice Mizuki}}|瑞城 ありす|Mizuki Arisu}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Yōko Asada]]|[[Emilie Brown]]}}
:Lain's classmate and only true friend throughout the series. She is very sincere and has no discernable quirks. She is the first to attempt to help Lain socialize; she takes her out to a nightclub. From then on, she tries her best to look after Lain. Alice, along with her two best friends Julie and Reika, were taken by Chiaki Konaka from his previous work, ''Alice in Cyberland''.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Mika Iwakura}}|岩倉 美香|Iwakura Mika}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Patricia Ja Lee]]}}
:Lain's older sister, an apathetic sixteen-year-old high school student. She seems to enjoy mocking Lain's behavior and interests. Mika is considered by ''Anime Revolution'' to be the only normal member of Lain's family:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323032932/http://www.anime-revolution.com/anime/sel-character-profiles |archivedate=March 23, 2007|url=http://www.anime-revolution.com/anime/sel-character-profiles|title=[SEL] Character Profiles|work=Anime Revolution|accessdate=December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; she sees her boyfriend in [[love hotel]]s, is on a diet, and shops in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. At a certain point in the series, she becomes heavily traumatized by violent hallucinations; while Lain begins freely delving into the Wired, Mika is taken there by her proximity to Lain, and she gets stuck between the real world and the Wired.&lt;ref name="otakon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjas.org/~leng/o2klain.htm |title=Otakon Lain Panel Discussion with Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi ABe |accessdate=September 16, 2006 |date=August 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Taro}}|タロウ|Tarō}}
:{{Voiced by|Keito Takimoto|[[Brianne Siddall]]}}
:A young boy of about Lain's age. He occasionally works for the Knights to bring forth "the one truth". Despite this, he has not yet been made a member, and knows nothing of their true intentions. Taro loves [[Virtual reality|VR]] games and hangs out all day at Cyberia  with his friends, Myu-Myu and Masayuki. He uses special technology, such as custom Handi Navi and video goggles. Taro takes pride in his internet anonymity, and he asks Lain for a date with her Wired self in exchange for information.

;{{visible anchor|Office Worker}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]]|Richard Plantagenet}}
:A top executive from Tachibana General Laboratories. He has a personal agenda, which he carries out with the help of the Men in Black. He looks forward to the arrival of a real God through the Wired, and is the man behind the Knights' mass assassination. There are many things he doesn't know about Lain, but he'd rather ask questions about her than disclose his agenda.

;{{visible anchor|Men in Black}}
:{{nihongo|Karl Haushoffer|カール・ハウスホッファ|Kāru Hausuhoffa}}, {{voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]|[[Jamieson Price]]}}
:Lin Suixi ({{zh|c=林随錫|p=Lín Suíxī}}), {{voiced by|[[Jouji Nakata]]|[[Bob Buchholz]]}}
:The Men in Black work for the above "Office Worker" in tracking down and murdering all of the members of the Knights. They are not told the true plan, but they know that Masami Eiri is somehow involved, despite having been "killed." They see no need for an almighty, all-powerful God—let alone Lain—in the Wired.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Chisa Yomoda}}|ヨモダ チサ|Yomoda Chisa}}
:{{Voiced by|Sumi Mutoh|[[Lia Sargent]]}}
:A teenage girl who committed suicide at the beginning of the series. After her death, she e-mails Lain, Julie, and a few other kids, saying that she's still alive in the Wired.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Reika Yamamoto}}|山本 レイカ|Yamamoto Reika}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Chiharu Tezuka]]|[[Lenore Zann]]}} 
:One of Alice's friends from school. She doesn't seem to care for Lain, since she harasses her quite a lot. She's more serious than Julie, and also somewhat meaner.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Julie Kato}}|加藤 ジュリー|Katō Juri}}
:{{Voiced by|Manabi Mizuno|Alexis A. Edwards}}
:Another friend of Alice. She also harasses Lain, but not as severely as Reika does. She is sometimes insensitive to other people's feelings.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Masayuki}}|マサユキ}}
:{{Voiced by|Sora Fujima|}}
:Taro's best friend. He is usually seen hanging out with Taro and Myu-Myu.

== Production ==
''Serial Experiments Lain'' was conceived, as a series, to be original to the point of it being considered "an enormous risk" by its producer Yasuyuki Ueda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeland.com/index.php?rub=articles&amp;id=399|work=AnimeLand|publisher=Anime Manga Presse|title=Abe Yoshitoshi et Ueda Yasuyuki|last=Scipion|first=Johan|accessdate=September 16, 2006|language=French|date=2003-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Ueda had to answer repeated queries about a statement made in an ''[[Animerica]]'' interview.&lt;ref name="otakon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lainchat.htm|author=The Anime Colony|title=Online Lain Chat with Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi ABe|accessdate=September 16, 2006|date=August 7, 2000}}&lt;!--Note: The moderated part is also available here: http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/animemonday.html--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ueda"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804105225/http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=32&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2008-08-04|url=http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=32&amp;page=1|title=Anime Jump!: Lain Men:Yasuyuki Ueda|accessdate=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial statement said ''Lain'' was "a sort of cultural war against American culture and the American sense of values we &lt;nowiki&gt;[Japan]&lt;/nowiki&gt; adopted after [[World War II]]".&lt;ref name="Animerica"&gt;''[[Animerica]]'', (Vol. 7 No. 9, p. 29)&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained in numerous interviews that he created ''Lain'' with a set of values he took as distinctly Japanese; he hoped Americans would not understand the series as the Japanese would. This would lead to a "war of ideas" over the meaning of the anime, hopefully culminating in new communication between the two cultures. When he discovered that the American audience held the same views on the series as the Japanese, he was disappointed.&lt;ref name="Ueda"/&gt;

The ''Lain'' franchise was originally conceived to connect across forms of media (anime, video games, manga). Producer [[Yasuyuki Ueda]] said in an interview, "the approach I took for this project was to communicate the essence of the work by the total sum of many media products". The scenario for the video game was written first, and the video game was produced at the same time as the anime series, though the series was released first. A [[dōjinshi]] titled "The Nightmare of Fabrication" was produced by Yoshitoshi ABe and released in Japanese in the artbook ''Omnipresence in the Wired''. Ueda and Konaka declared in an interview that the idea of a multimedia project was not unusual in Japan, as opposed to the contents of ''Lain'', and the way they are exposed.&lt;ref name="Animerica2"/&gt;

=== Writing ===
The authors were asked in interviews if they had been influenced by ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', in the themes and graphic design. This was strictly denied by writer [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] in an interview, arguing that he had not seen ''Evangelion'' until he finished the fourth episode of ''Lain''. Being primarily a horror movies writer, his stated influences are [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] (especially for using typography on screen), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''Hell House'', and [[Dan Curtis]]'s ''[[House of Dark Shadows]]''. Alice's name, like the names of her two friends Julie and Reika, came from a previous production from Konaka, ''Alice in Cyberland'', which in turn was largely influenced by ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. As the series developed, Konaka was "surprised" by how close Alice's character became to the original ''Wonderland'' character.&lt;ref name="HK"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2000|title=Serial Experiments Lain|journal=[[HK Magazine]]|issue=14|publisher=Asia City Publishing|location=Hong Kong}} in {{cite web|url=http://www.konaka.com/alice6/lain/hk.html|title=HK Interview|publisher=[[Chiaki J.

[[File:Lain hacker small.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=A young girl in a white shift sits with her back to us in the dark, focusing her attention on many glowing computer screens which surround her.|Lain's custom computer features holographic displays and liquid carbon dioxide cooling.]]

[[Vannevar Bush]] (and [[memex]]), [[John C. Lilly]], [[Timothy Leary]] and his [[eight-circuit model of consciousness]], [[Ted Nelson]] and [[Project Xanadu]] are cited as precursors to the Wired.&lt;ref name="Animerica2"&gt;[[Animerica]], (Vol. 7 No. 9, p.28)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Rushkoff]] and his book ''[[Cyberia (book)|Cyberia]]'' were originally to be cited as such,&lt;ref name="otakon"/&gt; and in ''Lain'' Cyberia became the name of a nightclub populated with hackers and techno-punk teenagers. Likewise, the series' ''[[deus ex machina]]'' lies in the conjunction of the [[Schumann resonances]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]] (the authors chose this term over [[Kabbalah]] and [[Akashic records|Akashic Record]]).&lt;ref name="Animerica"/&gt; [[Majestic 12]] and the [[Roswell UFO incident]] are used as examples of how a hoax might still affect history, even after having been exposed as such, by creating sub-cultures.&lt;ref name=Animerica/&gt; This links again to Vannevar Bush, the alleged "brains" of MJ12. Two of the literary references in ''Lain'' are quoted through Lain's father: he first logs onto a website with the password "Think Bule Count One Tow" ("[[Think Blue, Count Two]]" is an [[Instrumentality of Mankind|Instrumentality of Man]] story featuring virtual persons projected as real ones in people's minds);&lt;ref name="ep1"&gt;''Serial Experiments Lain'', "Layer 01: WEIRD"&lt;/ref&gt; and his saying that "[[Madeleine (cake)|madeleines]] would be good with the tea" in the last episode makes ''Lain'' "perhaps the only cartoon to allude to [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]".&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-gazette.com/cinereviews/860 |title=Movie Gazette: "Serial Experiments Lain Volume : Reset" Review |accessdate=October 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060521165608/http://www.movie-gazette.com/cinereviews/860 |archivedate = May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Yasuo:''' "I will bring madeleines next time. They will taste good with the tea." ''Serial Experiments Lain'', Episode 13, "Ego". Lain has just erased herself from her friends' memories, while for Proust the taste of madeleines triggers memories of his childhood.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character design ===
[[File:Lain Haircut.JPG|Right|thumb|250px|alt=A young girl in a white shift kneels facing us with scissors in her hand, and hanks of her own hair on the ground, leaving one forelock uncut. The background is blue.|ABe came up with Lain's hair by imagining Lain cutting it herself and making a ponytail of what was left.&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt; This was later included in his ''Omnipresence in the Wired'' artbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ABe|first=Yoshitoshi|title=Omnipresence In The Wired|chapter=Hair cut 01-04|publisher=Pioneer LDC|language=Japanese|year=1998|isbn=4-7897-1343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Yoshitoshi ABe]] confesses to have never read manga as a child, as it was "off-limits" in his household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=33&amp;page=1 |title=Anime Jump!: Lain Men: Yoshitoshi ABe |accessdate=September 16, 2006 |year=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510030644/http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=33&amp;page=1 |archivedate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His major influences are "nature and everything around him".&lt;ref name="otakon"/&gt; Specifically speaking about Lain's character, ABe was inspired by [[Kenji Tsuruta]], [[Akihiro Yamada]], [[Range Murata]] and [[Yukinobu Hoshino]].&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt; In a broader view, he has been influenced in his style and technique by Japanese artists Chinai-san and Tabuchi-san.&lt;ref name="otakon"/&gt;

The character design of Lain was not ABe's sole responsibility. Her distinctive left forelock for instance was a demand from Yasuyuki Ueda. The goal was to produce asymmetry to reflect Lain's unstable and disconcerting nature.&lt;ref name="fruits"&gt;''FRUiTS Magazine'' No. 15, October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a mystical symbol, as it is supposed to prevent voices and spirits from being heard by the left ear.&lt;ref name="chat"/&gt; The bear pajamas she wears were a demand from [[character animation]] director Takahiro Kishida. Though bears are a trademark of the Konaka brothers, Chiaki Konaka first opposed the idea.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; Director Nakamura then explained how the bear motif could be used as a shield for confrontations with her family. It is a key element of the design of the shy "real world" Lain (see "mental illness" under [[#Themes|Themes]]).&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; When she first goes to the Cyberia [[nightclub]], she wears a bear hat for similar reasons.&lt;ref name="fruits"/&gt; The pajamas were finally considered as possible [[Fan service|fan-service]] by Konaka, in the way they enhance Lain's [[nymph]] aspect.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt;

ABe's original design was generally more complicated than what finally appeared on screen. As an example, the X-shaped hairclip was to be an interlocking pattern of gold links. The links would open with a snap, or rotate around an axis until the moment the " X " became a " = ". This was not used as there is no scene where Lain takes her hairclip off.&lt;ref name="MAX2"&gt;''Manga Max'' magazine, September 1999, p. 22, "Unreal to Real"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
''Serial Experiments Lain'' is not a conventionally linear story, but "an alternative anime, with modern themes and realization".&lt;ref&gt;''Benkyo!'' Magazine, March 1999, p.16, "In My Humble Opinion"&lt;/ref&gt; Themes range from theological to psychological and are dealt with in a number of ways: from classical dialogue to image-only introspection, passing by direct interrogation of imaginary characters.

[[Communication]], in its wider sense, is one of the main themes of the series,&lt;ref name="THEM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=353|title=T.H.E.M.Anime Review of Serial Experiments Lain|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only as opposed to loneliness, but also as a subject in itself. Writer Konaka said he wanted to directly "communicate human feelings". Director Nakamura wanted to show the audience — and particularly viewers between 14 and 15—"the multidimensional wavelength of the [[Existentialism|existential self]]: the relationship between self and the world".&lt;ref name="Animerica2"/&gt;

[[Loneliness]], if only as representing a lack of communication, is recurrent through ''Lain''.&lt;ref name="DVDoutsider"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdoutsider.co.uk/dvd/reviews/s/serial_experiments_lain.html |title=DVDoutsider Review of Serial Experiments Lain |accessdate=November 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305015738/http://www.dvdoutsider.co.uk/dvd/reviews/s/serial_experiments_lain.html |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lain herself (according to Anime Jump) is "almost painfully introverted with no friends to speak of at school, a snotty, condescending sister, a strangely apathetic mother, and a father who seems to want to care but is just too damn busy to give her much of his time".&lt;ref name="AnimeJump"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&amp;func=showcontent&amp;id=201|first=Mike|last=Toole|title=Anime Jump!: Serial Experiments Lain Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610033719/http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&amp;func=showcontent&amp;id=201 |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |date=October 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendships turn on the first rumor;&lt;ref name="DVDoutsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 08: RUMORS&lt;/ref&gt; and the only insert song of the series is named ''Kodoku no shigunaru'', literally "signal of loneliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animelyrics.tv/anime/lain/|title=List of Serial Experiments Lain songs|accessdate=December 7, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113231952/http://animelyrics.tv/anime/lain/|archivedate=January 13, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lain Split Personnalities.JPG|left|thumb|250px|alt=A series of drawings depicting the different personalities of Lain—the first shows shy body language, the second shows bolder body language, and the third grins in an unhinged fashion.|The different personalities of Lain have their names written using different scripts.]]

[[Mental illness]], especially [[dissociative identity disorder]], is a significant theme in ''Lain'':&lt;ref name="MAX2"/&gt; the main character is constantly confronted with alter-egos, to the point where writer Chiaki Konaka and Lain's voice actress Kaori Shimizu had to agree on subdividing the character's dialogues between three different [[Orthography|orthographs]].&lt;ref name="MAX2"/&gt; The three names designate distinct "versions" of Lain: the real-world, "childish" Lain has a shy attitude and bear pajamas. The "advanced" Lain, her Wired personality, is bold and questioning. Finally, the "evil" Lain is sly and devious, and does everything she can to harm Lain or the ones close to her.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; As a writing convention, the authors spelled their respective names in [[kanji]], [[katakana]], and [[Romanization of Japanese|roman]] characters (see picture).&lt;ref name="visual"&gt;{{cite book|last=ABe|first=Yoshitoshi|title=Visual Experiments Lain|year=1998|publisher=Triangle Staff/Pioneer LDC.|isbn=4-7897-1342-3}}, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reality]] never has the pretense of objectivity in ''Lain''.&lt;ref name="MAX"&gt;''Manga Max'' Magazine, September 1999, p. 21, "God's Eye View"&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptations of the term are battling throughout the series, such as the "natural" reality, defined through normal dialogue between individuals; the material reality; and the tyrannic reality, enforced by one person onto the minds of others.&lt;ref name="DVDoutsider"/&gt; A key debate to all interpretations of the series is to decide whether matter flows from thought, or the opposite.&lt;ref name="DVDoutsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serial Experiments Lain, Layer 06: KIDS: "your physical body exists only to confirm your existence".&lt;/ref&gt; The production staff carefully avoided "the so-called God's Eye Viewpoint" to make clear the "limited field of vision" of the world of ''Lain''.&lt;ref name=MAX/&gt;

[[Theology]] plays its part in the development of the story too. ''Lain'' has been viewed as a questioning of the possibility of an infinite spirit in a finite body.&lt;ref name="Univ"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060302194747/http://www.ahcca.unimelb.edu.au/refractory/journalissues/vol3/colman.htm Study on ''Lain'', ''Buffy'', and ''Attack of the clones''] by Felicity J. Coleman, lecturer at the University of Melbourne. From the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; From self-realization as a goddess to [[deicide]],&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; religion (the title of a layer) is an inherent part of ''Lain''{{'s}} background.&lt;ref name="Univ"/&gt;

===Apple computers===
''Lain'' contains extensive references to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers, as the brand was used at the time by most of the creative staff, such as writers, producers, and the graphical team.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; As an example, the title at the beginning of each episode is announced by the Apple computer [[speech synthesis]] program  [[PlainTalk]], using the voice ''"Whisper"'', e.g. &lt;code&gt;say -v Whisper "Weird: Layer zero one"&lt;/code&gt;. Tachibana Industries, the company that creates the NAVI computers, is a reference to Apple computers: "tachibana" means "Mandarin orange" in Japanese. NAVI is the abbreviation of [[Knowledge Navigator]], and the HandiNAVI is based on the [[Apple Newton]], one of the world's first [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. The NAVIs are seen to run "Copland OS Enterprise" (this reference to [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] was an initiative of [[Chiaki J. Konaka|Konaka]], a declared Apple fan),&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; and Lain's and Alice's NAVIs closely resembles the [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]] and the [[iMac]] respectively. The HandiNAVI programming language, as seen on the seventh episode, is a dialect of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. Notice that the Newton also used a Lisp dialect ([[NewtonScript]]). The program being typed by Lain can be found in the [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] repository;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/fun/life.cl|title=Conway's Game of Life|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a simple implementation of [[Conway's Game of Life]] in [[Common Lisp]].

During a series of disconnected images, an iMac and the [[Think Different]] advertising slogan appears for a short time, while the ''Whisper'' voice says it.&lt;ref name="INFORN"&gt;''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 11: INFORNOGRAPHY.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unsolicited insertion from the graphic team, also Mac-enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; Other subtle allusions can be found: "Close the world, Open the nExt" is the slogan for the ''Serial Experiments Lain'' video game. [[NeXT]] was the company that produced [[NeXTSTEP]], which later evolved into [[macOS|Mac OS X]] after Apple bought NeXT. Another example is "To Be Continued." at the end of episodes 1–12, with a blue "B" and a red "e" on "Be": ''this'' "Be" is the original logo of [[Be Inc.]], a company founded by ex-Apple employees and NeXT's main competitor in its time.&lt;ref name="Be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatjapan.org/mirror/www.be.com/ |title=Be, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031128123907/http://www.beincorporated.com/ |archivedate=November 28, 2003 |accessdate=November 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' opening theme, "Duvet", was written and performed by Jasmine Rodgers and the British band [[Bôa]]. The ending theme, {{nihongo|"Distant Scream"|遠い叫び|Tōi Sakebi}}, was written and composed by [[Reichi Nakaido]].

The anime series was licensed in North America by [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer Entertainment]] (later Geneon USA) on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[LaserDisc]] in 1999. However, the company closed its USA division in December 2007 and the series went out-of-print as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-09-26/geneon-usa-to-cancel-dvd-sales-distribution-by-friday|title=Geneon USA To Cancel DVD Sales, Distribution By Friday|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at [[Anime Expo]] 2010, North American distributor [[Funimation]] announced that it had obtained the license to the series and re-released it in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-02/funi-adds-live-action-moyashimon|title=Funi Adds Live Action Moyashimon Live Action, More|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also released in [[Singapore]] by [[Odex]].

|ShortSummary = At night, when Yasuo checks on Lain, he sees a dramatic change in her room arrangement and the upgrades on her NAVI computer system, which worries him. As Lain hangs out with Alice, along with Julie and Reika, in the district, she notices that children are looking up into the sky and raising their arms, only to realize that they are looking at an image of herself that appears in the sky. Lain searches for the reason behind the strange happenings and finds Professor Hodgeson, the creator of KIDS, an experiment that started fifteen years ago that tried to gather [[Parapsychology|psi]] energy from children and store it, though the result of the project destroyed the children. Now it seems that the Knights have gotten hold of the project's schematics. When the Men in Black return, Lain goes outside to see them. The coolant system in her room bursts, leading the Men in Black to confirm that the Knights planted a parasite bomb there.

|ShortSummary = As Lain gets more and more involved in the Wired world, albeit at home and at school, Alice starts to worry about her closing up again. It is reported that the Knights cracked the firewall of the information control center of the Wired. As the activity of the Knights begins to surface, the network is in search for Lain. The Men in Black ask Lain to follow them to an office in the Tachibana General Laboratories, where the [[Serial Experiments Lain#Office Worker|Office Worker]] in charge of the Men in Black, after her help of fixing his computer, shows Lain a projection of herself in the Wired taking out one of the members of the Knights. After the Office Worker deduces that Lain in the real world and in the Wired are one and the same, he questions her about her origins. However, she breaks down for not knowing, altering her timid personality to that of a more serious one before she shoves her way out of the room.

|ShortSummary = Lain's family has been acting weird lately, much to her surprise. Upon further investigation, Lain disbelieves that she is omnipresent in the Wired, while she is merely a body, more or less a projection of herself, in the real world. A rumor is spread in the Wired about Alice having sexual fantasies about a male teacher, and a second one says that Lain has spread the first. To cope with the distress of rejection, Lain acts directly on reality for the first time, finding out that she can "delete" the event of the rumors. A lookalike duplicate of herself with its own distinct personality starts appearing more frequently, which leads her to question her own existence.

|ShortSummary = Throughout the episode, background information is being shown from "archives". Information regarding the [[Roswell UFO incident]], the [[Majestic 12]], which was formed by president [[Harry S. Truman]], engineer [[Vannevar Bush]], who developed what is called [[memex]], physician [[John C. Lilly]], who conducted experiments with [[cetacean intelligence|dolphin communication]], pioneer [[Ted Nelson]], who founded [[Project Xanadu]], and the [[Schumann resonances]] are all mentioned, explaining how the human consciousness can be communicated through a network without the use of a device. It is also noted that a man named [[#Masami Eiri|Masami Eiri]] has suddenly committed suicide. During that time, Lain gets a computer microchip from J.J., the disc jockey from Cyberia. She then asks Taro on a "date" and takes him to her home, where she asks him about the microchip. After becoming frightened, he admits it is a computer code made to disrupt human memory, and it was made by the Knights. Although he defends them, he admits not knowing much about them. He later kisses Lain before leaving.

|ShortSummary = As both are seen to have switched bodies, Eiri introduces himself to Lain as the creator of Protocol Seven, saying that Lain no longer needs to have a body in order to be alive. As she, back in her own body, comes home, Yasuo says his farewell after realizing she knows the truth behind her existence. Eiri is considered the God of the Wired because he explained that he is worshiped by the Knights. Knowing this, Lain deals with the Knights once and for all by leaking a list of all of its members onto the Wired, leaving a trail of murder by the Men in Black and suicide in its wake. Even with the Knights gone, Eiri still claims he is the God of the Wired, since he says that the real Lain exists in the Wired, not the real world.

|ShortSummary = Lain lies exhausted in her room to find herself all wrapped in electrical cord. After a really long and complicated memory flashback, seen throughout the series, Eiri appears to congratulate her for having succeeded in downloading her NAVI in her own brain to see and hear all that is happening, but warns her about her "hardware capacity" and that she is merely a [[sentient]] and [[autonomous]] software computer program with a physical human body. Lain later appears to Alice in her room to make things right with her again concerning the false rumors. Lain declares that anything is possible now, as devices are no longer needed anymore to enter the Wired. The next day, nobody seems to remember the rumored incidents and Lain smiles at Alice's complicity.

|ShortSummary = Lain witnesses the frontier between the physical and the Wired worlds finally beginning to collapse. The Men in Black are approached by their Officer Worker, who gives them a final "payment" for their services, telling them to leave town away from any power lines or satellite coverage. After he leaves, both Men in Black suffer death from an image of Lain etched in their retinas. Alice enters Lain's eerie house and goes inside her room. Lain explains that she is actually a computerized program designed to destroy the barrier between the two worlds. Lain is still affixed on the fact that humans no longer need a physical body to stay alive, but Alice shows that her heartbeat proves otherwise. Suddenly, Eiri, first unseen to Alice, appears behind Lain, assuming she needs to be "debugged". Lain argues that Eiri was just an "acting god", for she is the true Goddess of the Wired. Eiri retaliates by transforming into a monstrous form to attain the vastly limitless power and strength that she possesses, but Lain manages to crush Eiri with her electrical equipment.

|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1998|9|28}}
|ShortSummary = Lain's attempts to protect Alice from Eiri result in traumatizing Alice, Lain's only true friend; in order to fix this, Lain decides to do a "factory reset" on her life, deleting herself from everyone's memory. Distraught from doing so, Lain is determined to discover her true form and identity and takes radical action. She is confronted by her separate bolder self, who reminds her that the Wired is not an upper layer of the real world. Her bolder self then assures her that she is the true Goddess of the Wired, saying she is an omnipotent and omnipresent virtual being that can go and be anywhere she desires and merely watch the real world from afar. After causing her bolder self to disappear, Lain sees her father. Alice, now older with a spouse, spots Lain standing on an overpass, having some ''[[déjà vu]]'' about Lain but not recognizing who she is. Alice then says goodbye, saying that she might run into Lain someday.

===Soundtracks===
The first [[original soundtrack]], ''Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack'', features music by [[Reichi Nakaido]]: the ending theme and part of the television series' score, alongside other songs inspired by the series. The second, ''Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack: Cyberia Mix'', features [[electronica]] songs inspired by the television series, including a remix of the opening theme "Duvet" by DJ Wasei. The third, ''lain BOOTLEG'', consists of the ambient score of the series across forty-five tracks. ''BOOTLEG'' also contains a second mixed-mode data and audio disc, containing a clock program and a game, as well as an extended version of the first disc – nearly double the length – across 57 tracks in 128 kbps [[MP3]] format, and sound effects from the series in [[WAV]] format. Because the word ''[[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]'' appears in its title, it is easily confused with the Sonmay [[copyright infringement|counterfeit edition]] of itself, which only contains the first disc in an edited format. All three soundtrack albums were released by [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer Records]].

The series' opening theme, "[[Twilight (Bôa album)|Duvet]]", was written and performed in English by the British rock band [[Bôa]]. The band released the song as a single and as part of the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Tall Snake]]'', which features both an acoustic version and DJ Wasei's remix from ''Cyberia Mix''.

===Video game===
On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC released a video game with the same name as the anime for the [[PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005OVPO/|title=Serial Experiments Lain|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki, and made to be a "network simulator" in which the player would navigate to explore Lain's story.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; The creators themselves did not call it a game, but "Psycho-Stretch-Ware",&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; and it has been described as being a kind of [[graphic novel]]: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little or no puzzle needed to unlock.&lt;ref name="GAF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=67 |title=Games Are Fun: "Review – Serial Experiments Lain – Japan" |date=2003-04-25 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061706/http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=67 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lain distances itself even more from classical games by the [[random]] order in which information is collected.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; The aim of the authors was to let the player get the feeling that there are myriads of informations that they would have to sort through, and that they would have to do with less than what exists to understand.&lt;ref name="HK"/&gt; As with the anime, the creative team's main goal was to let the player "feel" Lain, and "to understand her problems, and to love her".&lt;ref name="Animerica2"/&gt; A guidebook to the game called ''Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide'' ({{ISBN|4-07-310083-1}}) was released the same month by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4073100831/|script-title=ja:シリアルエクスペリメンツレイン公式ガイド|trans-title=Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 25, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Serial Experiments Lain'' was first broadcast in [[Tokyo]] at 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Japan Standard Time|JST]].

Critics responded positively to these thematic and stylistic characteristics, and it was awarded an Excellence Prize by the 1998 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] for "its willingness to question the meaning of contemporary life" and the "extraordinarily philosophical and deep questions" it asks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/backnumber/10/sakuhin/serial.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426014853/http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/backnumber/10/sakuhin/serial.html |archivedate=2007-04-26|author=Japan Media Arts Plaza|title=1998 (2nd) Japan Media Arts Festival: Excellence Prize – serial experiments lain|accessdate=September 16, 2006|year=1998}}From the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian Nutt from ''[[Newtype USA]]'', the main attraction to the series is its keen view on "the interlocking problems of identity and technology". Nutt saluted Abe's "crisp, clean character design" and the "perfect soundtrack" in his 2005 review of series, saying that "''Serial Experiments Lain'' might not yet be considered a true classic, but it's a fascinating evolutionary leap that helped change the future of anime."&lt;ref name="newtype"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nutt|first=Christian|date=January 2005|title=Serial Experiments Lain DVD Box Set: Lost in the Wired|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|volume=4|issue=1|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anime Jump'' gave it 4.5/5,&lt;ref name="AnimeJump"/&gt; and Anime on DVD gave it A+ on all criteria for volume 1 and 2, and a mix of A and A+ for volume 3 and 4.&lt;ref name="referencekatamari"/&gt;
''Lain'' was subject to commentary in the literary and academic worlds. The ''Asian Horror Encyclopedia'' calls it "an outstanding psycho-horror anime about the psychic and spiritual influence of the Internet".&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Laurence C.|title=Asian Horror Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Writers Club Press|isbn=0-595-20181-4}}, page 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that the red spots present in all the shadows look like blood pools (see picture). It notes the death of a girl in a train accident is "a source of much ghost lore in the twentieth century", more so in Tokyo.

The ''Anime Essentials'' anthology by [[Gilles Poitras]] describes it as a "complex and somehow existential" anime that "pushed the envelope" of anime diversity in the 1990s, alongside the much better known ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''.&lt;ref name="essential"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poitras|first=Gilles|title=Anime Essentials|date=December 2001|publisher=Stone Bridge Press, LLC|isbn=1-880656-53-1 }}, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Susan J. Napier]], in her 2003 reading to the [[American Philosophical Society]] called ''The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation'' (published 2005), compared ''Serial Experiments Lain'' to ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]''.&lt;ref name="Napier APS"&gt;{{cite journal|format=pdf|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4598910?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103042300713|title=The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation|first=Susan J., Dr.|last=Napier|authorlink=Susan J.

Napier asks whether there is something to which Lain should return, "between an empty 'real' and a dark 'virtual'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Napier|2005|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Toole of [[Anime News Network]] named ''Serial Experiments Lain'' as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toole|first1=Mike|title=Evangel-a-like - The Mike Toole Show|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2011-06-05|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=20 November 2015|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the anime, the video game drew little attention from the public.&lt;ref name="GAF"/&gt; Criticized for its (lack of) gameplay, as well as for its "clunky interface", interminable dialogues, absence of music and very long loading times,&lt;ref name="GAF"/&gt; it was nonetheless remarked for its (at the time) remarkable CG graphics, and its beautiful backgrounds.&lt;ref name="GAF"/&gt;

Despite the positive feedback the television series had received, Anime Academy gave this series a 75%, partly due to the "lifeless" setting it had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeacademy.com/finalrevdisplay.php?id=201 |title=Serial Experiments: Lain |date=2002-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060034/http://www.animeacademy.com/finalrevdisplay.php?id=201 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Poirier of ''EX'' magazine stated that the last three episodes fail to resolve the questions in other DVD volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/5.2/25-anime_followup_lain.html |title=Serial Experiments Lain - Buried Treasure |date=2000-05-11 |accessdate=2015-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826092828/http://www.ex.org/5.2/25-anime_followup_lain.html |archivedate=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network noted that the English dub was decent, but that the show relied so little on dialogue that it hardly mattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2008-11-20/serial-experiments-lain|title=Serial Experiments Lain - Buried Treasure|date=2008-11-20|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social studies the practice of promoting a [[student]] (usually a general education student, rather than a [[special education]] student) to the next [[Educational stage|grade]] after the current school year, regardless of if they learned the necessary material or if they are often absent. This is done in order to keep the students with their peers by age, that being the intended social grouping. It is sometimes referred to as promotion based on '''seat time''', or the amount of time the child spent sitting in school. This is based on the enrollment criteria for Kindergarten, which is being 4 or 5 years old (5 or 6 years old for 1st graders) at the beginning of the school year. The intention is for the students to be able to graduate from high school level education before their 19th birthday.

Advocates of social promotion argue that promotion is done in order not to harm the students' or their classmates' [[self-esteem]], to encourage socialization by age (together with their [[Cohort (statistics)|age cohort]]), to facilitate student involvement in sports teams, or to promote a student who is weak in one subject on the basis of strength in the other areas.

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], social promotion is normally limited to [[primary education]], because comprehensive [[secondary education]] is more flexible about determining which level of students take which classes due to the graduation requirements, which makes the concept of social promotion much less meaningful.
 
In some countries, [[grade retention]] is allowed when students haven't learned the necessary material or if they are often absent.

The opposite of social promotion would be to promote students once they learned the necessary material. This might be called "merit promotion", similar to the concept of a "merit civil service". The scope of the promotion might then be either to the next grade or to the next course in the same field. In a curriculum based on grades, this is usually called "mid-term promotion". In a curriculum based on courses rather than grades, the promotion is open-ended and is better understood as satisfying a prerequisite for the next course.

==Pros==
Supporters of social promotion policies do not defend social promotion so much as say that [[grade retention|retention]] is even worse. They argue that retention is not a cost-effective response to poor performance when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as additional tutoring and summer school. They point to a wide range of research findings that show no advantage to, or even harm from, retention, and the tendency for gains from retention to wash out.

Harm from grade retention cited by these critics include:
* Increased drop-out rates of repeaters over time
* This may be proven true by data from studies by Allenseorth (2005), and the data recorded by Frey (2005) where drop out rates in Minnesota schools for non-repeaters nearly doubled from non-repeaters at 12.4% and to retained student drop out rates jumping to 27.2%
* No evidence of long-term academic benefit for retained students
* Increased rates of [[mental disorders]] and dangerous behaviors such as drinking, drug-use, crime, teenage pregnancy, depression, and suicide among repeaters as compared with similarly performing promoted students.
* Feeling left out with kids from different age groups, which means that being too old may lead to bullying, having fewer friends, and being ridiculed.

Critics of retention also note that retention has hard financial costs for school systems: requiring a student to repeat a grade is essentially to add one student for a year to the school system, assuming that the student does not drop out. Some parents worry that older retained students will victimize younger students.

==Cons==
Opponents of social promotion argue that it cheats children of education. When socially promoted children reach higher levels of education, they may be unprepared, may fail courses, and may not make normal progress towards graduation.

Opponents of social promotion argue that it has the following negative impacts:
* Students who have to wait for the end of the school year to move on to more advanced studies are denied present success.
* Students promoted to a class for which they are known to be unable to do the work are positioned for further failure.
* Students can have so many easy successes during subsequent years that either their study skills deteriorate or they become so frustrated with banal lessons that they drop out.
* Students can have many failures during the subsequent years, which is frustrating for them and may increase the risk of dropping out.
* Their frustration at sitting through "baby classes" can lead to classroom disruptions or the humiliation of others.
* Their frustration can lead to classroom disruptions, which can diminish the achievement of others.
* It sends the message to all students that they can get by without working hard.
* It forces the next teacher to deal with already-prepared and under-prepared students while trying to teach the prepared
* It gives parents and students a false sense of their children's progress.
* It creates social fiefdoms of same-age peers, their consequent peer pressure causing bullying and drug abuse.

Some hold that most students at the elementary school level don't take their education seriously and therefore retention is most likely not to be effective. Since most middle school students value their education more {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, retention should be used if they are judged not to have adequate skills before entering high school.

It can also be argued that social promotion, by keeping most students at the elementary school level from advancing at their own pace, is the reason they don't take their education seriously. Eliminating the social promotion system would then make the incentives of merit promotion more effective at the beginning of each student's academic career.

== Statistics ==
In the United States,  retention is more common for boys and non-white students than it is for girls and white students. By the time students reach high school, the retention rate for boys is about ten percentage points higher than for girls. In the early grades, retention rates are similar among [[white Americans]], [[African Americans]], and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic Americans]]. By high school, the rate is about 15 percentage points higher for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites.{{full citation needed|date=April 2012}}

There is much to be said about social promotion and retention. If students are socially promoted, some argue that they are being disadvantaged because they haven't learned the material. If they are retained, students will be older than their peers in the classroom, which may cause problems as well. African American boys are the group that are most often retained in school. By the time the students reach the ages of 15-17, 50% of African American boys are either below the grade of their peers that age or have dropped out of school. In contrast, only 30% of white girls ages 15–17 are below the modal grade of their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Robert M. Should We End Social Promotion? Truth and Consequences. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Center for Demography and Ecology The University of Wisconsin-Madison. Web. 20 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, educational researcher [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hauser/ Robert Hauser] said of the New York City school district:  "In its plan to end social promotion the administration appears to have [included] ... an enforcement provision—flunking kids by the carload lot—about which the great mass of evidence is strongly negative.  And this policy will hurt poor and minority children most of all." [Glavin, C. (2014, February 5). Studies. Retrieved from http://www.k12academics.com/education-issues/social-promotion/studies#.WSBLyLwrK8o]

In a study of 99,000 Florida students, Jay P. Greene and Marcus A. Winters [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/edfp.2007.2.4.319] found that "retained students slightly outperformed socially promoted students in reading in the first year after retention, and these gains increased substantially in the second year. Results were robust across two distinct IV comparisons: an across-year approach comparing students who were essentially separated by the year in which they happened to have been born, and a regression discontinuity design."

== History ==
With the proliferation of graded schools in the middle of the 19th century, retention became a common practice, as were mid-term promotions.  In fact, a century ago, approximately half of all American students were retained at least once before the age of 13.&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;Rose, Janet S.;  et al.  "A Fresh Look at the Retention-Promotion Controversy."  Journal of School Psychology, v21 n3 p201-11 Fall 1983. [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ292730&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ292730]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social promotion began to spread in the 1930s along with concerns about the psychosocial effects of retention.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;  This trend reversed in the 1980s, as concern about slipping academic standards rose.

The practice of grade retention in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Leckrone, M. J. &amp; B. G. Griffith. (2006) “Retention realities and educational standards.” In ''Children &amp; Schools'' 28(1) p53-58  See article at http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/357610/retention_realities_and_educational_standards/&lt;/ref&gt; although local educational agencies may or may not follow this trend.  For example, in 1982, [[New York City]] schools stopped social promotions. Within a few years, the problems caused by the change in policy led the city to start social promotion again. In 1999, the city once again eliminated social promotion; it reinstated it after the number of repeaters had mounted to 100,000 by 2004, driving up costs and leading to cutbacks in numerous programs, including those for helping underachievers.

==Alternatives==
Apart from the social promotion, there is the [[grade retention]], in which students repeat a grade when they are judged to be a low performer. The aim of grade retention is to help the student learn and sharpen skills such as organization, management, [[study skills]], literacy and academic which are very important before entering the next grade, [[Higher education|college]] and the [[labor force]].

In the US simple social promotion was not held to be an adequate alternative to the grade retention.  Current theories among academic scholars prefer to address underperformance problems with remedial help. Students with singular needs or disabilities require special teaching approaches, equipment, or care within or outside a regular classroom. Since students with intellectual disabilities are handled separately, schools may treat two students with identical achievements differently, if one of the students is low-performing, but typically developing,  and the other student is low-performing due to a disability.

Apart from the social promotion, there is the merit promotion, either by mid-term promotion or by using a course-based curriculum with a directed acyclic graph of prerequisites similar to college curricula. This alternative is unique in allowing each student to advance at his or her own pace. It would also save school districts money by ending the practice of warehousing "talented and gifted students" and allowing those students to graduate early.

A '''state fair''' is an annual competitive and recreational gathering of a [[U.S. state]]'s population, usually held in late summer or early fall.  It is a larger version of a [[county fair]], often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their categories at the more-local county fairs.

State fairs began in the nineteenth century for the purpose of promoting state [[agriculture]], through competitive exhibitions of [[livestock]] and display of [[farm]] products. As the U.S. evolved from a predominantly [[agrarian society|agrarian]] to an [[industrial society]] in the twentieth century, and the more [[service economy]] of the 21st century,  modern state fairs have expanded to include [[carnival]] amusement rides and games, display of industrial products, automobile racing, and entertainment such as musical concerts.  Large fairs can admit more than a million visitors over the course of a week or two. The first U.S. state fair was that of [[Great New York State Fair|New York]], held in 1841 in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and has been held annually to the present year.&lt;ref name=su&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/encyclopedia/entries/new-york-state-fair.html|title=New York State Fair :: The Encyclopedia of New York State :: Syracuse University Press|author=|date=|website=www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second state fair was in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which ran from 1849&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/mistatefair/0,1607,7-109--12804--,00.html Michigan.gov]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125155839/http://www.michigan.gov/mistatefair/0,1607,7-109--12804--,00.html |date=November 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2009.&lt;ref name="freep.com"&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20091030/NEWS06/91030026/1322/Granholm-cuts-State-Fair-from-budget Granholm cuts State Fair from budget]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103032010/http://www.freep.com/article/20091030/NEWS06/91030026/1322/Granholm-cuts-State-Fair-from-budget |date=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="It's official: State Fair a goner"&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20091031/NEWS06/910310309/1001/News/Its-official-State-Fair-a-goner It's official: State Fair a goner ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103030456/http://www.freep.com/article/20091031/NEWS06/910310309/1001/News/Its-official-State-Fair-a-goner |date=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events similar to state fairs are also held annually in each state capital in [[Australia]], known as royal shows. Australian royal shows are organized by state agricultural and horticultural societies, and are described further in the [[agricultural show]] article.

== Awards ==
State and county fairs are famous for a variety of competitions that award ''ribbons''. Awards are generally given according to the following scale:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;ref name="It's official: State Fair a goner" /&gt;
* First place – blue ribbon
* Second place – red ribbon
* Third place – white ribbon
* Fourth place – yellow ribbon
* Fifth place – green ribbon
* Sixth place – orange ribbon
*Seventh place-purple ribbon
*Eighth place-brown ribbon

== Attendance ==
The largest attendance at a state fair in the USA is in Texas attracting an estimated 2,000,000 people annually. The largest average per day attendance is at the Minnesota State Fair averaging just under 200,000 people per day.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Subvocal recognition''' (SVR) is the process of taking [[subvocalization]] and converting the detected results to a digital output, aural or text-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shirley|first1=John|title=New Taboos|publisher=PM Press|isbn=9781604868715|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phwsUNupNREC&amp;pg=PT70|accessdate=14 April 2017|language=en|date=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
A set of [[electrodes]] are attached to the skin of the [[throat]] and, without opening the [[mouth]] or uttering a sound, the words are recognized by a computer.

Subvocal speech recognition deals with [[electromyogram]]s that are different for each speaker. Therefore, consistency can be thrown off just by the positioning of an [[electrode]]. To improve accuracy, researchers in this field are relying on statistical models that get better at [[pattern]]-matching the more times a subject "speaks" through the electrodes, but even then there are lapses. At [[Carnegie Mellon University]], researchers found that the same "speaker" with accuracy rates of 94% one day can see that rate drop to 48% a day later; between two different speakers it drops even more.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Relevant applications for this technology where audible speech is impossible: for [[astronauts]], underwater [[Navy Seals]], fighter pilots and emergency workers charging into loud, harsh environments. At [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in Massachusetts, research is underway to use subvocal information as a control source for computer music instruments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Research and patents==
With a grant from the U.S. Army, research into [[synthetic telepathy]] using subvocalization is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27162401/{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Laboratory]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California, under the supervision of Charles Jorgensen is conducting subvocalization research.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Brain Computer Interface R&amp;D program at Wadsworth Center under the New York State department of health has confirmed the existing ability to decipher consonants and vowels from imagined speech, which allows for brain-based communication using imagined speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/8/4/046028 |pmid=21750369 |pmc=3772685 |title=Decoding vowels and consonants in spoken and imagined words using electrocorticographic signals in humans |journal=Journal of Neural Engineering |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=046028 |year=2011 |last1=Pei |first1=Xiaomei |last2=Barbour |first2=Dennis L |last3=Leuthardt |first3=Eric C |last4=Schalk |first4=Gerwin |bibcode=2011JNEng...8d6028P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

* In ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' and subsequent novels, author [[Orson Scott Card]] described an ear implant, called a "jewel", that allows subvocal communication with computer systems.
* Author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] made use of subvocal recognition to allow silent commands to the cybernetic 'companion implants' used by the advanced [[Neanderthal]] characters in his ''[[Neanderthal Parallax]]'' trilogy of science fiction novels.
* In ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]]'', [[David Brin]] depicts this technology and its uses as a normal gear in the near future.
* In ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'', [[Cory Doctorow]] has cellphone technology become silent through a cochlear implant and micing the throat to pick up subvocalization.
* [[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl Trilogy|''Sprawl'' Trilogy]] frequently uses sub-vocalization systems in various devices.
* In [[Kage Baker]]'s [[Kage Baker#Novels set in the Company universe|''Company'' novels]], the immortal [[cyborg]]s communicate subvocally.
* In the [[Hugo Award]]-winning ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]], the characters often use subvocalization to communicate.
* In the [[Culture series|''Culture'' novels]] by [[Iain M. Banks]], more highly advanced species often communicate subvocally through their technology.
* In ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' (2011), the protagonist is [[Human enhancement|augmented]] with a subvocalization implant for sending covert communications (and a corresponding [[cochlear implant]] for receiving covert communications).
* In ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' (2017) [[cyborg]] agents covertly communicate subvocally

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4814">'''Topothesia''' is “the description of an imaginable or non-existent place”.{{sfn|Oxford|loc=Topos}} It has been classified as a type of enargia{{sfn|Oxford|loc=Enargia}} (a synonym to “hypotyposis”), which is a “generic name for a group of figures aiming at vivid, lively description”. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] used enargia frequently to describe his characters in his literary works.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2005|p=195}}
According to [[Philip Hardie]], a professor at the University of Cambridge, its determining characteristic is its position within a text. Normally, when the descriptive analysis of a place is found to discontinue a narrative, this interrupting section can be considered topothesia. In addition, it has a stereotyped entry formula that facilitates distinguishing the narrative from the descriptive. In most famous texts, topothesia begins with est locus (“there is a place” in Latin), as can be seen in ''[[Metamorphoses]]''{{sfn|Anderson|1998}} by Ovid.{{sfn|Hardie|2002|p=122}}

== Etymology ==

Topothesia is derived from a mixture of two Greek words: “topos” (τοπος), which literally translated means “place”, and the suffix “-thesia”, which is obtained from the noun "thesis", meaning “setting forth". In ancient Greek the word always seems to refer to the description or arrangement of a real place,&lt;ref&gt;[http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%B1 Liddell-Scott-Jones, ''Greek-English Lexicon, 9th ed.'' s.v.]&lt;/ref&gt; while the application of the word to an imaginary description (as opposed to "topographia", the description of a real place) is first found in the Latin commentator Servius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin.packhum.org/loc/2349/5/154/54-64@1#154 On Vergil's ''Aeneid'' 1.159]&lt;/ref&gt;

Topothesia is a tool often used in poetry rather than by orators. A renowned poet who frequently utilized topothesia along with other forms of enargia was [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. A popular poem that featured various examples of topothesia is “Dreamland”.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2005|p=321}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;:By a route obscure and lonely, 
:Haunted by ill angels only, 
:Where an Eidolon, named Night, 
:On a black throne reigns upright, 
:I have reached these lands but newly 
:From an ultimate dim Thule- 
:From a wild clime that lieth, sublime, 
:Out of Space – Out of Time.

:Bottomless vales and boundless floods, 
:And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, 
:With forms that no man can discover 
:For the tears that drip all over; 
:Mountains toppling evermore 
:Into seas without a shore; 
:Seas that restlessly aspire,
:Surging, unto skies of fire; 
:Lakes that endlessly outspread 
:Their lone waters- lone and dead,- 
:Their still waters- still and chilly 
:With the snows of the lolling lily. (“Dream-Land,” 7:89){{sfn|Poe|2012|}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this rhetorical term was apparent in other of Poe’s works of fiction like “The Domain of Arnheim”.{{sfn|Poe}} This short story was recognized for its repeated use of topothesia. According to author and professor at York University, Brett Zimmerman, “the tale’s entire second half is a description of Arnheim, an artificial paradise on Earth – “the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii, and of the Gnomes” (6: 196). We also have “Landor’s Cottage: A Pendant to ‘The Domain of Arnheim’.” That piece really has no plot; it is extended topothesia – an exercise in picturesque description of a place…”{{sfn|Zimmerman|2005|p=322}}

'''Transhistoricity''' is the quality of holding throughout human history, not merely within the frame of reference of a particular form of [[society]] at a particular stage of historical development. An entity or concept that has transhistoricity is said to be '''transhistorical'''.

Certain theories of history (e.g. that of [[Historicism#Hegelian|Hegel]]), treat human history as divided into distinct [[historical period|epoch]]s with their own internal [[logic]]s—[[historical materialism]] is the most famous case of such a theory. States of affairs which hold within one epoch may be completely absent, or carry opposite implications in another, according to these theories.

== In the abstract ==
Transhistoricity may be seen as the necessary [[antithesis]] to the idea that meanings are bounded by their historical context. It is the temporal equivalent of the spatial concept of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]].

== In sociopolitical theory ==
Questions of what might and might not be transhistorical phenomena are typically the concern of historians and sociologists identifying with the [[Historicism|historicist]] traditions of [[Hegel]]ian or [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] thought, but matter additionally in the debates around [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of [[paradigm shift]] and similar discussions. 

[[Fredric Jameson]], a [[Marxist]] or perhaps [[post-modern]] theorist, is a case in point. He famously asserted that theory must "Always historicize!", going on to wryly observe that this order was itself a "transhistorical imperative".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric (1981). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xE6vLE71yUC&amp;dq=%22the+political+unconscious%22+books&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=book-ref-page-link&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail&amp;hl=en ''The Political Unconscious'']. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others look for transhistorical continuities to inform what's basic to the human condition. For example, D. K. Simonton, finds some regularities in the types of ideas that gain ascendancy following certain types of historical events, in a data series spanning 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D. K. (1976). ''The Sociopolitical Context of Philosophical Beliefs: A Transhistorical Causal Analysis''. ''Social Forces''. vol. 54. pp. 513–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, research in the vicinity of [[Evolutionary psychology]] has proceeded on the basis that some observed transcultural regularities in human behaviour are also transhistoric, accounted for by their being fixed in the genetic legacy common to all ''Homo sapiens''.

== In aesthetics ==
Part of the debate over the distinction between [[high art]] and [[folk art]] (or lesser disciplines) hinges on the question of whether art can (and if so, if it should) aspire to transcend the particular frame of reference within which it was produced. This frame may be taken to be historically delimited.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Paul (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpMsL8f56RMC&amp;dq=transhistorical+image+philosophizing+art ''The Transhistoric Image: Philosophizing Art and Its History''].

There are many stars visible. Venus is at the center, much brighter than any of the stars, and its light can be seen reflected in the ocean.|Venus is always brighter than the brightest stars outside the [[Solar System]], as can be seen here over the Pacific Ocean]]

[[Venus]], as one of the brightest objects in the sky, has been known since prehistoric times and has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. As such, it has a prominent position in human [[culture]], [[religion]], and [[myth]]. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the ''morning star'' and ''evening star''.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |first=James |last=Evans |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |pages=296–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=4 February 2008 |isbn=978-0-19-509539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and name ==
What is now known as the planet Venus has long been an object of fascination for cultures worldwide. It is the second brightest object in the night sky, and follows a [[synodic cycle]] by which it seems to disappear for several says due to its proximity to the sun, then re-appear on the opposite side of the sun and on the other horizon. Depending on the point in its cycle, Venus may appear before sunrise in the morning, or after sunset in the evening, but it never appears to reach the apex of the sky. Therefore, many cultures have recognized it with two names, even if their astronomers realized that it was really one object.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |first=James |last=Evans |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |pages=296–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=4 February 2008 |isbn=978-0-19-509539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[old English]], the planet was known as ''morgensteorra'' (morning star) and ''æfensteorra'' (evening star). It was not until the [[13th century]] C.E. that the name "Venus" was adopted for the planet&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/Venus#etymonline_v_4710]&lt;/ref&gt; (in classical Latin, though the morning star was considered sacred to the goddess Venus, it was called Lucifer).&lt;ref name="Auffarth"/&gt;

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the planet is called ''Jīn-xīng'' (金星), the golden planet of the [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal element]]. It is known as "Kejora" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].
Modern [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Korean culture|Korean]] cultures refer to the planet literally as the "metal star" ({{lang|zh|金星}}), based on the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the [[Sun]], for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as single entity; instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star. Nonetheless, a [[cylinder seal]] from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] indicates that the ancient [[Sumer]]ians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object. The Sumerians associated the planet with the [[goddess]] [[Inanna]], who was known as [[Ishtar]] by the later [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ians and [[Babylonia]]ns.&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooley |first=Jeffrey L. |title=Inana and Šukaletuda: A Sumerian Astral Myth |url=https://www.academia.edu/1247599/Inana_and_Sukaletuda_A_Sumerian_Astral_Myth |journal=KASKAL |volume=5 |pages=161–172 |year=2008 |issn=1971-8608}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a dual role as a goddess of both love and war, thereby representing a deity that presided over birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both Inanna's mythology as well as her dual nature.&lt;ref name=Cooley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Jeremy |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana |publisher=The British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1705-6 |pages=108–109 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nemet-Nejat |first=Karen Rhea |authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat |date=1998 |title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=Greenwood |series=Daily Life |isbn=978-0313294976 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Inanna and Shukaletuda}}Inanna's actions in several of her myths, including ''[[Inanna and Shukaletuda]]'' and ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Underworld]]'' appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus as it progresses through its synodic cycle. For example, in ''Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'', Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld, where she is killed, and then resurrected three days later to return to the heavens. An interpretation of this myth by Clyde Hostetter holds that it is an allegory for the movements of the planet Venus, beginning with the [[spring equinox]] and concluding with a meteor shower near the end of one synodic period of Venus. The three-day disappearance of Inanna refers to the three-day planetary disappearance of Venus between its appearance as a morning and evening star.&lt;ref name=Hostetter1991&gt;{{citation|last=Hostetter|first=Clyde|title=Star Trek to Hawa-i'i|location=San Luis Obispo, California|publisher=Diamond Press|date=1991|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; An introductory hymn to this myth describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for ''Kur'', what could be presumed to be the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West. In the myth ''Inanna and Shukaletuda'', Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the eastern and western horizons. In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.&lt;ref name=Cooley/&gt; Inanna-Ishtar's most common symbol was the [[Octagram|eight-pointed star]].&lt;ref name=black&amp;green1992&gt;{{citation|last=Black |first=Jeremy |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992 |isbn= 0-7141-1705-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-pointed star seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens, but, by the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 – {{circa}} 1531 BC), it had come to be specifically associated with the planet [[Venus]], with which Ishtar was identified.&lt;ref name=black&amp;green1992/&gt;

ISSN 1406-0957&lt;/ref&gt; " Ninsi'anna" translates to "divine lady, illumination of heaven", which refers to Venus as the brightest visible "star". Earlier spellings of the name were written with the [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign si4 (= SU, meaning "to be red"), and the original meaning may have been "divine lady of the redness of heaven", in reference to the color of the morning and evening sky.&lt;ref&gt;Heimpel, W. 1982.

=== Canaanite mythology ===
In [[ancient Canaanite religion]], the morning star is personified as the god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], a masculine variant of the name of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Julian Baldick |date=1998 |title=Black God |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0815605226|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |page=20 |isbn=0815605226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In myth, Attar attempted to occupy the throne of [[Baal|Ba'al]] and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-gfwlltlRwC John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. {{ISBN|0-82646830-6}}. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6830-7}}), pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C Gregory A.

It thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun.&lt;ref name=Gunkel/&gt;

Similarities have been noted with the story of [[Inanna]]'s descent into the underworld,&lt;ref name="GVS"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLN08jf_C2EC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=%22several+attempts+to+find+mythical+allusions%22 |author1=Gary V.

The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' comments:

::"The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and [[Zu (mythology)|Zu]]: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods ... but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus."&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10177-lucifer |title=Lucifer |publisher=''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is "[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]".)&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; --&gt; According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means "shining one, light-bearer", and the translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, "Lucifer".&lt;ref name="H1966"/&gt; However, the translation of הֵילֵל with the name "Lucifer" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the name {{lang|he-Latn|Helel ben Shahar}} occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3–4|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:

::"How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage was the origin of the later belief that [[Satan]] was a fallen angel, who could also be referred to as "Lucifer". However, it originally referred to the rise and disappearance of the morning star as an allegory for the fall of a once-proud king. This allegorical understanding of Isaiah seems to be the most accepted interpretation in the [[New Testament]], as well as among early [[Christianity|Christian]]s such as [[Origen]], [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Gregory the Great]]. The fallen angel motif may therefore be considered a Christian "remythologization" of Isaiah 14, returning its allegorical imagery of the hubris of a historical ruler to the original roots of the Canaanite myth of a lesser god trying and failing to claim the throne of the heavens, who is then cast down to the underworld.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=John|title=Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9780567537836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persia ===
In Iranian mythology, especially in [[Persian mythology]], the planet usually corresponds to the goddess [[Anahita]]. In some parts of [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] literature the deities ''Aredvi Sura'' and ''Anahita'' are regarded as separate entities, the first one as a personification of the mythical river and the latter as a goddess of fertility, which is associated with the planet Venus. As the goddess [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]]—and simply called ''Anahita'' as well—both deities are unified in other descriptions, e. g. in the ''Greater [[Bundahishn]]'', and are represented by the planet. In the [[Avesta]]n text [[Yasht|Mehr Yasht]] (''Yasht 10'') there is a possible early link to [[Mithra]]. The [[Persian language|Persian]] name of the planet today is "Nahid", which derives from Anahita and later in history from the Pahlavi language ''Anahid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Hesperus as Personification of the Evening Star'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] (1765).]]
The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] called the morning star {{lang|grc|Φωσφόρος}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|[[Phosphoros]]}}, the "Bringer of Light". Another Greek name for the morning star was [[Heosphoros]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἑωσφόρος}} ''Heōsphoros''), meaning "Dawn-Bringer".&lt;ref name=L&amp;S&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.80:5:31.LSJ|title=Liddell &amp; Scott|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called the evening star, which was long considered a separate celestial object, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[Hesperos]]}}'' ({{lang|grc|Ἓσπερος}}, the "star of the evening").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Hesperus|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hesperus|publisher=www.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Hellenistic]] times, the ancient Greeks had identified these as a single planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Sherwood|last=Fox|date=1916|title=The Mythology of All Races: Greek and Roman|publisher=Marshall Jones Company|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEUTAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2009-05-16|isbn=0-8154-0073-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ellen|last=Greene|date=1996|title=Reading Sappho: contemporary approaches|page=54|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20601-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the traditional use of two names for its appearance in the morning and the evening continued even into the Roman period.

The Greek myth of [[Phaethon]], whose name means "Shining One", has also been seen as similar to those of other gods who cyclically descend from the heavens, like Inanna and Attar.&lt;ref name="Gunkel"&gt;{{cite book | title=Creation And Chaos in the Primeval Era And the Eschaton.

In classical mythology, [[Lucifer]] ("light-bringer" in Latin) was the name of the planet Venus as the morning star (s the evening star it was called [[Hesperus|Vesper]]), and it was often [[anthropomorphism|personified]] as a male figure bearing a torch. Lucifer was said to be "the fabled son of [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]&lt;ref name="Auffarth"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=Christoph | editor1-last=Auffarth | editor1-link=Christoph Auffarth  | editor2-first=Loren T. | editor2-last=Stuckenbruck | editor2-link=Loren T.

He was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.&lt;ref name="EBLCM"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lucifer-classical-mythology "Lucifer]" in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans considered the planet Lucifer particularly sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], whose name eventually became the scientific name for the planet. The second century Roman mythographer [[De Astronomica|Pseudo-Hyginus]] said of the planet:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Astronomica 2. 4 (trans. Grant)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"The fourth star is that of Venus, Luciferus by name. Some say it is [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s. In many tales it is recorded that it is called Hesperus, too. It seems to be the largest of all stars. Some have said it represents the son of Aurora and Cephalus, who surpassed many in beauty, so that he even vied with Venus, and, as [[Eratosthenes]] says, for this reason it is called the star of Venus. It is visible both at dawn and sunset, and so properly has been called both Luciferus and Hesperus."

[[Ovid]], in his first century epic ''Metamorphoses'', describes Lucifer as ordering the heavens:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Metamorphoses 2. 112 ff (trans. Melville)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Aurora, watchful in the reddening dawn, threw wide her crimson doors and rose-filled halls; the Stellae took flight, in marshaled order set by Lucifer who left his station last."

In the classical Roman period, Lucifer was not typically regarded as a deity and had few, if any, myths,&lt;ref name=EBLCM/&gt; though the planet was associated with various deities and often poetically personified. [[Cicero]] pointed out that "You say that Sol the Sun and Luna the Moon are deities, and the Greeks identify the former with Apollo and the latter with Diana. But if Luna (the Moon) is a goddess, then Lucifer (the Morning-Star) also and the rest of the Wandering Stars (Stellae Errantes) will have to be counted gods; and if so, then the Fixed Stars (Stellae Inerrantes) as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
In [[Islam|Islamic]] traditions the morning star is called ''Zohra'' or ''Zohrah'' and commonly related to a "beautiful woman".&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Asad ''The Road To Mecca'' The Book Foundation 1954 {{ISBN|978-0-992-79810-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to myth, of which an echo is found in a play by the 17th-century English poet [[William Percy (writer)|William Percy]], two angels, [[Harut and Marut]], descended to earth and were seduced by Zohra's beauty to commit ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'': murder, [[adultery]] and drinking wine. In their drunken state, Zohra elicited from these angels the secret words to ascend to heaven. When she spoke the secret words, she elevated herself to the first heaven, but was imprisoned there (i.e. transformed into the planet Venus).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn7FOrsOOkcC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=William+Percy+Harut+Marut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bn6KlmdcaV&amp;sig=5hoz8XRhdycPENgwphofVr_HBDs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiv7eH-_7DeAhUL-qQKHeVtAtoQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Percy%20Harut%20Marut&amp;f=false Matthew Dimmock (editor), ''William Percy's ''Mahomet and His Heaven'': A Critical Edition'' Ashgate Publishing 2006] {{ISBN|978-0-754-65406-3}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Venus was considered the most important celestial body observed by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], who called it ''Chac ek'',&lt;ref name="Volume 7 of Mayan studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Chumayel: The Counsel Book of the Yucatec Maya, 1539-1638|date=1899|publisher=Richard Luxton|isbn=9780894122446|pages=6,194}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Noh Ek''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, "the Great Star". The Maya monitored the movements of Venus closely and observed it in daytime. The positions of Venus and other planets were thought to influence life on Earth, so the Maya and other [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|ancient Mesoamerican culture]]s timed wars and other important events based on their observations. In the [[Dresden Codex]], the Maya included an almanac showing Venus's full cycle, in five sets of 584 days each (approximately eight years), after which the patterns repeated (since Venus has a [[synodic period]] of 583.92 days).&lt;ref name="Milbrath"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Star Gods of The Mayans : Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars |last= Milbrath|first= Susan|date= 1999|publisher= University of Texas Press|location= Austin, TX|isbn= 978-0-292-79793-2|pages= 200–204, 383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya civilization developed a [[Maya calendar|religious calendar]], based in part upon the motions of the planet, and held the motions of Venus to determine the propitious time for events such as war.

Venus is important in many [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|Australian aboriginal cultures]], such as that of the [[Yolngu]] people in Northern Australia. The Yolngu gather after sunset to await the rising of Venus, which they call ''[[Barnumbirr]]''. As she approaches, in the early hours before dawn, she draws behind her a rope of light attached to the Earth, and along this rope, with the aid of a richly decorated "Morning Star Pole", the people are able to communicate with their dead loved ones, showing that they still love and remember them. Barnumbirr is also an important creator-spirit in the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]], and "sang" much of the country into life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ray P.|last=Norris|pages=1–4|title=Searching for the Astronomy of Aboriginal Australians|work=Conference Proceedings|date=2004|publisher=Australia Telescope National Facility|url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/AboriginalAstronomy/literature/Norris2007b.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-05-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174226/http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/AboriginalAstronomy/literature/Norris2007b.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Venus in fiction}}
The discovery in the modern era that Venus was a distant world covered in impenetrable cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] by humans.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;

Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Another appearance of Venus in popular culture is as the harbinger of destruction in [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (1950). In this controversial book, Velikovsky argued that many seemingly unbelievable stories in the [[Old Testament]] are true recollections of times when Venus, which Velikovsky claimed had somehow been ejected from [[Jupiter]] as a [[comet]], nearly collided with the Earth. He contended that Venus caused most of the strange events of the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] story. He cites legends in many other cultures (including the Greek, Mexican, Chinese and Indian) indicating that the effects of the near-collision were global. The scientific community rejected his unorthodox book, but it became a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{about|woodcraft or woodlore|Woodcraft retail stores, catalogs and magazine |Woodcraft Supply}}

The term '''woodcraft''' — or '''woodlore''' — denotes skills and experience in matters relating to living and thriving in the [[woodland|woods]]—such as [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and [[camping]]—whether on a short- or long-term basis. Traditionally, woodcraft pertains to [[subsistence]] lifestyles, with implications of [[hunting-gathering]]. In more recent times, and in [[developed countries]], it relates more to either outdoor [[recreation|recreationalism]] or [[survivalism]]. 

Whether traditional or modern, ''woodcraft'' may be roughly equated to the phrase "'''living off the land'''".

==Techniques==
A partial list of recreational woodcraft techniques might include knowledge of [[wildlife]] behavior, identifying and utilizing wild plants and animals (especially for food), [[Cooking on a campfire|camp cooking]], [[orienteering]] (including [[hiking]] skills and use of a [[map]] and [[compass]]), [[Making fire|fire making]] (including procurement of [[Wood fuel|firewood]]), selecting and preparing a [[campsite]], [[Lashing knot|lashing]] and [[knot]] techniques, the use of [[tent]]s and [[wilderness first aid]].  

==Contexts and significance==
The [[Scouting]] movement has adopted woodcraft techniques as a core skill set known as [[scoutcraft]].

In the United States, woodcraft techniques in a military context are taught as part of [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) training.

Traditional woodcraft has particular importance in [[American folklore]], especially that relating to the early [[Frontier#United States|American frontier]].

In the UK, the [[Woodcraft Folk]] are an organisation founded on the principles of woodcraft.
