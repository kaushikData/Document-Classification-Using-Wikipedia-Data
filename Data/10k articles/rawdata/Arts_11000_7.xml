      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">The '''Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S.''' is a German foundation established in 1931 by the [[Hamburg]] merchant [[Alfred Toepfer]].  The foundation is committed to promoting [[European integration|European unification]] and ensuring cultural diversity and understanding between the countries of [[Europe]].

== History ==

The rich industrialist Alfred Toepfer is considered, by the contemporary historiographic criticism, a controversial figure; philanthropist and lover of the arts, he had a significant role in the culture, politics and economic environment of [[Nazi Germany]] from the 30s until the end of the [[Second World War]]. The activity of Toepfer in between the two World Wars, is well documented by a massive cultural promotion of the ideas of ''common ethics and identity'', obviously symbiotic with [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. Toepfer however, after the war, denied any kind of Nazi involvement completely and categorically.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Alfred Toepfer. Stifter und Kaufmann. Bausteine einer Biographie – Kritische Bestandsaufnahme [Alfred Toepfer, Sponsor and Businessman, the Foundations of a Biography – a Critical Appraisal]'', ed. Georg Kreis, Gerd Krumeich, Henri Menudier, Hans Mommsen, Arnold Sywottek, Hamburg 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* ''Alfred Toepfer'' by Jan Zimmermann, published by the ZEIT-Stiftung [ZEIT Foundation] in the series Hamburger Köpfe [Hamburg Heads], Ellert &amp; Richter Verlag [Ellert &amp; Richter Publishers], Hamburg 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantial abdication of his politic and ideologic past, is recognised by critics nowadays  in the important range of prizes instituted by the {{Ref_label|A|a|none}} foundation,&lt;ref&gt;* ''Die Kulturpreise der Stiftung F.V.S. 1935-1945 [The Cultural Prizes of the F.V.S.

* The [[Herder Prize]], established in 1963 and named for [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], is a prestigious international prize, dedicated to the promotion of scientific, art and literature relations, and presented to scholars and artists from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] whose life and work have improved the cultural understanding of European countries and their peaceful interrelations.
* The [[Shakespeare Prize]] was an annual prize for writing or performance awarded to a British citizen.
* The [[Robert Schuman Prize|Robert Schuman Prize for European unity]] was a prize awarded annually in memory of former French Prime Minister, [[Robert Schuman]].{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}

The foundation cooperates also with the most important German universities and renowned cultural associations. The [[Heinrich Tessenow Medal]] is a prestigious architecture prize, created by the Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S. in 1963 in memoriam of [[Rostock]] architect [[Heinrich Tessenow]]. The prize is annually assigned by the [[Heinrich-Tessenow-Gesellschaft e.V.]] and among the rewardeds are [[Giorgio Grassi]] (1992), [[Juan Navarro Baldeweg]] (1998), [[David Chipperfield]] (1999), [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]] (2001) besides the [[Pritzker Prize]] winners [[Sverre Fehn]] (1997) and [[Peter Zumthor]] (1989).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37901">[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|300px|thumb|An art auction, as in this one at Christies, is an example of one part of the art market where buyers and sellers of art meet to conduct transactions in the art market]]
:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004. (art as an asset class)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goetzmann"&gt;Goetzmann, William N., Accounting for Taste: Art and the Financial Markets Over Three Centuries, ''The American Economic Review'', 83(5), Dec. 1993, pp. 1370-1376.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the previously non-transparent art market became more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and online data&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; although researchers discovered biased price estimates in the auction houses.&lt;ref name="mei"&gt;Mei, J. and Moses, M., [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jmei/estimates.pdf Vested Interest and Biased Price Estimates: Evidence from an Auction Market], ''The Journal of Finance'', 60(5), 2005, pp. 2409-2435.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. [[barriers to entry|High barriers to market entry]] for artists&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barriers"&gt;Jackson, M.R., et al, [http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411311_investing_in_creativity.pdf Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists], ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society'', 2004.

All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market,&lt;ref name="adaa"&gt;Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), [http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html Art Industry Summit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216122400/http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html |date=16 December 2011 }}, Transparency in the market: can we have more of it?, 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency.&lt;ref name="transpADAA"&gt;ADAA and The Art Newspaper, Transparency in the market...can we have more of it?, videos [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662 Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193922/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662# |date=2016-03-04 }}, [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172450/http://theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661# |date=2016-03-05 }}, and [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660 Part 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110955/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660# |date=2016-03-04 }}, Host Anna Somers Cocks, ''The Art Newpapaper'', 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Hammer houses of horror
 | magazine = [[The Economist]]
 | date = July 24, 1997
 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/152446
 | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit.&lt;ref name="horror" /&gt; For Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first  20% of the next  to  million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/arts/design/14auction.html Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate] ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

==Early life==
Mulligan was born in [[Westminster]], [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;Hornby, Nick [https://web.archive.org/web/20131117051213/http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/reviews/shes-the-one-3/ "She's the One"] ''Archived from Elle''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Matt [http://www.mattmueller.co.uk/index.php?page_id=Interviews%20/%20Features&amp;category_id=Interviews&amp;article_id=402 "There's Something About Carey"] ''Total Film''&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Nano ([[married and maiden names|née]] Booth) and Stephen Mulligan. Her father is of Irish descent and was originally from [[Liverpool]]. Her mother is from [[Llandeilo]], Wales.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref22"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rees|first=Claire |title=Mum keeps my feet on ground, says Oscar hopeful Carey Mulligan|publisher=Wales Online|date=7 February 2010|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/02/07/mum-keeps-my-feet-on-ground-says-oscar-hopeful-carey-mulligan-91466-25778500/|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref111"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2009/1028/1224257549716.html|author=Anna Carey|title=Life lessons captured on film |work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is a university lecturer and her father is a hotel manager.&lt;ref name="ref22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arts"/&gt; Her parents met while they were both working in a hotel in their twenties. When she was three years old, her family moved to Germany when her father was hired to manage a hotel there. While living in Germany, Mulligan and her brother attended the [[International School of Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="LaT"&gt;Abramowitz, Rachel [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/08/entertainment/et-mulligan8 "Carey Mulligan Gets An Education"] ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; When she was eight, she and her family moved back to England. As a teenager, she was educated at [[Woldingham School]] in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/baftas/7271959/Carey-Mulligan-her-journey-from-school-stage-to-Baftas-red-carpet.html|title=Carey Mulligan: her journey from school stage to Bafta's red carpet|date=20 February 2010|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|author=Anita Singh|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest in acting==
Her interest in acting sparked from watching her brother perform in a school production of ''[[The King and I]]'' when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus.&lt;ref name="All"/&gt; While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Actress Carey's Pride and Joy(archived) |url=http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0225croydon/tm_objectid=16165216&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=53340&amp;headline=actress-carey-s-pride-and-joy-name_page.html |work=ICSouthLondon.co.uk |author=Emily Attwood |author2=Brian Haran |last-author-amp=yes |date=23 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105613/http://icsouthlondon.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0225croydon/tm_objectid%3D16165216%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D53340%26headline%3Dactress-carey-s-pride-and-joy-name_page.html |archivedate=20 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;staff [http://abcnews.go.com/widgets/mediaViewer/image?id=9931402 "ABC News Mulligan"]. ''AbcNews''&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 16, she attended a production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry&amp;nbsp;V]]'' starring [[Kenneth Branagh]]. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief that she wanted to pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," she said. Branagh's sister replied: "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress."&lt;ref name="All"&gt;Fox, Chloe [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669189/Carey-Mulligan-All-or-nothing.html "Carey Mulligan All or Nothing"]. ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulligan's parents disapproved of her acting ambitions and wished for her to attend a university like her brother. At age 17, she applied to three London drama schools, instead of the universities that she was expected to submit an application to, but did not receive a subsequent offer.&lt;ref name="All"/&gt; During her final year at Woldingham School, actor/screenwriter [[Julian Fellowes]] delivered a lecture at the school on the production of the film ''[[Gosford Park]]''. Mulligan briefly talked to him after the lecture and asked him for advice on an acting career. However, Fellowes dissuaded her from the profession and suggested that she "marry a lawyer" instead. Undeterred, she later sent Fellowes a letter in which she stated that she was serious about acting and that the vocation was her purpose in life. Several weeks later, Fellowes's wife Emma invited her to a dinner for young, aspiring actors that she and her husband were hosting to offer advice. The event facilitated an introduction between Mulligan and a casting assistant that led to an audition for a role in ''Pride and Prejudice''. She auditioned on three occasions and was eventually given the role of Kitty Bennet.&lt;ref name="All"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;Fuller, Graham [http://www.theartsdesk.com/features/actress-carey-mulligan-emotionally-speaking "Actress Carey Mulligan, Emotionally Speaking"] "The Arts Desk"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vog"&gt;Buck, Joan [http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/the-talented-miss-mulligan "The Talented Miss Mulligan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115020514/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/the-talented-miss-mulligan/ |date=15 January 2013 }} ''Vogue''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Erin [http://www.elle.com/_mobile/news/culture/three-things-to-know-about-an-education-star-carey-mulligan-1755 "Three Things to Know About An Education Star Carey Mulligan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222190852/http://www.elle.com/_mobile/news/culture/three-things-to-know-about-an-education-star-carey-mulligan-1755# |date=22 February 2014 }} "Elle.com"&lt;/ref&gt; During her late teens and early twenties, she worked as a [[pub]] barmaid and an errand-runner for Ealing Studios in between acting jobs.&lt;ref name = "vog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/carey_mulligan_returns_home_empty_handed_from_oscars_1_632715 "Carey Mulligan Returns Home"] Hamhigh.co.uk,&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conception dreams''' are [[dream]]s that are said to foretell the [[Fertilisation|conception]] or [[birth]] of a child, dreamt by the future mother or people close to her. The belief that a dream will foretell a baby's birth originates from Ancient [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreaming in the Lotus: Buddhist Dream Narrative, Imagery, and Practice By Serinity Young&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/nah-ree_doh.htm|title=Psychological significance of Korean women's "conception dreams"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In India==
Ancient India believes that conception dream predicts the child character. [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)]] dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]] dreams are connected with the births of [[Tirthankara]]s and the other prominent people including ''[[chakravarti]]'', ''[[Balabhadra]]''s and ''Vāsudevas''. They are 63 in total and called ''[[Shalakapurusha]]''. Their mothers see a certain number of dreams on conception of their soul in womb. They are described in the great detail in [[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpasutra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/principles/holy-symbols/dreams.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=dreams&amp;cHash=33eba476582356cda9587de0d285a3b9Balbir, Nalini.

[[Rathore]] ruler Simhaji's queen dreamt 3 lions before birth of his 3 son.&lt;ref&gt;Muhnot Nainsi Ki Khyat Khand-ii.Page:- 53-54.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.308977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramakrishna]] parents experienced supernatural incidents and visions before his birth. In [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] his father Khudiram had a dream in which Lord Gadadhara (a form of [[Vishnu]]), said that he would be born as his son. Chandramani Devi is said to have had a vision of light entering her womb from Shiva's temple.{{sfn|Chatterjee|1993|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Harding|1998|pp=243–244}} [[Nahusha]] mother Indumati had conception dream.&lt;ref&gt;Padma purana, shrishti khand, 104&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dashakumaracharita]] Queen vasumati conceiving her first son hamsavahana, dreams that she has bathed in the water of all pilgrimages.while conceiving her second so Rajavahana she dreams that she swallowed the orb of universe.

==In Korea==
In Korea conception dreams are known as 태몽(''taemong''). Many women in Korean culture report having such dreams themselves. Popular topics of the dreams include fruit (such apples, [[persimmon]]s, cherries, chestnuts), animals (tigers, snakes, goldfish), nature (rivers, rainbows), children and jewels. The dreamer might eat or take fruits, embrace animals, or interact with nature. The topic is believed to influence the [[gender]] or the future of the baby; for example, fruits are seen as a sign for a baby girl.

The person having the dream can be the mother herself, but close family members such as her mother or the husband can also have conception dreams instead of the mother.

Dreams are often considered to be [[omen]]s, and sometimes people will "buy" dreams from friends, if they feel it is a good omen or a good conception dream.

Accounts of conception dreams can be found in numerous old histories. One example is the conception dream of [[Kim Yushin]], from the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]], documented in the [[Samguk Sagi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">'''Crux''' ([[Latin]] for "cross", "gallow", or "t-shape") is a term applied by [[palaeography|palaeographers]], [[textual criticism|textual critics]], [[bibliography|bibliographers]], and literary scholars to a point of significant corruption in a literary text. More serious than a simple slip of the pen or typographical error, a crux (probably deriving from Latin ''crux interpretum'' = "cross of the interpreters") is difficult or impossible to interpret and resolve. Cruxes occur in a wide range of pre-modern ([[ancient history|ancient]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]], and [[Renaissance]]) texts, printed and manuscript.

==Shakespearean examples==
Though widely exposed to readers and scholars, the texts of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays yield some of the most famous literary cruxes. Some have been resolved fairly well. In [[Henry V (play)|''Henry V,'']] II.iii.16-7, the [[First Folio]] text has the Hostess describe [[Falstaff]] on his death-bed like this:
{{quote|...his nose was sharp as a pen, and 'a Table of green fields.}}
[[Lewis Theobald]]'s editorial correction, "and 'a [he] babbl'd of green fields", has won almost universal acceptance from subsequent editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' pp. 945, 973.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "dram of eale" In ''[[Hamlet]]'' I, iv, 36 can be sensibly interpreted as "dram of ev'l [evil]."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 1148, 1188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Shakespearean cruxes have not been so successfully resolved. In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]],'' IV.ii,38-9, Diana observes to Bertram,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre,
That we'll forsake ourselves.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
Editors have reached no consensus on exactly what "ropes in such a scarre" can mean, or how it should be amended: "no satisfactory explanation or emendation has been offered."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 530, 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best alternative that has been proposed is "may rope 's [us] in such a snare." Another unresolved Shakespearean crux is the "runaway's eyes" in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' III, ii, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, p. 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a crux will not require emendation, but simply present a knotty problem of comprehension. In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]],'' IV, i, 98-9, Sir Richard Vernon describes Prince Hal and his comrades as appearing:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
All plum'd like estridges, that with the wind
bated like eagles having lately bath'd...
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
This is most likely a reference to some obscure assertion about animal behavior, and has sent researchers poring through dusty volumes in search of an explanation.

==Typographic conventions==
In editions of Greek and Roman authors, a crux is marked off by [[dagger (typography)|obeli]], to indicate that the editor is not confident enough either to follow the manuscript reading or to print a conjecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Dacian art''' is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or North Thracians; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of Scythians and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}}  

==Background ==
[[File:Daci Terra Getarum cf Strabo.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacians regions cf. [[Strabo]] (ca. 20 AD) by Muller (1877) {{sfn|Müller|1877|loc=tabulae XV}}]]
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacian gold bowl found in Transylvania (Vienna Museum)]]

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}



Dacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD).{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} In the [[Bronze Age]], proto-Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] stock with the intruders of the transitional [[Indo-Europeanization Period]]. From these proto-Thracians, in the [[Iron Age]], there were developed the Dacians of the [[Danubian-Carpathian Area]] on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern [[Balkan Peninsula]] on the other.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}

==Pre-Dacian periods==
North Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}}

The local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=62}}


Thracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=37}} While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=33}}

==Classical Dacian periods==

The 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto-Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube.{{sfn|Olmsted|2001|p=22}}


The design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}} Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}}

'''German art''' has a long and distinguished tradition in the [[visual arts]], from the earliest known work of figurative art to its current output of [[contemporary art]].

Germany has only been united into a single state since the 19th century, and defining its borders has been a notoriously difficult and painful process. For earlier periods German art often effectively includes that produced in German-speaking regions including [[Austria]], [[Alsace]] and much of [[Switzerland]], as well as [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|largely German-speaking cities or regions to the east]] of the modern German borders.

Although tending to be neglected relative to Italian and French contributions from the point of view of the [[English-speaking world]], German art has played a crucial role in the development of [[Western art]], especially [[Celtic art]], [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  From the development of [[Romanesque art]], France and Italy began to lead developments for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], but the production of an increasingly wealthy Germany remained highly important.  The [[German Renaissance]] developed in rather different directions to the [[Italian Renaissance]], and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the early German domination of printing.  The final phase of the Renaissance, [[Northern Mannerism]], was centred around the edges of the German lands, in [[Flanders]] and the Imperial capital of [[Prague]], but, especially in architecture, the German [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] took up these imported styles with enthusiasm. The German origins of [[Romanticism]] did not lead to an equally central position in the visual arts, but German participation in the many broadly [[Modernist]] movements following the collapse of [[Academic art]] have been increasing important.  

==Prehistory to Late Antiquity==
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Hohle Fels]], 35,000 to 40,000 BP, the oldest known figurative work of art (true height {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}}).]]
The area of modern [[Germany]] is rich in finds of [[prehistoric art]], including the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]]. This appears to be the oldest undisputed example of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic art]] and [[figurative art|figurative]] sculpture of the human form in general, from over 35,000 years BP, which was only discovered in 2008;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/14/science/sci-venus14 Venus figurine sheds light on origins of art by early humans] [[Los Angeles Times]], May 14, 2009, accessed December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the better-known [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24–22,000 BP) comes from a little way over the Austrian border. The spectacular finds of [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[golden hat]]s are centred on Germany, as was the "central" form of [[Urnfield culture]], and [[Hallstatt culture]]. In the [[Iron Age]] the "Celtic" [[La Tène culture]] centred on Western Germany and Eastern France, and Germany has produced many major finds of [[Celtic art]] like the elite burials at [[European Archaeological Park of Bliesbruck-Reinheim|Reinheim]] and [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]], and ''[[oppida]]'' towns like [[Glauberg]], [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]] and [[Heuneburg]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After lengthy wars, the [[Roman Empire]] settled its frontiers in [[Germania]] with the [[Limes Germanicus]] to include much of the south and west of modern Germany. The German provinces produced art in provincial versions of Roman styles, but centres there, as over the Rhine in France, were large-scale producers of fine [[Ancient Roman pottery]], exported all over the Empire. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Rheinzabern]] was one of the largest, which has been well-excavated and has a dedicated museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra-sigillata-museum.de/ Terra Sigillata Museum Rheinzabern] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Romanized areas of the later Roman period fall under [[Migration Period art]], notable for metalwork, especially jewellry (the largest pieces apparently mainly worn by men). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:BambergApocalypseFolio025vAngelWithLittleBook.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Bamberg Apocalypse]], from the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Reichenau School]], achieves monumentality in a small scale. 1000–1020.]]
German medieval art really begins with the [[Frankish Empire]] of [[Charlemagne]] (d. 814), the first state to rule the great majority of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. [[Carolingian art]] was restricted to a relatively small number of objects produced for a circle around the court and a number of [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial abbeys]] they sponsored, but had a huge influence on later [[Medieval art]] across Europe. The most common type of object to survive is the [[illuminated manuscript]]; wall paintings were evidently common but, like the buildings that housed them, have nearly all vanished. The earlier centres of illumination were located in modern France, but later [[Metz]] in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] in modern [[Switzerland]] came to rival them. The [[Drogo Sacramentary]] and [[Folchard Psalter]] are among the manuscripts they produced.&lt;ref&gt;See Hinks throughout, Chapters 1 of Beckwith and 3–4 of Dodwell&lt;/ref&gt;

No Carolingian [[monumental sculpture]] survives, although perhaps the most important patronage of Charlemagne was his commissioning of a life-size gold figure of [[Christ]] on a [[crucifix]] for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]; this is only known from literary references and was probably gold foil around a wooden base, probably modelled with a [[gesso]] layer, like the later and rather crumpled [[Golden Madonna of Essen]]. [[Early Christian art]] had not featured monumental sculptures of religious figures as opposed to rulers, as these were strongly associated by the [[Church Fathers]] with the cult idols of [[Ancient Roman religion]]. [[Byzantine art]] and modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious art have maintained the prohibition to the present day, but Western art was apparently decisively influenced by the example of Charlemagne to abandon it. Charlemagne's circle wished to revive the glories of classical style, which they mostly knew in its [[Late Antique]] form, and also to compete with [[Byzantine art]], in which they appear to have been helped by refugee artists from the convulsions of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]]. As Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been very interested in visual art, his political rivalry with the [[Byzantine Empire]], supported by the [[Papacy]], may have contributed to the strong pro-image position expressed in the [[Libri Carolini]], which set out the position on images held with little variation by the Western Church for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]], and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 32 on the ''Libri Carolini''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next [[Ottonian dynasty]], whose core territory approximated more closely to modern Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, [[Ottonian art]] was mainly a product of the large monasteries, especially [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] which was the leading Western artistic centre in the second half of the 10th century. The Reichenau style uses simplified and patterned shapes to create strongly expressive images, far from the classical aspirations of Carolingian art, and looking forward to the Romanesque. The wooden [[Gero Cross]] of 965–970 in [[Cologne Cathedral]] is both the oldest and the finest early medieval near life-size crucifix figure; art historians had been reluctant to credit the records giving its date until they were confirmed by [[dendrochronology]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the rest of Europe, metalwork was still the most prestigious form of art, in works like the jewelled [[Cross of Lothair]], made about 1000, probably in [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Maria laach teufel schriftrolle.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] carving from [[Maria Laach]] Abbey]]

[[Romanesque art]] was the first artistic movement to encompass the whole of [[Western Europe]], though with regional varieties. Germany was a central part of the movement, though [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture|German Romanesque architecture]] made rather less use of sculpture than that of France. With increasing prosperity massive churches were built in cities all over Germany, no longer just those patronized by the Imperial circle.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The French invented the [[Gothic art|Gothic style]], and Germany was slow to adopt it, but once it had done so Germans made it their own, and continued to use it long after the rest of Europe had abandoned it. According to [[Henri Focillon]], Gothic allowed German art "to define for the first time certain aspects of its native genius-a vigorous and emphatic conception of life and form, in which theatrical ostentation mingled with vehement emotional frankness."&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 106&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bamberg Horseman]] of the 1330s, in [[Bamberg Cathedral]], is the oldest large post-antique standing stone equestrian statue; more medieval princely [[tomb monument]]s have survived from Germany than France or England. Romanesque and Early Gothic churches had wall paintings in local versions of international styles, of which few artists' names are known.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ThreeFoolishVirginsMagdeburg.jpg|thumb|left|Three [[Parable of the Ten Virgins|Foolish Virgins]], [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], c. 1250.]]

The court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], then based in [[Prague]], played an important part in forming the [[International Gothic]] style in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 24-7, 37 &amp; passim, Snyder, Chapter II&lt;/ref&gt; The style was spread around the wealthy cities of Northern Germany by artists such [[Conrad von Soest]] in [[Westphalia]] and [[Meister Bertram]] in [[Hamburg]], and later [[Stefan Lochner]] in [[Cologne]]. Hamburg was one of the cities in the [[Hanseatic League]], then at the height of its prosperity, and Bertram was succeeded in the city by artists such as [[Master Francke]], the [[Master of the Malchin Altar]], [[Hans Bornemann]], [[Hinrik Funhof]] and [[Wilm Dedeke]] who survived into the Renaissance period. Hanseatic artists painted commissions for Baltic cities in [[Scandinavia]] and the modern [[Baltic states]] to the east. In the south, the [[Master of the Bamberg Altar]] is the first significant painter based in [[Nuremberg]], while the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]] and then [[Michael Pacher]] worked in Austria. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Like that of Pacher, the workshop of [[Bernt Notke]], a painter from the Hanseatic city of [[Lübeck]], both painted [[altarpiece]]s or carved them in the increasingly elaborate painted and gilded style used as frameworks or alternatives for painted panels.  South German wood sculpture was important in developing new subjects that reflected the intensely emotional devotional life encouraged by movements in late medieval Catholicism such as [[German mysticism]].  These are often known in English as [[andachtsbilder]] (devotional images) and include the ''[[Pietà]]'', ''[[Pensive Christ]]'', ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'', ''[[Arma Christi]]'', ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], and the ''[[Virgin of Sorrows]]'', many of which would spread across Europe and remain popular until the Baroque and, in popular religious imagery, beyond. Indeed "Late Gothic Baroque" is a term sometimes used to describe hyper-decorated and emotional 15th-century art, above all in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 308&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Schongauer]], who worked in Alsace in the last part of the 15th century, was the culmination of late Gothic German painting, with a sophisticated and harmonious style, but he increasingly spent his time producing engravings, for which national and international channels of distribution had developed, so that his [[old master print|prints]] were known in Italy and other countries. His predecessors were the [[Master of the Playing Cards]] and [[Master E. S.]], both also from the Upper Rhine region.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Chapters IV (painters to 1425), VII (painters to 1500), XIV (printmakers), &amp; XV (sculpture).&lt;/ref&gt;  German conservatism is shown in the late use of gold backgrounds, still used by many artists well into the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Focillon, 178–181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance painting and prints==
[[File:HMF Duerer Gruenewald Harrich Heller-Altar DSC 6312.jpg|thumb|The Heller altar by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The concept of the [[Northern Renaissance]] or [[German Renaissance]] is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting [[printing]] with [[movable type]], a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was [[Global spread of the printing press|first brought to most of Europe]], including France and Italy, by Germans. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Printmaking]] by [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] (perhaps another German invention) was already more developed in Germany and the [[Low Countries]] than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, [[Albrecht Dürer]], began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of [[Michael Wolgemut]], who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Dürer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], published by his godfather [[Anton Koberger]], Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time.&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002&gt;Bartrum (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 

After completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Dürer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Dürer supported [[Martin Luther]] but continued to create [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name=Bartrum2002/&gt; 
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 022.jpg|The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ|right|thumb|''The [[Crucifixion]]'', central panel of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]].|left]]

Dürer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. [[Martin Luther]] had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of "Lutheran altarpieces", mostly showing the [[Last Supper]], some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the [[Twelve Apostles]]. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely [[aniconic]] influence of [[Calvinism]], and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Part III, Ch. XIX on Cranach, Luther etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying somewhat outside these developments is [[Matthias Grünewald]], who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'' (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged [[triptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 007.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c.1480–1538), ''Danube landscape near Regensburg'' c. 1528, one of the earliest Western pure landscapes, from the [[Danube School]] in southern [[Germany]].]]

The [[Danube School]] is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in [[Bavaria]] and Austria, including [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent [[landscape art]] in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 9 – this is the main subject of the whole book&lt;/ref&gt;  Their religious paintings had an [[expressionist]] style somewhat similar to Grünewald's. Dürer's pupils [[Hans Burgkmair]] and [[Hans Baldung Grien]] worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of [[witch]]es in a number of enigmatic prints.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XVII, Bartrum, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Holbein the Elder]] and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' relate to the works of the [[Little Masters]], a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Ch. XX on the Holbeins, Bartrum (1995), 221–237 on Holbein's prints, 99–129 on the Little Masters&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Dürer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of [[Northern Mannerism]], which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. [[Hans von Aachen]] and the Netherlandish [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in [[Vienna]] and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish [[Sadeler family]] of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Levey&lt;/ref&gt; This style was continued for another generation by [[Bartholomeus Strobel]], an example of an essentially German artist born and working in [[Silesia]], in today's [[Poland]], until he emigrated to escape the [[Thirty Years War]] and become painter at the Polish court. [[Adam Elsheimer]], the most influential German artist in the 17th century, spent his whole mature career in Italy, where he began by working for another émigré [[Hans Rottenhammer]]. Both produced highly finished [[cabinet painting]]s, mostly on copper, with classical themes and landscape backgrounds. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Sculpture==
[[File:Steinhausen Kapitell-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wessobrunner School|Wessobrunner]] [[stucco]] at [[Schussenried Abbey]]]]

In Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. [[Veit Stoss]] (d. 1533), [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] (d.1531) and [[Peter Vischer the Elder]] (d. 1529) were Dürer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 298–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Two and a half centuries later, [[Johann Joseph Christian]] and [[Ignaz Günther]] were leading masters in the late Baroque period, both dying in the late 1770s, barely a decade before the [[French Revolution]]. A vital element in the effect of German Baroque interiors was the work of the [[Wessobrunner School]], a later term for the [[stucco]]ists of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Another manifestation of German sculptural skill was in [[porcelain]]; the most famous modeller is [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] of the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] factory in Dresden, but the best work of [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in [[Munich]] is often considered the greatest achievement of 18th-century porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th to 19th-century painting==

===Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism===
[[File:Johann Liss 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fall of [[Phaethon|Phaeton]]'' by [[Johann Liss]].]]
[[File:Christian Gottlieb Schick 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gottlieb Schick]], ''Frau von Cotta'', 1802]]

[[Baroque painting]] was slow to arrive in Germany, with very little before about 1650, but once established seems to have suited German taste well.  [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods saw German art producing mostly works derivative of developments elsewhere, though numbers of skilled artists in various genres were active.  The period remains little-known outside Germany, and though it "never made any claim to be among the great schools of painting", its neglect by non-German art history remains striking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24 (quotation), and Scheyer, 9 (from 1960, but the point remains valid)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many distinguished foreign painters spent periods working in Germany for princes, among them [[Bernardo Bellotto]] in [[Dresden]] and elsewhere, and [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], who spent three years painting the [[Würzburg Residence]] with [[Domenico Tiepolo|his son]]. Many German painters worked abroad, including [[Johann Liss]] who worked mainly in [[Venice]], [[Joachim von Sandrart]] and [[Ludolf Bakhuisen]], the leading marine artist of the final years of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]. In the late 18th century the portraitist [[Heinrich Füger]] and his pupil [[Johann Peter Krafft]], whose best known works are three large murals in the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Hofburg]], had both moved to Vienna as students and stayed there.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62–65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoclassicism]] appears rather earlier in Germany than in France, with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] (1728–79), the Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] (1754–98), and the sculptor [[Gottfried Schadow]] (1764–1850).  Mengs was one of the most highly regarded artists of his day, working in Rome, Madrid and elsewhere, and finding an early [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] style that now seems rather effete, although his portraits are more effective.  Carstens' shorter career was turbulent and troubled, leaving a trail of unfinished works, but through pupils and friends such as [[Gottlieb Schick]], [[Joseph Anton Koch]] and [[Bonaventura Genelli]], more influential.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 49–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Koch was born in the mountains of the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and became the leading Continental painter of [[landscape art|landscapes]], concentrating on mountain views, despite spending much of his career in Rome. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Daniel Chodowiecki]] was born in [[Danzig]], and at least partly identified as Polish, although he only spoke German and French. His paintings and hundreds of prints, book illustrations and political cartoons are an invaluable visual record of the everyday life and the increasingly complex mentality of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Germany, and its emerging [[Nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 50–68, Novotny, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Anton Graff]] was a prolific portraitist in Dresden, who painted literary figures as well as the court. The [[Tischbein family]] dynasty were solid all-rounders who covered most of the 18th century between them, as did the [[Zick]] family, initially mainly painters of grand Baroque ceilings, who were still active in the 20th century in the person of the illustrator [[Alexander Zick]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 60&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Asam brothers]], and [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann|his brother]], were able between them to provide a complete service for commissions for churches and palaces, designing the building and executing the stucco and wall-paintings.  The combined effect of all the elements of these buildings in South Germany, Austria and [[Bohemia]], especially their interiors, represent some of the most complete and extreme realizations of the Baroque aspiration to overwhelm the viewer with the "radiant fairy world of the nobleman's dwelling", or the "foretaste of the glories of Paradise" in the case of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 352–357; quotes from pp. 355 &amp; 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest German [[academy]] was the [[Akademie der Künste]] founded in [[Berlin]] in 1696, and through the next two centuries a number of other cities established their own institutions, in parallel with developments in other European nations. In Germany the uncertain market for art in a country divided into a multitude of small states meant that significant German artists have been to the present day more likely to accept teaching posts in the academies and their successor institutions than their equivalents in England or France have been. In general German academies imposed a particular style less rigidly than was for long the case in Paris,  London, Moscow or elsewhere. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Writing about art===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'' (1818)]]

The Enlightenment period saw German writers becoming leading theorists and critics of art, led by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], who exalted [[Ancient Greek art]] and, despite never visiting Greece or actually seeing many Ancient Greek statues, set out an analysis distinguishing between the main periods of Ancient Greek art, and relating them to wider historical movements.  Winckelmann's work marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture; he was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. Goethe had tried to train as an artist, and his landscape sketches show "occasional flashes of emotion in the presence of nature which are quite isolated in the period".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 78 (quotation); and see index for Winckelmann etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''.  In the following century, German universities were the first to teach art history as an academic subject, beginning the leading position that Germany (and Austria) was to occupy in the study of [[art history]] until the dispersal of scholars abroad in the Nazi period.  [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] championed what he identified in the Gothic and Dürer as specifically Germanic styles, beginning an argument over the proper models for a German artist against the so-called "Tyranny of Greece over Germany" that would last nearly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The rhetorical phrase was coined, or popularized, by: [[E. M. Butler|Butler, Eliza M.]], "The Tyranny of Greece over Germany: a study of the influence exercised by Greek art and poetry over the great German writers of the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries" (Cambridge Univ. Press, London, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism and the Nazarenes===
[[German Romanticism]] saw a revival of innovation and distinctiveness in German art. Outside Germany only [[Caspar David Friedrich]] is well-known, but there were a number of artists with very individual styles, notably [[Philipp Otto Runge]], who like Friedrich had trained at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Copenhagen Academy]] and was forgotten after his death until a revival in the 20th century.  Friedrich painted almost entirely landscapes, with a distinctive Northern feel, and always a feeling of quasi-religious stillness.  Often his figures are seen from behind – they like the viewer are lost in contemplation of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge's portraits, mostly of his own circle, are naturalistic except for his huge-faced children, but the other works in his brief career increasingly reflected a visionary [[pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 106–112&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adrian Ludwig Richter]] is mainly remembered for his portraits, and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carl_Wilhelm_Kolbe_d._%C3%84. Carl Wilhelm Kolbe] was purely an [[etcher]] (as well as a [[philologist]]), whose later prints show figures almost swallowed up by gigantic vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey, 112–122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Overbeck 008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] of the [[Nazarene movement]], ''Italia und Germania''.]]

The [[Nazarene movement]], the coinage of a mocking critic, denotes a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art which embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. Their programme was not dissimilar to that of the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in the 1850s, although the core group took it as far as wearing special pseudo-medieval clothing.  In 1810 [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]], [[Franz Pforr]], [[Ludwig Vogel]] and the Swiss Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to [[Rome]], where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by [[Philipp Veit]], [[Peter von Cornelius]], [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]] and a loose grouping of other German artists. They met up with the Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch, (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by [[Joseph von Führich]], and [[Eberhard Wächter (painter)|Eberhard Wächter]] was later associated with the group.  Unlike the strong support given to the Pre-Raphaelites by the dominant art critic of the day, [[John Ruskin]], Goethe was dismissive of the Nazarenes: "This the first case in the history of art when real talents have taken the fancy to form themselves backwards by retreating into their mother's womb, and thus found a new epoch in art."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths &amp; Carey, 24–25 and ''passim'', quotation from p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the Nazarene Schadow, son of the sculptor, the [[Düsseldorf school]] was a group of artists who painted mostly landscapes, and who studied at, or were influenced by the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Academy]], founded in 1767. The academy's influence grew in the 1830s and 1840s, and it had many American students, several of whom became associated with the [[Hudson River School]].&lt;ref&gt;John K. Howat: American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, S. 311&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ritratto della famiglia Begas.jpg|thumb|The family of the painter [[Carl Begas]], 1808, celebrating domesticity in [[Biedermeier]] style]]

===Naturalism and beyond===
[[Biedermeier]] refers to a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848.  Biedermeier art appealed to the prosperous middle classes by detailed but polished [[realism (arts)|realism]], often celebrating domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning aristocratic tastes, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. [[Carl Spitzweg]] was a leading German artist in the style.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Margaret, in ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850, Volume 1'',

[[File:Suende Franz Stuck ohne Rahmen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Stuck]] (1873) ''Sünde'' (''Sin'')]]

In the second half of the 19th century a number of styles developed, paralleling trends in other European counties, though the lack of a dominant capital city probably contributed to even more diversity of styles than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolph Menzel]] enjoyed enormous popularity both among the German public and officialdom; at his funeral [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] walked behind his coffin. He dramaticised past and contemporary [[Prussia]]n military successes both in paintings and brilliant [[wood engraving]]s illustrating books, yet his domestic subjects are intimate and touching. He followed the development of early [[Impressionism]] to create a style that he used for depicting grand public occasions, among other subjects like his ''[[Studio Wall]]''. [[Karl von Piloty]] was a leading [[academic art|academic]] painter of history subjects in the latter part of the century who taught [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|in Munich]]; among his more famous pupils were [[Hans Makart]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Defregger]], [[Gabriel von Max]] and [[Eduard von Grützner]]. The term "Munich school" is used both of German [[Munich School|and of Greek painting]], after Greeks like [[Georgios Jakobides]] studied under him. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[Berlin Secession]] was a group founded in 1898 by painters including [[Max Liebermann]], who broadly shared the artistic approach of [[Manet]] and the French [[Impressionist]]s, and [[Lovis Corinth]] then still painting in a naturalistic style.  The group survived until the 1930s, despite splits, and its regular exhibitions helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists, without imposing a particular style.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 181–184, and see index for later mentions&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of the century, the [[Benedictine]] [[Beuron Art School]] developed a style, mostly for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with a [[medievalist]] interest in pattern that drew from [[Les Nabis]] and in some ways looked forward to [[Art Nouveau]] or the Jugendstil ("Youth Style") as it is known in German.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz von Stuck]] and [[Max Klinger]] are the leading German [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painters. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==20th century==
[[File:Franz Marc 020.jpg|thumb|''Rehe im Walde'' ("[[Roe deer]] in the forest") by [[Franz Marc]]]]
Even more than in other countries, German art in the early 20th century developed through a number of loose groups and movements, many covering other artistic media as well, and often with a specific political element, as with the [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] and [[November Group (German)|November Group]], both formed in 1918. In 1922 The November Group, the Dresden Secession, Das Junge Rheinland, and several other progressive groups formed a "Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland) in an effort to gain exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, Dennis (1999). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&amp;pg=PA76 German Post-Expressionism : The Art of the Great Disorder 1918–1924]''. University Park, Pa: Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 76. {{ISBN|0271043164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] ("The Bridge") was one of two groups of German painters fundamental to [[German expressionism|expressionism]], the other being [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group. Die Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905 by architecture students who wanted to be painters: [[Fritz Bleyl]] (1880–1966), [[Erich Heckel]] (1883–1970), [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] (1880–1938) and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]] (1884–1976), with [[Max Pechstein]] and others later joining.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 197–204, and Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576&lt;/ref&gt; The notoriously individualistic [[Emil Nolde]] (1867–1956) was briefly a member of Die Brücke, but was at odds with the younger members of the group.&lt;!-- will expand --&gt; Die Brücke moved to Berlin in 1911, where it eventually dissolved in 1913. Perhaps their most important contribution had been the rediscovery of the [[woodcut]] as a valid medium for original artistic expression. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] ("The Blue Rider") formed in [[Munich]], Germany in 1911. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Marianne von Werefkin]] and others founded the group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue Künstlervereinigung—another artists' group of which Kandinsky had been a member. The name Der Blaue Reiter derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality—the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter (see illustration) in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 569–576, and Hamilton, 215–221&lt;/ref&gt; The intense sculpture and printmaking of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was strongly influenced by [[Expressionism]], which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Brücke'' and ''Der Blaue Reiter'' were both examples of tendency of early 20th-century German art to be "honest, direct, and spiritually engaged"&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in how the two groups attempted this were telling, however. The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction. Still, it was the spiritual and symbolic properties of abstract form that were important. There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: "We have before us an age of conscious creation, and this new spirit in painting is going hand in hand with thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. Hunter et al p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; ''Die Brücke'' also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- "Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us".&lt;ref&gt;From the Manifesto of Die Brücke, qtd Hunter et al p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bauhaus]] also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) with a view towards creating a better society. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Weimar period===

A major feature of German art in the early 20th century until 1933 was a boom in the production of works of art of a [[grotesque]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esti Sheinberg]] (2000) ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Dmitrii Shostakovich'', pp.248–9, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pamela Kort]] (2004) ''Comic Grotesque'', Prestel Publishing {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists using the [[Satirical]]-[[Grotesque]] genre included [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]] and [[Max Beckmann]], at least in their works of the 1920s. [[Dada]] in Germany, the leading practitioners of which were [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Hannah Höch]], was centered in Berlin, where it tended to be more politically oriented than Dada groups elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada"&gt;Hunter, Jacobus, and Wheeler (2000) pp. 173–77&lt;/ref&gt; They made important contributions to the development of collage as a medium for political commentary- Schwitters later developed his ''Merzbau'', a forerunner of installation art.&lt;ref name="Hunter et all on Dada" /&gt; Dix and Grosz were also associated with the Berlin Dada group. [[Max Ernst]] led a [[Dada]] group in Cologne, where he also practiced collage, but with a greater interest in Gothic fantasy than in overt political content&amp;mdash;this hastened his transition into [[surrealism]], of which he became the leading German practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 473–478&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss-born [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others experimented with [[cubism]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[New Objectivity]], or Neue Sachlichkeit (new matter-of-factness), was an art movement which arose in Germany during the 1920s as an outgrowth of, and in opposition to, expressionism. It is thus post-expressionist and applied to works of visual art as well as literature, music, and architecture. It describes the stripped-down, simplified building style of the [[Bauhaus]] and the [[Weissenhof Settlement]], the urban planning and public housing projects of [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Ernst May]], and the industrialization of the household typified by the [[Frankfurt kitchen]]. Grosz and Dix were leading figures, forming the "Verist" side of the movement with Beckmann and [[Christian Schad]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Georg Scholz]] (in his early work), [[Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler]], and [[Karl Hubbuch]]. The other tendency is sometimes called [[Magic Realism]], and included [[Anton Räderscheidt]], [[Georg Schrimpf]], [[Alexander Kanoldt]], and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Unlike some of the other groupings, the Neue Sachlichkeit was never a formal group, and its artists were associated with other groups; the term was invented by a sympathetic curator, and "Magic Realism" by an art critic.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 478–479&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plakatstil]], "poster style" in German, was an early style of [[poster]] design that began in the early 20th century, using bold, straight fonts with very simple designs, in contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] posters. [[Lucian Bernhard]] was a leading figure. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Art in the Third Reich===
[[File:Made in Germany by George Grosz 1920.jpg|thumb|''Made in Germany'' ({{lang-de|Den macht uns keiner nach}}), by [[George Grosz]], drawn in pen 1919, photo-lithograph 1920.]]
{{Main|Nazi art}}

The Nazi regime banned [[modern art]], which they condemned as [[degenerate art]] (from the German: entartete Kunst). According to Nazi ideology, modern art deviated from the prescribed norm of [[classical beauty]]. While the 1920s to 1940s are considered the heyday of modern art movements, there were conflicting nationalistic movements that resented abstract art, and Germany was no exception. Avant-garde German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to the German nation.  Many went into exile, with relatively few returning after World War II.  Dix was one who remained, being conscripted into the [[Volkssturm]] Home Guard militia; Pechstein kept his head down in rural [[Pomerania]]. Nolde also stayed, creating his "unpainted pictures" in secret after being forbidden to paint. Beckmann, Ernst, Grosz, Feininger and others went to America, Klee to Switzerland, where he died. Kirchner committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|url = http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kirchner-ernst-ludwig.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 1937, the Nazis mounted a polemical exhibition entitled ''Entartete Kunst'' ([[Degenerate art]]), in Munich; it subsequently travelled to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. The show was intended as an official condemnation of modern art, and included over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums. Expressionism, which had its origins in Germany, had the largest proportion of paintings represented. Simultaneously, and with much pageantry, the Nazis presented the ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung'' (Great German art exhibition) at the palatial ''Haus der deutschen Kunst'' (House of German Art). This exhibition displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 486–487&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Performance art]]ist, sculptor, and theorist [[Joseph Beuys]] was perhaps the most influential German artist of the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/306 Moma Focus], retrieved 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to theory was the expansion of the [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] to include the whole of society, as expressed by his famous expression "Everyone is an artist". This expanded concept of art, known as [[social sculpture]], defines everything that contributes creatively to society as artistic in nature. The form this took in his oeuvre  varied from richly metaphoric, almost shamanistic performances based on his personal mythology (''[[Joseph Beuys#.22How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare.22 .28performance.2C 1965.29|How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'', ''[[Joseph Beuys#.22I Like America and America Likes Me.22 .28performance.2C 1974.29|I Like America and America Likes Me]]'') to more direct and utilitarian expressions, such as [[7000 Oaks]] and his activities in the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green party]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The SPUR-artists met first at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and, before falling out with them, were associated with the [[Situationist International]].

'''Gnomic poetry''' consists of meaningful sayings put into verse to aid the memory. They were known by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] as gnomes, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "an opinion". A ''gnome'' was defined by the Elizabethan critic [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] as "a saying pertaining to the manners and common practices of men, which declareth, with an apt brevity, what in this our life ought to be done, or not done".&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gnome and Gnomic Poetry|volume=12|pages=151-152|first=Edmund|last=Gosse|authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to the broad family of [[wisdom literature]], which expresses general truths about the world. Topics range over the divine and secular, from moral aphorisms to hierarchical social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Ancient Greek gnomic literature==
The gnomic poets of Greece, who flourished in the 6th century BCE, were those who arranged series of sententious maxims in verse. These were collected in the 4th century, by [[Lobon of Argos]], an orator, but his collection has disappeared.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Hesiod's ''[[Works and Days]]'' is considered to be one of the earliest works of this genre.

The chief gnomic poets were [[Theognis]], [[Solon]], [[Phocylides]], [[Simonides of Amorgos]], [[Demodocus of Leros|Demodocus]], [[Xenophanes]] and [[Euenus]]. With the exception of Theognis, whose gnomes were fortunately preserved by some schoolmaster about 300 BCE, only fragments of the gnomic poets have come down to us.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There is at least one known woman gnomic poet, [[Kassia]]; nearly 789 of her verses survive.

The moral poem attributed to [[Phocylides]], long supposed to be a masterpiece of the school, is now known to have been written by a [[Jew]] in [[Alexandria]]. Of the gnomic movement typified by the moral works of the poets named above, [[Gilbert Murray]] has remarked that it receives its special expression in the conception of the [[Seven Wise Men]], to whom such proverbs as "[[Know thyself]]" and "[[Nothing in excess]]" were popularly attributed, and whose names differed in different lists.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

These gnomes or maxims were extended and put into literary shape by the poets. Fragments of Solon, Euenus and [[Mimnermus]] have been preserved, in a very confused state, from having been written, for purposes of comparison, on the margins of the manuscripts of Theognis, whence they have often slipped into the text of that poet. Theognis enshrines his moral precepts in his [[elegy|elegies]], and this was probably the custom of the rest; it is improbable that there ever existed a species of poetry made up entirely of successive gnomes. But the title gnomic came to be given to all poetry which dealt in a sententious way with questions of ethics. It was, unquestionably, the source from which [[moral philosophy]] was directly developed, and theorists upon life and infinity, such as [[Pythagoras]] and Xenophanes, seem to have begun their career as gnomic poets.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Gnomes, in their literary sense, belong to the dawn of literature, in their naiveté and their simplicity and moralizing. Many of the ethical reflections of the great dramatists, and in particular of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], are gnomic [[distich]]es expanded. The ancient Greek gnomes are not all solemn; some are voluptuous and some chivalrous. Those of [[Demodocus of Leros]] had the reputation of being droll.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[John Addington Symonds|J. A. Symonds]] writes that the gnomic poets mark a transition from [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] to the dramatists and moralists of [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Symonds, J.A., ''Studies of the Greek Poets'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and early modern gnomic literature==
Gnomes are frequently to be found in the ancient literatures of [[Arabia]], [[Persia]] and [[India]], in [[Anglo-Saxon poetry|Anglo-Saxon/Old English poetry]] and in the [[Iceland]]ic [[Icelandic magical staves|staves]]. Comparable with the Anglo-Saxon examples are the Early Welsh gnomic poems.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kenneth, ''Early Welsh Gnomic Poems''. University of Wales Press, Cardiff. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[priamel]], a brief, sententious kind of poem, which was in favor in [[Germany]] from the 12th to the 16th centuries, belonged to the true gnomic class, and was cultivated with particular success by [[Hans Rosenblut]], the lyrical goldsmith of [[Nuremberg]], in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Gnomic literature, including ''Maxims I'' and ''Maxims II'', is a [[genre]] of [[Medieval Literature]] in England.

The gnomic spirit has occasionally been displayed by poets of a homely philosophy, such as [[Francis Quarles]] (1592–1644) in England and [[Gui de Pibrac]] (1529–1584) in France. The once-celebrated ''Quatrains'' of the latter, published in 1574, enjoyed an immense success throughout [[Europe]]; they were composed in deliberate imitation of the Greek gnomic writers of the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

With the gnomic writings of Pibrac it was long customary to bind up those of [[Antoine Faber]] (or Favre) (1557–1624) and of [[Pierre Mathieu]] (1563–1621).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Granaz Moussavi ''' ([[Persian language|Persian]] : گراناز موسوی ), is an [[Iran]]ian-Australian contemporary poet, film director and screenwriter. She is primarily renowned for her [[avant-garde]] poetry in the 90s. Her award winning debut feature film ''[[My Tehran for Sale]]'' is an internationally acclaimed Australian-Iranian co-production.

==Biography==
Granaz was born in December 1976 in Tehran to TV parents, her father, Hashem Moussavi,  was a well-known sound engineer in the Iranian National TV ([[Jam e Jam]]) and in the film industry, and her mother, Parvin Chegini Farahani, a video grader. At the age of 17, she started writing professionally as a book review writer and [[literary critic]] at "Donyaye Sokhan literary magazine  مجلهٔ ادبی دنیای سخن"  in Tehran. Her first poems were published in 1989 and since then, she has continued writing and publishing poetry in various magazines and collections both in Iran and other countries . In Tehran, Granaz went to Razi primary school and Hadaf high-school. Her love for cinema and theatre made her change her mind about the field of tertiary schooling. She withdrew from a B.S. at [[Alzahra University]] and took various Drama courses in Tehran focusing on acting, including [[Hamid Samandarian]]'s drama workshops at The [[Theatre Organization of Tehran]], and [[Mahin Oskoui]]'s underground acting classes held in her apartment.

In 1997, Granaz immigrated to Australia with her family. She changed her focus from pursuing acting to Screen Studies and filmmaking. In 2002, she made her Honors film ''A Short Film About Colour'', shot by the renowned Iranian cinematographer [[Firooz Malekzadeh]]. The short film earned Granaz the best director award from [[Flinders University]] and an honorary membership to the [[Australian Screen Directors Association]] (ASDA).

Granaz published her first book, ''Khatkhati Rooye Shab خط خطی روی شب'' (''Sketching On Night''), underground in Tehran in 1996 to had an extensive reception. Her second book, ''Paberahneh Ta Sobh پابرهنه تا صبح'' (''Barefoot Till Morning''), was the winner of جایزه شعر کارنامه یاجایزه شعر امروز ایران  ''Karnameh’s best poetry book of the year award'' in 2001 and is currently in its fourth edition. She published her third collection, ''Avazhaye Zan e Biejazeh آوازهای زن بی اجازه '' (''The Songs of the Forbidden Woman''), in 2003. It has reached its second edition so far. Her poems have been anthologised worldwide and her solo bi-lingual collection was published in France by MEET publishers. Granaz published ''Les Rescapes De La Patience'' (translated by Farideh Rava, and with a preface by Jean Baptiste Para) after a sponsored literary residency in [[Saint Nazaire]], France. Also, in 2004 a DEA thesis at [[Sorbonne University]] (Paris III) was lodged on her poetry (by Etienne Forget).

After receiving an Honours degree from Flinders University, Granaz got accepted in AFTRS, the [[Australian Film TV and Radio School]] in Sydney. She graduated with a postgraduate degree in [[film editing]] in 2006. Currently, she is a doctoral candidate with a scholarship at the [[University of Western Sydney]] researching "The Aesthetics of Poetic Cinema". She has made several short films and documentaries and has participated in various roles in a few feature films. In the field of poetry, she has conducted many poetry readings worldwide, including her participation in the Paris Autumn Festival in 2000 (introduced and translated by Media Kashigar, managed by Alain Lance), [[SOAS]]/[[London University]] in 2001, [[Vienna]] and Mondorf/[[Luxembourg]] in 2003, Saint Nazaire, [[Nantes]], [[Marseille]], Arles/France in 2004-5, Sydney/Australia in 2005, “Caravan of poetry” through Paris, La Rochelle, [[Marseille]], Poitier, and [[Nantes]]/France in 2006, the Fifth International Festival of Poetry “Merci Poesie”, [[Göteborg]]/Sweden in 2008, the Iranian Arts and Literature Festival, San Francisco/USA in 2009, and Luxemburg in 2009. Her latest presentation was a lecture followed by poetry reading at [[Stanford University]] in February 2009 and [[University of California at Irvine]] in January 2011.

There are a number of accounts, articles, and critiques written on Granaz's poetry including the articles of some renowned Iranian writers and critics such as [[M. Azad]], Dr. [[Jalil Doustkhah]], [[Mohammad Rahim Okhovat]], [[Shahrnoush Parsipour]], and [[Ali Babachahi]]. Her poetry has been so far translated and published in French, English, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese, and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. In 2006, being shortlisted in local, statewide, and across the country competitions she won the ''Holding Redlich'' prize for her script "pitch" at the [[Screen Producers Association of Australia]]. Her prize was a sponsorship for her trip to [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007 in order to present her project idea in the film market. Her first feature film ''[[My Tehran for Sale]]'' (''tehran-e-man ,haraj'' تهران من، حراج ) a 2009 production was shot in July/Aug 2008 in Tehran. The film written and directed by Granaz Moussavi is the first feature collaboration of Iran and Australia, premiered at the [[Adelaide Film Festival]] (Feb 2009), and an official selection of [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (Sep 2009),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiff.net/filmsandschedules/films/mytehranforsale&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver International Film Festival]], [[Pusan International Film Festival]] (Oct 2009) and [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] (Nov 2009), The Museum of Modern Art ([[MoMA]]) New York (Jan 2010), [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] (Jan 2010), International Film Festival Prague - [[Febiofest]], 2010 Cinema Novo Film Festival Brugges, 2010 CPH:PIX Copenhagen International Film Festival, 2010 Guadalajara International Film Festival Mexico, Sydney Travelling Film Festival, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival, HRAFF 2010, Fukuoka International Film Festival 2010, Global Lens USA 2010 and Dialogue of Cultures Film Festival New York 2011.

'''''Hortus conclusus''''' is a [[Latin]] term, meaning literally "enclosed garden". At their root, both of the words in ''hortus conclusus'' refer linguistically to enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, ''A History of Garden design'', (New York:Praeger) 1963:17.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hortus conclusus'' is both an [[emblem|emblematic attribute]] and a title of the [[Virgin Mary]] in [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] poetry&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Stewart, ''The Enclosed Garden: The Tradition and Image in Seventeenth-Century Poetry'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press) 1966, discussed late sixteenth and seventeenth-century poetry in English; its four first chapters trace the ''hortus conclusus'' theme in European literatures and the visual arts.&lt;/ref&gt; and art, suddenly appearing in paintings and manuscript illuminations about 1330 &lt;ref&gt; Michelle P.

The term ''hortus conclusus'' is derived from the [[Vulgate]] Bible's ''[[Canticle of Canticles]]'' (also called the ''Song of Songs'' or ''Song of Solomon'') 4:12, in Latin: "''Hortus conclusus soror mea, sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus''" ("A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the shared linguistic culture of Christendom, expressed in [[homily|homilies]] expounding the ''Song of Songs'' as [[allegory]] where the image of King [[Solomon]]'s nuptial song to his bride was reinterpreted as the love and union between Christ and the Church, the mystical marriage with the Church as the [[Bride of Christ]].

The verse "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee" (4.7) from the ''Song'' was also regarded as a scriptural confirmation of the developing and still controversial doctrine of Mary's [[Immaculate Conception]] - being born without [[Original Sin]] ("macula" is Latin for spot).

[[Christian]] tradition states that [[Jesus Christ]] was conceived to Mary [[Virgin birth of Jesus|miraculously]] and without disrupting her virginity by the [[Holy Spirit]], the third person of the [[Holy Trinity]]. As such, Mary in late medieval and Renaissance art, illustrating the long-held doctrine of the [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]], as well as the Immaculate Conception, was shown in or near a walled garden or yard. This was a representation of her "closed off" womb, which was to remain untouched, and also of her being protected, as by a wall, from sin.  In the [[Grimani Breviary]], scrolling labels identify the emblemmatic objects betokening the Immaculate Conception: the enclosed garden (''hortus conclusus''), the tall cedar (''cedrus exalta''), the well of living waters (''puteus aquarum viventium''), the olive tree (''oliva speciosa''), the fountain in the garden (''fons hortorum''), the rosebush (''plantatio rosae'').&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Husband, reporting the exhibition and its catalogue in ''The Burlington Magazine'', '''125''', No. 967 (October 1983:643).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all actual medieval ''horti conclusi'' even strove to include all these details, the olive tree in particular being insufficiently hardy for northern European gardens.

The enclosed garden is recognizable in [[Fra Angelico]]'s ''Annunciation'' (''illustration, above left''), dating from 1430-32.

Two pilgrimage sites are dedicated to Mary of the Enclosed Garden in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Flanders|Flemish]] cultural area. One is the statue at the hermitage-chapel in [[Warfhuizen]]: "[[Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen|Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden]]". The second, "Onze Lieve Vrouw van Tuine" (literally "Our Lady of the Garden"), is venerated at the cathedral of [[Ypres]].

==Actual gardens==
[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|left|Hortus conclusus  depicted by Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins]]
All gardens are by definition enclosed or bounded spaces, but the enclosure may be somewhat open, and consist of columns, low hedges or fences. An actual [[walled garden]], literally surrounded by a wall, is a subset of gardens. The meaning of ''hortus conclusus'' suggests a more private style of garden.

In the [[history of gardens]] the High Medieval ''hortus conclusus'' typically had a well or fountain at the center, bearing its usual symbolic freight (see "[[Fountain of Life]]") in addition to its practical uses. The convention of four paths that divided the square enclosure into quadrants, was so strong that the pattern was employed even where the paths led nowhere. All medieval gardens were enclosed, protecting the private precinct from public intrusion, whether by folk or by stray animals. The enclosure might be as simple as [[Wattle-and-daub|woven wattle]] fencing or of stout or decorative masonry; or it might be enclosed by [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]]work tunneled pathways in a secular garden or by an arcaded [[cloister]], for communication or meditative pacing.

The origin of the [[cloister]] is in the Roman colonnaded [[peristyle]], as every garden history notes; the ruined and overgrown [[Roman villa]]s that were so often remade as the site of [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine monasteries]] had lost their planted garden features with the first decades of abandonment: "gardening, more than architecture, more than painting, more than music, and far more than literature, is an ephemeral art; its masterpieces disappear, leaving little trace."&lt;ref&gt;Clifford 1963, ''eo. loc.''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though "when, in 1070, the [[Montecassino|abbey of Cassino]]&lt;ref&gt;The site was that of a Roman imperial villa, as was the site of Benedict's monastery at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], occupying Nero's former villa.&lt;/ref&gt; was rebuilt," [[Georgina Masson]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;Masson, ''Italian Gardens'' (New York: Abrams) 1961:46.&lt;/ref&gt; "the garden was described as 'a paradise in the Roman fashion'", it may have been merely "the aura of the great classical tradition" alone that had survived. The ninth-century idealised [[plan of Saint Gall]] (''illustration'') shows an arcaded cloister with a central well and cross paths from the centers of each range of arcading, but when a consciously patterned garden was revived for the medieval cloister, the patterning came through [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] and its hybrid culture that adapted many Islamic elements, in this case the enclosed North African courtyard gardens, ultimately based on the [[Persian garden]] tradition.

The practical enclosed garden was laid out in the treatise by [[Pietro Crescenzi]] of Bologna, ''Liber ruralium commodorum'', a work that was often copied, as the many surviving manuscripts of its text attest, and often printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Late medieval paintings and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations in manuscripts]] such as for ''[[The Romance of the Rose]]''— where the garden in the text is largely allegorical— often show a turfed bank for a seat as a feature of the ''hortus conclusus''. Only in the fifteenth century, at first in Italy, did some European gardens begin to look outward.

Sitting, walking and playing music were the activities most often portrayed in the numerous fifteenth-century paintings and illuminated manuscripts, where strenuous activities were inappropriate. In Rome, a late fifteenth-century [[cloister]] at San Giovanni dei Genovesi was constructed for the use of the Genoese ''[[Nation|natio]]'', an ''Ospitium Genoensium'', as a plaque still proclaims, which provided shelter in cubicles off its vaulted encircling arcades, and a meeting place and shelter reuniting those from the distant home city.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Lotz, "Bramante and the Quattrocento Cloister" ''Gesta'' '''12'''.1/2 (1973):111-121) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat earlier, Pietro Barbo, who became [[Pope Paul II]] in 1464, began the construction of a ''hortus conclusus'', the Palazzetto del Giardino di San Marco, attached to the Venetian Cardinals' Roman seat, the Palazzo Venezia.&lt;ref&gt;It was dismantled and re-erected in 1910 to make space for [[Piazza Venezia]].&lt;/ref&gt; It served as Paul's private garden during his papacy; inscriptions stress its secular functions as ''sublimes moenibus hortos...ut relevare animum, durasque repellere curas'', a garden of sublime delights, a retreat from cares, and praise it in classicising terms, as the home of the [[dryad]]s, suggesting that there was a central grove of trees, and mentioning its snowy-white stuccoed porticoes. An eighteenth-century engraving shows a tree-covered central mount, which has been recreated in the modern replanting, with box-bordered cross and saltire gravelled paths.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinc hortos dryadumque domos et amena vireta/ Porticibus circum et niveis lustrata columnis''Lotz 1973 ''eo. loc.'' and figs 10 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farnese Gardens]] (''Orti Farnesiani sul Palatino''—or "Gardens of Farnese upon the Palatine") were created by [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]] in 1550 on Rome's northern [[Palatine Hill]], for Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] (1520–89). These become the first private [[botanical garden]]s in Europe (the first botanical gardens of any kind in Europe being started by Italian universities in the mid-16th century, only a short time before). Alessandro called his summer home at the site ''Horti Farnesiani'', probably in reference to the ''hortus conclusus.'' These gardens were also designed in the Roman peristylium style with a central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theromanforum.com/?p=160 History of the Farneses and the garden.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in the age of the automobile, the enclosed garden that had never disappeared in [[Islam]]ic society, became an emblem of serenity and privacy in the Western world.

==In art==
[[Image:Unicorn annunciation.jpg|thumb|Hunt of the Unicorn Annunciation (ca. 1500) from a Netherlandish Book of Hours. In this example [[Gideon]]'s fleece is worked in as well, and the altar at the rear has [[Aaron's rod]] that miraculously flowered in the centre. Both are [[Typology (theology)|types]] for the Annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 54&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''hortus conclusus'' was one of a number of depictions of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages developed to be more informal and intimate than the traditional hieratic enthroned Virgin adopted from Byzantine icons, or the [[Coronation of the Virgin]]. The subject began as a specific metaphor for the [[Annunciation]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; but tended to develop into a relaxed ''[[sacra conversatione]]'', with several figures beside the Virgin seated, and less specific associations.  Germany and the Netherlands in the 15th century saw the peak popularity of this depiction of the Virgin, usually with Child, and very often a crowd of angels, saints and donors, in the garden - the garden by itself, to represent the Virgin, was much rarer. Often walls, or [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellises]] close off the sides and rear, or it may be shown as open, except for raised banks, to a landscape beyond. Sometimes, as with a [[Gerard David]]'s  ''The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor'' (Below) the garden is very fully depicted; at other times, as in [[engraving]]s by [[Martin Schongauer]], only a wattle fence and a few sprigs of grass serve to identify the theme. Italian painters typically also keep plants to a minimum, and do not have grass benches. A sub-variety of the theme was the German "Madonna of the Roses", sometimes attempted in sculptured [[altarpiece]]s. The image was rare in Orthodox [[icon]]s, but there are at least some Russian examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www2/art/images/icon18.jpg Russian example], [[Tretyakov Gallery]] Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of depiction, not usually compatible with correct perspective, concentrates on showing the whole wall, and several garden structures or features that symbolize the mystery of Christ's conception, mostly derived from the ''Song of Songs'' or other Biblical passages, as interpreted by theological writers. These may include one or more temple or church-like buildings, an [[Ivory Tower]] (SS 7.4), an open-air altar with [[Aaron's rod]] flowering, surrounded by the bare rods of the other tribes, a gatehouse "tower of David, hung with shields" (SS 7.4),&lt;ref&gt;"Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.&lt;/ref&gt; with the gate closed, the [[Ark of the Covenant]], a well (often covered), a fountain, and the morning sun above (SS 6.10).&lt;ref&gt;"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of depiction usually shows the Annunciation, although sometimes the child Jesus is held by Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,pp 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; The miniature at right shows a relatively simple example; below a large Spanish altarpiece is able to combine many of the usual features (others no doubt contained in the many chapels) with correct perspective.

A rather rare, late 15th century, variant of this depiction was to combine the Annunciation in the ''hortus conclusus'' with the ''Hunt of the [[Unicorn]]'' and ''Virgin and Unicorn'', so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The [[Council of Trent]] finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 52-4 &amp; figs 126-9, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}, [http://www.sagen.at/fotos/data/603/medium/Maria_Gail_HortusConclusus_Detail.jpg another image]&lt;/ref&gt; partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal. In the 16th century the subject of the ''hortus conclusus'' drifts into the open air ''[[Sacra Conversazione]]'' and the Madonnas in a landscape of [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Raphael]], where it is hard to say if an allusion is intended.

An exhibition of later medieval visual representations of ''hortus inclusus'' was mounted at [[Dumbarton Oaks]], Washington DC;&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue, Marilyn Stokstad and Jerry Stannard, ''Gardens of the Middle Ages'', Dumbarton Oaks and Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas (University of Kansas) 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition drew a distinction between "garden representations as thematic reinforcements and those that seemingly treat the garden as a subject in itself"; in reviewing it Timothy Husband, warned against uncritical interpretation of the refined detail in manuscript illuminations' "seemingly objective representation". "Late medieval garden imagery, by subjugating direct observation to symbolic or allegorical intention, reflects more a state of mind than reality," &lt;ref&gt;Husband 1983:644.&lt;/ref&gt; if a disjunct can be detected where the objects of the world shimmered with pregnant allegorical meaning. South Netherlandish illuminations and painting appear to document the "turf benches, fountains, raised beds, 'estrade'&lt;ref&gt;An ''estrade'' tree was pruned into a series of diminishing horizontal tiers like a sweetmeat stand, the French ''estrade'' coming from Spanish ''estrado'', denoting the carpeted and raised section of a room (cf ''OED'', ''s.v.'' "estrade", "estrado").&lt;/ref&gt; trees, potted plants, walkways, enclosing walls, [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellises]], [[Acacia|wattle]] fences and [[Pergola|bowers]]" familiar to contemporary viewers, but assembled into an illusion of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Husband, ''eo. loc.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern cultural references==
The concept for the 2011 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was the hortus conclusus, a contemplative room, a garden within a garden. Designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and with a garden created by Piet Oudolf, the Pavilion was a place abstracted from the world of noise and traffic and the smells of London – an interior space within which to sit, to walk, to observe the flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/04/serpentine_gallery_pavillion_2011_zumthor.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juliet Kathleen Pannett''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] ([[Name at birth|née]] '''Somers'''; 15 July 1911 – 22 August 2005) was an English portrait painter.

==Background==
Born in Hove, East Sussex, Pannett started painting at three, and wanted to be a professional artist by seventeen.&lt;ref name=NPG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07394/juliet-pannett |title=Juliet Panett |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPG1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/2004/juliet-pannett.php|title=Juliet Pannett|publisher= [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She trained at [[Faculty of Arts (University of Brighton)|Brighton College of Art]] in the 1920s under Louis Ginnett, and received her first artistic commission at eighteen to draw local Sussex characters for the ''Sussex County Magazine''.&lt;ref name=NPG1/&gt; Pannett maintained a studio in Hove and was elected a member of the Society of Graphic Artists in 1934. She was a professional artist until her marriage in 1938.&lt;ref name=NPG1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt;

Pannett married Major Rick Pannett who had been injured in the [[First World War]] when he was shot in the mouth. The bullet had pierced his cheek and missed all his bones.&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Pannett gave up painting after the birth of her children. Suffering from depression, it was alleviated when she resumed painting.&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; In 1949 the family moved to [[Croydon]] where she built a studio in her garage.&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt; The Pannett family later moved to [[Angmering]] in Sussex in 1964.&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt;

==Noted portraits==
Among her subjects were [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field-Marshal Montgomery]], film director [[Jean Cocteau]], athlete [[Chris Chataway]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]].&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Pannett was a keen cricketer and drew such cricketers as [[Maurice Tate]] and [[Bob Wyatt]].&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Pannett preferred to paint men rather than women, describing men as she found them "less troublesome as sitters...They never ask me not to put in their double chin or to leave out their wrinkles."&lt;ref name=ObvOct05/&gt;

Before the televised proceedings of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Pannett was employed by the [[Illustrated London News]] from 1957 to 1964 to sketch the events of the House.&lt;ref name=NPG/&gt; Sitting in the gallery of the Commons Pannett drew such historically significant events as [[Winston Churchill]]'s last appearance in the house in 1964.&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Pannett later formally drew several other [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]], including [[Alec Douglas-Home]], who told her that he had "the biggest head in London" and could never find a hat to fit him.&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Later Prime Ministers painted by Pannett included [[Edward Heath]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt;

For several years around 1960, Pannett supplied the [[Radio Times]] with drawings of musicians and other figures being broadcast on BBC radio. In February 1963, she was commissioned by ''The Illustrated London News'' to do several sketches of C. S. Lewis.

She painted [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1989 for the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]].&lt;ref name=BBCMar13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21532151|author=Justin Parkinson|title=Painting the Queen (and her prime ministers)|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|location=London|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pannett had previously drawn Princes [[Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]].&lt;ref name=BBCMar13/&gt; Upon seeing the portrait [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] commissioned a pastel drawing from her of the Queen for the 25th anniversary of the [[History of Malta#History of independent Malta 1964-.|Independence of Malta]].&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt;

==Recognition==
Due to her failing eyesight her last major portrait was of General Sir [[John Wilsey]].&lt;ref name=TelegSep05&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1498184/Juliet-Pannett.html|author=Justin Parkinson|title=Obituary: Juliet Pannett|newspaper=[[the Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1993, and was a member of the Pastel Society and a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and an Honorary Freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]], who awarded her their gold medal in 1995.&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt;

At the time of her death in 2005 she was the oldest living artist to have work in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]'s collection.&lt;ref name=TelegSep05/&gt; Her husband had died in 1980, she was survived by her two children, who are both artists.&lt;ref name=ObvOct05&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/06/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|author=DL Libterre|title=Obituary: Juliet Pannett|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her autobiography, ''My Colourful Life'' was published in 2006.

'''Latte art''' is a method of preparing [[coffee]] created by pouring [[microfoam]] into a shot of [[espresso]] and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the [[latte]].  It can also be created or embellished by simply "drawing" in the top layer of foam.  Latte art is particularly difficult to create consistently, due to the demanding conditions required of both the espresso shot and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/latteartguide|title=Latte Art Guide|last=Imam|first=Febri|date=|website=|publisher=CoffeeGeek|accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, is limited by the experience of the [[barista]] and quality of the [[espresso machine]].  The pour itself, then, becomes the last challenge for the latte artist. The term is not reserved to latte coffee only, it also applies for other beverages containing milk foam like [[cappuccino]] and [[hot chocolate]].

== History ==
Latte art developed independently in different countries, following the introduction of espresso and the development of [[microfoam]], the combination of crema (which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee) and microfoam allowing the pattern; it presumably was initially developed in Italy.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[David Schomer]] {{Harv|Schomer|1994}} describes pitcher-shaking in latte art as "quite standard in the world of Italian espresso preparation", indicating that it was well established in Italy by this time.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, latte art was developed in Seattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly popularized by [[David Schomer]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3072720/ns/business-us_business/t/meet-espressos-exacting-master/ |title=Meet espresso's exacting master&amp;nbsp;— Food Inc |first= Jon |last= Bonné |authorlink= Jon Bonné |website=[[NBC News]], [[MSNBC]] |date=May 9, 2003 |dead-url=no |archiveurl= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3072720/ns/business-us_business/t/meet-espressos-exacting-master/ |archivedate= July 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schomer credits the development of microfoam ("velvet foam" or "milk texturing") to Jack Kelly of ''Uptown espresso'' in 1986, and by 1989 the heart pattern was established and a signature at Schomer's ''[[Espresso Vivace]].'' The rosette pattern was then developed by Schomer in 1992, recreating the technique based on a photograph he saw from Cafe Mateki in Italy.&lt;ref name="art101"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espressovivace.com/archives/9412ct.html |title=Latte Art 101 |author=Schomer |publisher=espressovivace.com |work=CoffeTalke |date=1994 |page=13 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schomer subsequently popularized latte art in his course "Caffe Latte Art". At the same time Luigi Lupi from Italy met Schomer on the internet and they exchanged videos they made on Latteart and [http://www.latteart.org Cappuccini Decorati].

== Chemistry ==

Latte art is a mixture of two [[colloid]]s: the [[crema (coffee)|crema]], which is an [[emulsion]] of coffee oil and brewed coffee; and the microfoam, which is a [[foam]] of air in milk. Milk itself is an emulsion of butterfat in water, while coffee is a [[mixture]] of coffee solids in water. Neither of these colloids are [[Chemical stability|stable]] – crema dissipates from espresso, while microfoam separates into drier foam and liquid milk – both degrading significantly in a matter of seconds, and thus latte art lasts only briefly.

== Technique ==
{{see also|Microfoam#Procedure}}
[[File:Latte art leaf - 01.ogv|thumb|right|150px|Leaf]]
[[File:Latte art flower - 01.ogv|thumb|right|150px|Flower]]
Latte art requires first producing espresso with [[crema (coffee)|crema]] and [[microfoam]], and then combining these to make latte art. See [[Microfoam#Procedure|microfoam: procedure]] for how microfoam is made; this article concentrates on the latte art once the foam is made.

Before the milk is added, the espresso shot must have a creamy brown surface, an emulsion known as crema.  As the white foam from the milk rises to meet the red/brown surface of the shot, a [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] is created and the design emerges. As the milk is poured, the foam separates from the liquid and rises to the top. If the milk and espresso shot are "just right", and the pitcher is moved during the pour, the foam will rise to create a pattern on the surface. Alternatively, a pattern may be etched with a stick after the milk has been poured, rather than during the pour.

Some controversy exists within the coffee community as to whether or not there is excessive focus on latte art amongst baristas.  The argument is that too much focus on the [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] appearance of a drink leads some to ignore more important issues, such as taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/showreports/05-05-2008/20:05 |title=Anti Latte Art |publisher=CoffeeGeek |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially relevant with new baristas.

== Styles ==
[[File:Latte at Doppio Ristretto Chiang Mai 02.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The winner of a free-pouring championship creating his signature latte art, that of an angel surfing on waves.]]
There are two main types of latte art: free pouring (pattern created during the pour) and etching (using a tool to create a pattern after the pour). Free pouring is far more common in American cafés, and requires little additional time in preparing a drink.

=== Free pouring ===
The two most common forms of poured latte art are a heart shape and the "rosetta" or "rosette",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Both the Italianate ''[[wikt:rosetta|rosetta]]'' and the Anglicized ''[[wikt:rosette|rosette]]'' are used to describe this pattern; compare ''[[doppio]]'' and ''double'' for a double shot of espresso.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "fern" which resembles a type of flower or fern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratemyrosetta.com/ |title=Rate my Rosetta |publisher=Rate my Rosetta |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, hearts are simpler and more common in macchiatos, while rosettes are more complex and more common in lattes.

For free pouring, the cup is either kept level or tilted in one direction.  As the milk is poured straight into the cup, the foam begins to surface on one side (due to the tilt).  The barista then moves the pitcher from side to side as they level the cup, or simply wiggle the spout back and forth, and finishes by making a quick strike through the previously poured pattern.  This "strike" creates the stem portion of the flower design, and bends the poured zig-zag into a flower shape.

A more direct pour and less wiggling yields a heart shape, and minor variation (reduced lobes, larger stem) yields an apple shape.

More complex patterns are possible, some requiring multiple pours. Some examples of advanced latte art techniques are that of the tulip, wave heart, swan, or even a scorpion.&lt;ref name="latteartguide"&gt;[http://www.latteartguide.com/2013/04/what-is-latte-art.html "What Is Latte Art?"], latteartguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etching ===
[[File:Making of Latte art of cappuccino on Coffee Right in Brno, Brno-City District.jpg|thumb|Etching latte art.]]

[[Etching|Etched]] patterns range from simple geometric shapes to complicated drawings, such as crosshatching, images of animals and flowers, and are generally performed with a coffee stirrer of some sort. Etched latte art typically has a shorter lifespan than free poured latte art as the foam dissolves into the latte more quickly.

A crude but quick method with cappuccino is to pour chocolate powder through a metal cutout in which an image, typically a flower, has been incised. This is favoured by chain coffee shops like Costa where speed is of the essence when serving large numbers of clients during peak times.

== Variants ==
Latte art is made by adding microfoam to espresso. Similar patterns, though much fainter, can be achieved by adding microfoam to brewed coffee, as in a [[café au lait]] or tea. Alternatively, patterns can be etched in the crema of an espresso, without adding any milk, in order to yield '''espresso art'''.

'''Mikhail Vasilyevich Nesterov''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Васи́льевич Не́стеров}}; {{OldStyleDate|31 May|1862|19 May}}, [[Ufa]] &amp;ndash; 18 October 1942, [[Moscow]]) was a Russian and Soviet painter; associated with the [[Peredvizhniki]] and [[Mir Iskusstva]]. He was one of the first exponents of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] art in Russia.

== Biography ==
He was born to a strongly patriarchal merchant family. His father was a draper and [[haberdasher]], but always had a strong interest in history and literature. As a result, he was sympathetic to his son's desire to be an artist, but insisted that he acquire practical skills first and, in 1874, he was sent to Moscow where he enrolled at the [[Voskresensky District, Moscow Oblast|Voskresensky]] [[Realschule]].

In 1877, his counselors suggested that he transfer to the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]], where he studied with [[Pavel Sorokin (painter)|Pavel Sorokin]], [[Illarion Pryanishnikov]] and [[Vasily Perov]],&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; who was his favorite teacher. In 1879, he began to participate in the school's exhibitions. Two years later, he entered the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]], where he worked with [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. He was disappointed at the teaching there and returned to Moscow, only to find Perov on his deathbed, so he took lessons from [[Alexei Savrasov]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/symbolist/mikhail-nesterov Brief biography] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Mikhail Nesterov 009.jpeg|thumb|185px|left|The Hermit]]
After a brief stay in Ufa, where he met his future wife, Maria, he returned to Moscow and studied with [[Vladimir Makovsky]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; While creating a series of historical paintings, he supported himself doing illustrations for magazines and books published by {{ill|Alexei Stupin|ru|Ступин, Алексей Дмитриевич}}, including a collection of fairy tales by [[Pushkin]]. In 1885, he was awarded the title "Free Artist" and married, against his parent's wishes. The following year, his wife died after giving birth to his daughter, Olga.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Several of his works from this period feature his wife's image.

His first major success came with his painting, "The Hermit" which was shown at the seventeenth exhibition of the Peredvizhniki in 1889. It was purchased by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] and the money enabled Nesterov to take an extended trip to Austria, Germany, France and Italy. Upon returning, his painting, "The Vision to the Youth Bartholomew", the first in a series of works on the life of [[Sergius of Radonezh|Saint Sergius]], was shown at the eighteenth Peredvizhniki exhibition and also purchased by Tretyakov. This series would eventually include fifteen large canvases and occupy him for fifty years.

===Religious art===
In 1890, [[Adrian Prakhov]], who was overseeing work at [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]], became familiar with Nesterov's paintings and invited him to participate in creating murals and icons there. After some hesitation, he agreed, then travelled to Rome and Istanbul to acquaint himself with [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; This project would take twenty-two years to complete. Although it brought him great popularity, he apparently came to feel that the images required were too clichéd and beneath his dignity as an artist, so he occasionally introduced some minor innovations, such as setting portraits of saints in a recognizable landscape. 
[[File:Annunciation nesterov.jpg|thumb|175px|[[The Annunciation]], Marfo-Mariinsky Convent.]] 
Despite this, he undertook other religious commissions. In 1898, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George Alexandrovich]] asked him to work at the [[Alexander Nevsky]] church in [[Abastumani]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He spent six years there, off and on, creating 50 small murals and the [[iconostasis]], but was dissatisfied with the results. He was apparently much more pleased with later work at the [[Marfo-Mariinsky Convent]]. He refused to work on the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw]], because he did not approve of building an Orthodox cathedral in a predominantly Catholic city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/nesterov/index.htm Biographical notes] by Sergei Durylin @ Bibliotekar.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, he wanted to deepen his spiritual appreciation of the monastic life, so he spent some time at the [[Solovetsky Monastery]] on the coast of the [[White Sea]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He painted numerous works there and the influence of his visit could be seen in his canvases for many years after. He was also inspired by the novels of [[Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov]], dealing with the lives of the [[Old Believers]] in the [[Volga Region]]. In 1902, he married Ekaterina Vasilyeva, whom he had met admiring his works at an exhibition.

===Later years===
In 1905, after the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution]] began, he joined the [[Union of the Russian People]], an extreme right-wing nationalist party that supported the Tsar.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As a result, he was in some danger after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1918, he moved to [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]], where he became ill and was unable to work. He returned to Moscow in 1920 and was forced to give up religious painting, although he continued to work on his Saint Sergius series in private. From then until his death, he painted mostly portraits; notably [[Ivan Ilyin]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Sergei Yudin (surgeon)|Sergei Yudin]], [[Alexey Shchusev]] and [[Vera Mukhina]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/n/nesterov/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Nesterov-Pavlov.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Portrait of Ivan Pavlov, 1935]]
In 1938, toward the end of the [[Great Purge]], his son-in-law, Vladimir Schroeter, a prominent lawyer, was accused of being a spy and shot. His daughter was sent to a prison camp in [[Taraz|Zhambyl]], where she was brutally interrogated before being released. He was also arrested and held for two weeks at [[Butyrka Prison]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;

In 1941, he was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] for his portrait of Pavlov (created in 1935). It was one of the first given to an artist. Shortly after, he received the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]. As the war progressed, his health and financial situation deteriorated rapidly. He had a stroke while working on his painting "Autumn in the Village" and died at {{ill|Botkin Hospital|ru|Городская клиническая больница имени С. П. Боткина}}.

His unfinished memoirs, which he had begun in 1926, were published later that year under the title "Bygone Days". In 1962, he was honored with a postage stamp. In 1996, his likeness appeared on the 50 [[Ural franc]] banknote and, in 2015, a monument to him was unveiled at the {{ill|Bashkir State Art Museum|ru|Башкирский государственный художественный музей имени М. В. Нестерова}} in Ufa.

The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B.

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]]. Paxton albums such as ''Outward Bound''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/outward-bound-mw0000785860 |title=Outward Bound - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Morning Again''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/morning-again-mw0000786225 |title=Morning Again - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as [[Holly Near]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-in-there-mw0000104473 |title=Hang in There - Holly Near &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Korona]], [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]], [[Utah Phillips]] and more recently [[David Rovics]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G. Lansdale and the Folksongs of Americans in the Vietnam War|journal=American Folklore|year=1989|volume=102|pages=390–411|jstor=541780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was banned from broadcast by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sex-pistols-mn0000418740/biography |title=Sex Pistols &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|1977]] due to its presumed anti-[[Royalism]], partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a "fascist regime". The following year, the release of debut Crass album [[The Feeding Of the 5000]] was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Grimes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-history-of-music-censorship-9051887.html |title=A history of music censorship |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their [[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]] album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their [[Frankenchrist]] album artwork.&lt;ref name="DKs"/&gt;

[[The Clash]] are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or [[Political nihilism|nihilistic]] attack of many early punk bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonino D’Ambrosio |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2003/06/01/let-fury-have-the-hour-the-passionate-politics-of-joe-strummer |title='Let Fury Have the Hour': The Passionate Politics of Joe Strummer by Antonino D’Ambrosio |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clash-mn0000075747/biography |title=The Clash &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/[[new wave music|new wave]] bands such as [[The Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]] and [[Newtown Neurotics]], and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as [[White Riot|racial tension]], [[Career Opportunities (song)|unemployment]], [[Garageland (song)|class resentment]], [[London's Burning (The Clash song)|urban alienation]] and police violence, as well as [[I'm So Bored with the USA|imperialism]].

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy.

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music journalism''' (or "'''music criticism'''") is media criticism and reporting about popular [[music]] topics, including [[pop music]], [[rock music]], and related styles. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now thought of as [[classical music]]. In the 2000s, a more prominent branch of music journalism is an aspect of [[entertainment journalism]], covering [[popular music]] and including profiles of [[singer]]s and [[Band (music)|band]]s, live concert, and [[album]] reviews.

==Origins in classical music criticism==
[[File:151 Franck Hector Berlioz.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Hector Berlioz]], active as a music journalist in Paris in the 1830s and 1840s]]
Music journalism has its roots in [[classical music|classical]] [[music criticism]], which has traditionally comprised the study, discussion, evaluation, and interpretation of music that has been composed and notated in a [[sheet music|score]] and the evaluation of the performance of classical songs and pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[concerto]]s .

Before about the 1840s, reporting on music was either done by musical journals, such as ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' (later the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''), founded by [[Robert Schumann]], and in London journals such as ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (founded in 1844 as ''The Musical Times and Singing-class Circular''); or else by reporters at general newspapers where music did not form part of the central objectives of the publication. An influential English 19th-century music critic, for example, was [[James William Davison]] of ''[[The Times]].'' The composer [[Hector Berlioz]] also wrote reviews and criticisms for the Paris press of the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name=bujic/&gt;

Modern [[art music]] journalism is often informed by [[music theory]] consideration of the many diverse elements of a musical piece or performance, including (as regards a [[musical composition]]) its form and style, and for performance, standards of technique and expression. These standards were expressed, for example, in journals such as ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded by [[Robert Schumann]], and are continued today in the columns of serious [[newspaper]]s and journals such as ''[[The Musical Times]]''.&lt;ref name=bujic&gt;Bujić, Bojan (n.d.), "Criticism of Music" in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', [[Oxford Music Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors&amp;mdash;including growth of education, the influence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement generally and in music, popularization (including the 'star-status' of many performers such as [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]), among others&amp;mdash;led to an increasing interest in music among non-specialist journals, and an increase in the number of critics by profession of varying degrees of competence and integrity. The 1840s could be considered a turning point, in that music critics after the 1840s generally were not also practicing musicians.&lt;ref name=bujic/&gt; However, counterexamples include [[Alfred Brendel]], [[Charles Rosen]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Ernst Krenek]]; all of whom were modern practitioners of the classical music tradition who also write (or wrote) on music.

==Classical==
In the early 1980s, a decline in the quantity of classical criticism began occurring "when classical-music criticism visibly started to disappear" from the media. At that time, magazines such as ''Time'' and ''Vanity Fair'' employed classical music critics, but by the early 1990s, classical critics were dropped in many magazines, in part due to "a decline of interest in classical music, especially among younger people".&lt;ref&gt;Sandow, Greg, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118194664260737253 "Yes, Classical-Music Criticism Is in Decline but the Last Thing the Industry Should Do Is Blame the Press"], ''Wall Street Journal''. Accessed on March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of concern in classical music journalism was how American reviewers can write about ethnic and folk music from cultures other than their own, such as Indian [[raga]]s and traditional Japanese works.&lt;ref name=schick&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Robert D. |title=Classical Music Criticism: With a Chapter on Reviewing Ethnic Music |location=New York |publisher=Garland |year=1996 |pages=166–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyO3jcUpp4UC&amp;pg=PA173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii,173}} In 1990, the World Music Institute interviewed four ''[[New York Times]]'' music critics who came up with the following criteria on how to approach ethnic music:

# A review should relate the music to other kinds of music that readers know, to help them understand better what the program was about.
# "The performers [should] be treated as human beings and their music [should] be treated as human activity rather than a mystical or mysterious phenomenon."
# The review should show an understanding of the music's cultural backgrounds and intentions.&lt;ref name=schick/&gt;{{rp|173–74}}

A key finding in a 2005 study of arts journalism in America was that the profile of the "average classical music critic is a white, 52-year old male, with a graduate degree".&lt;ref name=classicalcritic&gt;{{cite conference |last1=McGill |first1=Lawrence |first2=Willa J. |last2=Conrad |first3=Donald |last3=Rosenberg |first4=András |last4=Szántó |title=The Classical Music Critic: A Survey of Music Critics at General-Interest and Specialized News Publications in America |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Music Critics Association of North America |conference=National Arts Journalism Program |year=2005 |url=http://www.mcana.org/images/Critics_Survey_PDF.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911221451/http://www.mcana.org/images/Critics_Survey_PDF.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Demographics indicated that the group was 74% male, 92% white, and 64% had earned a graduate degree.&lt;ref name=classicalcritic/&gt;{{rp|15}} One critic of the study pointed out that because all newspapers were included, including low-circulation regional papers, the female representation of 26% misrepresented the actual scarcity, in that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics", with the notable exceptions of [[Anne Midgette]] in the ''New York Times'' and Wynne Delacoma in the ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;ref name=iawmlist&gt;{{cite mailing list|first=William |last=Osborne |url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |mailing-list=IAWMLIST |publisher=International Alliance for Women in Music |date=June 11, 2005 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that classical music criticism, which it characterized as "a high-minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers", had undergone "a series of hits in recent months" with the elimination, downgrading, or redefinition of critics' jobs at newspapers in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, citing ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's [[Peter G. Davis]], "one of the most respected voices of the craft, [who] said he had been forced out after 26 years".&lt;ref name="Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics 2007"&gt;Wakin, Daniel J., "Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics", ''The New York Times'', June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing "robust analysis, commentary and reportage as vital to the health of the art form", ''The New York Times'' stated in 2007 that it continued to maintain "a staff of three full-time classical music critics and three freelancers", noting also that classical music criticism had become increasingly available on blogs, and that a number of other major newspapers "still have full-time classical music critics", including (in 2007) the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name="Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics 2007" /&gt;

Staff reporters such as [[Chris Welch]] and [[Ray Coleman]] applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=85, 88, 89–91}} Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of ''[[The Times]]'' when [[William Mann (critic)|William Mann]], the paper's [[classical music]] critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendron|first=Bernard|title=Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-28737-9|ref=harv|pp=14, 164–65, 341}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1965, ''[[The Observer]]'', the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing [[George Melly]] as its "critic of pop culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Bray|title=1965: The Year Modern Britain Was Born|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=London|isbn=978-1-84983-387-5|pp=262–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Tony Palmer]]'s arrival at ''The Observer'',{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=125fn}} the first daily newspaper to employ a dedicated rock critic was ''[[The Guardian]]'', with the appointment of [[Geoffrey Cannon]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/geoffrey-cannon/|title=Geoffrey Cannon|publisher=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Melody Maker''{{'}}s writers advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. "By 1999, the 'quality' press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums", which had a "key role in keeping pop" in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of "legitimating pop as an art form"; as a result, "newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon".&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|129}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2018}}

In the world of pop music criticism, there has tended to be a quick turnover. The "pop music industry" expects that any particular rock critic will likely disappear from popular view within five years; in contrast, according to author Mark Fenster, the "stars" of rock criticism are more likely to have long careers with "book contracts, featured columns, and editorial and staff positions at magazines and newspapers".&lt;ref name=fenster-jones2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenster|first=Mark|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Steve|chapter=Consumers' Guides: The Political Economy of the Music Press and the Democracy of Critical Discourse |page=85 |title=Pop Music and the Press|year=2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=N-ViwZnnR3oC&amp;pg=PA85 |isbn=9781566399661|publisher=Temple University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Richard Goldstein - Pop Conference 2015 - 02 (17182432526).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Richard Goldstein (pictured at the 2015 [[EMP Museum|EMP]] Pop Conference) was the first American music critic to focus on rock music.]]
Author Bernard Gendron writes that in the United States "the emergence of a 'serious' rock press and the rock critic" began in 1966, presaged by [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], the [[folk music]] critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing articles praising the Beatles and [[Bob Dylan]], the last of whom had just embraced rock 'n' roll by performing with electric backing at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=190}} [[Paul Williams (journalist)|Paul Williams]], an eighteen-year-old student, launched the pop journal ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy!]]'' in February 1966; in June, [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]], a recent graduate and [[New Journalism]] writer, debuted his "Pop Eye" column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which Gendron describes as "the first regular column on rock 'n' roll ... to appear in an established cultural publication".{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=191}} Rock journalist [[Clinton Heylin]], in his role as editor of ''The Penguin Book of Rock &amp; Roll Writing'', cites "the true genesis of rock criticism" to the emergence of ''Crawdaddy!''{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=73–74}} Lindberg et al. say that, while Williams is widely considered to be the first American rock critic, he "nevertheless looked to England for material".{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=74}}

According to Gendron, Goldstein's most significant early pieces were a "manifesto" on rock 'n' roll and "pop aestheticism", and a laudatory assessment of the Beatles' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' album. Published in late August, the latter article provided "the first substantial rock review devoted to one album to appear in any nonrock magazine with accreditory power".{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=192}} Whereas Williams could be sure of a sympathetic readership, given the nature of his publication, Goldstein's task was to win over a more highbrow readership to the artistic merits of contemporary pop music.{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=192}} At this time, both Goldstein and Williams gained considerable renown in the cultural mainstream{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=193}} and were the subject of profile articles in ''[[Newsweek]]''.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=118}}

The emergence of rock journalism coincided with an attempt to position rock music, particularly the Beatles' work, in the American cultural landscape.{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=193–94}}{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=118–19}} The critical discourse was further heightened by the respectful coverage afforded the genre in mainstream publications such as ''Newsweek'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in the months leading up to and following the release of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2017/05/the-beatles-sgt-peppers-was-a-masterpiece-of-timing.html|first=Jack|last=Hamilton|title=''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s Timing Was As Good As Its Music|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=24 May 2017|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=194–95}} Within this discourse, [[Richard Meltzer]], in an essay for ''Crawdaddy!'' in March, challenged the highbrow aesthetic of rock proposed by Goldstein. The latter's mixed review of ''Sgt. Pepper'' in ''The New York Times'' was similarly the subject of journalistic debate, and invited reprisals from musicologists, composers and cultural commentators.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=118–19}}

Among other young American writers who became pop columnists following Goldstein's appointment were [[Robert Christgau]] (at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', from June 1967), [[Ellen Willis]] (''[[The New Yorker]]'', March 1968) and [[Ellen Sander]] (''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', October 1968).{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=193}} Christgau was the "originator of the 'consumer guide' approach to pop music reviews", an approach that was designed to help readers decide whether to buy a new album.&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|4}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2018}}

According to popular music academic Roy Shuker in 1994, music reference books such as ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' and ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''  played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers in the music industry, "constructing their own version of the traditional [[High culture|high]]/[[low culture]] split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism". These review collections, Shuker continues, "became bibles in the field, establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists. Record collectors and enthusiasts, and specialisation and secondhand record shops, inevitably have well-thumbed copies of these and similar volumes close at hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuker|first=Roy|year=1994|title=Understanding Popular Music|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415107229|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the realm of rock music, as in that of classical music,&lt;ref name=slonimsky&gt;{{cite book|last=Slonimsky|first=Nicolas|authorlink=Nicolas Slonimsky|title=Lexicon of Musical Invective|isbn=978-0-393-32009-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=JjW66BVA-j0C}} (citing many examples of insults in both directions)&lt;/ref&gt; critics have not always been respected by their subjects. [[Frank Zappa]] declared that "Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read." In the [[Guns N' Roses]] song "[[Get in the Ring]]", [[Axl Rose]] verbally attacked critics who gave the band negative reviews because of their actions on stage; such critics as [[Andy Secher]], Mick Wall and [[Bob Guccione Jr.]] were mentioned by name.

===Critical trends of the 21st century===

====2000s====
In the 2000s, online music bloggers began to supplement, and to some degree displace, music journalists in print media.&lt;ref name=edlund/&gt; In 2006, Martin Edlund of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' criticized the trend, arguing that while the "Internet has democratized music criticism, it seems it's also spread its penchant for uncritical hype".&lt;ref name=edlund&gt;Edlund, Martin. [http://www.nysun.com/arts/not-all-they-were-blogged-up-to-be/33913/ "Not All They Were Blogged Up To Be"]. ''The New York Sun''. June 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Wilson (writer)|Carl Wilson]] described "an upsurge in pro-pop sentiment among critics" during the early 2000s, writing that a "new generation [of music critics] moved into positions of critical influence" and then "mounted a wholesale critique against the syndrome of measuring all popular music by the norms of rock culture".&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Tom. [http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7703-the-decade-in-pop/2/ "The Decade in Pop"]. ''Pitchfork'' articles. August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine writer [[Jody Rosen]] discussed the 2000s-era trends in pop music criticism in his article "The Perils of Poptimism". Rosen noted that much of the debate is centered on a perception that rock critics regard rock as "normative ... the standard state of popular music ... to which everything else is compared".&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;Rosen, Jody. [http://www.slate.com/id/2141418/ "The Perils of Poptimism"]. ''Slate'' magazine. May 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At a 2006 pop critic conference, attendees discussed their "guilty pop pleasures, reconsidering musicians ([[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Phil Collins]]) and genres ([[blue-eyed soul]], [[Elevator music|Muzak]])" which rock critics have long dismissed as lightweight, commercial music. Rosen stated that "this new critical paradigm" is called "popism" – or, more evocatively (and goofily), "poptimism". The poptimism approach states: "Pop (and, especially, hip-hop) producers are as important as rock auteurs, [[Beyoncé]] is as worthy of serious consideration as [[Bruce Springsteen]], and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act."&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt;

[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|upright|American pop music critic Ann Powers]]
In 2008, [[Ann Powers]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' argued that pop music critics "have always been contrarians", because "pop music [criticism] rose up as a challenge to taste hierarchies, and has remained a pugilistic, exhibitionist business throughout pop's own evolution".&lt;ref name=powers2008&gt;[[Ann Powers|Powers, Ann]]. [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/27/entertainment/ca-pop27 "Bratty by nature"]. ''Los Angeles Times''. July 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Powers claimed that "[i]nsults, rejections of others' authority, bratty assertions of superior knowledge and even threats of physical violence are the stuff of which pop criticism is made", while at the same time, the "best [pop criticism] also offers loving appreciation and profound insights about how music creates and collides with our everyday realities".&lt;ref name=powers2008/&gt; She stated that pop criticism developed as a "slap at the establishment, at publications such as the hippie homestead ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the rawker outpost ''[[Creem]]''", adding that the "1980s generation" of post-punk indie rockers had in the mid-2000s "been taken down by younger 'poptimists,' who argue that lovers of underground rock are elitists for not embracing the more multicultural mainstream".&lt;ref name=powers2008/&gt; Powers likened the poptimist critics' debates about bands and styles to a "scrum in rugby", in that "[e]verybody pushes against everybody else, and we move forward in a huge blob of vehement opinion and mutual judgment".&lt;ref name=powers2008 /&gt;

====2010s====
Music critic and indie pop musician [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], in his 2010 book ''[[Music: What Happened?]]'', suggested, "Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it's pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence". Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared "to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade", stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist "a musical genius" while "in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable."&lt;ref name=mwh2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Scott|authorlink=Scott Miller (pop musician)|title=Music: What Happened?|year=2010|publisher=125 Records|isbn=9780615381961|url=http://www.loudfamily.com/mwh.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to "credit an artist with getting a feeling across", specifically pointing out critic [[Lester Bangs]] as "a ball of emotion at all times", who nonetheless "never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don't feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature."&lt;ref name=mwh2010 /&gt;

''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''{{'}}s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer.&lt;ref name=moore2014 /&gt; In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate "more music talk in music criticism", suggesting that "sensitively modest doses" of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion "that great melody writing occurred or it didn't". For example, Miller noted that critics rarely "identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song", in the way that working musicians might discuss "the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus".

Stevie Chick, a writer who teaches music journalism at [[City University London]], said, "I think more than any other journalism, music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reid |first=Alastair |date=March 22, 2013 |title=How To: Get Into Music Journalism |work=Journalism.co.uk |publisher=Mousetrap Media Ltd |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/skills/how-to-get-into-music-journalism/s7/a552475/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tris McCall]] of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' discussed his approach to music criticism in a 2010 interview, stating, "Most of us [critics] begin writing about music because we love it so much. We can't wait to tell our friends and neighbors about what we're hearing."&lt;ref name=jci2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/2010/05/18/jersey-citys-tris-mccall-joins-the-star-ledger/|date=May 18, 2010|newspaper=Jersey City Independent|first=Jon|last=Whiten|title=Jersey City’s Tris McCall Joins the Star-Ledger|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622032840/http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/2010/05/18/jersey-citys-tris-mccall-joins-the-star-ledger|archivedate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCall, even over the course of a long professional career, the enthusiastic impulse to share "never fades".&lt;ref name=jci2010/&gt; McCall expressed his interest in "examining why people respond to what they respond to. I hazard guesses. Sometimes I'm wrong, but I hope I'm always provocative."&lt;ref name=jci2010/&gt;

===Gender and race theory===
{{undue weight|date=November 2018}}
Applying [[critical theory]] (''e.g.'', critical gender studies and [[critical race theory]]) to music journalism, some academic writers suggest that mutual disrespect between critics and artists is one of many negative effects of [[rockism]]. In 2004, critic [[Kelefa Sanneh]] defined "rockism" as "idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star".&lt;ref name=brooks2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|pages=54–62 |doi=10.1353/wam.0.0002|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} Music journalism "infected" with rockism has become, according to [[Yale University|Yale]] professor Daphne Brooks,&lt;ref name=yaleafam&gt;{{cite web |title=Daphne Brooks |work=Department of African American Studies |publisher=Yale University |year=2015–16 |url=http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/daphne-brooks |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709221923/http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/daphne-brooks |archivedate=2015-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge "for those of us concerned with historical memory and popular music performance".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

[[Simon Frith]] said that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions".&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|134}} [[Kembrew McLeod]] analyzed terms used by critics to differentiate between pop music and rock, finding a gendered dichotomy in descriptions of "'serious,' 'raw,' and 'sincere' rock music as distinguished from 'trivial', 'fluffy,' and 'formulaic' pop music".&lt;ref name=mcleod-jones2002&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=Kembrew|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Steve|chapter=Between Rock and a Hard Place: Gender and Rock Criticism |page=96|title=Pop Music and the Press|year=2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=N-ViwZnnR3oC&amp;pg=PA96|isbn=9781566399661|publisher=Temple University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLeod found that a likely cause of this dichotomy was the lack of women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around a whopping 15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was graphically discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of [[Women in music#Music critics|women in music journalism]], written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=March 20, 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore described how another female music blogger, an "admitted outsider" who threatened no stereotypes, was greeted with enthusiasm by men, in contrast with Moore's own experiences as a self-described "insider" who was nevertheless expected to "prove" or "earn" her way into a male-dominated journalism scene.&lt;ref name=moore2014 /&gt;

According to Anwen Crawford, music critic for Australia's ''[[The Monthly]]'', the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago"; as a result, "most famous rock-music critics – Robert Christgau, [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]] – are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crawford |first=Anwen |title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 26, 2015 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford points to "[t]he [[record store]], the [[guitar shop]], and now [[social media]]: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess", and adds, "Female expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience] ...and becoming a recognized 'expert' (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Daphne Brooks, in her 2008 article "The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory, and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism", wrote that in order to restructure music criticism, one must "focus on multiple ''counter''narratives" to break away from racial and gender biases as embodied in "contemporary cultural fetishizations of white male performative virtuosity and latent black male innovations".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|55}} Brooks focused on "the ways that rock music criticism has shaped and continues to shape our understandings of racialized music encounters, and what are the alternative stories that we might tell".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|55–56}} Brooks pointed to Christgau's statement that, after the Beatles' arrival in America, "rock criticism embraced a dream or metaphor of perpetual revolution. Worthwhile bands were supposed to change people's lives, preferably for the better. If they failed to do so, that meant they didn't matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christgau |first=Robert |chapter=A History of Rock Criticism |page=142 |title=National Arts Journalism Program: Reporting the Arts II: News Coverage of Arts and Culture in America |editor1-first=András |editor1-last=Szántó |editor2-first=Daniel S. |editor2-last=Levy |editor3-first=Andrew |editor3-last=Tyndall |location=New York |publisher=NAJP at Columbia University |year=2003 }} Quoted in {{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|page=56|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html }} (ellipses and internal quotes omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, according to Brooks, "the history of women who've been sustaining a tradition of writing about rock since the 60's" has been "largely hidden in American culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Evelyn |editor1-last=McDonnell |editor2-first=Ann |editor2-last=Powers |title=Rock She Wrote: Women Write about Rock, Pop, and Rap |location=New York |publisher=Cooper Square Press |year=1999 |page=6 }} Quoted in {{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|page=58|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html }} (ellipses and internal quotes omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks theorized that perceptions of female artists of color might be different if there were more women of color writing about them, and praised [[Ellen Willis]] as a significant feminist critic of rock's classic era.&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58–59}} Willis, who was a columnist for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' from 1968 to 1975, believed society could be enlightened by the "ecstatic experience" of visions expressed through music's rhythm and noise and that such joy would lead people to different ways of sharing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Powers|Powers, Ann]]. [https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.powers.pdf "Spy in the House of Love"]&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks wrote that "the confluence of cultural studies, rock studies, and third wave feminist critical studies makes it possible now more than ever to continue to critique and reinterrogate the form and content of popular music histories".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58}} In Brooks' view, "By bravely breaking open dense equations of gender, class, power, and subcultural music scenes", music journalists, activists and critics such as Ellen Willis have been "able to brilliantly, like no one before [them], challenge the intellectual and political activism and agency" of the entire music industry.&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58}}

'''National Art Hate Week''' ran from 13–20 July 2009 and was a largely imaginary and highly humorous event created by the "non-organisation" [[The British Art Resistance]]. British artists [[Billy Childish]], [[Jimmy Cauty]] and art collective [[Harry Adams (artist)|Harry Adams]] created the week to promote the public questioning the bureaucratic nature of the contemporary art world.

==About==

The artists involved questioned the ideas of permission, curatorship, commercialism and consensus within the art world using satirical and confrontational strategies. The campaign was largely imaginary and through its fictions sought to raise awareness of the wider public's opinions of the art world, as well as the way the art world was promoted and disseminated by those within it. According to The Guardian, "the point [was] to take a closer, more honest look at what's on show in public galleries and be unafraid to loathe it violently".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/13/national-art-hate-week-billy-childish Guardian article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Music, posters, stamps, fake membership cards and graphic works were produced by the group as part of the week, including a limited edition 7" single with art work by [[Jamie Reid]] by a group made up of the artists involved under the name Silent Revolt.

The group failed to hand out propaganda leaflets outside the [[Tate Modern]] gallery in London on 15 July 2010.

==Future incarnations==

The movement has been altered to World Art Hate Day for 2010 and will occur on 21 June 2010.

'''Needle time''' was created in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the [[BBC]] during the course of any 24-hour period.  The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and the [[Independent Local Radio]] stations until 1988.

The result was that the BBC had to use "cover" versions of popular songs by groups such as [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.

The term "needle time" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a [[magnetic cartridge|gramophone needle]].

==Needle time notice==
Unlike American records, British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: "Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited."

===Radio Luxembourg===
Although the record industry in [[UK|Britain]] wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The "208" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the ''[[Decca Records]] Show'' or the ''[[Capitol Records]] Show''. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as [[Infomercials]], because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.

Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.

===The "pirate stations"===
Unlike the [[BBC]] or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore [[pirate radio]] stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of [[territorial waters]], but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as [[Wonderful Radio London]] which introduced [[top 40]] radio to Britain, the ship was actually registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which of course did not recognize "needle time". [[Payola]] operated on several of these stations.

'''''On the Sublime''''' (Περì Ὕψους Perì Hýpsous) is a [[Roman Greece|Roman-era Greek]] work of [[literary criticism]] dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as '''Longinus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|n|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Λογγῖνος}} ''Longĩnos'') or '''Pseudo-Longinus'''. It is regarded as a classic work on [[aesthetics]] and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

The author's identity has been debated for centuries. The oldest surviving manuscript, from the 10th century, indicates the original author was named "Dionysius or Longinus", which was later misread as "Dionysius Longinus". Subsequent interpretations have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1st century) or [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD), though neither is now widely accepted.

==Authorship ==
The author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports "Dionysius or Longinus", an ascription by the  medieval [[copyist]] that was misread as "by Dionysius Longinus." When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named "Dionysius", some have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a writer of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grube"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grube|first=G.M.A|title=On Great Writing (On the Sublime) |publisher=The Liberal Arts Press|location=New York|year=1957|isbn=978-0-87220-080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the [[Roman Empire]], likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the [[codex]] was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.

Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), [[Aelius Theon]] (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of ''On the Sublime''), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of ''On the Sublime'', since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work ''On the Sublime'' in style and thought.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Andrew Russell|title='Longinus' on the Sublime|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Longinus===
Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of [[Plotinus]], and considered "the most distinguished scholar of his day." He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to [[Zenobia]], the queen of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Longinus. (1851, Jul 01). Robert Merry's Museum (1841-1851), 22, 179. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/135926705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longinus. 9 Vol. Detroit: The Gale Group Inc, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is [[Cicero]], who died in 43 BC){{clarify|date=April 2017|Last citations are 1st C AD by Cicero who died 1st C BC?}} and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Petronius]] and [[Quintilian]], who also dealt with the subject, were alive.  Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD were on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

==Contents==
''On the Sublime'' is both a treatise on [[aesthetics]] and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.

The treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. ''On the Sublime'' is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=William Rhys|title=Longinus on the Sublime|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expected examples from [[Homer]] and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'', which is quite unusual for the 1st century:

{{quote|A similar effect was achieved by the lawgiver of the Jews—no mean genius, for he both understood and gave expression to the power of the divinity as it deserved—when he wrote at the very beginning of his laws, and I quote his words: "God said,"—what was it?—"Let there be light, and there was. Let there be earth, and there was."|''On the Sublime'' 9.9}}

Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Vincent B.|title=The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism|publisher=Norton|year=2001|pages=135–154|isbn=978-0-393-97429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have "moral excellence".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world "either by modesty or by prudential motives".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem "bold, lawless, and original".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, "never did a slave become an orator".&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Hugh |author2=Abraham Mills |title=From Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|publisher=T. Zell|year=1866|edition=2nd|pages=950–979}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the [[sublimity|sublime]] writer.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===The sublime===
Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus ultimately promotes an "elevation of style"&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; and an essence of "simplicity".&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Jules|title=Boileau and Longinus|publisher=E. Droz|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote this famous author, "the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions."&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; The concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]] is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself "above the ordinary". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: "great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement".&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;

The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by [[Sappho]], the so-called ''Ode to Jealousy'', defined as a "Sublime ode". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

In the treatise, the author asserts that "the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Sublime'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a ''great soul'' ({{lang|grc|μεγαλοφροσύνης ἀπήχημα}}, ''megalophrosunēs apēchēma''). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources ("aspiration to vigorous concepts" and "strong and enthusiastic passion") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and "dignified and high composition").&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

===Decay of rhetoric===
The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of personal freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If [[Petronius]] pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, [[Tacitus]] was nearer to Longinus in thinking&lt;ref name="Grube"/&gt; that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.

===Misleading translations and lost data===
Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The "sublime" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word [[sublimity|sublime]], argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns "the essentials of a noble and impressive style" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing;&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===Limitations of the writing===
Despite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes "carried away" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic [[Edward Burnaby Greene]] finds Longinus, at times, to be "too refined".&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt; Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is "particularly weak, and misapplied."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of "tediousness" in treating his subjects.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of "practical rules of a teachable kind."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

===Writing style and rhetoric===
Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its "noble tone," "apt precepts," "judicious attitude," and "historical interests".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote ''On the Sublime'' is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains "personal and fresh," unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on "greatness of style" than "technical rules."&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a "master of candor and good-nature".&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Edward Burnaby|title=Critical Essays: 1770|year=1973|isbn=978-0-85417-911-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek]] to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.

===Influences===
In reading ''On the Sublime'', critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a "great hero" to Longinus.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, [[Caecilius of Calacte]].&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

==Historical criticism and use of ''On the Sublime''==
*10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to "Dionysius or Longinus."&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;
*13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus' text.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by [[Francis Robortello]] in [[Basel]], in 1554, and Niccolò da Falgano, in 1560.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; The original work is attributed to "Dionysius Longinus" and most European countries receive translations of the treatise.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;
*17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much [[Baroque]] art and literature, and the rediscovered work of "Longinus" goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too "primitive" to be truly understood by a "too civilized" 17th-century audience.
*18th century - [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith's]] 1739 translation of ''Longinus on the Sublime'' established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus' text reaches its height in popularity.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In England, critics esteem Longinus' principles of composition and balance second only to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' and Immanuel Kant's ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert R. (2009). ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; owe a debt to Longinus' concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]], and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As "Longinus" says, "The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport," a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the "rules" of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;
*19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of ''On the Sublime''.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus' work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of ''On the Sublime'' are published at the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle's ''Poetics'', as "the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Also see [[Neil Hertz]]'s essay on Longinus in his book, ''The End of the Line.'' Hertz is in part responding to [[Thomas Weiskel]]'s book ''The Romantic Sublime'', probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus.&lt;ref name="Hertz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Neil|title=The End of the Line|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-231-05708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Weiskel|author2=Portia Williams Weiskel |title=The Romantic Sublime|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-8018-1770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyzes of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's.&lt;ref name="Quinney2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinney|first=Laura|title=Weiskel's Sublime and the Impasse of Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in "The Hertzian Sublime."&lt;ref name="Culler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|title=The Hertzian sublime|journal=[[MLN]]|volume=120|issue=5|pages=969–985|doi=10.1353/mln.2006.0007|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne Carson]] and [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]] have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and [[Harold Bloom]] and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. [[William Carlos Williams]] also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to [[Kora in Hell]].&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Anne|title=Conjunctions|year=2001|pages=96–104|chapter=Foam: (Essay with Rhapsody) On the Sublime in Longinus and Antonioni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marin|first=Louis|author2=Nicolas Poussin |author3=Catherine Porter |title=The Sublime Poussin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8047-3477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=William J.|author2=Brenda Deen Schildgen |title=The Rhetoric Canon|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1997|chapter=Interest in the Canon: Kant in the Context of Longinus and Adorno|isbn=978-0-8143-2632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German film director [[Werner Herzog]] claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled "On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: "For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12101">The '''expansive force of [[rust]]ing''', which may be called '''oxide jacking''' or '''rust burst''', is a phenomenon that can cause damage to structures made of stone, masonry, concrete or ceramics, and reinforced with metal components.  A definition is "the displacement of building elements due to the expansion of iron and steel products as the metal rusts and becomes iron oxide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Physical process==

According to [[Metallurgy|metallurgist]] Jack Harris, "Oxidation is usually accompanied by a net expansion so that when it occurs in a confined space stresses are generated in the metal component itself or in any surrounding medium such as stone or cement. So much energy is released by oxidation that the stresses generated are of sufficient magnitude to deform or fracture all known materials."&lt;ref name=Harris2&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1915, it was recognized that certain modern metal alloys are more susceptible to excessive [[Oxidation state|oxidation]] when subjected to [[weathering]] than other metals.  At that time, there was a trend to replace [[wrought iron]] fasteners with  [[Carbon steel#Mild and low carbon steel|mild steel]] equivalents, which were less expensive. Unexpectedly, the mild steel fasteners failed in real world use much more quickly than anticipated, leading to a return to use of wrought iron in certain applications where length of service was important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In a 1987 article in ''[[New Scientist]]'', Jack Harris reported that oxide jacking has caused significant damage to many historic structures in the United Kingdom, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[British Museum]] and the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[List of buildings in King's Lynn#St Margaret's Church|St. Margaret's Church]] in [[King's Lynn]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], and [[Blackburn Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news

Harris also wrote that oxide jacking also damaged the ancient [[Horses of Saint Mark]] on the exterior of [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].  Expansive rusting of iron and steel bolts and reinforcements affected the structural integrity of the copper horse sculptures, which were relocated indoors and replaced with replicas.  Poorly-designed early 20th-century renovations also led to oxide jacking damage to the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

In the United States, rusting of iron pegs inserted into holes in the stone entrance stair in order to support [[handrails]] resulted in cracking of the steps at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Oxide jacking damaged the [[terra cotta]] [[cornice]] on the [[Land Title Building]] in [[Philadelphia]], designed in 1897 and expanded in 1902 by pioneer skyscraper architect [[Daniel Burnham]].&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt; The Land Title complex, with its two interconnected towers, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  By 1922, experts on architectural terra cotta were warning that the rusting of embedded iron fasteners could cause decorative building components to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Flooding in 2007 damaged the modernist [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]], designed in 1945 by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and now owned by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].  Among the damage discovered by an architect inspecting the house in 2007 was oxide jacking at the corners of the house's steel framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Damage to reinforced concrete bridges and buildings==

Structures built of [[concrete]] and reinforced with metal [[rebar]] are also subject to damage by oxide jacking. Expansion of corroded rebar causes [[spall]]ing of the concrete.  Structures exposed to a marine environment, or where [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|salt]] is used for [[Snow removal#De-icing and anti-icing|de-icing]] purposes, are especially susceptible to this type of damage.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Research in the 1960s showed that 22% of concrete bridge decks in [[Pennsylvania]] showed signs of spalling due to oxide jacking within four years of construction.  Oxide jacking caused widespread damage to concrete [[council houses]] built in the United Kingdom in the post World War II era.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

According to an expert in the field, the problem resulted in "intensive worldwide research into the causes and repair of reinforcement corrosion, which in turn led to a vast output of research papers, conferences and publications on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Damage to stone countertops==
[[Countertop]] components fabricated out of [[granite]] and other natural stones are sometimes reinforced with metal rods inserted into grooves cut into the underside of the stone, and bonded in place with various resins.  This procedure is called "rodding" by countertop fabricators.  Most commonly, these rods will be placed near [[sink]] cutouts to prevent cracking of the brittle stone countertop during transportation and installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, if a metal rod subject to [[Oxidation state|oxidation]] or other forms of [[corrosion]] is used, and moisture from a [[sink]] or [[Tap (valve)|faucet]] reaches the rod, oxide jacking can crack the countertop directly above the rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Skilled stone repair professionals can disassemble the cracked stone, remove the metal rod, and reassemble the stone using various resins tinted to match the colors of the stone.&lt;ref name=Beware/&gt;  This type of problem can be prevented by using reinforcing rods made of [[stainless steel]] or [[fiberglass]] in the rodding procedure.&lt;ref name=Beware/&gt;

The '''Pipe rolls''', sometimes called the '''Great rolls''',&lt;ref name=Brown54&gt;Brown ''Governance'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Great Rolls of the Pipe''', are a collection of financial records maintained by the English [[Exchequer]], or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.

They were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.

==Composition==
The Pipe rolls are named after the "pipe" shape formed by the rolled up [[parchment]]s on which the records were originally written.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they "piped" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or [[Butt (volume)|pipe]] of wine.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt;

The Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the [[High Sheriff|sheriffs]]' accounts, usually conducted at [[Michaelmas]] by the [[Exchequer]], or English treasury.&lt;ref name=Warren73&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Charter Roll|chancery records]] began in the reign of King [[John of England]], they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered.&lt;ref name=RandS216&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rolls use an [[Accountancy|accounting system]], it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each [[shire]].&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; In their early form, they record all debts owed to the [[The Crown|Crown]], whether from [[Feudalism|feudal]] dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt.&lt;ref name=Warren76&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed.&lt;ref name=Bartlett198&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.&lt;ref name=Lyon262&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30,&lt;ref name=HenryI26/&gt;{{efn|The Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I is "the earliest surviving comprehensive account of royal income in European history" according to [[C. Warren Hollister]]&lt;ref name=HenryI26&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the continuous series begins in 1155–56,&lt;ref name=Coredon219&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; and continued for almost seven hundred years.&lt;ref name=Lyon112&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s.&lt;ref name=Chibnall&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England,&lt;ref name=Memory136&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear.&lt;ref name=Clanchy141&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154–1189) and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in France.&lt;ref name=Mason139&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason150&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start.&lt;ref name=Lyon220&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.&lt;ref name=Frame87&gt;Frame ''Political Development'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dialogus de Scaccario'' or ''[[Dialogue concerning the Exchequer]]'', written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60/&gt; The ''Dialogue'' was written by [[Richard FitzNeal]], the son of [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel of Ely]], who was [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] for both [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] and Henry II of England.&lt;ref name=Warren73/&gt; According to the ''Dialogue'', the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the [[Clerk of the Pipe]] and later the clerk of the pells.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used.&lt;ref name=Clanchy136&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dialogue'' also states that the Pipe rolls, along with [[Domesday Book]] and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.&lt;ref name=Clanchy151&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king.&lt;ref name=Lyon164&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded.&lt;ref name=Enc266&gt;Loyn (ed.) ''Middle Ages'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock.&lt;ref name=Lyon163&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of [[danegeld|geld]], a form of land tax dating from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon times]],&lt;ref name=Warren68&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld.&lt;ref name=Warren146&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Whether geld was abolished in 1161 or later is a matter of debate among historians.&lt;ref name=Warren146/&gt;}} By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the [[Assize Court|Assizes]], or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Warren111&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon23&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scutage]] payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.&lt;ref name=Hollister578&gt;Hollister "Significance of Scutage Rates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict252&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary'' p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is unclear if the recording of scutage in the Pipe rolls was an innovation during Henry II's reign, or if it is just mischance that the lone surviving Pipe roll prior to his reign does not record any scutage payments.&lt;ref name=1066page717&gt;Hollister "1066" ''American Historical Review'' p. 717&lt;/ref&gt; The 1130 Pipe roll does allude to scutage payments, it just does not record any payment made.&lt;ref name=Irony9&gt;Hollister "Irony of English Feudalism" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, [[Ward (law)|wardships]], and ecclesiastical vacancies.&lt;ref name=Mortimer42&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate.&lt;ref name=Bartlett164&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon237&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]],&lt;ref name=Bartlett170&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared [[royal forest]].&lt;ref name=Bartlett239&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159/&gt;

Expenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett133&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons,&lt;ref name=Bartlett171&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt; hunting expenses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett239/&gt; payments to acquire a governmental office,&lt;ref name=Huscroft159&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; payments to mercenaries,&lt;ref name=Bartlett254&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs of bags and casks to transport [[Penny (English coin)|silver pennies]] about the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Bartlett373&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons.&lt;ref name=Heiser20&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 20 footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles.&lt;ref name=Heiser22&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 22 footnote 22&lt;/ref&gt; The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as [[William Longchamp]], who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=Heiser32&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the [[County palatine|palatinate]]s of [[County Durham|Durham]] and [[Cheshire|Chester]].&lt;ref name=Palatinate719&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 719&lt;/ref&gt; The county of [[Cornwall]] also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate.&lt;ref name=Palatinate724&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 724 and footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll.&lt;ref name=Barratt636&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous [[Easter]] to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=John836/&gt;

==History==
[[File:National Archives 2007 02 03.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], where the Pipe rolls are now held]]

Although the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years.&lt;ref name=Chrimes30&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the [[Cotton Library]] at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=Hagger&gt;Hagger "Pipe Roll for 25 Henry I" ''English Historical Review''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The extract is very short, but it shows that the Pipe rolls already recorded exemptions from [[danegeld]]. It is currently [[manuscript Tiberius]] E.vi part i.&lt;ref name=Hagger/&gt;}}  Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign,&lt;ref name=Chrimes30/&gt; but others feel that they were introduced by King [[William I of England|William I]] (reigned 1066–1087).&lt;ref name=Clanchy151/&gt; The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian [[Pauline Stafford]] argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (reigned 1016–1035), [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (reigned 978–1016), and [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar the Peaceable]] (reigned 959–975).&lt;ref name=Stafford149&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to the king's "rolls" in a [[writ]] from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] of ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]], but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later [[cartulary]], and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.&lt;ref name=Clanchy137&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

After the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=RandS257&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 257 footnote 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshi&gt;Yoshitake "Exchequer in the Reign of Stephen" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 950–959&lt;/ref&gt; Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).&lt;ref name=Mortimer66&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 1213 roll does not exist, and the 1215 roll was compiled after John's death and is not contemporary with the actual financial investigation carried out in that year.&lt;ref name=John836&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' p. 836 footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850.&lt;ref name=Huscroft102&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225.&lt;ref name=Mortimer51&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.&lt;ref name=RandS260&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of ''receipt rolls'' and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes73&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate ''[[Estreat]] rolls'', and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes119&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1284 the ''[[Statute of Rhuddlan|Statutes of Rhuddlan]]'' were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes148&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a "d" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.&lt;ref name=EdwardI242&gt;Prestwich ''Edward I'' pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the ''Cowick Ordinance'' of June 1323,&lt;ref name=Chrimes181&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that [[Walter de Stapledon]] held the office of Treasurer.&lt;ref name=Plant59&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the ''Cowick Ordinance'' attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts.&lt;ref name=Buck246&gt;Buck "Reform of the Exchequer" ''English Historical Review'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of [[customs]] receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records.&lt;ref name=Plant208&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473/&gt;

In 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.&lt;ref name=Wolffe2&gt;Wolfee "Management of English Royal Estates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;"[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html Pipe rolls entry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231225308/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html |date=31 December 2009 }}" ''Websters Online Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
They were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about {{convert|14|in|cm|sigfig=2}} wide.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the [[Patent Rolls]] were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;Ramsay "Origin of the Name Pipe Roll" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 329–220&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes they are referred to, in [[Latin]], as ''magnus rotulus pipae''.&lt;ref name=Chrimes50&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, [[Adelard of Bath]], who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.&lt;ref name=Clanchy140&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650.&lt;ref name=NatArch&gt;National Archives ''[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/RdLeaflet.asp?sLeafletID=186&amp;j=1 Research Guides: Early Pipe Rolls, 1130–c.&amp;nbsp;1300]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor.&lt;ref name=Lyon261&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt;

==Influence on other records==
The example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], which are extant from 1208,&lt;ref name=Clanchy92/&gt; and form a continuous series from that date. They started under [[Peter des Roches]], who was also a royal clerk and administrator.&lt;ref name=Bartlett201&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], wife of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], survive for part of the year 1265.&lt;ref name=Clanchy92&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies by historians==

A number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era.&lt;ref name=Mason148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason157/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason162/&gt; A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by [[Nick Barratt]] on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research.&lt;ref name=Barratt&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=John&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–855&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175/&gt; The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking.&lt;ref name=Huscroft88&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges.&lt;ref name=Lyon191&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RandS176&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=John836a&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 836–837&lt;/ref&gt;

The lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include [[Judith Green (historian)|Judith Green]]'s search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites.&lt;ref name=Mason148&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason157&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[C. Warren Hollister]] used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason162&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Lyon330&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s residence in the parish of [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], and in [[Southwark]].&lt;ref name=Hales401&gt;Hales "London Residences of Shakespeare" ''Athenaeum'' pp. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
[[File:Pipe roll 1174 record type.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Extract from the Pipe roll for [[Regnal years of English monarchs|21]] [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1174–5), as published by the Pipe Roll Society in 1897 using [[record type]].]]

The earliest Pipe rolls were published by the [[Record Commission]] in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the [[Public Record Office]] in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58).&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt; The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Green ''Great Roll of the Pipe''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a [[text publication society]]) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of [[Walford Dakin Selby]] and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=NatArch/&gt; It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"&gt;Pipe Roll Society "[http://www.piperollsociety.co.uk/page2.htm Pipe Roll Society Publications]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal Historical Society |publisher=Royal Historical Society |url=http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piperollsociety.pdf |title=Pipe Roll Society Publications |accessdate=11 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref name=Graves474&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'', p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in "[[record type]]", designed to produce a near-[[facsimile]] of the original manuscript, including its [[scribal abbreviation]]s. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.&lt;ref name=Pipe1904&gt;Pipe Roll Society ''Great Roll of the Pipe'' pp. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"/&gt; Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.&lt;ref name=Graves475&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' pp. 475–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Princess Theatre''' is a 1452-seat [[theatre]] in [[Melbourne|Melbourne's]] [[East End Theatre District]], [[Australia]], and is the oldest continuous entertainment site on mainland Australia. It is listed by the [[National Trust of Australia]] and is on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]].

==Astley's Amphitheatre==
Entertainment on the site of today's Princess Theatre dates back to the [[Victorian Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] years of 1854, when entrepreneur Tom Moore constructed a large, barn-like structure called '''Astley's Amphitheatre'''. The venue featured a central ring for equestrian entertainment and a stage at one end for dramatic performances. It was named in honour of the Astley Royal Amphitheatre, also known as [[Astley's Amphitheatre]], near [[Westminster Bridge]], [[London]].

It was soon leased by the prolific actor-manager [[George Coppin]], who had already established himself as an actor at the Queen's Theatre, and would go on to build the Olympic (known as the 'Iron Pot') on the corner of [[Exhibition Street, Melbourne|Exhibition]] and [[Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Lonsdale]] Streets - the future site of the [[Comedy Theatre, Melbourne|Comedy Theatre]], build the Haymarket Theatre and Apollo Music Hall, and lease (and eventually rebuild) the [[Theatre Royal, Melbourne|Theatre Royal]] in [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]].

In 1857, the amphitheatre was extensively renovated and the facade extended, re-opening as the '''Princess Theatre and Opera House'''. 
 
==The New Princess Theatre==
[[File:Princess Theatre Melbourne 1920.jpg|thumb|260px|left|The Princess Theatre 1922]]
By 1885, the theatre came under the control of 'The Triumvirate', a partnership between [[J. C. Williamson]], [[George Musgrove]] and [[Arthur Garner]]. The existing theatre had become rundown, and so the Triumvirate resolved to demolish the existing building. 

The new theatre, designed by architect [[William Pitt (architect)|William Pitt]], interiors designed by George Gordon, and built by Cockram and Comely, was completed in 1886 at a cost of £50,000. The design is in the exuberant [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style, and the theatre forms part of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] streetscape of [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]].

When completed, it featured Australia's first sliding or retractable roof and ceiling. It also featured state-of-the-art electrical stage lighting.

The theatre re-opened, again, on 18 December 1886, with a performance of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Mikado]]''. The marble staircase and foyer was hailed as equal to that of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], the [[Frankfurt]] Stadt and the Grand in [[Bordeaux]].
[[File:Princess Theatre at dusk, Melbourne Australia.jpg|thumb|260px|right|The theatre at dusk, July 2010]]
Williamson left the Triumvirate in 1899 to form his own company, and Musgrove continued operate the theatre until 1910. The Princess came under a rapid succession of different owners until 1915, when [[Ben Fuller (producer)|Ben Fuller]] took control. Fuller then went into partnership with [[Hugh J. Ward]], and in 1922 they engaged the architect [[Henry Eli White]] to extensively renovate the auditorium and foyers, and add the grand copper awning. The '''New Princess Theatre''' reopened on 26 December 1922 with a performance of ''The O'Brien Girl''.

The theatre was purchased from Fuller in 1933 by Efftee Films, the film production company of [[F. W. Thring]], the theatrical and film entrepreneur, who had his initials FT carved over the proscenium arch. He produced several musicals there, and made it the first home of his radio station [[3XY]], founded 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Argus, 4 August 1993, p.7, quoted in ''The Two Frank Thrings'', Peter Fitzpatrick, Monash University Publications 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

When F.W. Thring died, Ben Fuller and Garnett Carroll took over the lease of the Princess in Melbourne and in 1946 they formed another partnership forming Carroll-Fuller Theatres Ltd to purchase the Princess Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/garnetcarroll2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Princess Theatre Stained Glass.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass window on the Princess Theatre exterior.]]
After Sir Ben Fuller's death in 1952, Garnet H. Carroll assumed complete control&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/garnetcarroll2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For the following 12 years, often in association with other entrepreneurs, he presented an eclectic array of opera, ballet, musical comedy and drama, though he was constrained by the lack of an interstate circuit. At the Princess in 1954 he hosted the National Theatre Movement’s gala performance of ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Other notable productions included Ballet Rambert (1947-48), the Old Vic Theatre Company with [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence (Lord) Olivier]] and [[Vivien Leigh]] (1948), the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company (1949), the Vienna Boys' Choir (1954), the Chinese Classical Theatre (1956) and the [[Sadler's Wells Opera Company]] (1960 and 1962). Garnett Carroll often staged elaborate American musicals—among them ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'' (which he himself produced in 1954), ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1960), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1960) and ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1964)—while they were still in their early months on Broadway, and tried unknown singers and actors.&lt;ref&gt;http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/carroll-garnet-hannell-9697&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnett Carroll died on 23 August 1964 and ownership passed to his son, John Carroll. For some years he maintained the pattern set by his father, but in 1969 the family company, Carroll Freeholds Pty Ltd, leased the Princess to the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]]. Over time, the theatre was used less frequently, and the theatre fell into disrepair.

==1989 Reopening and Current Operation==
In 1986, [[David Marriner]] purchased the theatre and commenced a renovation and refurbishment to restore the building to its 1922 state, and improve its technical capacity. The refurbished theatre reopened on 9 December 1989 with the musical ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', followed by ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which established a new record for the longest running show ever staged in Victoria.

The Princess Theatre continues to be owned and operated by the Marriner Group as a venue for major musical theatre productions, including ''Beauty and the Beast'', ''MAMMA MIA!'', ''Jersey Boys'' and ''The Book of Mormon''. 

In 2017, it was announced that the international production ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' would open at the Princess Theatre in early 2019 for an exclusive Australian season&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/hit-play-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-coming-to-melbourne-in-2019-20171024-gz6rib.html&lt;/ref&gt;, as just the third location for the production after London and New York. The theatre underwent a comprehensive internal and external refurbishment in 2018 in preparation for the production&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/harry-potter-show-transforming-melbourne-theatre/news-story/cacd6324fc406b91bbe0077ceca6182c?nk=ad940100a3c32cd364580c6c9f296be9-1532208643&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Ghost sightings==
[[File:Frederick Baker Federici.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Frederick Federici, c. 1888]]
The theatre has experienced several reported [[ghost]] sightings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1184926.htm The theatre ghost] from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 3 March 1888, the baritone Frederick Baker, known under the stage name "[[Frederick Federici]]", was performing the role of Mephistopheles in [[Gounod]]'s opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. This production ended with Mephistopheles sinking dramatically through a trapdoor returning to the fires of hell with his prize, the unfortunate Dr Faustus. As Federici was lowered down through the stage into this basement, he had a heart attack and died almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/F/FedericiFrederick.htm Frederick Federici] at ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 27 August 2001, accessed 4 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  He never came back onstage to take his bows, but when the company was told of what had happened at the end of the opera, they said that he had been onstage and taken the bows with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6107450 "Shocking Occurrence at the Princess's Theatre: Tragic Death of Mr. Federici"], ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)]]'', 5 March 1888, p. 8; and [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP18880329.2.9 "Production of ''Faust'' in Melbourne"], ''[[The Press]]'', Volume XLV, Issue 7025, 29 March 1888, p. 3, [[National Library of New Zealand]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, various people have claimed to see a ghostly figure in evening dress at the theatre.  For many years, a third-row seat in the dress circle was kept vacant in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeme Blundell]], "Marvellous Meelbourne",  ''[[The Age]]'', 27–28 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public bookcase''' is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with [[Library|libraries]]. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.

== Origin ==
Closely allied with the [[BookCrossing]] concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html ''Book Crossing: Offene Bücherschränke in Bonn'', reticon-Report von Martin Ragg, 2. April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103044019/http://www.reticon.de/reporte/book-crossing-offene-buecherschraenke-in-bonn_121--1.html |date=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg &amp; Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as "free open-air libraries" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ ''Die Geschichte der Offenen Bibliotheken'' auf hannover.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819054002/http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/stadtteilkultur/stadtteilkultur/buechersch/geschichte/ |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bonn]] Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea "outdoor books&amp;nbsp;– books in the open" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerstiftung-bonn.de/cms/download/pressetexte/pressemeldung_031115.pdf ''Bürgerstiftung Bonn stellt offenen Bücherschrank auf'', Presseerklärung der Bürgerstiftung Bonn, 15. November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and since this time the concept has been widely replicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/aktuell/pressebox/archiv_volltext.shtml?arch_0806/nachricht3102.html ''Bücherwald&amp;nbsp;– erstes öffentliches Bücherregal im Berliner Straßenraum'', Presseerklärung Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 27. Juni 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=offener Bücherschrank – Wien
 |url = http://www.offener-buecherschrank.at/ |date=2010 |access-date=8 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.öffentliche-bücherregale.ch/ Öffentliche Bücherregale]&lt;/ref&gt; a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 Medienmitteilung der [[Christoph Merian Stiftung]] vom 14. Juni 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108234709/http://www.merianstiftung.ch/presse/detail.cfm?ObjectID=8563D8F6-E24F-56B8-C18F4E451AFDC6D3 |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://3landinfo.blogspot.com/2011/06/dies-das-ein-neuer-bucherschrank.html 3land.info: ''dies &amp; das &amp; ein neuer Bücherschrank'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Open bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-juelicht.de/nachrichten/artikel/10465.php Das JüLichT: ''Jülich ganz „sozial“''] Beitrag 2. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.

== Use and acceptance ==
If a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by "bookcase sponsors" or "godfathers" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.

The acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huk.uni-bonn.de/pdf-dateien/bonner-buecherschrank-artikel''Der Bonner Bücherschrank auf der PoppelsdorferAllee – Ein merkwürdiges Versorgungssystem . Kurzfassung der Ergebnisse des Projekts „Das Nutzungsverhalten am Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank“''] (pdf) Autoren: Prof. Dr. Michael-Burkhard Piorkowsky, Sandra Bichler, Kerstin Hilt, Olga Reger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/publikationen/forsch/forsch-2-april-2009/lernen_und_lehren.pdf''Bonner "Gemeinschaftsmöbel" Studienobjekt: Offener Bücherschrank als soziales System'' (pdf) Autorin: Ulrike Klopp. In: forsch / Bonner Universitäts-Nachrichten 2/2009. (S.27)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 ''Poppelsdorfer Bücherschrank: Die Frauen geben, die Männer nehmen''; Bonner General-Anzeiger, 3. February 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825024252/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10004&amp;detailid=552233 |date=2011-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/index.php?k=loka&amp;itemid=10490&amp;detailid=525497 ''Ein Schrank für ausgesetzte Bücher/Bürgerstiftung Bonn eröffnet in den kommenden Tagen zwei weitere Freiluft-Bibliotheken'', Bonner General-Anzeiger, 20.

== Variants ==
In Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called "book exchange", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.

The Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.

A cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.

== Catalogs and mapping ==

In the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the [[Little Free Library]] network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the [[Open Book Case]] project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project [[OpenStreetMap]] has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8079">{{short description|poetic persona in Shakespeare's sonnets}}
The '''Rival Poet''' is one of several characters, either fictional or real persons, featured in [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]]. The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the [[Shakespeare's sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] group in [[Sonnet 78|sonnets 78]]–[[Sonnet 86|86]]. Several theories about these characters, the Rival Poet included, have been expounded, and scholarly debate continues to put forward both conflicting and compelling arguments. In the context of these theories, the speaker of the poem sees the Rival Poet as a competitor for fame, wealth and patronage.

==Possible candidates==
Among others, [[George Chapman]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Barnabe Barnes]], [[Gervase Markham]],&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 52, 127, 141-2, 303, 463.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Barnfield]]&lt;ref&gt;Leo Daugherty, ''William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the Sixth Earl of Derby'', Cambria Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  have been proposed as identities for the Rival Poet.

=== George Chapman ===

[[George Chapman|Chapman]] was a prominent poet and translator of [[Homer]]. Scholars speculate that Shakespeare was familiar with his work, having read part of his translation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' for his own ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'',{{sfn|Bevington|1998|p=21}} a dramatic reworking of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] epic poem. Chapman wrote ''Ovid's Banquet Of Sense'', a metaphysical poem seen as a response to the erotic ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]],'' which incidentally features Shakespeare's most quoted poet, [[Ovid]]. In ''Shakespeare and the Rival Poet'', Acheson conjectures that Chapman's erotic poems were written with a view to gaining Southampton's patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Acheson|1903|pp=14–15, 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral tone of ''Ovid's Banquet of Sense'' eschews the amatory tone of Shakespeare's, and seeks to instill spiritual seriousness in a work that takes the five senses as its [[Conceit]]s. Chapman's patrons also moved in the same circles as Shakespeare's; thus Shakespeare may have felt insecure about the stability of his own income versus a talented rival. Chapman was both then and now regarded as being particularly erudite, whereas, as [[Ben Jonson]] writes, Shakespeare had "small Latine and lesse Greeke".&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, W. T.  [http://franklin.press.illinois.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'']. 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christopher Marlowe ===

[[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] was more highly regarded as a dramatist than a poet, his chief poetical work, ''[[Hero and Leander]],'' remaining incomplete at the time of his death (it was subsequently completed by Chapman). Due to Marlowe's relatively small dramatic output as compared with Shakespeare, it's unlikely that he would have been the subject of Shakespeare's sonnets, i.e. considered a serious rival. By the time Shakespeare began his works Marlowe was a well-established playwright but the two had a very important artistic relationship. In his book ''The Genius of Shakespeare'', Jonathan Bate notes "the two-way traffic between Marlowe and Shakespeare until the latter’s death".&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Jonathan. ''The Genius of Shakespeare.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare strove to outdo Marlowe and through their artistic competition they would push one another to higher achievements in dramatic literature.  This competition could have also motivated the Rival Poet sonnets.&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Jonathan. ''The Genius of Shakespeare.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple poets ===

It has also been suggested that the Rival Poet is an amalgam of several of Shakespeare’s contemporaries instead of a single person. This is indicated by the fluctuation between singular and plural addresses of the rival(s) in the sonnet sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, MacD. P.  [http://res.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/224/224 "Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare’s Rival Poet Sonnets".] ''Review of English Studies.'' 56.224 (2005): 224–246. 16 Nov 2007: 225&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Sonnet 78]] the Speaker refers to other poets who have gained inspiration from the Fair Youth but in [[Sonnet 79|79]] the Speaker is only concerned with one "he", a potentially "worthier pen". Sonnet 80 continues the singular reference but by 82 the Speaker reverts to the plural "writers".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 225&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sonnet 83|83]] he refers to "both your poets" indicating that the Speaker is one poet and the Rival is the other. According to MacD. P. Jackson, [[Sonnet 86]] is "the most powerful of the group [and] the most detailed in its characterization of one specific Rival Poet".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 226&lt;/ref&gt; While arguably the most powerful of this sonnet grouping, one cannot neglect the oscillation between singular and plural seen throughout the group as a whole. This discrepancy makes it difficult to isolate one specific poet to claim the title of Rival.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p=244}}

The Speaker's attitude towards the Rival is also difficult to pinpoint. Some critics, such as R. Gittings, believe that much of the Poet’s comments on his rival should be read as ironic or satiric.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 180&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson maintains that the Poet's feelings toward the Rival shift between varying degrees of admiration and criticism. This also indicates a multitude of rivals.  As the Poet's confidence ebbs and flows along with his impression of his rival(s), the identity of the rival(s) also fluctuates.{{sfn|Jackson|2005|p=226}}

A final defense for the Multiple Rivals Theory relies on a dating of the Rival Poet sonnets between 1598–1600.  While this frame of reference has support, so do other possible dates and there will always be controversy regarding dating of individual sonnets.  However, if it is assumed that this grouping was published between 1598 and 1600, a publication by [[Francis Meres]] comes into play.  In 1598, Meres published ''[[Palladis Tamia|Palladis Tamia; Wits Treasury]]'' with a chapter titled "A Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets" in which he documents the critical esteem of the poets of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Shakespeare received high praise for his dramatic work but Marlowe and Chapman were deemed England's "two excellent poets".&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Jackson 234&lt;/ref&gt;  This, according to Jackson, "must surely have helped provoke the Rival Poet series".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 234&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosario Lufrano''' ([[Lanús]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], 8 January 1962) is an Argentinian journalist, broadcaster and reporter. In 2016, she had a regular programme on [[Radio Rivadavia]].

== Career ==
She graduated from the [[Lomas de Zamora University|Lomas de Zamora National University]] and began to work in 1983 on the popular Radio Belgrano, as an announcer and reporter. By 1988, she was presenting the main bulletin of the defunct cable network Cablevisión Noticias (CVN). In 1990, under a new management, the revamped channel 11 ([[Telefe]]) hired her to front the 7:00pm nightly news hour, alongside Franco Salomone, lasting until December 30, 1998, when she and hundreds of co-workers were sacked for a developing financial crisis in the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1999/01/02/e-04803d.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1991 and 1993, she hosted a weekly investigative program for the same network, focused on current affairs. By the mid-1990s, added a job at [[Radio Continental]], where she hosted a Saturday morning chat show.
Lufrano appeared on the air again in 2000, providing commentaries and reading the news in a midday program that was broadcast on the [[América TV|América]] channel. In 2003, she began a long-time career as a newscaster for the [[TV Pública|public network]], and since 2006 shared the duties of manager of programming,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/8-2634-2006-05-25.html&lt;/ref&gt; until 2008, when she resigned in the middle of a political crisis due to the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|agricultural strike]]. After leaving the public eye, Rosario continued working as a manager of an online channel, focused on travelling across the globe, and since 2013, has a daily morning program on Radio Rivadavia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arinfo.com.ar/notix/noticia/09015_rosario-lufrano-cuando-llegu-a-canal-7-era-un-lugar-saqueado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
She is a daughter of [[Italy|Italian]] immigrants, who arrived to Argentina in extreme state of poverty, after [[World War II]]. Her father is a [[tailor]] and her mother is a [[dressmaker]], both still working. She has two children and is divorced from her first husband.

'''Ruth Milles''' (19{{nbsp}}April 1873{{snd}}11{{nbsp}}February 1941) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] sculptor and writer. She is mainly known for her [[Bronze sculpture|figurines]] and [[relief]]s.

== Early life and education ==
Milles was born Ruth Anna Maria Anderson on Örby Manor in [[Vallentuna]] near [[Stockholm]], Sweden. She was the daughter of Chief Verifier of the [[brännvin]] manufacturing in Sweden, Emil Anderson (1843–1910), called "Mille". She had two siblings when her mother died in childbirth and gained three half siblings after her father remarried. Her brother was the sculptor [[Carl Milles]] (1875–1955) and her half brother Evert Milles (1885–1960) was an [[architect]].&lt;ref name=slakt&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=G-m |first=H|title =Milles, släkt | encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1985–1987

She studied at the ''Tekniska Skolan'' (the Technical School), predecessor to the [[Konstfack|Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design]] in Stockholm in 1892–93, after which she went on to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] in 1894–98, where she was considered talented enough to skip a year. She would also visit the [[Theosophical Society]] which became influential for her future works.&lt;ref name=garden&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Milles|url=http://www.millesgarden.se/ruth-milles-596.aspx|website=www.millesgarden.se|publisher=[[Millesgården]]|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In the autumn of 1898, Milles left for [[Paris]], approximately a year after her brother Carl had moved there. She studied at the [[Académie Colarossi]] and [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and used Paris as base for journeys through France and Germany.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; Milles and her brother spent much time together in Paris where they collaborated, artistically and economically, in a joint company they started.&lt;ref name=idun&gt;{{cite web|last=E-ER|editor1-last=Nordling|editor1-first=Johan|title=Hos Ruth Milles|url=http://www.ub.gu.se/fasta/laban/erez/kvinnohistoriska/tidskrifter/idun/1908/pdf/1908_26.pdf|website=www.ub.gu.se|publisher=Idun|date=25 June 1908|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the company sold small [[bronze]] [[Bronze sculpture|figurines]], depicting children and characters from [[fairy tale]]s made by her. She spent the summers in the fishing village Briac in [[Brittany|Bretagne]] where she would draw inspiration from the local fishers' life for her sculptures. Her sculptures were made in an early [[Impressionism|Impressionistic]] style.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; While in France, she and her brother changed their surname to Milles after their father's nickname.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; In 1902, she received an honorary award at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; The next year she fell ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Milles 1873–1941|url=http://www.signaturer.se/Sverige/RuthMilles.htm|website=www.signaturer.se|publisher=signaturer.se|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She travelled back to Sweden and settled down in Islinge on [[Lidingö]],&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt; where she set up a [[studio]] which she sometimes shared with the wife of her brother Carl, Olga Milles.

Milles got many commissions from cultural institutions in Stockholm, among them the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] for [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] and [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of the singer [[Jenny Lind]] and the actor Georg Dahlqvist.&lt;ref name=garden /&gt; In 1904–16, she participated in a number of international exhibitions like in [[St. Louis]] (1905) and [[Buenos Aires]] (1910), where she received silver medals for her work,&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; [[Rome]] (1911), the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition|world's fair]] in [[San Francisco]] (1915) and the Swedish art exhibition in [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]], Denmark (1916). However, her failing health forced her to abandon her sculpturing and she turned first to painting&lt;ref name=idun /&gt; and later to writing instead. She also made illustrations for books, her own and those of other writers.&lt;ref name=slakt /&gt;

In 1932, she moved to Rome. Her health deteriorated, among other things she contracted gangrene and had one of her legs amputated. Milles died in Rome in 1941 and was buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome]].&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;

Milles is represented in the [[Nationalmuseum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RUTH Anna Maria MILLES|url=http://www.lexikonettamanda.se/show.php?aid=19398|website=www.lexikonettamanda.se|publisher=Konstnärslexikonett Amanda|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thielska Galleriet]]. There is also a bust and a painting by her in the home (''Strand'' by lake [[Vättern]]) of [[Ellen Key]].&lt;ref name=garden /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">'''Ski-U-Mah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|aɪ|juː|ˈ|m|ɑː}} {{respell|SKY|yoo|MAH}}) is a slogan used at the [[University of Minnesota]] since 1884.

U of M Rugby captain John Adams had heard [[Sioux]] boys yell "ski-yoo!" when they won canoe races on [[Lake Pepin]]. He incorrectly interpreted that phrase as the Sioux word for victory, or exultation and suggested it as a cheer for the University rugby team. A co-captain added the "mah" to make it rhyme with "rah" and created "Ski-U-Mah!"  The slogan has been used to cheer on the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] athletics teams, and was written into the lyrics of University songs including the "[[Minnesota Rouser]]", "[[Go Gopher Victory]]", "Minnesota Fight" and "[[Minnesota March]]".

[[Dakota language|Dakota]]–[[Lakota language|Lakota]] specialists state that the word "Ski-U" or "Ski-yoo" or "Ski-oo" are not Sioux victory cries or the Sioux word for winning. What Adams heard on Lake Pepin, "sky-yoo," may have just been an interjection, similar to "woo hoo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croman|first=John|title=I’ve Been Wondering: Ski-U-Mah?|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/investigative/extras/extra_article.aspx?storyid=122027|publisher=KARE 11 News|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Dakota-Lakota words or phrases that have been suggested for what Adams heard include:

* "Schkee ooh poh!" or "Scheee ooh!" 
* Scheeh/scheen-shay, which means "Try Hard"
* Oh-hee-yah, which means "To win"
* Oh-hee-un-yum, oh-hee-oohn-yum, which means "We won"

The slogan has had other uses at the University through the years.  In the mid-20th century, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)]]'' was a U of M humor magazine.  It is currently used on the football team's helmets and jerseys,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-watch.com/2012/01/28/minnesota-gopher-jersey-collector-shawn-kennedy0128/&lt;/ref&gt; as the name  of a meeting room at the McNamara Alumni Center, a campus tailgate lot/parking lot near [[TCF Bank Stadium]], and as the title of a yearbook-style publication published by the [[Minnesota Daily]].

The '''Slovenian Youth Theatre''' or '''Mladinsko Theatre''' ({{lang-sl|Slovensko mladinsko gledališče}}) was founded in [[Ljubljana]] in 1955 as the first professional theater for children and youth in [[Slovenia]]. It is situated in the Baraga [[Seminary]], which was built by architect [[Jože Plečnik]] in the [[Center, Ljubljana|center of Ljubljana]]. In the 1980s, it became a center of theatrical research and politically-engaged theater. It is known for a wide range of innovative [[poetics]] of different directors and an [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] energy, a [[Peter Brook]]-like approach to acting with a laboratory for theatre research for actors, directors, choreographers and musicians to research, develop, and create.

== History ==

===Introduction===

Mladinsko Theatre was founded in 1955 by Balbina Baranovič, the directress who also founded the first [[experimental theatre]] company in [[Slovenia]]. Throughout its history, the theatre has collaborated with the theatre reformers that shaped the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century.

The Mladinsko Theatre's development progressed with contemporary theatre practices of the reformers of the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century, including directors [[Žarko Petan]], Mile Korun, [[Dušan Jovanović (theatre director)|Dušan Jovanović]], Ljubiša Ristić, Meta Hočevar, Paolo Magelli, Janez Pipan, Vito Taufer, [[Tomaž Pandur]], Eduard Miler, [[Matjaž Pograjc]], [[Martin Kušej]], [[Dragan Živadinov]], Emil Hrvatin, [[Tomi Janežič]], Matjaž Berger, Jan Decorte, [[Diego de Brea]], Jernej Lorenci, [[Ivica Buljan]], Silvan Omerzu, Oliver Frljić, Borut Šeparović and [[Damjan Kozole]].

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, Slovenian playwright [[Dominik Smole]] became managing director of the theatre and ensured that the Mladinsko presented artistically demanding youth performances. The Mladinsko was on the theatre margin, which allowed many different creative energies to congregate there. The political powers deemed the theatre unimportant, which enabled organizational and programmatic changes to be made. The 1970s also marked a time of crisis at the Drama Ljubljana (the [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana]]), where circumstances prevented the development of the kind of contemporary theatre which Mladinsko started developing with the arrival of Dušan Jovanović.

===1980s===

During the next decade – when Petar Jović became the managing director and Dušan Jovanović the artistic director (with the help of the [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] Marko Slodnjak), followed by [[Ivo Svetina]] – was marked by the projects by Ljubiša Ristić, especially ''Missa in a minor'', which began the series of projects that marked the Mladinsko as the nexus of the political and at experimental theatre. Around the mid-1980s, poetics that were not bound to "actual political" began to appear, first with the projects by Vito Taufer, then the performances by Janez Pipan and ''Scheherezade'' by [[Ivo Svetina]], directed by Tomaž Pandur, and [[Dragan Živadinov]]'s projects.  This line has continued from the 1990s through the present in the form of diversity and auto-poetics in performances such as those by Eduard Miler, [[Matjaž Pograjc]], Emil Hrvatin]], [[Tomi Janežič]], Matjaž Berger, [[Diego de Brea]] and a wide range of contemporary theatre artists.
===1990s===
Under the artistic leadership of Eduard Miler, Tomaž Toporišič, Matjaž Berger, and, in the last few seasons of the current director of the theatre Uršula Cetinski, Mladinsko became a setting for the wealth of diversity, while remaining the Slovenian centre of theatre research. The strong accents of Martin Kušej (''Scandal after Cankar''), Meta Hočevar (''A Family Album''), [[Matjaž Pograjc]] (''Roberto Zucco, Fragile!''), Emil Hrvatin (''Male Fantasies''), Eduard Miler (''Susn, The Mission''), Tomi Janežič (''Oedipus Rex, Utva''), Matjaž Berger (''Galileo Galilei, Interpretacija sanj''), Diego de Brea (''The Damned, Crime and Punishment''), Ivica Buljan (''Young Flesh''), Jernej Lorenci (''Gilgamesh''), [[Vinko Möderndorfer]] (''Blasted''), Barbara Novakovič, Vlado Repnik, Ivan Peternelj, Jan Decorte, Sebastijan Horvat, Damjan Kozole, Silvan Omerzu, and many others, have, together with Taufer's research of an extremely wide territory of theatre function (such as the performances ''Silence Silence Silence'', ''Pippi'', and ''Midsummer Night's Dream'') and the projects of Dragan Živadinov resulted in the aesthetically most diverse period in the history of the theatre that the critical machinery in Slovenia – due to the limited tools with which it was operating, and ideological altercations of the political left, connected to the so-called independent or "dependent" production – didn't know to contextualize or couldn't analyse.

== Activities ==

Together with several representatives of the so-called independent scene, the Mladinsko Theatre of the last two-and-a-half decades has been a place of creation which has brought strong impulses into the more institutional Slovenian theatre. The impulses moved in the direction of [[Richard Kostelanetz]]'s "theatre of combined ways of expression for the post-literary age"{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. On the one hand, it emphasises "meta-theatricality" as defined by [[Bonnie Marranca]], (for instance, the focusing upon the third [[paradigm]] of the spectator and their perception and, on the other hand, the double coding of theatre springing from the tactics of the historical neo-[[avant-garde]]s, post-avant-gardes and political performances of the second half of the 20th century.

The tactics of epicization, formalist and energy theatre, the stage of the landscape, of [[parataxis]], simultaneity, play with the density of signs, musicalization, visual dramaturgy, intrusions of the real, the scenic essay, [[Heterogeneity#Heterogeneity|heterogeneity]], [[Metonymy|metonymic]] space, framing, scenic montage, aesthetics of speed, aesthetics vs. the real body, intermediality – to use the terminology used by Hans-Thies Lehmann for the analysis of the postdramatic – all this has taken the Mladinsko Theatre into the heterogeneous spheres of contemporary performing arts at the meeting points of various artistic mediums that have constantly enriched and added to the theatrical field.

The placement of these phenomena into the international and festival theatre space was extremely important. Today, when audience members are ensconced in the post post-socialist era of the so-called transition period in Slovenia, the historic distance enables them to claim that without this support from abroad, Mladinsko as an example of contemporary theatre wouldn't have survived. The positive response in Europe and the Americas was critical for the continuation of the research. Thus, the duality occurred: Mladinsko was relatively marginalized in Slovenia, while abroad it represented Slovenian art, culture and even the country.

==Awards==
In 1969, the city of Ljubljana gave the theatre the Župančič Award for special achievements as an “exceptional example of communal creative will for quality conveying theatre art to wider circles”.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In 2008, the [[European Commission]] awarded the theatre the honorary title of European Cultural Ambassador, on the grounds of its international activity and the quality of its performances.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''StoryCorps''' is an American [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to record, preserve, and share the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer [[David Isay]]. Its headquarters are located in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

StoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the [[United States]] were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was [[oral history|oral historian]] [[Studs Terkel]], who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in [[Grand Central Terminal]]. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.

==Interviews==
StoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary [[Compact Disc|CD]] of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on [[NPR]]’s ''[[Morning Edition]]''. These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.

==Recording methods==
There are several ways by which participants can record their stories.

===StoryBooth===
Participants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in [[New York City]]’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to [[Lower Manhattan]]’s [[Foley Square]] in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at [[Atlanta]]’s public radio station [[WABE]] in October 2009.

===MobileBooth===
[[File:StoryCorps booth vehicle.jpg|thumb|A StoryCorps MobileBooth parked at the Library of Congress]]
In May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted [[Airstream]] trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.

===Services===
StoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.

=== StoryCorps App ===
With the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.

==Initiatives==
StoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.&lt;ref&gt;StoryCorps Initiatives, http://storycorps.org/initiatives/, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Military Voices Initiative''' records, shares, and preserves the stories of post-9/11 veterans, active-duty service members, and their families. 
* The '''Memory Loss Initiative''' encourages individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of [[memory loss]] to share their stories.
* The '''Historias Initiative''' collects the stories of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] throughout the United States and [[Puerto Rico]].
* The '''[[Griot]] Initiative''' preserves the voices and experiences of [[African Americans]].  These stories will be archived at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].
* The '''September 11 Initiative''' honors and remembers the stories of survivors, rescue workers, and others most personally affected by the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].
* '''OutLoud''' seeks to record and preserve a diverse collection of LGBTQ stories across America.
* The '''Justice Project''' amplifies and preserves the stories of those whose lives have been impacted by mass incarceration and the criminal justice system.

== Community programs ==
StoryCorps currently has four community programs.
* Through the '''MobileBooth Tour''', StoryCorps visits cities and towns across the country to record the stories of the people who live there. The MobileBooth Tour partners with local public radio stations, cultural institutions and community-based organizations to get the word out and invite participants to bring someone to the StoryCorps MobileBooth.
* '''StoryCorps Legacy''' provides opportunities for people with serious illness, and their relatives, to record and share their life stories. StoryCorps Legacy partners with organizations across the country, including hospitals and clinics, pediatric centers, hospice and palliative care departments, and disease specific organizations.
* '''StoryCorpsU (SCU)''' is a year-long, cross-disciplinary (language arts, media, history), youth development program designed for 9th and 10th graders to help students develop self and social awareness, academic skills, and strengthened school relationships. SCU uses StoryCorps’ tested interviewing techniques, combined with outstanding radio broadcasts and animated shorts, to support high school students in the development of identity and in drawing connections between their unique strengths and the college application process. For the 2016-2017 school year, SCU will be implemented in nine schools, more than 30 classrooms, and seven cities. The program was most recently evaluated in 2015 by Dr. Ronald Ferguson, a leading national researcher on racial and economic achievement gaps in education.
* The '''StoryCorps Archive''' is the largest born-digital collection of human voices. The collection is housed and can be accessed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

== Criticism ==
StoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,”&lt;ref&gt;“StoryCorps, An Oral History of America: Sound Booths Will Record Ordinary People’s Life Stories,” National Public Radio, October 23, 2003, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId1⁄41475619, accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the "highly sculpted techniques of the interviews"&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;, such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit "an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory." &lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs.&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 258. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”&lt;ref&gt; Freund, Alexander. “Under Storytelling’s Spell? Oral History in a Neoliberal Age.” Oral History Review, vol. 42, no. 1, Winter/Spring  ///Winter/Spring2015 2015, pp. 13. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1093/ohr/ohv002.&lt;/ref&gt;

StoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on [[Morning Edition]]. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Edition. “A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/2016/12/09/504828481/a-lifelong-secret-can-you-help-this-ailing-94-year-old-man-make-amends. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; The title NPR gave the story - "A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?" - as well as [[Steve Inskeep]]’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sánchez de Ortigosa House is located at 60 St. George Street, [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It is a reconstruction of a home dating from the [[History of Florida|First Spanish Period (1565-1763)]] that stood on this site. 

== History ==
The Sánchez de Ortigosa House shows up on city maps in 1763 and 1765 as being a stone building belonging to José Sánchez de Ortigosa. Sánchez de Ortigosa was from Ronda, Spain. He married a local woman, Juana Theodora Pérez, with whom he had nine children. He was a [[privateer]].

By 1788, during Florida's [[History of Florida|British Period (1763-1783)]], the stone house had been razed and a wooden house stood in its place.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book: Including Descriptions of the Buildings, Crafts, and a Brief History of the Restoration of the Nation's Oldest City|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=32-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration Commission Director Earle Newton stated that First Spanish Period homes did not last because the English tended to tear them down for use of the building materials and replace them with wooden structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/USACH00501/00001?search=sanchez+=ortigosa|title=Two Restoration Project Reconstructed Structures In Final Stages Of Building|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
The St. Augustine Historic Restoration and Preservation Commission (later the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]) completed a reconstruction of the Sánchez de Ortigosa house in 1966. It was built as a one-story pink house on the corners of St. George Street and Cuna Street. The roof was built of tile and cement.

Additional funding for this reconstruction was donated by [[Edward Ball (businessman)|Edward Ball]] of Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== San Agustín Antiguo ==
During the time of the living history museum San Agustín Antiguo in St. Augustine, the Sánchez de Ortigosa house served as a First Spanish Period carpenter's shop. Antiques were repaired there and custom pieces were made for exhibition houses and for public sale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Present Day ==
Today this site is retail space, operated by the Spanish Dutch Convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spanishdutchconvoy.com/about-us/|title=About Us|date=2015-02-12|work=Spanish Dutch Convoy|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed on behalf of the state by [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc]].

== Summary ==
The story starts with little [[monarch|King]] Wistful, the eight-year-old king of the Cheerful Isles, or as he renamed them, the Monotonous Isles. The King slips through the gates to go look for something interesting because he finds that his kingdom is the “dullest and ugliest and the most wearisome place in the world.”

The King, now outside, surveys his kingdom, commenting on how stupid his kingdom is, and feeling sorry for himself, then he hears a voice.  The voice is from a little girl singing.  The little girl is singing for the little King Wistful to come and play.

::Sing-song! Don't be long!
::Wistful, Wistful, come and play!
::Sing-song! It's very wrong
::To stay and stay and stay away!
::The world is much too nice a place
::To make you pull so long a face;
::It's full of people being kind,
::And full of flowers for you to find;
::There's heaps of folks for you to tease
::And all the naughtiness you please;
::To sulk is surely waste of time
::When all those trees are yours to climb!
::Ting-a-ring! Make haste, King!
::I've something really nice to say;
::Ting-a-ring! A proper King
::Would not make me sing all day!

When the girl comes into sight the King notices that she has the “brightest brown eyes” that he had ever seen. The little girl introduces herself as Eyebright and when asked where she learned her song, she replies that the [[Magic (paranormal)|magician]] taught her and that she needed to sing it every day until the King came.

The two talk for a time and the King tells Eyebright about how stupid his kingdom is while Eyebright tries to change his mind about it.  Eyebright does not manage to change the little King's mind but does get him to follow her to go to see the Magician. The two children travel to the middle island, through woods and into a boat to get to the Magician’s cave.

The two enter the cave and Eyebright tells the Magician that she brought the King and that he must disenchant the King so that he can see what a wonderful kingdom he has. After shaking hands with the King the Magician invites them to sit with him for tea. The Magician performs some magic for a table and chairs to appear.  The King and Eyebright set the table and the three proceed to have a delightful tea-party.

After tea the children tell the Magician just why they came in the first place.  The Magician tells them that the reason that the King cannot see his kingdom for the wonderful place that it is, was because the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a baby.  The Magician explains why the wymps would do such a thing and tells them where they have to go to try to get the wymps to reverse what they did, Wympland, and how they were to get there.  The Magician then sends the children to Wympland on a flash of lightning.

The King and Eyebright, now in Wympland, look around and find a wymp to talk to.  They to talk with the wymp and the King tells him that the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a child.  The wymp reveals to them that there is only one thing to do; they must exchange eyes, only thing to be done.  The Wymp tells them how to exchange eyes and without hesitation Eyebright switches their eyes.  The King is unhappy about this as he did not want Eyebright to have to see things through his eyes but at this point he has little choice.

The King and Eyebright suddenly appear back home, looking over the kingdom.  The King can now see just how wonderful and beautiful his kingdom is.  Eyebright thought she could only see five round islands in a row, but the King cannot possibly be mistaken so she agrees that it is a beautiful kingdom.  Eyebright then runs off and the King returns home to bed.

The final lines tell of how there is now a Queen as well as a King of the Monotonous Isles.  This Queen always agrees with the King when he tells of how beautiful the kingdom is.  While this may be remarkable it needs to be remembered that “the Queen sees everything with the King's eyes.”&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Evelyn. “The Magician’s Tea-Party.” The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Other Side of the Sun.

== Author ==

The fairy tale “The Magician’s Tea-Party” was written by Evelyn Sharp as part of a set of fairy tales in her book ''The Other Side of the Sun''.
Evelyn Jane Sharp (1869-1955) was a children’s writer in England.  Evelyn was the ninth of eleven children, and the youngest of four girls.  Her sisters taught her until she was twelve, then she attended a school in London for three years, before attending the College de France in Paris

Evelyn Sharp wrote over twenty books and hundreds of short stories for children.  Her children’s stories are known for treating children as intelligent and creative rather than patronizing and moralistic.  Evelyn also wrote for several newspapers, she was the Manchester Guardians’ first regular women's page writer, she wrote for the Daily Herald for eight years, and wrote for the Daily Chronicle in the 1930s. She became a women’s suffragist in 1906, lecturing and writing towards the goal of women’s suffrage.

Evelyn continued in this manner, writing and various excursions. She then, after claiming she would be expected to settle down into spinsterhood in her autobiography, married her husband, Henry, on January 18, 1933. At this time Evelyn was a sixty-year-old woman and Henry was seventy-five.  The two had eight years together when Henry died in 1941.  Evelyn lived out her remaining years in London, where she died in a nursing home June 17, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V.. “Sharp , Evelyn Jane (1869–1955).” Angela V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Verb displacement''' as it relates to prose, is a technique used to impart a lyrical or poetic feel to a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Well-Spoken Thesaurus]]", Tom Heehler, [[Sourcebooks]] 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This technique finds particular expression in [[minimalist]] literature. 

Specifically, verb displacement involves only those verbs that can be displaced by the word "is" or its past tense "was." For instance, in this excerpt from the novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', instead of writing "He died in April," [[Ernest Hemingway]] displaces the verb "died" with "is," and thereby creates a more lyrical effect:

{{quotation|"Kashkin," Robert Jordan said. "That would be Kashkin."{{br}}
{{br}}
"Yes," said Pablo. "It was a very rare name. Something like that. What became of him?"{{br}}
{{br}}
''"He is dead since April."''|''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', [[Ernest Hemingway]]}}

== Origins ==
The term as it relates to prose in literature (as opposed to poetry or linguistics&lt;ref&gt;"New Horizons in the Study of Language", Noam Chomsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Language and Mind", Noam Chomsky&lt;/ref&gt;) was first introduced in 2011 by [[Tom Heehler]], author of ''[[The Well-Spoken Thesaurus]]'', to describe one of the ways in which minimalist writers are able—consciously or otherwise—to enhance simple language without increasing complexity.

== Belarus ==
[[File:2009. Stamp of Belarus 34-2009-11-02-bl.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamp]] from [[Belarus]] inspired by Vytynanky.]] 
Vycinanka is also known as vyrazanka or vystryhanka, Viačaslaŭ Dubinka was key in reviving in Belarus the folk art of paper cutting images with scissors.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"&gt;http://kurjer.info/2010/05/12/vyachasla%D1%9E-dubinka-%E2%80%9Cvycinanka-lichylasya-durykami-a-ne-mastactvam%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/2124897.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==
[[Image:Wystroj-chaty-kurpie.JPG|thumb|Wycinanki from [[Kurpie]]]]

Polish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskiinternet.com/english/info/artpaper.html "Polish folk art -  Paper Cutout / Wycinanki," PolskiInternet, retrieved 2010-09-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wycinanki originated with [[shepherd]]s cutting designs out of [[tree bark]] and leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheldonbrown.org/joyce/wycinanki.html Wycinanky, Madelyn Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.

Wycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the [[Kurpie]] region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the [[Łowicz]] region are multicolored.  Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as ''nalepianki'' in which multiple layers are glued together.

Subject matter includes [[peacock]]s, [[rooster]]s, and other birds; circular or star-shaped [[medallion]]s (''gwiazdy''); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki.  Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.

The [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Poland|Polish Pavilion]] at the [[2010 World Expo]] in [[Shanghai]] is based on a wycinanki design.

== Ukraine ==
Historical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth [[century]], but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian [[countryside]].&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

The word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of [[people]], [[animals]] and [[plants]]. [[Ethnographer]]s and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional [[pottery]], [[embroidery]], [[carpet|rugs]] and other items.&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

Vytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “[[tree of life|trees of life]].”&lt;ref name=index2.php&gt;[http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20084/62 Vytynanka — an art of decorative paper cutting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wearable art''', also known as ''Artwear'' or "art to wear", refers to individually designed pieces of (usually) handmade clothing or [[jewellery]] created as fine or expressive art. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term ''wearable art'' implies that the work is intended to be accepted as a serious and unique artistic creation or statement. Pieces may be sold and/or exhibited. The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Marbeth Schon's book on modernist jewellery (see the section on jewellery below) refers to a "wearable art movement" spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. A 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of a book on knitting refers to "the 60s Art to Wear movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Green |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DD143CF937A35756C0A9659C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22art%20to%20wear%20movement%22&amp;st=cse |title=BOOKS OF STYLE; Why Knit? The Answers |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-05-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beo Beyond Costume design.jpg|thumb|220px|Wearable art by the artist Beo Beyond]]

Most wearable art is made of fibrous materials and constitutes therefore a branch of the wider field of [[fiber art]], which includes both wearable and non-wearable forms of art using fabric and other fiber products. Wearable art as an artistic domain can also include jewelry, or clothing made from non-fiber materials such as leather, plastic sheeting, metals, etc.

==Wearable fiber art==
Artists creating wearable fiber art may use purchased finished fabrics or other materials, making them into unique garments, or may dye and paint virgin fabric. Countering the belief that art is something expensive, some clothing artists have started local companies to produce quality art work and clothing for a modest price. Wearable art is not restricted to jewellery but is also seen in graphic [[T-shirt]]s and even pants.

As with any other art form, the talent and skills of artists in this field vary widely. Since the nature of the medium requires [[craft]] skills as well as artistic skills, an advanced artist may wish to study [[color theory]], [[chemistry]], [[sewing]], [[Fashion designer|clothing design]], and computer software such as [[Photoshop]] and [[Illustrator]]. Classes in [[fashion design|clothing design and marketing]] are offered at colleges such as the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in [[New York City]].

The [[New Zealand]] city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] gained a reputation in the field of wearable art, with its ''World of Wearable Art Awards'', held annually since 1987 and run by [[Suzie Moncrieff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Suzie Moncrieff has the WoW factor|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/8884275/Suzie-Moncrieff-has-the-WoW-factor|newspaper = [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date = 2013-07-06|access-date = 2015-12-02|language = English|first = Kimberley|last = Rothwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the show moved to [[Wellington]] to a larger venue, although [[World of Wearable Art|a museum of garments]] remains in Nelson. In Australia, the [[Shearwater Wearable Arts]] or W.A.V.E. (Wearable Arts Vision In Education) has developed from a high school initiative to become a leading wearable arts event.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is held at [[Shearwater, The Mullumbimby Steiner School]] in [[Mullumbimby]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shearwaterperformingarts.com/ | title=Shearwater Wearable Arts 2017 | publisher=Shearwater The Mullumbimby Steiner School | work=Shearwater Wearable Arts | accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry as wearable art==
{{main|Art jewelry}}
Some 20th-century modern artists and architects sought to elevate bodily ornamentation — that is, jewellery — to the level of fine art and original design, rather than mere decoration, craft production of traditional designs, or conventional settings for showing off expensive stones or precious metals. In ''Modernist Jewelry 1930-1960: The Wearable Art Movement'' (2004), author Marbeth Schon explores unique and innovative wearable art objects created by surrealists, cubists, abstract expressionists, and other modernist artists working in the middle decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schon |first=Marbeth |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=modernist+%22The+Wearable+Art+Movement+%22&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Results for 'modernist "The Wearable Art Movement "' |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme examples==
Not all garments created as wearable art are made from traditional fibers or fabrics, and not all such artworks are meant for ordinary, practical use. [[Performance art|Performance]] and [[conceptual art]]ists have sometimes produced examples which are more provocative than useful.  [[Trashion]] is another branch of extraordinary wearable art, for example, work by [[Marina DeBris]].  The Portland Oregon Trashion Collective, Junk to Funk, has been using creating outrageous art garments out of trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junktofunk.org |title=Junk to Funk |publisher=Junk to Funk |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example is the ''Electric Dress'', a [[Shinto wedding|ceremonial wedding]] [[kimono]]-like costume consisting mostly of variously colored electrified and painted light bulbs, enmeshed in a tangle of wires, created in 1956 by the Japanese [[Gutai]] artist [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]. This extreme garment was something like a stage costume. Not really wearable in an everyday, practical  sense, it functioned rather as part of a daring work of [[performance art]] (though the "performance" element consisted merely of the artist's wearing the piece while mingling with spectators in a gallery setting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Mark |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/ |title=Electrifying Art: Atsuko Tanaka, 1954-1968 - New York Magazine Art Review |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2004-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nam June Paik]]'s 1969 performance piece called ''TV Bra for Living Sculpture'', [[Charlotte Moorman]] played a [[cello]] while wearing a [[brassiere]] made of two small operating television sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Collins |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D7143DF93AA35752C1A967958260 |title=Charlotte Moorman, 58, Is Dead; A Cellist in Avant-Garde Works |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian artist Andrea Vander Kooij created a group of pieces called ''Garments for Forced Intimacy'' (2006). According to an essay at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]'s Faculty of Fine Arts gallery website, these hand-knit articles of clothing are designed to be worn by two people simultaneously, and they, "as the name states, compel the wearers into uncharacteristic proximity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204221546/http://fofagallery.concordia.ca/ehtml/2007/acting.htm |date=February 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[wearable computing]] technology develops, increasingly miniaturized and stylized equipment is starting to blend with wearable art esthetics.  Low-power mobile computing allows light-emitting and color-changing flexible materials  and high-tech fabrics to be used in complex and subtle ways.  Some practitioners of the [[Steampunk]] movement have produced elaborate costumes and accessories which incorporate a pseudo-Victorian style with modern technology and materials.

M. Heyl, [[Hein Kever]] and [[George Hendrik Breitner]]]]
'''Willink van Collenprijs''' (''English'': The Willink van Collen Award) is a former Dutch art award, which was awarded for the first time in 1880 by the [[Sociëteit Arti et Amicitiae]]. It was intended as an encouragement award for young artists, and was considered as a national counterpart to the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]]. Its existence of more than 71 years proves the success of Amsterdam's art policy {{dubious|date=August 2016}}. For many of its winners, it was a valuable boost to their careers in the Dutch art world. Some of the prize winners were also recognized abroad and remain well known today.

== Background ==
During the "[[Second Golden Age of Dutch painting]]", the Dutch painters enjoyed considerable arts patronage from the upper class. This can also be seen in the context of the [[Hague School]] and the School of [[August Allebé|Allebé]].&lt;ref&gt;This School is also known as ''Amsterdam Impressionism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amsterdam-born painter [[Wilhem Ferdinand Willink van Collen]] (1847–1881) and his wife [[Anna Weber-van Bosse]] were great art lovers. After his death, he bequeathed a sum of 30,000 guilders to the society [[Arti et Amicitiae]] to set up a trust fund. The aim was to support young artists' income during their difficult initial phase.&lt;ref&gt;''Maatschappij‚ Arti et Amicitiae Fonds Willink van Collen.'' In: ''[[Algemeen Handelsblad]]'' of  August 2, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''13e Wedstrijd, uitgeschreven door het bestuur van het fonds ‚Willink van Collen'.'' In: ''[[Het nieuws van den dag]]'' of December 21, 1891&lt;/ref&gt; This also happened at painter's schools like [[Düsseldorfer Malerschule|Düsseldorf painter's School]][a], [[Copenhagen School (painting)|Copenhagen School]][b], [[Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School]][c],&lt;ref&gt;It is also known under the name Weimar School. From 1870 – 1900 she turned away from the traditional academic painting – [[neoclassicism]] – and opened herself to Impressionism (German Impressionism) and then to [[Modern Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Munich School]][d], [[École des Beaux-Arts|Academy of Beaux-Arts]] to Paris[e], [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]][f] as well as the [[Barbizon School]][g] and the new French [[Impressionism]][h] to give a chance to the Dutch young generation, too.

[[File:Rixens jour de vernissage.jpg|thumb|left|The Pariser Salon in 1890.]]
The annual art exhibition of the [[Paris Salon]] was the most important event, too. It was the centre of the painters of Europe and it was very difficult to be allowed to exhibit there. The Five prizes awarded there were highly desired. It concerned two ''Gold Medals'' (medals of the 1st class) and three ''Silver Medals'' (medals of the 2nd class). Moreover, "Recognitions" and "Honorable Mentions" were pronounced. All this needed an answer in the Netherlands.

The board of Directors of the Association "Arti et Amiticitae" decided to hold an annual painting competition for all Dutch artists. Participants were required to reside in the Netherlands, and be under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;R. Zeitler: ''Die Kunst des 19. Jahrhunderts''. Berlin 1966 (Propyläen Kunstgeschichte, Bd. 3 German version)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the age limit was raised to 35. The paintings were submitted unsigned, and evaluated by the jury anonymously. Originally, there was a first place, a second place and a third one, a commendation - structured like the prizes of the Paris Salon. Not every prize was awarded every year. This approach was maintained until 1893. The jury had to deal with a problem of a special kind. The standard of entries was quite staggering. In 1891 it was decided to select a more difficult theme, to deter painters with inadequate training.

The following year, the jury decided to award no first prize. The reason was: It was felt that "no sufficient artistic value" was presented in the submitted works.

== No award and its consequences ==
[[File:Arti.jpg|thumb|The house of the ''Sociëteit Arti et Amicitiae'' at Rokin 3 in Amsterdam. This is where the Willink van Collenprijs was awarded.]]
In 1893, a competition to design a mural for the organizers' building was announced. Only seven submissions were received, all of which disappointed the jury. For the first time in the history of the award, neither the prize nor the commendation were awarded. In 1894, the executive board decided to proceed differently. Instead of awarding the prize, the award money was spent on acquiring the painting "The Snow" by [[George Hendrik Breitner]], a study trip for three [[Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten|Rijksacademie of Amsterdam]] students, and a small scholarship for Dutch artists living in London.

This decision upset both painters and the general public. This must be seen in the contemporary social context, because the Willink van Collenprijs had become a national institution. 
As a consequence, a petition to protest this practice was signed by 29 artists, including famous names like [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]], the brothers [[Jacob Maris|Jacob]] and [[Willem Maris]], [[Paul Gabriël]] and [[Louis Apol]]. Giving in to the pressure, a competition was organized again in 1896. According to the new rules, there would only be a first prize, and no other places. In the years 1897, 1906, 1909 and 1910, multiple "first prizes" were awarded.

Because of political events, the award could not be written out consistently. After 71 years, it was awarded for the last time in 1950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8952">The '''word count''' is the number of [[word]]s in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in [[academia]], legal proceedings, [[journalism]] and [[advertising]]. Word count is commonly used by [[translator]]s to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of [[readability]] and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in [[words per minute]]). When converting [[character (computing)|character]] counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.&lt;ref&gt;The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America suggest [http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/what-is-a-word/ 6 chars to a word]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and variations of definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Variations in the [[operational definition]]s of how to count the words can occur (namely, what "counts as" a word, and which words "don't count" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread [[word processing]], there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the [[text segmentation]] rules generally found in most word processing software (including how [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] are determined, which depends on how [[word divider]]s are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a [[space (punctuation)|space]] (any of various [[whitespace character]]s, such as a "regular" word space, an [[space (punctuation)#Space characters and digital typography|em space]], or a [[tab key#Tab characters|tab character]]) is a word divider. Usually a [[hyphen]] or a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], or [[hidden text]]) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.

However, during the era when school assignments were done in [[handwriting]] or with [[typewriter]]s, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that "certain words don't count", usually [[English articles|articles]] (namely, "a", "an", "the"), but sometimes also others, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s (for example, "and", "or", "but") and some prepositions (usually "to", "of"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as "follow-up" (noun) or "long-term" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a [[rule of thumb]] for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These "rules" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the "word count" feature of such software (which follows the [[text segmentation]] rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).

As for which sections of a document "count" toward the total (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s, [[citation|reference lists and bibliographies]], [[table (information)|tables]], figure captions, [[hidden text]]), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply [[selection (user interface)|select]] (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.

== Software ==
Modern [[web browser]]s support word counting via [[Browser extension|extensions]], via a [[JavaScript]] [[bookmarklet]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=http://marklets.com/Word+Count.aspx | title=Word Count Bookmarklet | publisher=Marklets.com | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | author=Tavory, Ran}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[script (computing)|script]] &lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=https://wordcounttools.com/ | title=Word Count Tool | accessdate=March 6, 2014 | author=Word Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is hosted in a website. Most [[word processor]]s can also count words. [[Unix]]-like systems include a  program, ''[[wc (Unix)|wc]]'', specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.

As [[#Details and variations in how the count is defined|explained earlier]], different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.

== In fiction ==
Novelist [[Jane Smiley]] suggests that length is an important quality of the [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, Jane. 2005. Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[National Novel Writing Month]] requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a [[novella]] and a [[novel]] is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Tom, "Does Size Matter?" The Guardian (UK), Booksblog, Nov. 2, 2006. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2006/nov/02/doessizematter&lt;/ref&gt; But while the length of a novel is to a large extent up to its writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[New York Times]]|last=Quindlen|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Quindlen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/books/writers-on-writing-the-eye-of-the-reporter-the-heart-of-the-novelist.html|title=Writers on Writing: The Eye of the Reporter, the Heart of the Novelist|date=September 23, 2002|quote=A novelist doesn't write to space, of course; 80,000 words, 100,000, it is up to the writer to say when the story is done.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lengths may also vary by subgenre; many [[chapter book]]s for children start at a length of about 16,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Nancy, Crafting Stories for Children. Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Agents give writers the book on what's hot and what's not|journal=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|first=Carol|last=Thurston|date=August 3, 1997|quote=no one wants more than 60-80,000 words in a mystery, 110,000 for a thriller}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
