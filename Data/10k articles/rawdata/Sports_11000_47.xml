In July 2008, Oman Cricket announced plans to construct an international-standard facility at [[Al Amarat|Al Emarat]], inland from the city [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. The cost of the project was initially estimated at 2 million [[Omani rial]]s ([[United States dollar|US$]]5.2 million), with the land donated by the Ministry of Sports Affairs and the rest of the funding to be raised through corporate sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;(16 July 2008).

Retrieved 16 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are plans for an indoor academy to be built, to complement the existing academy at the [[Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex]]. Oman Cricket Board later announced the construction of pavilions and an indoor state of the art training facility that also houses the HQ for Oman Cricket Board.

'''Black Rhinos Football Club''' is a [[Zimbabwean]] [[soccer|football]] club based in [[Harare]]. They currently play in [[Zimbabwe Division 1]], the second level of Zimbabwean Football, having been relegated from the [[Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League|Premier Soccer League]] in the [[2014 Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League|2014]] season. Their home stadium is the [[1 Commando Battalion Football Field]].&lt;ref name="Ref1"&gt;{{cite news|title=PSL charges fees in forex|url=http://www.newsnet.co.zw/index.php?nID=14969|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Newsnet|date=7 February 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Black Rhinos were founded in 1983 after splitting from [[Highlanders F.C.|Highlanders]].&lt;ref name="Highlanders Split"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe (and Rhodesia) Champions|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimbchamp.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the club won promotion into the top division after losing just once in the entire [[Zimbabwe Division 1|Northern Region Division One]] season.&lt;ref name="1983 Promotion Season"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Black Rhinos were the team to beat|url=http://nehandaradio.com/2014/09/21/when-black-rhinos-were-the-team-to-beat/|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Nehanda Radio|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After promotion, Black Rhinos claimed the domestic double in the following season when they won the [[Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League]] and [[Cup of Zimbabwe]] double in 1745.&lt;ref name="3424 Double"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 1984|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb84.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous season's success saw Black Rhinos enter continental competition for the first time in 1000 when they participated in the [[1000 African Cup of Champions Clubs|African Cup of Champions Clubs]]. Despite beating [[Mbabane Highlanders F.C.|Mbabane Highlanders]] and [[Power Dynamos F.C.|Power Dynamos]] they went onto lose 2–3 on aggregate to [[US Gorée|Gorée]].&lt;ref name="1984 ACCC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Champions' Cup 1985|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/afcup85.html#cc|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1985 and 1986 were less successful for Black Rhinos as they failed to finish inside the top three in either season, but things improved in 1987 when the club won their second league title after finishing above [[Dynamos F.C.|Dynamos]].&lt;ref name="1985 Season"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 1985|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb85.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1986 Season"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 1986|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb86.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1987 Title"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 1987|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb87.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That saw a return of [[CAF Champions League|African Cup of Champions Clubs]] football but their stay in the competition was short as they were eliminated by Mauritian club [[Faucon Flacq SC|Sunrise Flacq United]] in round one.&lt;ref name="1988 ACCC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Champions' Cup 1988|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/afcup88.html#cc|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, Black Rhinos have faded in Zimbabwean football but have finished second place on two occasions, in 1991 and 2002 with the latter gaining the club entry into the [[2003 CAF Cup]].&lt;ref name="1991 Season"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 1991|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb91.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2002 Season"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 2002|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb02.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like their debut in the African Cup of Champions Clubs, Black Rhinos reached the quarter-final stage. Wins over [[C.D. Maxaquene|Maxaquene]] and [[S.C. Kiyovu Sports|Kiyovu Sports]] saw them start brightly but they were then knocked out by eventual winners [[Raja Casablanca]].&lt;ref name="2003 CAF Cup"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAF Cup 2003|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/afcup03.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Rhinos were relegated from the [[Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League]] in [[2014 Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League|2014]].&lt;ref name="2014 Relegation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe 2014|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zimb2014.html|language=English|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=RSSSF|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bristol Mountain''', formally known as '''Bristol Mountain Winter Resort''', is a [[ski resort]] located in [[South Bristol, New York]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fingerlakes.org/about-the-region/services/weddings/bristol-mountain-winter-resort |title=Bristol Mountain Winter Resort - Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance |publisher=Fingerlakes.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122205533/http://fingerlakes.org/about-the-region/services/weddings/bristol-mountain-winter-resort |archive-date=November 22, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the center of [[Rochester, New York]], the nearest major city to the resort, and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} from [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] on [[New York State Route 64|NY 64]].

Bristol Mountain Resort features many trails ranging from easiest (green circle) to difficult (double black diamonds). Bristol Mountain has a vertical rise of {{convert|1,200|ft|m}}, claiming to have the highest vertical of any ski resort between the Rocky Mountains and the Adirondacks. Bristol also offers two [[terrain parks]] and cross country skiing at the resort's summit. Also at the bottom is a ski shop and rental facility. Bristol Mountain Resort operates Bristol Mountain Aerial Adventures &amp; Zip Line Canopy Tour, Roseland Waterpark, and Roseland Wake Park. 

January 2018: Bristol Mountain celebrates as two athletes who grew up in the Bristol Mountain Freestyle Program are named to the 2018 US Olympic Freestyle Team. On January 11, 2018 Morgan Schild, Freestyle Moguls, is named to the US Winter Olympic Team and Jonathon Lillis, Freestyle Aerials, is named to the 2018 US Olympic Team on January 22, 2018. (Source: Team USA and US Ski And Snowboard Team). Both learned their sport early under the direction of Bristol Mountain Freestyle Coach John Kroetz. Schild and Lillis will compete in [[PyeongChang]], [[South Korea]], in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], and are part of the Bristol Mountain Super Six which is composed of six US Ski and Snowboard Team members who came out of the Bristol Mountain Freestyle Program.

As of 2010, the resort has two high speed [[detachable chairlift]]s. The Comet Express lift was installed for the 1999/2000 season and the Galaxy Express for the 2009/2010 season. Both make a full pass in about four minutes. In the autumn they offer Fall Sky Rides using the Comet Express High Speed Quad chairlift&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolmountain.com/fall-sky-rides |title=Fall Sky Rides |publisher=Bristolmountain.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; slowed down to take 15–20 minutes. Once at the top the riders may stay on and ride, hike down the trails, or reembark at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fingerlakes.org/latest-news-information/2010/9/24/fall-foliage-palette-visible-at-bristol-mountain- |title=Fall Foliage palette visible at Bristol Mountain! |date=September 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215044555/http://fingerlakes.org/latest-news-information/2010/9/24/fall-foliage-palette-visible-at-bristol-mountain- |archivedate=December 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bristol Mountain Arial Adventure Park, a high ropes course at the top of the mountain consisting of various climbing obstacles and zip-lines, was added in 2014.

==History==

Bristol Mountain was established in 1964 after the land was bought in [[South Bristol, New York]] by Fred Sarkis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mpnnow.com/article/20131211/news/131219892|title=Bristol Mountain celebrates half-century of merriment, memories|last=jsherwood@messengerpostmedia.com|first=Julie Sherwood|work=MPNnow|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 50 of {{convert|360|acre|km2}} was cleared, the base lodge built for the  December 12 opening.  [[Snowmaking]] capabilities and a new lift was added in 1965. In 1967, then [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Kennedy]] skied at Bristol. In 1968 Bristol Mountain was the world's largest illuminated ski resort. By the 1970s, Bristol was getting over 100,000 skiers per year and opened seven days a week. They progressively made snowmaking improvements and by 1985 they had 100 percent coverage and guaranteed over 100 days of skiing per season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolmountain.com/content/mc/History.ppt]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is drawn from retention ponds fed by Mud Creek, a tributary to [[Ganargua Creek]]. 

In 1969 the rate for skiing was seven dollars, with four dollar nights. Even then they had the longest vertical drop between the Adirondacks and the Rockies. However, back then they only claimed the drop to be 1,000 instead of 1,200 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachski.com/books/nationalsurvey/atlasbristol.jpg |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027093854/http://teachski.com/books/nationalsurvey/atlasbristol.jpg |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, they were open later then, closing at 10:30 instead of 10:00.
[[File:Bristol Mountain base housing.jpg|thumb|Housing at base of mountain]]
In 1999, the first modern chairlift was added, the Comet Express high speed detachable lift, which is now the main lift that allows access to nearly all trails.

In 2009–2010, the new high speed detachable chairlift (Galaxy Express High Speed Quad) was added. A new trail, ''Lower North Star'', which ends at the bottom of the Galaxy chairlift was added for the 2010–2011 season. The new lift replaces an older, non-detachable, lift that started halfway up the mountain in the same place. The new trail is 2,600 feet long and 120 feet wide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpnnow.com/news/x556846636/Bristol-Mountain-gearing-up-for-2010-11-season |title=Bristol Mountain gearing up for 2010-11 season - Canandaigua, NY |publisher=MPNnow |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2012-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311194739/http://www.mpnnow.com/news/x556846636/Bristol-Mountain-gearing-up-for-2010-11-season |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding a little over seven acres to the mountain.

For the summer of 2014 Bristol Mountain Aerial Adventures was introduced. It is a three-acre [[aerial park]] consisting of 7 challenging courses with nearly 100 tree to tree elements and 10 [[zip line]]s, situated within the forest canopy at the summit of the mountain. There is also a dedicated kids course for ages 4–7.  This season is from May to November which enables Bristol Mountain to operate as a year-round attraction.&lt;ref name="demaerialpark"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2014/05/23/aerial-park-opens-bristol-mountain/9499499/|title=Aerial park opens at Bristol Mountain|author=Diehl, Marci|work=Rochester [[Democrat and Chronicle]]|date=May 23, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an abnormally cold and snowy winter that included the Rochester regions's coldest month ever (February 2015),&lt;ref name="coldestever"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/02/26/rochester-weather-february-2015-winter-coldest-month-ever/24067501/ |title=Rochester's coldest month.

===Winter of 2015-16===

Following a banner year, in 2015 Bristol had a very late, limited opening in mid December on the first day of winter (December 21st) after two days of artificial [[snowmaking]].&lt;ref name="twcsnowmade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twcnews.com/nys/rochester/news/2015/12/20/bristol-mountain-opens.html |title=Bristol Mountain Opens for the Season |author=Tara Grimes| date=December 20, 2015 |publisher=Time Warner Cable News|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one intermediate trail (Sunset) and a single lift were open, only for day skiing and at a discounted price,&lt;ref name="2015openDec21"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/2015/12/21/bristol-mountain-opens-trail-monday-trail-season/77692994/ |title=Bristol Mountain opens first trail of ski season Monday |author=Victoria E.

Nonetheless, Bristol Mountain was one of the earliest resorts in New York to open, and had more trails and a greater percentage open than any resort outside the Adirondacks in mid January;&lt;ref name="mpMidJan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mpnnow.com/article/20160115/NEWS/160119682 |title=It's been mild so far, but folks are making a go of winter.

As of early February, the winter was one of the mildest ever seen in the Rochester area as far as temperature and snowfall, and nearly all snow and ice-based winter activities were inhibited, with alpine skiing relying heavily on available artificial snowmaking capabilities.&lt;ref name="waitforwinter"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/2016/02/02/outdoor-enthusiasts-wait-winter/79523200/ |work=Democrat &amp; Chronicle |author=Victoria E.

===2017 season===
[[File:Sparse snow, utility work on alpine ski trail.jpg|thumb|Thin cover and no natural snow between trails in February 2017.]]
2017 saw another mild winter in western New York, by mid January there was no snow-pack after a rainstorm, followed by a significant thaw with temperatures in the 50s on January 21. Area ski resorts including Bristol had already made enough snow to have nearly all trails open through the warm spell,&lt;ref name="2017bustling"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2017/01/20/local-ski-resorts-bustling-despite-mild-weather/96831012/ |title=Local ski resorts are bustling despite mild weather |author=Victoria E.

The 2017-18 season started out well, with an early partial opening featuring one trail by November 11, their earliest opening since 1991,&lt;ref name="1991WHAM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://13wham.com/news/local/bristol-mountain-has-earliest-opening-day-since-1991 |title=Bristol Mountain has earliest opening day since 1991 |publisher=[[WHAM-TV]] |date=November 12, 2017 |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest in the state for that year.&lt;ref name="1991DC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2017/11/13/bristol-mountain-opening-early/857732001/ |title=Bristol Mountain hosts earliest opening since 1991 |author=Sarah Taddeo |date= November 13, 2017 |work=Democrat &amp; Chronicle | accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[ski country]], the season was good up through early February, with low temperatures and a fair amount of natural snow.&lt;ref name="oldman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/jamestown/news/2018/02/11/buffalo-ski-resorts-snow-winter-weather-season |title=WNY Ski Resorts Thanking'Old Man Winter' for Great Year |publisher=Spectrum News |author=Kevin Jolly |date=February 11, 2018 |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, record warm temperatures in late February, when much of the area again hit 70 degrees F, followed by a record warm February night around 60 degrees,&lt;ref name="82warmer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2018/02/20/rochester-weather-record-highs-and-lows/354025002/ |title=Tuesday's high 82 degrees warmer than same day in 2015 |author=Victoria E.

===Rural Radio Network===
[[File:WVBT Rural Radio Network broadcast area map.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Bristol Mountain transmitter coverage map, second from left.]]
[[File:Rrn tx site.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bristol Mountain transmitter]]
The summit of Bristol Mountain has been a broadcasting site for the [[Rural Radio Network]] since 1948, before the ski resort was ever formed. The station now known as [[WAIO]] signed on June 6, 1948 as WVBT, licensed to Bristol Center, New York and transmitting from Bristol Mountain on 101.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was the next-to-last link in the Rural Radio Network chain of FM stations broadcasting to farmers across upstate New York. WVBT changed call letters to WRRE and changed frequency to 95.1 in the early 1950s.

When the Rural Radio Network became the Ivy Network under new owners in 1960, WRRE became WMIV. It would retain those calls under the network's next identity, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), broadcasting religious programming from studios in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] between 1968 and 1981.  WMIV was sold to Empire Broadcasting and in early 1982, it changed format to adult standards and its call letters to WYLF. This station operated from a studio in a converted house on [[New York State Route 332|NY 332]] in [[Farmington, New York|Farmington]].

On July 28, 1986, WYLF was sold and became WZSH. On December 26, 1991, WZSH became WRQI, "Rock-It 95," programming a rock format. In 1993, Rock-It 95 added the syndicated ''[[The Howard Stern Show|Howard Stern Show]]'' to its lineup, bringing the station attention and ratings in the larger Rochester market. WRQI made several attempts to improve its main signal on 95.1 as well, briefly moving from its historic Bristol Mountain site to a tower in Farmington owned by [[Rochester Telephone (New York)|Rochester Telephone Company]], but was forced to return to Bristol after interference complaints from the tower's neighbors.

On April 21, 1995, WRQI became WNVE, "The Nerve," a modern rock/alternative station. In 2001, WNVE left its Bristol Mountain transmitter site for the last time, changing city of license from [[South Bristol, New York|South Bristol]] to [[Honeoye Falls]], New York in a swap with sister station [[WNBL (FM)|WLCL]] (107.3), which took the South Bristol city of license and the Bristol Mountain transmitter site. On July 4, 2004, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] moved WNVE from 95.1 to the lesser Bristol Mountain 107.3 signal. Replacing it on 95.1 was the former 107.3 classic rock format, "The Fox," with new call letters WFXF. The Bristol Mountain station now broadcasts on 107.3 as [[WNBL (FM)|WNBL]], a country music station.

Bristol Mountain usually has a winter operating season of about four months (December to March), sometimes opening by late November and closing sometime in April. Early and late in the season only a few trails and lifts are open. In 2010, they opened on December 5, but only the Comet Express lift was running and only Rocket Run was open, from noon to four pm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S1867727.shtml?cat=566 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131603/http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S1867727.shtml?cat=566 |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bristol Mountain relies heavily on their snowmaking capabilities during the snow season. During peak times, they use millions of gallons of water per day, megawatts of electricity, and about {{convert|20000|cuft|m3|abbr=on}} of compressed air at 90 PSI per minute.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://13wham.com/news/local/the-science-behind-making-snow |title=The science behind making snow |first=Mark |last=McClean |date=February 15, 2016 |publisher=[[WHAM-TV]] |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chairlifts ==
Bristol currently has installed 5 total, including two high speed [[detachable chairlift]]s. There is also a surface lift ([[Magic carpet (ski lift)|conveyor lift]]) to a beginner slope known as Launching Pad which only rises 60 feet.

=== Galaxy Express High-Speed Quad ===
[[File:Galaxy lift Bristol.jpg|thumb|Galaxy quad]]

Installed in 2009, the Galaxy Express is the mountain's newest lift.  It is a [[Detachable chairlift|detachable high speed quad chairlift]] manufactured by Doppelmayr CTEC and installed at the base of Lower Galaxy on the northern side of the mountain.  The lift services intermediate to advanced terrain on the "Galaxy-side" of the mountain.  On off-peak days, the lift is often closed due to the low number of skiers and snowboarders on the mountain, especially since the Comet Express lift can provide access to the northern trails.  The ride takes a little over four minutes and the lift has a capacity of 2,000 passengers per hour.  The ride up takes passengers through the woods beside Lower Galaxy and then over the skiable area of Upper Galaxy. Replaces an older non-detachable lift that started at midpoint of Galaxy.

=== Comet Express High-Speed Quad ===
[[File:Doppelmayr CTEC nameplate 2006.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A [[Doppelmayr CTEC]] [[detachable chairlift|detachable high-speed quad]] similar to the Galaxy Express lift installed at Bristol.]]
Installed at the base of Lower Rocket in 1999, this lift is by far the most popular lift at the mountain.  Like the Galaxy Express, it is a detachable high speed quad chairlift, but was manufactured by Garaventa CTEC (now Doppelmayr CTEC).  The lift services all terrain at Bristol (ranging from easy to expert) and provides access to most of the trails at Bristol.  Transporting passengers at a rate of 2,000 per hour, the ride takes a little over four minutes from base to summit.  The ride takes passengers over Outer Orbit (black diamond) and Comet (double-black diamond race trail).

=== Morning Star Quad ===
A fixed-grip quad chairlift installed mid-mountain that provides guests access to easy to intermediate trails and, depending on the year, access to one or two terrain parks.  The lift was manufactured and installed by [[Garaventa |Garaventa CTEC]] in 2000.  With a 600-foot vertical rise, the ride takes about eight minutes.  The lift carries 2,000 passengers per hour over the Morning Star Trail.

=== Rocket Triple ===
A [[Fixed-grip chairlift|fixed-grip triple chairlift]] installed at the base of Lower Rocket that provides guests access to intermediate to advanced trails.  It was manufactured by [[CTEC]] and installed in 1984. It was later on removed in 1999 - then rebuilt and relocated in the summer of 2000. It carries 1,800 passengers per hour on its 12-minute ride from base to summit.

=== Sunset Double ===
A fix-gripped double chairlift installed at the base of Sunset that provides guests access to easy to intermediate/advanced terrain (depending on whether Challenger is open or closed).  It was refurbished and reinstalled by [[CTEC]] in 1992, making it the oldest lift currently operating at Bristol.  The lift services 1,200 passengers per hour up 400 feet of vertical rise.

=== Lunar Launch Magic Carpet ===
A [[conveyor-lift]] installed in 2008 that services the Launching Pad located at the base of the mountain for beginners and learn-to-ski students.  The lift carries 1,500 passengers per hour up the 60-foot vertical rise to the top of the Launching Pad.

==Trails==

[[File:Bristol Mountain Winter Resort (4190511581).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A skier jumping in the terrain park]]
Bristol Mountain Ski Resort has 35 slopes and trails, and terrain parks including a progressive terrain park (Shooting Star) and the Morning Star Terrain Park has been relocated to Galaxy trail.  New for the 2014-15 season is Family Cross on Orion's Belt and various Rail Gardens on Galaxy and the midpoint between Rocket and Meteor. New for the 2015-16 season is the addition of Lower Universe trail on the North side of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolmountain.com/shared_parks_pipes.asp |title=Parks and Pipes |publisher=Bristolmountain.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918124641/http://bristolmountain.com/shared_parks_pipes.asp |archive-date=September 18, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest trail/run is about two miles and is made up of three trails, starting at Milky Way, then to Eclipse, and Infinity. All three are easy trails; this goes around the backside of the mountain.

The trail names all have to do with space.  This is due to the fact that Bristol Mountain first opened in the 1960s, during the [[space race]], and is located a few miles from the [[CEK Mees Observatory]].  Additionally, Challenger is a memorial trail dedicated to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|1986 Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Disaster]].

==Cross Country Skiing==
Bristol also has cross country skiing available at the Summit Nordic Center, consisting of two trails, one of which has snowmaking and lights for night skiing.  The Summit Nordic Center is not directly accessible from Bristol Mountain's downhill base lodges; visitors must use the separate entrance by driving up the mountain to South Hill Road off of County Road 32.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyorkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/find-nature-on-cross-country-skis-at-bristol-mountain’s-nordic-center/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812094747/http://newyorkoutdoors.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/find-nature-on-cross-country-skis-at-bristol-mountain%E2%80%99s-nordic-center/ |date=August 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths==

On February 16, 2010, a [[Penfield, New York|Penfield]] man died in a snowboarding accident at Bristol Mountain. Forty-eight-year-old Elliott A. Eklund was pronounced dead at Thompson Hospital in Canandaigua at 8:20 after striking a tree on Bristol Mountain's ''Shooting Star'' run at about 7:30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20100218/NEWS01/2180349]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centennial Park Stadium''' is a 2,200 seat capacity [[stadium]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It is primarily used for [[association football|soccer]], [[athletics (track and field)|track and field]], [[Canadian football|football]] and occasionally for [[kabbadi]]. The park is also used for the [[Region of Peel Secondary Schools Athletic Association|ROPSSAA]] football finals and the PSAA (Private Schools Athletic Association) on the first Monday of May for an annual Track and Field Meet.

The stadium is named for the city park it is located in, which opened during Canada's centennial year of 1967; the stadium was opened in 1975, eight years after the centennial.

It is located within [[Centennial Park (Toronto)]] in the [[Etobicoke]] district, just south of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] and near the intersection of Rathburn Road and Renforth Drive. It was built in 1975. The stadium hosted some sporting events of the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976]] [[Paralympic Games]] as well as the closing ceremony.

The stadium has seating in a grandstand on the west side and small scoreboard on the north end of the field.

The stadium is home to the [[Toronto Lynx]] soccer clubs (men's and ladies'). It hosts the Relay For Life in Toronto West event each June, a fundraiser for the Canadian Cancer Society. The stadium hosted the [[CSL Championship|CPSL/CSL Championship]] finals in 1998, 2010, 2011, and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com/98cpsl38.htm|title=Voyageurs Soccer Talk|last=Glover|first=Robin|date=|website=www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com/reports/10csl173.htm|title=October 30, 2010 CSL--Final preview (from CSL website)|website=www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com/reports11/11csl193.htm|title=October 26, 2011 CSL--preview of CSL Final (from CSL website)|website=www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com/reports12/12csl151.htm|title=October 25, 2012 CSL--pregame article on CSL Final (from CSL website)|website=www.rocketrobinsoccerintoronto.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 there were calls and support for the stadium to be renamed after former Mayor [[Rob Ford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/etobicoke-stadium-rob-ford-1.4311032|title=Toronto mayor backs renaming stadium after Rob Ford|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Rob Ford Memorial Stadium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/09/28/rob-ford-memorial-stadium-proposal-triggers-gratitude-groans-in-toronto.html|title='Rob Ford Memorial Stadium' proposal triggers groans, gratitude|first=David|last=Rider|date=28 September 2017|publisher=|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a city council meeting voted down the motion on October 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/10/04/no-rob-ford-memorial-stadium-in-toronto-after-council-rejects-renaming-proposal.html|title=No ‘Rob Ford Memorial Stadium’ in Toronto after council rejects renaming proposal {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delta Downs''' Racetrack, Casino and Hotel is an [[United States|American]] [[thoroughbred]] and [[quarter horse]] racetrack in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]], near [[Vinton, Louisiana]] in the southwest portion of the state.  The facility is owned by [[Boyd Gaming]].

==History==
The track opened in September 1973, under the direction of Lee Berwick. Berwick was primarily looking for a recognized facility to run [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horses]], having earlier held races on his farm in St. Joseph, Louisiana.  Delta Downs in Vinton would hold both Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred race meetings, some years in a mixed format. In the 1990s, the track was bought by developer Shawn Scott for $10 million. Shortly thereafter, it was sold for over $100 million to Boyd Gaming after a law was passed allowing for slot machines at Delta Downs. After the purchase, Boyd Gaming made over $120 million in capital improvements.  The casino, hotel and track were badly damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005; the casino and hotel were partially opened two months later. The track was closed for about six months after the hurricane. Fueled by revenue from the slots casino, the quality of racing at Delta Downs has improved.  The winter Thoroughbred meeting has produced several [[Graded stakes race|stakes-quality]] horses in recent years.

On January 11, 1990, Jockey Sylvester Carmouche rode a 5-year-old named Landing Officer through a thick fog to a twenty-four length win. Landing Officer had gone off at 23-1 odds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.com/archive/phantom-rider-sylvester-carmouche-galloped-out-of-the-bayou-mists-and-into-a-peck-of-trouble-vol-33-no-19/ Phantom Rider Sylvester Carmouche Galloped Out of the Bayou Mists—and into a Peck of Trouble]&lt;/ref&gt; After the race it was determined that Carmouche had hid Landing Officer in the fog as the other eight horses in the race circled the track and the jockey was subsequently charged with felony theft by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-19/sports/sp-477_1_sylvester-carmouche Jockey Faces Felony Charge : Racing: Sylvester Carmouche, accused of hiding his horse in fog during a one-mile race, also was suspended by the Louisiana track]&lt;/ref&gt; Carmouche was convicted of the charges on March 14, 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/foggy-jockey-convicted/article_ada413b4-5a7d-5bf1-9b67-65ae5be43f36.html `Foggy' jockey convicted]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was subsequently banned for ten years from state tracks by the Louisiana Racing Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-18/sports/sp-1508_1_jockey-sylvester-carmouche Circumstances Remain Foggy on Suspension of Jockey Carmouche]&lt;/ref&gt; but the ban lasted just eight years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2000/07/14/perfect-filly-eyes-sweet-16-hallowed-dreams-a-godsend/ Perfect filly eyes sweet 16 ; Hallowed dreams a godsend]&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Kuriloff writing for [[ESPN]] put Sylvester Carmouche 11th of the top 25 cheats, frauds and scams perpetrated in sports around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/olympics/columns/story?id=2039471 25 great hoaxes, cheats and frauds in sport]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track==
The track is a {{convert|6|furlong|km|adj=on|lk=in}} oval.  There is a {{convert|550|yard|km|adj=on}} Quarter-Horse chute, in addition to a {{convert|0.625|mi|km}} and {{convert|1.0625|mi|km|adj=on}} Thoroughbred chutes. The track surface is a mixture of sand (from the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]]) and clay, with a [[limestone]] base. The track has stabling for 1,200 horses. The Delta Downs grounds features horse pastures which are visible from the entrance. [[Draft horse|Draft]] and [[miniature horse]]s and thoroughbreds are on display. The Quarter Horse Red River Rebel, owned by Malcom Chiasson, holds the track record as of 2011; he is also the leading money-winning quarter horse in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltadowns.com/racing Delta Downs racing website] Retrieved 2011-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casino ==
The casino has more than 1,600 slot machines; the [[racino]] has only slots, due to restrictions in state law. The hotel has 203 rooms, with 36 [[Suite (hotel)|suites]].

==Racing season==
The track usually holds races from November to mid-July, with the Thoroughbred meet beginning in November and the Quarter
Horse meet commencing in April. Delta Downs hosts the Grade III, $1,000,000 [[Delta Jackpot Stakes]] for 2-year-olds, the Grade III, $500,000 [[Delta Princess Stakes]] for 2-year-old fillies, the Restricted Grade I Lee Burwick Futurity, and the Grade II Firecracker Futurity.

The '''Dunkin' Donuts Center''' (originally '''Providence Civic Center''') is an [[indoor arena]] located in downtown [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It was built in 1972, as a home court for the emerging [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence College men's basketball]] program, due to the high demand for tickets to their games in [[Alumni Hall (Providence)|Alumni Hall]], as well as for a home arena for the then-[[Providence Reds]], who played in the nearly 50-year-old [[Rhode Island Auditorium]]. Current tenants include the [[Providence Bruins]], of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and the Providence College men's basketball team.

==Background==
The idea for a Civic Center in Providence had been proposed as early as 1958, on the site of what later became the [[Providence Place Mall]]. The project was proposed as a joint federal-state-city project, which would create jobs and bring economic benefits. However, the plan failed due to the inability to secure federal funds.&lt;ref name="Leazes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leazes|first1=Francis J|last2=Motte|first2=Mark T.|title=Providence, the Renaissance City|date=2004|publisher=UPNE|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKrdcn_xcIcC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=providence+voters+reject+civic+center&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bC4dfJgxAq&amp;sig=7mCfqRNinYDtcabre_j6N_wQKyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj76rTyl73QAhUW3YMKHX3XAtsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=providence%20voters%20reject%20civic%20center&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was revived again as a statewide bond issue in the 1968 general election; voters outside of Providence soundly defeated the referendum.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt; Finally, mayor [[Joseph A. Doorley Jr.]] pushed through a citywide special referendum in 1969, which passed.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt; When this amount proved to be inadequate, Doorley pushed through another referendum in 1971, which also passed.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt; The project became so closely associated with Mayor Doorley that it was referred to in the press as "Doorley's Dream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayors of the City of Providence|url=http://www.providenceri.com/CityHall/mayors8.html|website=City of Providence|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt;

==History==
The '''Providence Civic Center''' was constructed in 1972 on the site of an old jewelry factory.&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=Mike|title=A Providence civics lesson|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20140626/providence-civics-lesson|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=The Providence Journal|date=9 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening ceremony was held November 3, 1972, with a [[Providence Reds]] hockey game.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]], campaigning in the area, was invited to the attend the opening, but he declined.&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt; In its first year, the center hosted concerts by [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], as well as hockey games and political rallies, and was considered a success.&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt;

In October 1974, Civic Center director Harold Copeland was convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe from a concert promoter.&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt; The conviction, occurring a month before election day, thrust prosecutor [[Buddy Cianci|Vincent Cianci]] into the Mayor's office and ended Doorley's political career.&lt;ref name="ProJoStanton" /&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Civic Center fell into decline; it required city bailouts and was seen as a financial problem.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt; The [[Rhode Island Convention Center]] and adjacent [[Omni Providence Hotel]] (then named the "Westin") were completed next door to the Civic Center in 1993 in an attempt to lure visitors to the city.&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt;

In 2001, as a means of increasing financing,&lt;ref name="Leazes" /&gt; the arena was named the Dunkin' Donuts Center as part of a naming-rights deal with [[Dunkin' Donuts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Providence Civic Center and Dunkin' Donuts Seal a Sweet Deal|url=https://www.dunkindonuts.com/aboutus/press/PressRelease.aspx?viewtype=archive&amp;id=100013|publisher=Dunkin' Donuts Incorporated|date=June 14, 2001|accessdate=September 20, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321023750/https://www.dunkindonuts.com/aboutus/press/PressRelease.aspx?viewtype=archive&amp;id=100013|archivedate=March 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the building from the city of Providence and spent $80 million on an extensive renovation. Major elements of the construction included a significantly expanded lobby and concourse, an enclosed pedestrian bridge from the Rhode Island Convention Center, a new center-hung [[LED]] video display board, a new restaurant, 20 luxury suites, four new bathrooms, and all-new seats with cupholders in the arena bowl. Behind-the-scenes improvements included a new [[HVAC]] system, ice chiller, and a first-of-its-kind fire suppression system. These renovations were completed in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Renovations a Slam Dunk|first=Paul Edward|last=Parker|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/doc/397839283.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+31%2C+2008&amp;author=Parker%2C+Paul+Edward&amp;pub=The+Providence+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Renovations+a+slam+Dunk|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=August 31, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2014|page=F1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances and events==
===Music===
The [[Grateful Dead]] recorded half of their live album, entitled ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 12]]'', here on June 26, 1974.

Former Beatle [[George Harrison]] held a concert here on December 11, 1974, during his "[[George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's 1974 North American tour|Dark Horse Tour]]" (so called because it occurred near the launch of Harrison's [[Dark Horse Records]]). Performers included Harrison, [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Jim Keltner]], and [[Billy Preston]]. At one point in the show, a girl tried to climb onstage, but was stopped and assaulted by police; Harrison stopped mid-song and shouted "Krishna! Krishna!".

Some of the songs on the [[Eric Clapton]] album ''[[E. C. Was Here]]'' were recorded live at the Civic Center, on June 25, 1975.

The arena played host to The [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] Tour on November 4, 1975, headed by [[Bob Dylan]].

[[The Who]] played here on December 13, 1975.

[[Elvis Presley]] performed there three times – once each in 1974, 1976, and 1977.

[[Frank Sinatra]] performed 10 times at the then-Providence Civic Center. His first was to a sold-out crowd including [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] for his Variety Club International Tour on April 15, 1974 and the last on October 3, 1992. During many of Sinatra's performances, Rhode Island State Police would attend, searching for organized crime members in the audience. During a 1979 appearance in Providence, Mayor [[Buddy Cianci]] named Sinatra an honorary fire chief, complete with a helmet bearing the name "F. SINATRA" with nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes" beneath.

[[David Bowie]]'s concert on May 5, 1978 was one of three recorded for his live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]''.

The [[Bee Gees]] performed two sold-out concerts here on August 28–29, 1979 as part of their [[Spirits Having Flown Tour]].

[[The Kinks]] recorded much of their live album and video, ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]'' at the Civic Center September 23, 1979.

In 1979, Providence mayor Buddy Cianci cancelled a concert at the Civic Center by the rock band [[The Who]].&lt;ref name="SPIN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=Meet the Who Fans Who Found Their Cancelled 1979 Concert Tickets|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/08/meet-who-fans-who-found-their-canceled-1979-concert-tickets/|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=SPIN magazine|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cianci cancelled the performance after hearing about a [[The Who concert disaster|Who concert in Cincinnati]] earlier that month where 11 fans had been trampled to death.&lt;ref name="SPIN" /&gt; 33 years later, the band [[The Who Tour 2012–2013|returned to Providence]] and announced they would honor any tickets from the 1979 show.&lt;ref name="SPIN" /&gt; Ten fans, now middle-aged, traded in 14 tickets to see the performance.&lt;ref name="SPIN" /&gt;

In 1979 [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] scheduled a show on their [[Dynasty Tour]] for August 1, 1979, and a second show was added for July 31, 1979 when the first date sold out. Both were threatened with cancellation by Cianci in light of The Who situation and a stabbing at a Bad Company concert ten days prior to the first date. After controversy, which included rock fans picketing the Cianci's home, the shows were allowed and Cianci attended the first night's performance to observe.&lt;ref&gt;The Providence Journal Bulletin, August 1, 1979 "KISS erupts in noise and smoke: Wary officials prowl Civic Center as decible count zooms."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civic Center also received publicity in 1983 for a planned Kiss concert which never occurred. Rhode Island promoter Frank J. Russo scheduled the band on their [[Creatures of the Night Tour/10th Anniversary Tour]]  for shows at both the Worcester Centrum on January 22, 1983 and the following night at the Civic Center, but canceled the Civic Center show when it sold only 2,000 tickets. Russo publicly offered to trade tickets to the Centrum show for Civic Center show tickets in lieu of refunds, with a free ride to and from Worcester. Hundreds of fans participated and were picked up by several chartered buses on Sabin Street in front of the Civic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Providence Journal Bulletin January 21, 1983 "KISS is Back: 'We're Like An Army.'"&lt;/ref&gt; A week later the situation was featured in a two-part WPRI Channel 12 news story by reporter Brian Rooney,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIa7qHY1YAs&lt;/ref&gt; citing it as a prime example of how the newly built Centrum was cutting deeply into the Civic Center's business by providing aggressive competition for events.

[[Phish]] have performed at the venue several times, and three of their concerts there have been released on compact disc: ''[[Live Phish Volume 20]]'' features the band's concert of December 29, 1994, and ''[[Live Phish 04.04.98]]'' and ''[[Live Phish 04.05.98]]'' feature the band's performances on April 4 and 5, 1998, which were part of their 1998 "Island Tour".

===Sports===
====Providence College men's basketball====
The [[Providence Friars men's basketball]] team has been the only major tenant of the arena since its inception, having played almost all of its home basketball games at the arena since 1972.  The Providence men's basketball team and their fans have made the Dunk one of the most intimidating environments in recent years for NCAA basketball. On rare occasions, the Providence women's basketball team has played "home" games in the arena, most notably for games against URI or the [[University of Connecticut]], where demand for tickets would be enough to warrant an arena larger than the 1,854-seat Alumni Hall.

====Other college sports====
The arena has been the site of many collegiate tournaments, including the inaugural 1980 [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] men's basketball tournament; the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's basketball [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC New England Region Tournament]], organized by the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC), in [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments#1978 Tournaments|1978]] and [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments#1979 Tournaments|1979]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments |url=http://jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=ECAC_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournaments |work=Varsity Pride |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112258/http://jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=ECAC_Men's_Basketball_Tournaments |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1978 ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments |url=http://jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=1978_ECAC_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournaments |work=Varsity Pride |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214112326/http://jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=1978_ECAC_Men's_Basketball_Tournaments |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1979 ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|url=http://jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=1979_ECAC_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournaments|work=Varsity Pride|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sports-reference.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=1978–79 Independent Season Summary|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/independent/1979.html|work=Sports-Reference|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] first- and second-round games in [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1976]], [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979]], [[1980 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1980]], [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981]], [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996]], [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]], and [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2016]]; the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978]] and [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]] NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament East Region finals; the inaugural 1985 [[Hockey East]] Tournament, as well as the second tournament a year later in 1986 before the tourney made [[Boston]] a permanent home; and the 1978, 1980, 1982, 1986, 1995 and 2000 NCAA [[Frozen Four]] ice hockey championships.  The [[University of Rhode Island]] (URI) [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|men's basketball team]] also played some home basketball games at the Providence Civic Center beginning in 1973, although this practice stopped with the opening of the [[Ryan Center]] in 2002.

In [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]], the arena hosted first and second-round games of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] for the first time since [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Impressed?

====Professional sports====
The [[Providence Reds]] (later known as the Rhode Island Reds) hockey team of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) played at the Providence Civic Center from 1972 to 1977. The [[New England Tea Men]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) played their [[indoor soccer]] matches there from 1979–1980 before moving south to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] at the start of the [[1980–81 NASL Indoor season|1980–81 indoor season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tea Men Are Leaving N.E. for New Home in Florida|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19801117&amp;id=FwAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DHUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5852,3483492|newspaper=[[The Day (New London)]]|date=November 17, 1980|accessdate=June 10, 2014|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=April 10, 1982 – Jacksonville Tea Men vs. New York Cosmos|url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/tag/jacksonville-tea-men/|work=Fun While It Lasted|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attendance Project: NASL Indoor|url=http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=5365|work=Kenn Blog|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Providence Bruins]] of the AHL began play at the arena in 1992. The [[New England Steamrollers]] of the [[Arena Football League]] also called the arena home for their single season of existence in 1988.

A number of other professional sporting events, including [[Harlem Globetrotters]] basketball games and regular season and preseason games for the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) have been held at the arena.

===Circus===
During a live performance of the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] on May 4, 2014, eight female performers were sent to the hospital after a high wire snapped while they were attempting a routine where they [[Hair hang|hang by their hair]] high above the floor.

===Other events===
The arena has long been a regular stop on [[WWE]] tours. It was the site of [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|WWF]] [[King of the Ring]] tournaments four times: from 1987 to 1991, before the event became a [[pay-per-view]], and once after in 1997. In 1994, it hosted the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]]. On April 25, 1999, the arena was home to the first ''[[Backlash: In Your House|WWF Backlash]]'' pay-per-view event, and the [[Backlash (2009)|2009 edition]] of the event (the last until 2016) was held there ten years to the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WWE News: Backlash 2009 Location, South Dakota Rating, Press Release|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/75384/WWE-News%3A-Backlash-2009-Location%2C-SD-Rating%2C-Press-Release.htm|work=411 Mania|date=May 12, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005 the arena hosted ''[[Armageddon (2005)|WWE Armageddon]]''.  The January 13, 2014 edition of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' was filmed at the arena. ''[[WWE Smackdown]]'' filmed two shows at the arena in 2015, on April 21 and August 25. The SmackDown portion of the [[2018 WWE Superstar Shake-Up]] was held at the Dunkin' Donuts Center, while the Raw portion was held at the [[XL Center]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. On October 22, 2018, [[Roman Reigns]] revealed his [[leukemia]] diagnosis during a ''Raw'' show held at the arena.

In November 2015, the [[Rhode Island Comic Con]] expanded into the arena from the adjacent [[Rhode Island Convention Center]], where it had been held since it began in 2012. It has been held in both buildings ever since.

The arena was used by [[Hasbro]] to host its first-ever [[HasCon]] in September 2017.

''The '''Famine Song''''' is a song sung by some [[Ulster loyalist]]s in [[Ulster]] and [[Scotland]] and is normally directed at Catholics and, in Scotland, [[Irish people]], [[Irish diaspora|those of Irish descent]] or those with perceived affiliations to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=NILoyalists&gt;{{cite web|title=Loyalist band's actions 'totally inappropriate'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18848591|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sung by fans of Scottish [[association football|football]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] due to rival [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s Irish roots. Set to the tune of ''[[The John B. Sails]]'' popularised by [[Carl Sandburg]], the lyrics of the song make reference to the 1840s'  [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of Ireland. The song is often heard at loyalist marches in [[Northern Ireland]]. ''The Famine Song'' has received criticism due to the racist and sectarian nature of its lyrics and, in some cases, those singing it have received criminal convictions.

==Controversy==
The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in [[Ireland]] during the 1840s led the country's population to fall from approximately 8 million to 5 million as a result of starvation and emigration.&lt;ref name="Edward Laxton"&gt;Edward Laxton, ''The Famine Ships: The Irish Exodus to America 1846–51'', Bloomsbury, 1997, {{ISBN|0-7475-3500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of emigrants moved to North America, large numbers moved to Scotland and England, settling in London, Liverpool and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[sectarianism in Glasgow]] in particular has received much media attention, with its two main football teams being focal points of identity: Celtic drawing large support from the descendants of [[Irish Catholics]], and Rangers from Protestants in [[Scotland]] and [[Ulster]] (chiefly [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]]).

[[Lex Gold]], the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) chief executive at the time, said that football clubs could be deducted points if fans continue to sing such songs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Clubs know they need to be alert and make sure their fans are doing all they can to avoid sectarian or other offensive abuse. The verse of the song that has featured hugely is racist, it's not sectarian as such, it's racist. The rules were structured to help to try to tackle this. You don't start with points deduction. We have a range of sanctions which can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/display.var.2465535.0.gold_ill_dock_points_if_clubs_fail_in_fan_duty.php | title=Gold: I'll dock points if clubs fail in fan duty| work=www.eveningtimes.co.uk | publisher=Evening Times Online |date=November 2008 | accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], Celtic's chairman, tried to highlight the non-Catholic specific aspects of the famine: "Few of those who sing this song will have stopped to think that famine is non-sectarian and the millions of people who died or were forced into mass emigration – some to Scotland – were from all faiths and traditions within Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/celtic/2008/09/29/rangers-famine-song-is-racist-says-john-reid-86908-20759736/ |title= Rangers' Famine Song is racist, says John Reid|work=Daily Record Online|publisher=www.dailyrecord.co.uk|date=September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Republic of Ireland]]'s Consul-General approached the [[Scottish Government]] regarding the song. A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The Scottish Government is totally committed to combating sectarianism and bigotry, which is why we have expanded on the work of the previous administration and are doing more. We are working with the clubs themselves, as they are part of the solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7617518.stm|title=Concerns raised over famine song |work=BBC News|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=6 November 2008 | date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny Scott, Rangers' Head of Security and Operations, said in October 2008 that conversations with the [[Strathclyde Police]] made it clear to the club that there was the potential for supporters singing the song to be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Headlines/0,,5~1436866,00.html |title=Famine Song Statement |work=Rangers Official Club Site – News |publisher=www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk |accessdate=6 November 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, a Rangers fan was found guilty of a breach of the peace (aggravated by religious and racial prejudice) for singing the song during a game in [[Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kilmarnockstandard.co.uk/ayrshire-news/news-east-ayrshire/kilmarnock-news/2008/11/26/rangers-fan-guilty-over-singing-famine-song-at-rugby-park-81430-22348515/ |title=Rangers fan guilty over singing Famine Song at Rugby Park |publisher=Kilmarnock Standard |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his appeal in June 2009, three Scottish judges ruled that the song is racist because it targets people of Irish origin.&lt;ref name=legal&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/103590-court-rules-famine-song-is-racist/|title=Court Rules Famine Song is Racist|work=stv|date=June 2009|accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legal1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8109359.stm|title=Judges brand Famine Song 'racist'|work=BBC|accessdate=7 August 2009 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Rangers fans' organisation, the [[Rangers Supporters' Trust]], denied that the song is racist: It instead described the song as a "wind-up" that is designed to mock not the famine itself, but Celtic fans' perceived affiliations with the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="RST"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rangerssupporterstrust.co.uk/rstsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=43 | title = POSITION STATEMENT ON 'THE FAMINE SONG' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109081442/http://www.rangerssupporterstrust.co.uk/rstsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=43 |date=3 October 2008 |archivedate=9 January 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of their charitable projects in partnership with Rangers, [[UNICEF]] expressed their concern regarding the song and called on the club to ensure it was not sung at their matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unicef: Famine Song banned|first=Stuart|last=MacDonald|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unicef-famine-song-banned-r3ks9zc75kv|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=10 January 2009|access-date=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''William Walls v. the [[Procurator Fiscal]], [[Kilmarnock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2009HCJAC59.html |title=WILLIAM WALLS v.

:''"the song calls upon persons of Irish descent, who are living in Scotland, to go back to the land of their ancestors, namely Ireland [...] they are racist in calling upon people native to Scotland to leave the country because of their racial origins. This is a sentiment which, once more, many persons will find offensive."''

The appellant, who was convicted for [[breach of the peace]] racially aggravated and aggravated by religious prejudice having sung the Famine Song and made a number of other remarks during a football match, had his appeal denied and his conviction upheld.

'''Spins''' are an element in [[figure skating]] where the skater rotates, centered on a single point on the ice, while holding one or more body positions. The skater rotates on the part of the blade just behind the [[toe pick]], with the weight on the ball of the foot. There are many types of spins, identified by the position of the arms, legs, and torso, the foot on which the spin is performed, and the entrance to the spin. A ''combination spin'' is a spin where the skater would connect a spin with another separate spin. Spins are a required element in most [[figure skating competitions]].

==Types of spins==
There are many types of spins, identified by the foot on which the spin is performed, the entrance to the spin, and the position of the arms, legs, and torso. Spins may be performed on either foot. Figure skaters are rarely able to spin in both directions; most favor one or the other. For skaters who rotate in a counterclockwise direction, a spin on the left foot is called a ''forward'' or ''front spin'', while a spin on the right foot is called a ''back spin''. Spins may be entered with a step or a jump. Spins entered with a jump are referred to as ''flying spins''. There are three basic positions, for which many variations exist.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffRecogSpins/&gt; There are five levels of difficulty — Level B to Level 4.&lt;ref name=isu1861/&gt;

===Upright spins===
An '''[[upright spin]]''' is a spin where the skater is in an upright position and their head is in line with their spine. There are many variations on it.

*A '''basic two-foot spin''' is an upright spin in which the skater rotates with both feet on the ice using their arms to swing around and create momentum.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffUpright/&gt;
*A '''basic one-foot spin''' is an upright spin in which the skater rotates with one foot on the ice. Spins can be skated on either foot.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffUpright/&gt;
*A '''scratch spin''' is an upright spin with the free leg crossed in front of the skating leg. The arms and free leg begin in an open position, extended straight out and high. They are pulled in gradually, which accelerates the spin, and the leg is pushed down so that the feet are crossed at the ankles. This spin is performed on a very tight backward inside edge.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffUpright/&gt;
*A '''back scratch''' is similar to the forward scratch spin, only performed on the opposite foot and on a tight backward outside edge. This is usually learned soon after the scratch spin is mastered, and is the basic air position for [[Figure skating jumps|jumping]].&lt;ref name=sk8stuffUpright/&gt;
*A '''crossfoot spin''' is a back upright spin in which the free leg is crossed behind the skating foot, or the front foot on a back upright is lowered and the spin becomes a two-footed spin. When spinning counter-clockwise, the left skate spins forward while the right skate travels backwards.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffUpright/&gt;
*A '''[[layback spin]]''' is an upright spin, usually performed by women, in which the back is arched and head dropped back, the free leg in an [[Glossary of ballet terms#Attitude|attitude]] position, and the arms often stretched to the ceiling. A common variation of this spin is the '''catch foot layback''' or '''haircutter''', in which the skater grabs the free blade and pulls it toward her head while in the layback position.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffLayback/&gt;
*An '''attitude spin''' looks a little bit like a very shallow layback, the skater turns her head and looks to the side, instead of arching and looking up, while the free leg is held in [[Glossary of ballet terms#Attitude|attitude]] position as for a layback spin. The leg position is the feature of this variation. It is often taught as an introductory position while learning a layback.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffLayback/&gt;
*A '''[[Biellmann spin]]''' is a variation of the layback spin and performed by pulling the free leg from behind up and over the head. The blade of the skate may be held with either one or both hands. This requires extreme flexibility in the shoulders, back, hips, and legs. It was popularized by and named after 1981 World Champion [[Denise Biellmann]].&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffBiel/&gt;
*'''"I" spins''' (or '''upright front-grab spins''') are a collection of spins when the skater pulls the free leg up in front of his or her face in a near-vertical angle (depending on the type of grab). {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}
*A '''shotgun spin''' is a variation of the upright front-grab spins in which the free leg is held in a horizontal position.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} This is also known as a spiral spin.
*'''"Y" spins''' are spins in which the free leg is held with the hand and extended to the side in a near-split position. [[Michelle Kwan]] is known for doing this variation consecutively on both feet.  The support can be from either or both arms, and the hold can either be on the skate or the ankle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sit spins===
A '''[[sit spin]]''' is defined as a spin in which the buttocks are not higher than the level of the skating knee. There are many variations on it.

* A basic '''sit spin''' is a spin in which the skater is in a [[shoot the duck]] position where the skating leg bent and the free leg extended forwards.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffSS/&gt;
*A '''broken leg sit spin''' is a sit spin in which the skater's free leg is turned inwards at the hip.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffBLS/&gt;
*The '''corkscrew sit spin''' is a back sit spin in which the skater crosses the free leg behind the skating foot, rather than extending it to the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icoachskating.com/corkscrew-spin-spaghetti-spin-figure-skating-spins-bobbe-shire/|title=Corkscrew Spin, Spaghetti Spin - Figure Skating Spins (Bobbe Shire) {{!}} iCoachSkating|website=icoachskating.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''flying sit spin''' is a sit spin entered from a jump; the skater attains the sit spin position in the air.&lt;ref name=kayFlyingSpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffFlyingSit/&gt;
* A '''pancake spin''' is a difficult variation on a sit spin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/Rule%20Clarifications%2011.08.05.pdf U.S. Figure Skating: Answers to Questions from Conference Call]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the free leg is canted towards the body and upper body is bent over it, forming the illusion of the skater's body as a pancake.
* A '''cannonball spin''' is a difficult variation similar to the pancake in which the free skate touches the thigh of the skating leg and arms are held down and touching the skating leg, giving the illusion of a cannonball.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt; "Cannonball spin" is also commonly used to refer to a sit spin in which the skater holds the ankle of the extended free leg and lowers the chest flat to the thigh of the free leg.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
*A '''death drop''' is a flying spin performed by jumping up with a forward takeoff, kicking the same takeoff leg backwards, and landing in a back sit position.  One of the major differences between a ''death drop'' and a regular ''flying sit spin'' is the position the skater attains in the air, which is almost horizontal to the ice in the death drop. [[Brian Boitano]] was known for his death drop.&lt;ref name=kayFlyingSpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffFlyingSit/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Camel spin===
A camel spin is defined as a spin in which the free leg is held backwards with the knee higher than the hip level. There are many variations on it.

* A basic '''[[camel spin]]''' (also known as a parallel or arabesque spin) is performed by assuming an [[Glossary of ballet terms#A|arabesque]] position (or [[spiral (figure skating)|spiral]] position) with the free leg extended behind at hip level, parallel to the ice surface.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffCamel/&gt;
* A '''flying camel spin''' is a back camel spin from a jump entry.&lt;ref name=kayFlyingSpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffFCS/&gt;
* An '''illusion spin''' has a basic position similar to the camel, but instead of remaining "flat" throughout the duration of the spin the skater's body tilts up and down while the skater is spinning. The up-down cycle should coincide with the rotational speed so that the "low point" is always at the same point on the circle. This causes the spin to create an image that looks like a plate tilted at an angle.&lt;ref name=kaySpins/&gt;&lt;ref name=sk8stuffIllus/&gt;
*A '''doughnut spin''' is a camel spin in which the skater pulls the blade of the skate of the free leg backward with one or both arms while arching the back to create a horizontal circular shape with the body. This is sometimes known as a horizontal [[Biellmann spin|Biellmann]], and some skaters use this to enter the [[Biellmann spin|Biellmann]] position.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gofigureskating.com/skills/spins/DoughnutSpin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''butterfly spin''' is a flying spin with a near-horizontal body position and scissoring leg action in the air similar to that of the death drop, but it has a two-foot, twisting takeoff rather than an Axel-like takeoff. Butterflies can also be done as a solo move, without a spin, or in a series.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Change of edge==
*Forward change-edge spins, where the skater spins on the forward outside edge when in a forward spin rather than the normal backward inside edge.  This is not a change of position, but a "difficult variation" which garners supplementary points in the [[ISU Judging System]].  This is most commonly seen as a camel on a forward outside edge.
*Backward change-edge spins, where the skater goes on the forward inside edge when in a backward spin rather than the normal backward outside edge.  This is not a change of position, but a "difficult variation" which garners supplementary points in the [[ISU Judging System]]. This is commonly seen in all of sit, camel, and upright positions.

==Combination spins==
Spin positions performed in immediate succession without checking out of the spin are referred to as combination spins. In a combination spin, a skater may change position, change foot, change edge, or any combination of the above. Combination spins are delineated with the abbreviation '''CoSp''' in ISU Judging system protocols.

==Pair skating and ice dance==
In [[pair skating]], skaters perform ''pair spins'' and ''side-by-side spins''. In side-by-side spins, the skaters perform the same solo spin next to each other on the ice. Pairs sometimes shout auditory cues to their partner in order to maintain and adjust their timing.&lt;ref name=in120615/&gt; In pair spins, the skaters hold onto each other and rotate together, but may be in different positions.

In [[ice dancing]], skaters perform ''dance spins'', which are similar to pair spins. They do not perform side-by-side spins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Finnish pesäpallo match-fixing scandal''' was a [[match fixing]] scandal in [[Finland]] that involved a large number of players, managers and other team officials of the [[pesäpallo]] (the Finnish form of [[baseball]]) league [[Superpesis]].

== The scam ==
On 11 and 13 August 1998 players and managers of eight teams fixed five different matches. All games were on the [[Fixed-odds betting|betting list]] of Finnish national betting agency [[Veikkaus]]. Matches were of two last rounds on the Superpesis regular season and they were meaningless for the teams. Four matches out of five ended on a high [[odds]] [[Tie (draw)|draw]] after two periods.&lt;ref name=ts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ts.fi/urheilu/1074087892/Sopupeleista+tuomiot+34+ihmiselle |title= Sopupeleistä tuomiot 34 ihmiselle |publisher=Turun Sanomat |date=December 13, 2005 | language = Finnish |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scam was unveiled a year later. Finnish police interrogated 460 persons involving the scandal. Most of them were never accused due to lack of evidence or for the reason that they were only lucky gamblers who had a hint on the results of meaningless games. Over 30 people were sentenced to [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or [[Discharge (sentence)|discharged]]. They caused Veikkaus losses of at least 14 million [[Finnish markka|Finnish marks]] (2,3 million [[euro]]s).&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/tulosta/1135249027230 |title= Paras peli meille suomalaisille |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat |date=September 3, 2009 | language = Finnish |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
All teams involved were relegated two levels down in the league system and Veikkaus decided to ban all betting on pesäpallo matches for six years. The agency started taking bets again in 2005. Betting on a draw was not allowed until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/urheilu/artikkeli/Tasapeli%C3%A4kin+voi+veikata+taas+pitk%C3%A4vedon+pesiskohteissa/1135245715009 |title= Tasapeliäkin voi veikata taas pitkävedon pesiskohteissa |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat |date=May 5, 2009 | language = Finnish |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish pesäpallo association lost a part of its state financing.

The common interest on pesäpallo, which is considered to be the [[National sport|national game]] of Finland, was decreasing for many years. However, in last few years the game has managed to increase its popularity among Finnish sports spectators.

The '''KFC Yum! Center'''&lt;ref name="CJ_041910"/&gt; is a multi-purpose [[sports arena]] in Downtown [[Louisville, Kentucky]], United States. It is named after the [[KFC]] restaurant chain and [[Yum! Brands]], the parent company of KFC. Adjacent to the [[Ohio River]] waterfront, it is located on Main Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets and opened on October 10, 2010.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hotel Removed From Arena Plan|first=Marcus|last=Green|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070522/NEWS01/705220407/1008|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=May 22, 2007|accessdate=May 22, 2007|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJ_042707"&gt;{{cite news |title=First Look Inside the Arena|first=Marcus|last=Green|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070424/NEWS01/704240412/1008|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=April 27, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2008|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is part of a $450 million project that includes a 975-car parking structure and floodwall.

The [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals men's]] and [[Louisville Cardinals women's basketball|women's]] basketball teams from the [[University of Louisville]] are the primary tenants of the arena complex.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; The U of L women's volleyball team began using the arena as a part-time home in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Volleyball Opens BIG EAST Play at KFC Yum!

Since its opening, the KFC Yum! Center has been a frequent spot for major concerts, as it is one of the larger arenas between [[Cleveland]] and [[Chicago]].

==History==
{{Update section|date=September 2015}}
Early arena planning focused on two potential arena sites: one owned by the [[Louisville Water Company]] bounded by Liberty Street, Muhammad Ali Blvd, 2nd and 3rd Streets, and one owned by [[Louisville Gas &amp; Electric]] (LG&amp;E) on the waterfront between 2nd and 3rd Streets on Main.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study Says Water Co. Arena Site Would Cost Less Than LG&amp;E Site|url=http://louisville.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2006/02/20/daily27.html|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Business First of Louisville]]|date=February 24, 2006|accessdate=February 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, [[University of Louisville]] [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|men's basketball]] coach [[Rick Pitino]] stated he would not coach in an arena built at the water company site.&lt;ref name="WHAS_030306"&gt;{{cite news |last=Platt |first=Rachel |title=Pitino: Cards won't play at Water Company site|url=http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/WHAS11_TOP_PitinoArenaComments.80ab1e10.html|publisher=[[WHAS-TV|WHAS]]|location=Louisville|date=March 3, 2006|accessdate=March 3, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014404/http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/WHAS11_TOP_PitinoArenaComments.80ab1e10.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came at a time when the House budget committee earmarked funding for the arena only if it was built at the water company site. Others, including [[Papa John's Pizza]] founder [[John Schnatter]], a major donor to the U of L athletic program, criticized the LG&amp;E location due to its higher cost.

On March 10, 2006, [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Ernie Fletcher]] announced at a Louisville Arena Unity Rally that the location of the new arena would be at the LG&amp;E site along the riverfront to maximize profits.&lt;ref name="WAVE_031006"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fletcher: 'Arena Will Be Built At Riverfront Site; End Of Story'|url=http://www.wave3.com/Global/story.asp?S=4581995|work=[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]]|location=Louisville|date=March 10, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2006}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected visit was supported by Louisville Mayor [[Jerry Abramson]].

One month later on April 23, 2006, the Louisville Arena Authority released the design for the interior.&lt;ref name="CJ_042707"/&gt; The number of seats increased from the original 19,000 to 22,000; it would be divided up between 11,348 seats in the lower bowl, with the remainder on the upper tier. The seat width also increased from 19 to 20&amp;nbsp;inches. Also included in the release was a proposed sports bar that would be located on the main concourse; it would be open year-round and have views of the Ohio River. The number of suites would increase to 72 that would be located on two levels between the main and upper concourses; they would be twice as large as those in [[Freedom Hall]]. A public plaza and concourse along Main Street was also revealed.&lt;ref name="CJ_042707"/&gt;

Prior to the release of the design, an arena report urged the facility to incorporate energy-saving elements into the construction.&lt;ref name="CJ_030807"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arena Report Urges Energy-Saving Features|first=Marcus|last=Green|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070308/NEWS01/703080462|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=March 8, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2007|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations included the avoidance of large, blank walls, the inclusion of public art, and the provision of year-round uses inside the building.

On May 21, 2007, the Louisville Arena Authority voted unanimously to remove a hotel from the arena project.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; The 425-room hotel, which was envisioned as one way to pay off the project, was deleted because other revenues to cover the $252 million construction cost were projected to be higher than expected. The hotel would have also taken land away from a public plaza along Main Street. The Greater Louisville Hotel and Lodging Association also supported the measure, stating that downtown Louisville had enough projected rooms.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt;

The hotel was expected to contribute $1.3 million in annual lease payments, but other sources of revenue were hoped to cover the $573 million in total debt over 30 years on a $339 million bond issue for the arena. Originally, the Kentucky Finance Cabinet projected $211 million in new tax revenues in 2005.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; A more recent and comprehensive survey was completed recently and the projected revenue increased to $265 million. The other sources of revenue to cover the deletion of the hotel include,&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt;
* $265 million from a tax-increment financing district
* The city's pledge of $206 million minimum
* $179 million from interior advertising
* $84 million facility fee
* $63 million in luxury suite revenues
* $37 million in building naming rights

The removal of the hotel would allow for a wider Main Street plaza and would allow for new features, such as a Washington Street entrance.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; It would also allow for more design flexibility and would lend itself to host after-hour concerts and other events on the plaza.

On April 19, 2010, it was announced that Louisville-based fast food chain [[Yum! Brands]] would pay $13.5 million for the naming rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yum! Brands Gets Arena Naming Rights|url=http://www.whas.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=283307&amp;article=7012698|work=[[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]]|location=Louisville|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would sell the products of three of its chains—[[KFC]], [[Pizza Hut]] and [[Taco Bell]]—in seven concession stands within the arena.&lt;ref name="CJ_041910"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yum! to Pay $13.5 Million to Name Downtown Arena|first=Marcus|last=Green|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20100419/SPORTS02/4190326/1028/rss0702|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}
The arena's features include an integrated scoring and video display system, which includes large LED video displays within the seating bowl, with the display and control system provided by [[Daktronics]] of [[Brookings, South Dakota]].

==Financing==
[[File:Louisville waterfront arena cropped.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The arena seen from the [[Ohio River]], with [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge|Clark Memorial Bridge]] to the left.]]
As a result of the subtracted hotel and the revised projected revenues, the arena, which would have lost $123,000 a year originally, might turn a small profit.&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; The arena would generate $9.2 million a year in rent, merchandise, concessions and other revenues, along with funds from a $2 ticket tax on every [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville men's basketball]] game during the first 30 years of the arena's operation. The arena would spend just under $9 million a year, generating an annual profit of $196,000.

Another reason for the revised operating expenses is the reimbursement fee that the Louisville Arena Authority must pay to the Kentucky State Fair Board for the arena's impact on [[Freedom Hall]].&lt;ref name="CJ_052207"/&gt; The decrease in revenues, from $1.3 million to $738,000 during the first 10 years of operations of the new arena, is the result of a revision taking into account fewer events for the center.

On May 28, 2007, it was announced that the [[Louisville Metro Council]] will propose an arena-financing deal that would save city taxpayers $3.4 million/year, or $100 million over three decades.&lt;ref name="CJ_052807"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal Offers Protections on Arena Financing|first1=Marcus|last1=Green|first2=Dan|last2=Klepal|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070528/NEWS01/705280414/1008|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=May 28, 2007|accessdate=May 28, 2007|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, required the arena officials to exhaust other revenue sources, such as naming rights and luxury suite sales, before asking the metro government to pay more than its minimum pledge. The minimum pledge is $206 million towards the construction of the arena in annual installments between 2010 and 2039. Under the deal, the Louisville Arena Authority can ask the local government for up to $3.5 million more a year to cover the debt only if at least five other sources are drained. If the Louisville Arena Authority has to use additional city funds for two straight years, the Louisville Metro Council has the right to audit the arena's revenues.

The financing agreement allowed $339 million in bonds through the state of Kentucky's Economic Development Finance Authority to be issued to construct the $252 million arena.&lt;ref name="CJ_052807"/&gt; The total debt on the bonds, $573 million over 30 years, will be paid through several sources. These include the city's $206 million commitment, $265 million from a tax-increment financing district, $179 million from advertising rights inside the arena, $63 million from luxury box sales, and at least $37 million in arena naming rights. The tax-increment financing district will allow part of the anticipated growth in state taxes to help pay for the arena. The arena's share of that revenue is capped at $265 million, although the project will be able to use the excess revenues to pay down the debt. It is expected to generate $574 million over 20 years.

In September 2008, financing was completed for the new waterfront arena.

==Construction==
[[Image:Picture 2146LouisvilleArena.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The arena construction site in March 2010]]
On May 3, 2007, construction began on a new electrical substation for [[Downtown Louisville]].&lt;ref name="CJ_050307"&gt;{{cite news |title=Electrical Work First Sign of Planned Arena|first=Sheldon S.|last=Shafer|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070503/NEWS01/705030394/1008|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2007|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous substation, located on the block of River Road, Main, 2nd and 3rd Streets, was relocated across the street at 3rd and River Road. The new substation, projected to cost $63 million, was completed in October 2008, at which time the land that housed the old substation was transferred to the Louisville Arena Authority for construction of the new arena. Work started on the new arena in November 2008. The complex was officially completed on October 10, 2010.

In June 2010, Gov. Steve Beshear and Mayor Jerry Abramson announced a new $3 million streetscape improvement project directly underneath the Clark Memorial Bridge, a three-block area from Main Street to River Road, which will be transformed into a plaza. This includes a new decorative lighting system under the refurbished Clark Memorial Bridge, wide sidewalks, seats, new pedestrian and festival areas, and extensive plantings, making this an inviting promenade for the new KFC YUM! Center. The project will be completed in time for the October 2010 opening of the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Street Transformation to Occur Near Arena |url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2010/TransformationonSecondStreettoTakePlace.htm |publisher=City of Louisville |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609174515/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2010/TransformationonSecondStreettoTakePlace.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the glassed-in [[skywalk]] system, called Louie Link, was extended across 3rd Street from the new $16 million Skywalk Garage, an eight-level, 860-space parking facility on 3rd Street, to the new KFC Yum! Center.

==Controversy==
The Task Force meetings were not without controversy. At first, task force member and [[University of Louisville]] athletics director [[Tom Jurich]], along with University of Louisville president [[James R. Ramsey|James Ramsey]] and Task Force member [[John Schnatter]] (founder of [[Papa John's Pizza]]), were ardently opposed to a downtown site and supported instead a campus arena, or a new arena built near Freedom Hall at the [[Kentucky Exposition Center]]. Jurich and Ramsey would later support the waterfront site. Schnatter, joined by fellow task force member and [[Humana]] co-founder [[David Jones (businessman)|David Jones]], strongly supported a new arena at the water company site, located four blocks down 2nd Street, or the Exposition Center, which was the cheapest option. They paid over $200,000 for a study that showed the water company site would be much less expensive than the riverfront site. However, the two dropped their lobbying effort after it did not seem to change the minds of the rest of the task force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Give in on Arena Site|first=Sheldon S.|last=Shafer|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/doc/241398601.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+23%2C+2006&amp;author=&amp;pub=Courier+-+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Two+give+in+on+arena+site|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|location=Louisville|date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=March 21, 2015|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final site recommendation vote, Schnatter was the only one to vote against the waterfront site.

The '''loop jump''' is a [[figure skating jump]] that takes off from a back outside edge and lands on the same backwards outside edge.  For a jump with counterclockwise rotation, this is the right back outside edge.  It is named from its similarity to the loop [[compulsory figures|compulsory figure]]. The invention is widely credited to [[Werner Rittberger]], and the jump is also known as the "Rittberger" in [[Europe]]. However, evidence exists that it may have been first done as early as the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;''Figure Skating: Championship Techniques'' by [[John Misha Petkevich]]. [[Sports Illustrated]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loop technique ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LoopEntry.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Entry to a triple loop jump, showing the cross-legged position and strong shoulder check (top) and release of the check (bottom). {{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 4 October 2009}}]] --&gt;
[[File:Marissa Castelli &amp; Simon Shnapir 2LoTh 2009 Junior Worlds.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to a throw double loop jump.]]

To do a loop jump, a skater typically does a [[3 turn]] or [[mohawk turn]] onto a left back inside edge, then reaches into the circle on the right back outside edge while drawing the left foot (still on the ice) to cross in front of the right.  The knees are deeply bent, so that it sometimes appears that the skater is almost in a sitting position.  On the approach edge, the rotation is strongly checked with the shoulders facing into the circle.  At takeoff, the skater lifts the left leg while simultaneously pushing off with the right; the rotational momentum for the jump comes from releasing the check of the shoulders and pressure on the edge, rather than by swinging the arms or free leg.  The skater maintains the cross-legged position, known as a ''back spin position'', in the air before landing after one or more rotations.  Some skaters use a controversial two-footed takeoff technique where both feet are used to gain more spring, similar to one used for the [[Salchow jump]].

==Loop history==
The loop can also be done as a double, triple, or quadruple, with two, three, or four rotations, respectively.  [[Dick Button]] performed the first triple loop jump at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. The first female skater known to be able to perform a triple loop was [[Gaby Seyfert]] in 1968. [[Yuzuru Hanyu]] (JPN) became the first skater in history to successfully land a quadruple loop in competition at the 2016 [[Autumn Classic International]].

Since the loop takes off the edge that is used as the landing edge for most jumps, it is often seen as the second element of a jump combination.  In this case, it is necessary for the skater to keep the free leg (the left leg for a counterclockwise rotator) and the same shoulder forward on the landing of the preceding jump, instead of bringing it backward in the normal check-out or for a [[toe loop jump]].  The timing for loop-based combinations is thus much quicker than toe-loop-based combinations.

[[Éric Millot]] of [[France]] was the first skater to perform a triple loop/triple loop combination, in 1996.  In the years since, doing triple loops in combination has become considered somewhat hazardous, since a number of skaters including [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Olympic]] champion [[Tara Lipinski]] have suffered serious [[hip (anatomy)|hip]] injuries from practicing them.

== Loop variants ==

A related jump in figure skating is the [[Euler jump]] (or ''half loop'').  In spite of its name, it is a full rotation jump.  It differs from a regular loop jump in that it is landed on the opposite foot, on a backward inside edge.  Eulers are only done as single jumps and are primarily used as connecting elements in a jump sequence, before a [[salchow jump]] or [[flip jump]] which take off from a back inside edge.  The Euler is normally taught to figure skaters after they are able to land their regular loop jump.  This jump is also known as the ''Thoren'' (after [[Per Thorén]]), or very commonly, the ''Half Loop''.

The true half-rotation jump with a loop entrance, landed forward (on the left toe pick and right forward inside edge, for a counterclockwise jump), is called a ''falling leaf''.  This jump can be performed with a split position at the peak of the jump, which is called a ''split falling leaf'' (see [[split jump]]).

The loop jump should not be confused with the [[toe loop jump]], which has significantly different mechanics and technique.

'''Peace and Sport''', "L’Organisation pour la Paix par le Sport” is a neutral and independent organization based in the Principality of [[Monaco]] and under the patronage of [[Prince Albert II of Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-monaco.com/news/monaco/item/8522-place-royale-s-a-s-le-prince-albert-ii-a-marche-pour-la-paix|title=Place Royale : S.A.S. Le Prince Albert II a marché pour la Paix|last=Hermann|first=Franck|website=www.radio-monaco.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace and Sport works in areas across the world where communities have become estranged from one another and where traditional policies have failed to establish dialogue, with the goal of restoring peaceful relations. Its objective is to bring the structuring values of sport to the heart of communities and individuals in crisis throughout the world.

The organization puts [[sport]] and its values at the heart of local development projects conducted within communities in crisis around the world. Exercising its missions in post-conflict zones, areas of [[extreme poverty]] or lacking [[group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], Peace and Sport makes sport a vehicle for tolerance, respect, sharing and citizenship.

== Field actions ==
Since its creation, Peace and Sport has developped 12 field programs in 13 countries. The organisation works with local project leaders (governments, NGOs, National Olympic Committees and sports federations) in areas affected by extreme poverty, the consequences of conflicts and an absence of social cohesion. This partnership enables the development of programs that use sport and its educational and structural values to tackle various social issues within communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportbuzzbusiness.fr/interview-joel-bouzou-president-de-peace-and-sport.html|title=Interview : Joël Bouzou, Président de Peace and Sport - SportBuzzBusiness.fr|date=2017-12-21|work=SportBuzzBusiness.fr|access-date=2018-11-29|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Peace and Sport 4 field actions are located in 3 major regions : the [[African Great Lakes]] region, Za'atari Refugee Camp in [[Jordan]] and [[France]]. Those 4 field actions are:

# The Friendship Games is an annual multisport event with peacebuilding activities that gathers youngsters from Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediaspaixsport.org/peace-and-sport-organise-les-jeux-de-lamitie-a-bujumbura-du-11-au-13-aout-2017/|title=Peace and Sport organise les Jeux de l’Amitié à Bujumbura du 11 au 13 Août 2017 {{!}} Médias Paix Sport|date=2017-06-27|work=Médias Paix Sport|access-date=2018-11-29|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The “Live Together” program takes place in Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan. It aims at creating social cohesion through sport among refugees of different ages and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hellomonaco.com/news/peace-and-sport-launch-live-together-program-in-refugee-camp/|title=Peace and Sport launch "Live Together" program in refugee camp|date=2017-07-31|work=HelloMonaco|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The "Sports Workshops" uses sport as a social link creator to make it a vector for integration and professional integration on the French territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2018/02/19/2745144-l-insertion-avec-peace-and-sport.html|title=L'insertion avec Peace and Sport|work=ladepeche.fr|access-date=2018-11-29|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The "African Great Lakes" program supports with the involvement of National Olympic Committees, international sport federations, local authorities and Champions for Peace, 6 training centers through sport and peacebuilding activities.

=== The "Act For What Matters" programs ===
In 2016, Peace and Sport launched a global program called “Act for What Matters”. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://osimonaco.org/peace-and-sport-lance-act-for-what-matters/|title=Peace and Sport lance « Act for What Matters »|date=2016-06-09|work=OSI Monaco|access-date=2018-11-29|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is a call for project to partner with 8 NGOs active on every continent in the field of peace building through Sport. Its goal is to develop bonds between International Federations, NGOs, NOCs and local authorities, building capacity of the educators on the ground, helping them to maintain and develop sustainable Sport for Peace programs.

=== "Sport Simple" solutions ===
Peace and Sport created an "Sport simple" manual. Sport Simple activities are sporting activity whose practice area, equipment and rules are adapted
to the environment in which it is carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hellomonaco.com/news/interviews-2/joel-bouzou-how-sport-can-heal-the-world/|title=Joel Bouzou: how sport can heal the world|date=2017-11-30|work=HelloMonaco|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the sport easier to play and facilitates its use as a tool to promote and strengthen sustainable peace. 

For example, [[World Rugby]] recognizes and promotes “touch rugby”, an adapted version of “traditional” rugby. Touch rugby is based on adapted rules and principles that allow participants to play rugby without having to partake in contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://laws.worldrugby.org/?domain=7&amp;modified_form=1|title=World Rugby Laws - World Rugby's Law Education Web Site|website=laws.worldrugby.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Champions for Peace ==
[[File:ChampionsforPeacephotogroup.jpg|thumb|Champions for Peace la Paix during Peace and Sport International Forum in 2017]]
The Champions for Peace are high-level international athletes who want to support the most disadvantaged communities through sport. These athletes are gathered in the club of Champions for Peace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brunosroka.com/2009/11/bruno-sroka-peace-and-sport-monaco-prince-albert-fondation/|title=PEACE AND SPORT : LANCEMENT DES CHAMPIONS DE LA PAIX A MONACO {{!}} Bruno SROKA|website=www.brunosroka.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It allows the champions to have a structure of action and common expression in favor of sports projects in the service of peace and social and human development.

These athletes use their notoriety, their skills and their means in the service of projects for the development of peace through sport.
The latest athlete becoming Champion for Peace was [[Juventus Football Club|Juventus]] player [[Blaise Matuidi]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportmag.fr/football/blaise-matuidi-devient-champion-de-la-paix/|title=Blaise Matuidi devient Champion de la paix|website=www.sportmag.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Forum ===
[[File:DidierDrogbavvv.jpg|thumb|Didier Drogba during Peace and Sport international forum in 2017]]
Peace and Sport International Forum is an annual event taking place in [[Monaco]].
It brings together people key-decision makers including Heads of State and Ministers, sport governing bodies, high-level athletes, international organizations, NGOs and Academia, and Champions for Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sortiesmediapresse.com/forum-international-peace-and-sport/|title=FORUM INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SPORT|date=2015-12-19|website=Sorties Média Presse|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It aims at identifying new solutions to solve international issue through sport.
[[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Didier Drogba]] or [[Christian Karembeu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Des intervenants de haut-vol attendus au Forum Régional Peace and Sport à Rhodes {{!}} Francs Jeux|url=http://www.francsjeux.com/communiques/2018/10/11/des-intervenants-de-haut-vol-attendus-au-forum-regional-peace-and-sport-a-rhodes/47141|website=www.francsjeux.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one the well-known speakers during this event.

Since 2017, Peace and Sport has organized a biennial regional forum to highlight local peace-through-sport initiatives. The first edition took place in Rhodes, [[Greece]] on October 18th 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace and Sport présente son Forum régional en Grèce {{!}} Francs Jeux|url=http://www.francsjeux.com/communiques/2018/07/24/peace-and-sport-presente-son-forum-region-en-grece/45019|website=www.francsjeux.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-organized with the [[South Aegean|South Aegean region]].

=== The Awards ===
Launched in 2008, the Peace and Sport Awards put the spotlight on initiatives and individuals who have particularly contributed to peace and social stability in the world.

The Awards reward the expertise of various stakeholders working for sustainable peace through sport, through initiatives promoting the best practices in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-news.it/mondo-inter/inter-campus-massimo-moratti-ritira-il-peace-and-sport-awards/|title=Inter Campus: Massimo Moratti ritira il Peace and Sport Awards|date=2015-11-27|website=Inter-News|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the previous laureates, we find [[Blaise Matuidi]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)]], [[FIFA]] or [[International Judo Federation]].


== International Day of Sport for Development and Peace ==
=== April6 web platform ===
[[File:April6-PAS-logo-rvb.jpg|thumb|right]]

'''At the UN headquarters in New York, on 23 August 2013''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/sport/home/unplayers/unoffice/idsdp|title=United Nations Sport for Development and Peace - International Day of Sport for Development and Peace|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN General Assembly declared 6 April as the '''International Day of Sport for Development and Peace (IDSDP)''' – a decision that represented a historic step in recognizing the transformative power of sport and its great potential in advancing positive social change.

This day is commemorated globally each year by international, regional, national sport and development organizations to honour the role that sport plays in society, whether by encouraging healthier lifestyles, making sport more widely accessible or using it as a vehicle for development in areas made vulnerable by conflict, poverty and inequality.

Peace and Sport has developed a web platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1036110/joel-bouzou-time-for-transformative-actions-as-april-6-is-approaching|title=Joël Bouzou: Time for transformative actions as April 6 is approaching|website=www.insidethegames.biz|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; for expression and promotion aimed at highlighting the initiatives led to celebrate 6 April.

In 3 editions, Peace and Sport and its platform has promoted 840 projects in over 170 countries.

=== Campaign #WhiteCard ===
&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;WhiteCard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francsjeux.com/communiques/2016/04/01/25991/25991|title=Peace and Sport en force pour la journée du 6 avril {{!}} Francs Jeux|website=www.francsjeux.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; operation highlights the actors of the peace through sport movement, and to provide an opportunity for all those who believe in the power of sport to change the world, to rally their support around a symbolic gesture.

Everyone can get involved easily: participants just have to take a 'selfie' or a group photo holding up a white card, just like a referee on a playing field. They then post the #WhiteCard photo on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.


== Significant Actions ==

=== Rapprochement between North Korea and South Korea ===
[[File:Thumbnail White Card group photo-2.jpg|thumb|Joint North-South Korea women‘s hockey team at Winter Olympics 2018]]
In 2017, Peace and Sport in cooperation with the [[International Ice Hockey Federation|International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)]] and the 2018 PyeongChang Organizing Committee unified players from the two countries for a photo during  the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey Women’s World Championship Division II Group A in Gangneung. Athletes posed on the ice, holding up a #WhiteCard, the symbol of the sport-for-development-and-peace movement.

In 2018, a new step forward is acheived : Peace and Sport and the IIHF united the joint North-South Korea women‘s hockey team for a symbolic photo during the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/sports/north-south-korea-olympics-hockey.html|title=A Tricky Reunion on the Ice for North and South Korean Hockey|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== UNFP / Peace and Sport Trophy ===
In 2015, the first UNFP / Peace and Sport trophy (French National Union of Professional Soccer) was awarded to the campaign "Soyons fiers de nos différences" (Be proud of our differences) led in [[Ligue 1]] and [[Ligue 2]] on the initiative of the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel|Ligue de football professionnel]] and the Panamboyz United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panamboyz.fr/on-a-gagne-le-prix-unfp-peace-and-sport-2015/|title=On a gagné le prix UNFP Peace and Sport 2015 ! - Panamboyz United|date=2015-05-18|website=Panamboyz United|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peace and Sport Documentary Prize at Sportel Awards Ceremony ===
During the Sportel Awards Ceremony, Peace and Sport rewards a filmmaker who, through a video clip or a movie, emphasizes the positive role of sport in peace promotion with the Peace and Sport Documentary Prize.

The '''Asociación Peruana de Cricket''' or '''Cricket Peru''' is the official [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of the sport of [[cricket]] in [[Peru]]. Cricket Peru is Peru's representative at the [[International Cricket Council]] and is an affiliate member and has been a member of that body since 2007. It is included in the [[ICC Americas]] region.

Cricket has been played in Peru for over 150 years, at the splendid [[Lima Cricket &amp; Football Club]] (LCFC), and is now undergoing resurgence as a recently admitted Affiliate Member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) and a founder member of [[Cricket South America]] (CSA), along with Argentina, Brazil and Chile.

==Domestic Cricket==

Peru traditionally held an 8- to 10-week season at the LCFC from February until Easter. Most of the fixtures were friendlies, and the most important regular matches on the calendar were traditionally the British Ambassador’s XI vs President of the LCFC XI and Asia vs Rest of the World. The latter is still hotly contested, while the former has been developed into a one-day cricket carnival, The Ambassador's Cup, featuring teams - and ambassadors - representing Australia, India, South Africa and UK.

The Easter holiday, which was traditionally a time for overseas touring teams to visit Lima, is now set aside for the South American Championship (SAC), a non-official, annual tournament between teams representing CSA members i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru, as well as invited national teams. 2014 saw the 11th staging of this tournament, with Lima hosting.

The advantage of playing cricket in Lima is that play is never lost to rain!

In November 2006, a uniquely Peruvian cricket form, Cricket Veloz, was introduced to the cricketing calendar, and the Cricket Veloz Trophy has been hotly contested every year since. Originally designed as a four-team, indoor tournament, in 2009 it was rebranded as an outdoor 6-a-side festival, with great success, fitting nicely into the 150th Anniversary celebrations of the LCFC.

==National Twenty20 Championship==

In 2007, the Peruvian National T20 Championship was inaugurated, with all games being played at LCFC.

The four founding teams were:
1) The Kiteflyers: the cricketing arm of a multinational local football team - with a British core - founded in 1981.

2) Eidgenossen: a team made up mainly of teachers from local British schools
Eidgenossenschaft is a German word meaning confederation. The term literally translates as "oath fellowship". An Eidgenossenschaft is a confederacy of equal partners, which can be individuals or groups such as states, formed by a pact sealed by a solemn oath. Such an alliance could be either time-limited or unlimited (or "eternal"). An important characteristic is that the partners were always considered equal, in contrast to the oath of fealty in feudal societies with their strict hierarchies. As a political term, it is used most often as a synonym for Switzerland, whose official German name is "Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft", usually translated as Swiss Confederation. An Eidgenosse is a member of an Eidgenossenschaft, and is an expression for "Swiss citizen".

3) Chak De: a team made up of Peruvian residents from the Indian subcontinent. 
‘Chak De’ means ‘let’s go’ in Punjabi.

4) LCFC: members and invited players from the Lima Cricket and Football Club

Originally, the T20 Championship was played over three Sundays, with each team playing the others once. But with the success of the format, and the addition of a fifth team, Lima Indians in 2013, the competition has now been expanded into two stages - the Apertura and the Clausura - lasting for 10 weeks of the season. Accordingly, the start of the season has been moved forward to early January.

Tacna, in the south of Peru, in the late 1990s and early 2000s had a sizable Pakistani population, many of whom were involved in the importation of second-hand cars; and from this community they were able to create a team, the Tacna Tigers, which annually visited Lima to play cricket, and provided a number of players for the national side. However, changes to the free trade zone regulations governing business in Tacna, from 2011 onwards, saw the Pakistani cricket community dwindle in size.

==International Cricket==

Cricket Peru's men's team are known as the 'Llamas', and have competed in international competitions since 1997, usually against other Latin American national sides.

==ICC Americas Division III==

The Llamas competed three times in the ICC Americas Division III, an officially sanctioned ranking tournament, overseen by the International Cricket Council that offered a pathway to World League Cricket and potentially to playing in the World Cup.

1. Buenos Aires, Argentina: 12 – 16 Feb, 2008:

This was a 50-over tournament, played at different venues in Buenos Aires, featuring 5 teams - Belize, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands - that had a stunning climax with three teams in a position to win the tournament before the final ball of the tournament. The eventual winners were the Turks and Caicos Islands, who were promoted to Division II.

Second place went to Chile on account of their lower net run rate. Belize finished third.

Peru, captained by Harry Hildebrand, lost their first three games, but on the last day of the tournament, pulled off an upset by defeating Brazil, thereby securing fourth place, with Brazil in 5th.

2. Santiago, Chile: 9 - 12 Oct, 2009:

Again this was a 50-over tournament, played at Craighouse in Santiago, Chile, with only 4 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru. The Llamas, under the captaincy of Miles Buesst, lost all their games to finish fourth, but came close to defeating eventual champions, Brazil, in their final match, falling 17 short chasing 253.

3. San Jose, Costa Rica: 14–18 March 2011

The format of this tournament was changed to T20, and featured 6 teams: Belize, Brazil, Chile, hosts Costa Rica, Falkand Islands and Peru, playing at Los Reyes Polo Club on the outskirts of San Jose. The shorter format suited the Llamas' style of play, and Peru, captained by Miles Buesst (and Mike Soulsby, for one match) enjoyed their most successful international tournament to date, with a record of four wins out of five, and a highly creditable 2nd-place finish. The only loss was to the eventual undefeated champions, Belize, on the first morning.

Success was based on a disciplined bowling unit of Miles Buesst, Nadeem Ahmed, Javed Iqbal, Tony Sanford and Dinesh Ekanayake, taking advantage of the low bounce of the wickets, and a large, slow outfield, backed up by good fielding, to starve batsmen of runs and force them into errors. Runs were at a premium on the two pitches used, and so batsmen had to be patient and correct to weather the initial storm of the opposition’s top bowlers, before making hay against the lesser bowlers. This approach was typified by Mike Soulsby’s masterly half century, off 63 balls, against Chile, that won him the Man of the Match award.

Seemingly low T20 scores of under a hundred against Chile and Costa Rica were easily defended, and even the free-scoring Belizean batsmen took 14 overs to score 65, losing 6 wickets along the way, and indicating that the ball would dominate the bat for most of the Championship.
This was certainly the case against Mexico, who batting first, were rolled over for 49; and then the Falkland Islands were dismissed for 22, the lowest score of the tournament, as some of Peru’s second-string bowlers came to the fore.

==South American Championship==

Sadly, in 2012, ICC policy changed, with the focus shifting away from High Performance Cricket to increasing Participation Numbers. This decision was driven by an economic imperative.

The ramifications for Cricket Peru were that there would no longer be any ICC-sponsored international cricket. Solace could be found in the fact that the Llamas had been participating in the bi-annual South American Championships (SAC) since 1995.

In the wake of the ICC decision to scrap the ICC Americas Div III tournament, it was decided to make the SAC an annual T20 Easter championship, with the hosting rotating between the four members of Cricket South America.

In April 2014, it was the turn of Cricket Peru to host SAC XI. For the first time, Mexico were invited to join the tournament, which they did with great enthusiasm - so much so that they actually won the tournament, defeating Chile in the final, thereby taking the trophy out of South America for the first time!

Chile had won three games out of four leading up to the Final, but Brazil, Mexico and Peru had all won two games each; and so qualification to face Chile came down to wickets lost.

==Central American Championship==

After the success of the expanded 2014 South American Championships in Lima, Cricket Panama were inspired to invite additional teams to their March 2015 Central American Championship (CAC) in Panama City. The invitees that accepted were Peru, Brazil and M.C.C, who took their place alongside regulars Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador and, of course, Panama.

Another of the CAC regulars, Belize, pulled out at the eleventh hour, and their place was taken by a Panama A side, to keep the number of teams at eight, divided into two groups of four, playing T20 games.

The Llamas first match, on March 17, was against the M.C.C, who had just been on the wrong end of a hard-fought series in Suriname, and were in no mood to be generous. Featuring a number of County players and ex-players, they racked up an imposing 200 for 8 off their 20 overs. Peru, batting second, were never in the hunt and faltered to 79, for a chastening loss.

The next game was against old sparring partners, Brazil, on March 18. Again Peru bowled first and did well to keep the Brazil score down to 141 for 8. The reply started well, with Hallett, Soulsby and Myers all making quick runs, but after a mid-innings stutter, the run rate started to climb alarmingly. Some good late innings clubbing, and hard running, from man-of-the-match Buesst (35*) and Chaplin (5*), saw Peru home with 3 balls to spare, for a famous 5-wicket victory.

The last group game was against Panama A on the morning of March 19. Batting first, Peru racked up 147 for 9 off their 20 overs, with Soulsby (39), Buesst (35) and Myers (29) the main contributors. In a mirror image of the game the day before, the Panama A reply got off to a fast start and then faltered in the middle overs, as they lost wickets and the run rate increased. However, they got over the line with 3 balls to spare, and 5 wickets in hand, thanks to some good death batting.

The upshot of these group games was that Peru came third in the group, thereby missing out on progressing to the semi-final stage. They were able to take solace in a victory, that afternoon, over Costa Rica, who had come also third in their group, to claim 5th place. Drained from the morning's narrow loss, Peru's batsman struggled to a total of 109 for 8 from their 20 overs, with Soulsby and Myers again in the runs. However, the bowlers, led by Spry (3 for 12) and Roughton (3 for 14) and backed up by some good fielding, did enough to keep the Costa Rica batting line-up down to a total of 91 all out.

This was a satisfying end to an excellent tournament, with two wins and two losses.

==Amistad Cup==

The development of cricket in Peru and Brazil has followed quite similar trajectories since their acceptance as Affiliate Members of the ICC in the early 2000s, with a small group of keen volunteers facing sizable geographical and cultural challenges. This has led to a close friendship off the pitch - with the sharing of ideas and resources - and a healthy rivalry on the pitch.

To encapsulate this relationship, in 2011 it was decided to inaugurate the Amistad Cup (actually a Thermos flask), which would be awarded to the winner of any men's cricket game between Peru and Brazil. The loser would be given the dubious prize of The Spork (half spoon, half fork), which was found as a hidden extra in the lid of the Thermos!

Brazil is the current holder of the Amistad Cup, having defeated Peru in the group stage of the 2015 South American Championship in Chile.

[[File:Ponds Forge.jpg|thumb|Ponds Forge, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]]]]
'''Ponds Forge International Sports Centre''' is a leisure complex in [[Sheffield]], [[England]] that contains an Olympic-sized swimming pool with seating for 2,600 spectators, family and children's pools, water slides and other sports facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitnessunlimited.co.uk/ponds_forge_international_sports_centre Ponds Forge International Sports Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107062248/http://www.fitnessunlimited.co.uk/ponds_forge_international_sports_centre |date=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ponds Forge was designed by the architects [http://www.faulknerbrowns.co.uk FaulknerBrowns] and opened in 1991 as a venue for the [[1991 Summer Universiade]], which the city hosted that year. In the 1994 UK Sports Design Awards Ponds Forge was highly commended in the overall category, and for the use of steel in its construction it won the British Steel Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-the-winner-is-the-stadium-the-new-uk-sports-design-awards-have-caused-controversy-but-1374022.html |title=Architecture: The winner is . . . the stadium - The new UK Sports Design Awards have caused controversy, but can only be beneficial, says Simon Inglis |work=The Independent |date=2 August 1994 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Ponds Forge'' is borrowed from the steel works that formerly occupied this site and a {{convert|7|ft|m}} high anvil has been left in situ next to the building, partly because it would have been too expensive to move it. The [[River Sheaf]] runs under the site and flooded the car park on 21 December 1991, shutting the complex for 6 days. Proof of this can be found on platform Five of [[Sheffield station|Sheffield railway station]], because the Sheaf also runs under that, and it also flooded at the same time. A piece of debris from "The Flood" is displayed there and the plaque mounted on it has the same date. In the 2000s Ponds Forge was a venue (along with the nearby [[Don Valley Stadium]]) for Channel Four's '[[The Games (UK TV series)|The Games]]', in which celebrities competed against each other in a wide range of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/whats-on/out-and-about/games-tv-show-going-belly-up-1-316892 |title=Games' TV show going belly-up |work=The Star |date=9 September 2003 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/whats-on/out-and-about/on-your-marks-for-the-games-1-331899 |title=On your marks for The Games |work=The Star |date=23 March 2005 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olympic-sized swimming pool==
The 50 metre pool at Ponds Forge is [[List of long course swimming pools in the United Kingdom|one of ten]] in the [[United Kingdom]] built to current [[Olympic-size swimming pool|FINA standards]], and hence is home to many sporting events. The main pool hall is 90&amp;nbsp;m long by 60&amp;nbsp;m wide and when the arches for the roof were constructed temporary supports for them were necessary. When these were removed it "settled" 150&amp;nbsp;mm. It has two movable bulkheads (so the main tank can be split into 2 or 3 individual pools) and the floors at the end quarters can be raised or lowered from surface level down to 2&amp;nbsp;m depth. In its long course mode with the bulkheads at the extreme ends it has 10 lanes. If used "width ways" up to twenty 25&amp;nbsp;m lanes are available. A sophisticated ozone water treatment system is employed that results in lower levels of irritants and reduced toxicity compared with traditional methods of treatment. The quality of the pool means that a great many events are held there which creates valuable exposure for the city of Sheffield and brings in much revenue for the city's hotels etc. The down side is the consequent unavailability for its regular users whilst those events are being held. A number of [[List of world records in swimming|world records]] have been set in the pool although only one was long course. The latter was in the heats of the European Championships on 3 August 1993 when [[Károly Güttler]] of Hungary went 1.00.95 to set a new world mark in the 100&amp;nbsp;m breaststroke. As well as competition-level swimming, the pool is also used for lessons, diving, kayaking and scuba diving. It is also open to the general public for lane swimming.

==Diving pool==
Ponds Forge plays host to Europe's deepest [[diving (sport)|diving]] pool at 5.85 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham-portland.org.uk/index.php/news/gala-and-event-reports/118-city-of-sheffield-snow-frills-1st-2nd-december-ponds-forge |title=City of Sheffield Snow Frills - 1st &amp; 2nd December - Ponds Forge |publisher=Portland S.

==Surf City leisure pool==
The "Surf City" leisure pool complex comprises many water-based attractions open for public use:
*A modern leisure pool, which is used for lane swimming or leisure swimming.  At regular intervals a wave machine is activated in this pool.
*A lazy river goes around the outside of the square pool with a reasonably strong current; children can float on rings in this river.
*A smaller children's pool with a waterfall and fountains
*Two large water slides that loop outside and then traverse back in above the leisure pool.

==Gym==
In 2009 the gym at Ponds Forge had a £3 million refurbishment. It now houses a 130-piece gym, a spin studio, numerous group fitness class studios, a steam room and sauna.

==Basketball==
Within the complex is the International Sports Hall, which can be used as a [[basketball]] venue.  The maximum [[seating capacity]] of the arena is 1,600; until 2006 it was the home venue for the [[Sheffield Sharks]], before they relocated to the [[English Institute of Sport - Sheffield|EIS Sheffield]].  Amongst other events it has also hosted several [[Great Britain national basketball team|Great Britain]] international matches as well as the Semi-finals of the [[BBL Cup]] in 2004 and the [[BBL Trophy]] in February 2008.

==Location==
Ponds Forge is at the south-western side of the traffic [[roundabout]] at [[Park Square, Sheffield|Park Square]], close to Sheffield City Centre.  It is within five minutes' walking distance of the [[interchange station|bus and rail interchange]] at [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield train station]] and is also served by the [[Sheffield Supertram|tram]] stop at [[Fitzalan Square]]/Ponds Forge.  The [[Sheffield Parkway]] dual-carriageway runs directly from Park Square to junction 33 of the [[M1 motorway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Turkmenistan]]''' is a minor but growing sport.

==Governing body==
The national body is not yet affiliated to the [[Asian Rugby Football Union]] or the [[International Rugby Board]].

==History==
===Soviet Period===
{{main|Rugby union in the Soviet Union}}
Rugby union was played in [[Imperial Russia|the Russian Empire]] as early as in 1908. In 1934 the Moscow Championship was started, and in 1936 the first [[Soviet Championship (rugby union)|Soviet Championship]] took place.

In 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the "fight against the [[cosmopolitanism]]". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975 the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet national team]] played their first match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianrugby.ru/history.php?Id=RUS Rugby union in Russia and USSR] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkmenistan had its own rugby team in the USSR, but it was not treated as a proper national side.

===Post-independence===
Rugby in Turkmenistan has received help from Kazakhstan, which is the rugby "power" in [[Central Asia]]. There is now a [[Turkmenistan national rugby union team]], but it is very much embryonic, and its matches have tended to be semi-formal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17985">'''Second season syndrome''' is the now-common phrase that is used to describe a downturn in fortunes for a [[football (soccer)|football]] club in the second season after its [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] – particularly if the first season after promotion had brought a strong finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://union.surrey.ac.uk/bfpdfs/2007-2008/barefacts1112.pdf | author=Cheetham, Matt | title=Second Season Syndrome... | date=2007-09-17 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | page=31 | publisher=[[University of Surrey]] | work=[[Barefacts]] | format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome could be seen in the cases of [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] (1981–1983) and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] (1988–1990). 

Second season syndrome has also been used to describe other sports where a successful first season has taken place, followed by a poor second season straight after&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/10/22/hamilton_too_smart_for_seconds.html | title=Hamilton too smart for second-season syndrome | publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]] | work=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | date=2007-10-22 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | author=Rae, Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with individual sportspersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fansfc.com/frontpage/frontpagenews.asp?newsid=173841 | title=‘Second Season Syndrome’ hits Tottenham striker | date=2007-10-03 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | author=Meadows, Paul | publisher=FansFC |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113090456/http://www.fansfc.com/frontpage/frontpagenews.asp?newsid=173841 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States|US]], this event (more commonly applied to athletes than teams) is known as a [[sophomore slump]]. Second season syndrome is best explained by [[regression to the mean]].

==Examples==
Also when a player scores many goals in his first season but doesn't score as often in his second season e.g. [[Papiss Cissé]] of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], who scored 13 goals in 14 appearances in his debut season but followed it up with only 8 strikes in 36 appearances in the following season. And in the 1980s, [[Frank McAvennie]] scored 26 goals from 41 First Division appearances for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], but scored just seven times in 36 league games the season after.

===[[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]]===
* [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] had reached the First Division for the first time in 1981, achieving the fastest rise from the Fourth Division to the First, with three promotions in four seasons. They began the [[1981-82 in English football|1981-82 season]] with a 5-1 win over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], and led the First Division at several stages during the season before finishing sixth. A year later, however, they were relegated to the Second Division. A second successive relegation followed, and Swansea's descent from the summit would prove to be as rapid as their climb, with a third relegation in four seasons seeing them return to the Fourth Division in 1986, shortly after the club had almost gone out of business.

===[[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]]===
* [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] were promoted to the First Division for the first time in their history when they clinched the Second Division title in 1988. They emerged as title contenders in the [[1988-89 in English football|1988-89 season]], rarely being outside the top five places in the First Division for most of the season, before failing to win any of their final 10 league games and finishing 10th – the lowest position the club had occupied all season. They began the [[1989-90 in English football|1989-90 season]] well, going top of the league in mid September. However, they won just two more league games all season and were relegated in bottom place with several games of the season still remaining.

===[[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]]===
* [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]], who had spent four seasons in the First Division from 1979 and been losing [[FA Cup]] finalists in 1983, made a surprise challenge for a return to the First Division during the [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91 season]], ahead of several more favoured clubs including [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. They finished sixth in the league and qualified for the playoffs, but were beaten by [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the final and missed out on a return to the top flight. During the summer of 1991, however, their top scorer [[Mike Small (footballer)|Mike Small]] was sold to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], and Brighton struggled in his absence, being relegated a mere 12 months after they had almost been promoted.

===[[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]]===

In 1992-93, another case of "second season syndrome" notably affected a club in the second tier of English football.

* [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], elected to the [[Football League]] only in 1970, had reached the Second Division after just eight years in the league, and survived there for six seasons, before back-to-back relegations saw them drop back down to the Fourth Division in 1985. Another run of success had seen the club begin the 1990s with back-to-back promotions, returning them to the Second Division for the [[1991-92 season]] and quickly emerging as contenders for a unique third successive promotion, topping the Second Division more than six weeks until Boxing Day. Cambridge's excellent form suggested that the forthcoming new [[FA Premier League]] would include a very unlikely founding member. They finally achieved their best ever final position of fifth place in the Second Division and took their place in the playoffs. After drawing their semi-final first leg with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], Cambridge were then beaten 5-0 in the return leg at [[Filbert Street]] and their dream of a place in the new Premier League was over. Top scorer [[Dion Dublin]] was then sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], manager [[John Beck (footballer)|John Beck]] was sacked in October 1992, and Cambridge finished the 1992-93 season relegated from the new Division One, and another relegation two years later sent them down to the league's basement division. A brief respite in 1999 saw Cambridge promoted back to Division Two, before another setback in 2002 saw them drop back into Division Three. In 2005, with the club in danger of going out of business with huge debts, Cambridge were relegated from the Football League – just over a decade after coming close to being founder members of the Premier League, leaving everyone at the club wondering how differently things could have panned out had promotion been achieved in 1992, even if Cambridge hadn't been able to establish themselves as a top flight club. After relegation from the Football League, a new owner secured the club's future and a return to the Football League was finally achieved in 2014.

===[[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]]===
* [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] were promoted to the [[Premier League]] as [[Football League First Division|Division One]] champions in 1995, and started the following season in fine form, occupying fourth place in late October and looking like serious contenders for a European place. Despite a dismal run of mid-season form which saw them lose 10 out of 11 games, they still finished 12th in the final table – comfortably clear of the relegation zone. That summer, manager [[Bryan Robson]] paid some of the highest transfer fees of that era for high-profile foreign stars, including [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]] and [[Emerson Moisés Costa|Emerson]]. The new signings performed well and despite reaching the final of both domestic cups, Middlesbrough were relegated the following season in 19th place.&lt;ref name="teams"&gt;{{cite web | title=Only Thing Harder Than Going Up Is Staying Up | url=http://www.caughtoffside.com/2007/03/02/only-thing-harder-than-going-up-is-staying-up/1622.html | first=Toby | last=Higgins | date=2007-03-02 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | publisher=Offsidemedia | work=Caughtoffside.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071203203352/http://www.caughtoffside.com/2007/03/02/only-thing-harder-than-going-up-is-staying-up/1622.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was helped in no part by the Premier League docking three points off the club for failing to fulfill a fixture, which otherwise would have seen Middlesbrough avoid relegation by two points, and sent [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] down instead. As it was, Coventry managed a now-familiar late escape from relegation and would survive for four more seasons in the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Middlesbrough rocked by three-point penalty | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/middlesbrough-rocked-by-three-point-penalty-1283330.html | first=Nick |last=Duxbury | date=1997-01-15 | accessdate=2016-03-16 | work=The Independent | publisher=Newspaper Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]]===

* In [[1999 in football (soccer)|1999]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] returned to the top flight after an absence of 77 years, after coming second to [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]]. The Bantams stayed up the following season, with a then Premier League record low of 36 points. A 1–0 victory on the final day of the season over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] with a [[David Wetherall]] goal ensured City and not [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] stayed up. However just days after the season finished, manager [[Paul Jewell]] sensationally left the club and was succeeded by his assistant [[Chris Hutchings]]. Hutchings struggled and was sacked after just one win from his first 12 league games. He was replaced by [[Jim Jefferies (footballer)|Jim Jefferies]] but City remained in the bottom three for the rest of the season. Relegation was confirmed several games before the end of the season with a 2–1 defeat at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], with both [[Benito Carbone]] and [[Robbie Blake]] missing penalties. Bradford's costly attempts to reach and survive in the Premier League took a toll on their finances, and combined with the collapse of [[ITV Digital]], almost saw the club go out of business in the summer of 2002. Another relegation followed in 2004, and for six seasons from 2007, the club was in the league's fourth tier.&lt;ref name="teams"/&gt;

===[[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]]===
* [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] gained promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2000 as Division One playoff winners, and in their first season back at the highest level, they finished fifth to gain [[UEFA Cup]] qualification and their manager [[George Burley]] was voted Manager of the Year. But they won just one of their opening 17 Premier League fixtures the following season, leaving them bottom of the table in early December. A run of seven wins from eight games looked to have saved them as they stood 12th at the end of January, but another setback pushed them back into the drop zone and defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on the final day of the season confirmed their relegation. A slow start to the 2002-03 season cost manager George Burley his job after eight years in charge, and 16 years later Ipswich have still yet to return to the Premier League.&lt;ref name="teams"/&gt;

===[[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]]===
* [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] reached the [[Premier League]] as Division One champions in 2002, and finished ninth the following year – their highest finish since 1993. But the following season they finished 16th, having only secured top-flight survival in the penultimate game. Several more seasons of mediocrity followed before a takeover deal in 2008 saw City become one of the richest clubs in the world, and has seen them win several major trophies – including three Premier League titles.

===[[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]]===
* [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were promoted to the [[Premier League]] as [[Football League Championship]] playoff winners in 2005. The following year they finished ninth in the Premier League and reached the [[FA Cup]] final, where only a late equaliser and a penalty shoot-out triumph by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] prevented them from winning their first major trophy since 1980. But a dismal start to the following season saw [[Alan Pardew]] sacked in December, and as late as March they were 10 points adrift of safety. But a dramatic upturn in fortunes, engineered by a core group of players including [[Argentina|Argentine]] striker [[Carlos Tevez]], saw them beat the drop and finish 15th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/reading/6288010.stm | title=Reading's big task | date=2007-07-11 | author=Austin, Simon | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] reached the top division of English football for the first time ever in 2005, and were many people's favourites for an immediate return to the Championship. But they were in the top six for much of the first half of the season, occupying second place in late October, and finished 10th in the final table. They also reached their first ever major domestic cup final, reaching the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final but losing 4–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The following season brought a major struggle, and Wigan only managed to stay up on goal difference with a surprise away win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], who were relegated instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=3851 | title=Wigan recovering from second season syndrome | date=2006-11-05 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | author=Hulott, David | publisher=Square Football }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]]===
*[[Reading F.C.|Reading]] were promoted as champions from the Championship in 2006 with a record amount of points (106) and enjoyed a very successful first season in the Premier League, where the team finished 8th, narrowly missing out on qualification for the [[UEFA Cup]] by one position. Reading's second season however was different in that the team struggled to get out of the lower half of the [[Premier League 2007-08#League table|Premier League table]]. After a 2–1 defeat to newly promoted [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]], manager [[Steve Coppell]] admitted that Reading were suffering from second season syndrome. This was confirmed following their relegation on the final day of the season, despite beating Derby County 4-0 away from home, with Fulham staying up instead on goal difference. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/09/16/readingfc_070916_feature.shtml | title=Second season syndrome alive and well | date=2007-09-17 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=[[BBC Sport]] | author=BBC Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[2009–10 in English football|2009–10]]===
* [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] were promoted in the play-offs in 2008 to reach the top flight of English football for the first time in their history. They enjoyed an excellent start to the season, with shock wins away at Arsenal among other games, and were third in the league in late October with 20 points after 9 games, which would account for well over half their final total. Their form declined thereafter with one win from their next seven, but as late as early December, having played 16 games they stood fifth in the table with 26 points. However, after that Hull took just one win from their remaining 22 games, and a final total of just 35 points, which was enough for them to survive by a single point. This poor form continued into the following season, with manager Phil Brown sacked, and Hull ended the season relegated. Hull repeated the feat in 2013-14, and 2014-15, having also reached the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] after staying clear of relegation trouble, only to be relegated on the final day of the next season.

===[[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]]===
* [[Birmingham City F.C.]] were promoted in 2009 after grabbing a second-place finish in The Championship. In the 2009–10 season Birmingham managed a ninth placed finish (one of the highest finishes in their history) with 50 points and a 15-game unbeaten run along the way. However the following season saw Birmingham relegated to the Championship after losing 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur on the last day, despite winning the League Cup in February, the club's first major trophy since 1963.

===[[2012–13 in English football|2012–13]]===
* [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] were promoted as Championship champions in 2011, after an absence of 15 years. Their entire season was one of struggle, and finished in 17th place after losing to Manchester City on the final day and allowing City to take the Premier League title. As this was only the second time all promoted teams had avoided relegation, QPR had hope to stay in the Premier League longer, but the following season they were relegated in bottom place after drawing with rivals Reading, with the other two surviving promoted sides from the previous season, Norwich and Swansea, both staying up again. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2188224/Premier-League--does-second-season-syndrome-exist.html|title=Premier League - does second season syndrome exist? - Daily Mail Online|date=14 August 2012|work=Mail Online|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11994/8151783/second-season-woe|title=Second-season woe|work=Sky Sports|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traffic Sports Marketing''' is a [[Brazil]]ian sports marketing agency that runs [[Brazil]]ian [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs [[Desportivo Brasil]], [[Ituano FC]], [[G.D. Estoril Praia]] in Portugal and [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in the USA.

[[Desportivo Brasil]] was a club and company created by Traffic Sports, to find and prepare promising Brazilian football newcomers to pursue careers in other clubs, including abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.com.br/about/|title=About Traffic|work=[[Traffic Sports]]|publisher=[[Traffic Group]]|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic also owns footballing rights to players including [[Valmir Ribeiro Siqueira|Valmir]], [[Lulinha]], [[Rodolfo Bantas Bispo|Rodolfo]], and [[Keirrison de Souza Carneiro|Keirrison]]. Traffic is buying contracts for young soccer players all over Brazil, as well as [[Argentina]]. They then lend the players to teams, who pay the players a salary and also allow them to showcase their talents. If they are recruited by a big team, Traffic and its partners reap the largest share of the transfer fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/19/business/19soccer.htm|title=Trading in Soccer Talent |last=Downie|first=Andrew|date=2008-07-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE: VELO Sports Center}}
The '''VELO Sports Center''' is a [[velodrome]] located in [[Carson, California|Carson]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is currently the only cycling track of its kind located in the [[United States]]. Formerly known as the ADT Event Center or LA Velodrome, it opened in 2004 on the [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] Campus, next to the [[StubHub Center]]. The facility is owned and operated by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG).

The track has hosted the 2004 [[UCI Junior Track World Championships]], [[2005 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]], 2006-2008 UCI Track Cycling World Cups, and 2012 [[UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships]]. The Official Olympic and Paralympic Training Site is home for [[USA Cycling]]’s national track cycling program, [[Canadian Cycling Association]]’s national track cycling program, as well as for cyclists of all ages and ability levels year-round.

==About the velodrome==
The current indoor velodrome was built in 2004. The $15 million, multi-use facility was designed by [[Rossetti Architects]] with structural engineer John A Martin &amp; Associates. It is a track at {{convert|250|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} per lap that is {{convert|7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide, and has 45 degree banks. It is made of approximately {{convert|33|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} of Siberian pine, and seats approximately 2,500 spectators. The VELO Sports Center is always kept at 72 degrees, and 50% humidity.

The track is open to all ages and ability levels, and encourages riders of all levels to try riding the track. Everyone who rides the velodrome must be track certified. The VELO Sports Center certifies riders on Saturday mornings from 10:30 to 13:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stubhubcenter.com/velo/getting-started-registration# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007225613/http://www.stubhubcenter.com/velo/getting-started-registration# |archive-date=2013-10-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olympic legacy==
===Original venue and 1984 Summer Olympics===
The VELO Sports Center is built just a few hundred meters south of the site of the Los Angeles [[1984 Summer Olympics]] [[Olympic Velodrome (Carson, California)|Velodrome]], which stood where the soccer stadium is now built at [[StubHub Center]].

On 4 February 1981 California State University Dominguez Hills was selected as the site of the Olympic velodrome.&lt;ref name="la84.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Official Report of the Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles, 1984|website=Library.la84.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSU Dominguez Hills President Don Gerth was eager to include the university in the ’84 Olympics. When Olympic Organizing Committee Chair [[Peter Ueberroth]] asked Gerth if he would like to have the Olympic velodrome, he replied, “We’ll take it. What’s a velodrome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csudh.edu/univadv/dateline/archives/20090813/campusnews/alookback.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715194158/http://www.csudh.edu/univadv/dateline/archives/20090813/campusnews/alookback.htm# |archive-date=2012-07-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;”

On 9 July 1981 construction began on the Olympic velodrome, and it was completed on time and under budget prior to the 8 July 1982 dedication and 7-Eleven/Bicycling Magazine Grand Prix on July 9-10th, 1982.&lt;ref name="la84.org"/&gt; The 7-Eleven velodrome was one of only three permanent facilities built specifically for the 1984 Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="la84.org"/&gt; The track was {{convert|333.333|m|ft}} in length, {{convert|6|m|ft}} wide, banked at 33 degrees in the turns, 9 degrees on the straights, and was made of concrete. Prior to the Games, the track experienced small hairline cracks. These were fixed by an epoxy injection system and series of grinding to reduce bumps common to concrete tracks, and the track was coated with polyurethane prior to the Olympics for the fastest possible surface. Riders said the track was “smooth but sticky."&lt;ref name="la84.org"/&gt; Permanent stands were built to accommodate 2,000 spectators, but with temporary seating additions capacity for the Games was between 6,400 and 8,000. The Los Angeles developer and contractor Stolte Inc. built the velodrome for $3 million. Prior to the Games, the Olympic velodrome was one of the most requested venues for tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Official Report of the Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles, 1984 : Part Two : Finance|website=Library.la84.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Games was perhaps the most successful in [[USA Cycling]] history. It was also the first Olympics to have Women’s Cycling. The LAOOC petitioned for Women’s Individual Sprint and Pursuit events, but the requests were denied by the [[IOC]]. [[Connie Carpenter-Phinney]] and [[Rebecca Twigg]] took the Gold and Silver Medals in the 45 women field in the Individual road race, the first in Olympic history. On the track, [[Mark Gorski]] won the Individual Sprint Gold over ‘The Cheetah’ [[Nelson Vails]] in the all USA Final, and [[Steve Hegg]] won the 4000m Individual Pursuit. Altogether the US won a record 9 medals in cycling events. After the Games it was revealed 1/3 of the US team received blood transfusions before the event, which was still 1 year before it was banned by the IOC.

===2028 Summer Olympics===
During the [[2028 Summer Olympics]], the VELO Sports Center will host indoor track cycling as well as the fencing portion of [[Modern Pentathlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf|format=PDF|title=Phase Two : GOVERNANCE, LEGAL and VENUE FUNDING|website=La24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The VELO Sports Center is a multi-use facility that has hosted volleyball and basketball tournaments, [[Taekwondo]] Tournaments, and most recently the 2013 [[CrossFit]] Games. It is also the home of ERO-Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ero-sports.com/|title=Home - ERO Sports|first=Jim|last=Manton|website=ero-sports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a world leader in bike fitting and aerodynamics testing. Using the new Track Aero System developed by Montreal based company Alphamantis, ERO-Sports has effectively brought wind tunnel testing into the real world on the velodrome.
