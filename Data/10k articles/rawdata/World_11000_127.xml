The '''Belgium Pier''' is a pier in [[Blankenberge]], Belgium. It was built in 1933 after an [[Art Deco]] design by architect Jules Soete. The concrete structure stretches 350 meters out into the North Sea. The Belgium Pier replaced an earlier structure that was the first pier at the Atlantic and North Sea costs of the European continent, and the only other pier like it is the [[Scheveningen Pier]] in the Netherlands.

'''''Bácsmegyei Napló''''' (lit. ''County of Bács Journal'') was a [[Hungarian language]] daily [[newspaper]]. The first issue of the paper was published on June 14, 1903, with the purpose of serving as the information source for the Magyars and Hungarian language-speaking population in [[Bács-Bodrog County]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]. It was also published in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The paper was published in [[Subotica]] (Today in [[Serbia]]). Bácsmegyei Napló survived [[World War I]] the ban from 1917 and it reappeared in 1920. It was banned again in March 1920 but reappeared in August the same year. Its [[editors-in-chief]] were Ferens Fenyves, Imre Dugovich, [[Kosztolányi]], László Czebe, Lazar Stipić, and Mihály Bródy. ''Bácsmegyei Napló'' was finally disestablished in 1941.

'''Camerton''' ({{lang-mn|Камертон}}, after the Russian word for [[tuning fork]]) are a [[Mongolia]]n [[vocal group]]. They independently formed on June 24, 1995. The same year they won "Best Debut Group" at the [[Pentatonic Award]], the biggest music awards in Mongolia.

Widely considered as the first and the most successful pop/boy band in Mongolia, Camerton have released a total of ten albums and EPs between 1996 and 2004. At the peak of their success, the band's popularity spanned throughout [[East Asia]], most notably in Taiwan, where they have exclusively released a "best of" compilation. Their song "Don't I think About You" has been included in an Asian All Stars' CD, named "Love is The Answer".

Following the release of "Celebration" EP in 2004, Camerton announced their hiatus. All four members of the group immediately went on to launch solo careers, most prominently Bold, who released several solo albums since 2005 and started a musical project named "Mongol Pop". The band occasionally reunites for one-time concerts and performances, most notable ones include their tenth and twentieth anniversary concerts in 2005 and 2015 respectively.

In January 2015, they released a brand new song called "{{Lang|mn|Асах Гэрэл}}" (''Asakh Gerel''), a [[soundtrack]] for the film "{{Lang|mn|Давхар Цохилт}}" (''Davkhar Tsohilt''), with a new music video. In November 2015, the band played another sold-out concert in Ulaanbaatar. The concert named '18 Years' (the original title of their debut concert in 1996) consisted of 40 songs. Following their hugely successful concert, Bold announced via his [[Facebook]] page that Camerton would be releasing a new album in 2016, the band's first release in more than a decade.

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Chad]] on 2 June 1996, with a second round on 3 July. They were the first multiparty presidential elections in the [[history of Chad]] and occurred at the end of a long transitional process after repeated delays. The elections were won by the incumbent [[Heads of state of Chad|President]] [[Idriss Déby]], who easily defeated a prominent southern politician, [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué]], in the second round. Déby benefited from the support of another southern politician, [[Saleh Kebzabo]], who was placed third in the first round. The election was marred by widespread and credible reports of [[electoral fraud]] and government intimidation of opposition forces, confirmed by international observers. Voter turnout was 67.5% in the first round and 77.7% in the second.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]], Michael Krennerich &amp; Bernard Thibaut (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p238 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his victory, Déby was sworn in on 8 August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chadembassy-usa.org/images/special_tchad.pdf LE PRÉSIDENT DÉBY VEUT FAIRE PLUS ENCORE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228151942/http://www.chadembassy-usa.org/images/special_tchad.pdf |date=February 28, 2008 }} ''Diplomat Investissement'', March–April 2006, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Confederation of Trade Unions''' (KSSh) is a [[:Category:National federations of trade unions|National federation]] of [[Trade union]]s in [[Albania]]. It is a successor organization to the [[Trade Unions of Albania]].

It was led by [[Kastriot Muco]] until November 2004 and has an estimated membership of 100,000. Actual president Kol Nikolli took over the lead of the institution after a narrow victory in the CTUA Congress elections on 24 November 2004. This was in many ways the first time that in a political organisation a change happened through democratic elections, where trade union delegates could for the first time vote for an alternative, represented by the most reformist trade union leader in Albania. It was considered to be a victory not only for the Albanian Trade Union Confederation - KSSH, but for all the Albanian trade union movement. Moreover, it was considered to be a challenge for the political parties in Albania, who so far (2007) have been unable to undergo such a process.

The 1876–77 '''Constantinople Conference''' ({{lang-tr|Tersane Konferansı}} "Shipyard Conference", after the venue ''Tersane Sarayı'' "Shipyard Palace") of the [[Great power|Great Powers]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]]) was held in [[Names of Istanbul|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]])&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Caroline, ''Osman's Dream'', (Basic Books, 2005), 57; "''Istanbul was only adopted as the city's official name in 1930.''".&lt;/ref&gt; from 23 December 1876 until 20 January 1877. Following the beginning of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–1878)|Herzegovinian Uprising]] in 1875 and the [[April Uprising]] in April 1876, the Great Powers agreed on a project for political reforms both in [[Bosnia]] and in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territories with a majority&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence respecting the Conference at Constantinople and the affairs of Turkey: 1876–1877. Parliamentary Papers No 2 (1877). p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] population.

==Participants==
[[File:Balkan boundaries1876map1914.png|thumb|400px|Bulgaria according to the Constantinople Conference]]
The Great Powers were represented at the conference respectively by:&lt;ref&gt;H. Sutherland Edwards. [https://archive.org/stream/sirwilliamwhite00edwagoog/sirwilliamwhite00edwagoog_djvu.txt ''Sir William White K.C.B., K.C.M.G., For Six Years Ambassador at Constantinople''.] London: John Murray, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]:
: [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and Sir [[Henry Elliot]];
* [[Russian Empire]]:

* [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]:

* [[German Empire]]:

* [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]:

* [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]:
: Count [[Lodovico, Count Corti|Luigi (Lodovico) Corti]].

Of these, [[Lord]] Salisbury, [[Count]] de Chaudordy and [[Baron]] von Calice were [[Ambassador|Ambassadors Plenipotentiary]] to the conference, while Count Ignatyev, Sir Henry Elliot, Count de Bourgoing, Baron von Werther, Count Zichy and Count Corti were the resident Ambassadors of their countries in Constantinople.

The US [[Consul (representative)|Consul General]] in Constantinople, [[Eugene Schuyler]] also took an active part in drafting the conference decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1876/12/31/93824050.pdf The Eastern Question.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was represented at the conference by:
: [[Midhat Pasha]], [[Saffet Pasha]] and [[Ibrahim Edhem Pasha|Edhem Pasha]].

Midhat [[Pasha]] was the [[Grand Vizier]] (First Minister), and Saffet Pasha the Foreign Minister of the Ottoman Empire.  Although the Ottoman representatives participated in the plenaries of the conference, they were not invited to the preceding working sessions at which the Great Powers negotiated and elaborated their agreement.

Lord Salisbury and Count Ignatyev played a leading role in the process.  Ignatyev was trying to dispel British misgivings about Russia’s assumed role of a protector of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[South Slavs|Slavs]] being but a disguise of its drive to take over the [[Turkish Straits|Black Sea Straits]] and Constantinople itself and thus – as Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] feared – potentially threaten the vital [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] routes to [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckle G.E., W.F.

===Bosnia===

The conference envisaged the creation of an [[autonomy|autonomous]] province including [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and most of [[Herzegovina]], while a southern part of the latter was to be ceded to the [[Principality of Montenegro]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bulgaria===

The Great Powers agreed on a substantial Bulgarian autonomy to take the form of two new Ottoman provinces ([[Wilayah#Ottoman Empire|vilayets]]) established for the purpose: Eastern, with capital [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], and Western, with capital [[Sofia]].&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Compte rendu No. 8"/&gt;

The conference determined that, as of the late 19th century, the Bulgarian ethnic territories within the Ottoman Empire extended to [[Tulcea]] and the [[Danube Delta]] in the northeast, [[Ohrid]] and [[Kastoria]] in the southwest, [[Kirklareli]] and [[Edirne]] in the southeast, and [[Leskovac]] and [[Niš]] in the northwest.  These territories were to be incorporated into the two Bulgarian autonomous provinces as follows:

* Eastern Bulgarian autonomous province, including the Ottoman [[sandjak]]s – second level administrative divisions – of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tırnova]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Rusçuk]], [[Tulcea|Tulça]], [[Varna]], [[Sliven]], [[Plovdiv|Filibe]] (bar the [[kaza (country subdivision)|kaza]]s – third level administrative divisions – of [[Ardino|Sultaneri]] and [[Smolyan|Ahıçelebi]]), and part of the [[Edirne]] sandjak including the kazas of [[Kırklareli|Kırkkilise]], [[Svilengrad|Mustafapaşa]] and [[Elhovo|Kızılağaç]].&lt;ref name="Compte rendu No. 8"&gt;Conference de Constantinople.

(in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maps"&gt;Further Correspondence respecting the affairs of Turkey. (With Maps of proposed Bulgarian Vilayets).  Parliamentary Papers No 13 (1877).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Western Bulgarian autonomous province, including the sandjaks of [[Sofia|Sofya]], [[Vidin]], [[Niš|Niş]], [[Skopje|Üsküp]], [[Bitola|Manastır]] (bar the kazas of [[Debar|Debre]] and [[Korçë|Korça]]), the [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop]], [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]] and [[Sidirokastro|Demirhisar]] kazas of the [[Serres|Serez]] sandjak, and the kazas of [[Strumica|Ustrumca]], [[Veles (city)|Köprülü]], [[Tikveš|Tikveş]] and [[Kastoria|Kesriye]].&lt;ref name="Compte rendu No. 8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maps" /&gt;

The Great Powers elaborated in detail the constitutional, [[Legislative Assembly|legislative]], executive, [[Defense (military)|defense]] and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] arrangements, [[Canton (administrative division)|canton]]al [[Local government|administrative]] system, taxation, international supervision etc. for the proposed autonomous provinces.&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Compte rendu No. 8"/&gt;

==Conclusion==

The agreed decisions of the six Great Powers were formally handed over to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Government on 23 December 1876,&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence respecting the Conference at Constantinople and the affairs of Turkey: 1876–1877. Parliamentary Papers No 2 (1877). p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; dismissing the opening Ottoman suggestions that the Conference's mission might be unnecessary, given a new [[Kanunuesasi|Ottoman Constitution]] approved by [[Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] that same day.&lt;ref&gt;L.S.

Austin: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent conference's plenary sessions, the Ottoman Empire submitted objections and alternative reform proposals that were rejected by the Great Powers, and attempts to bridge the gap did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1877/01/16/80361295.pdf Turkey and the Great Powers.

==Legacy==

The rejection by the Ottoman Government of the decisions of the Constantinople Conference triggered the 1877–1878 [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], depriving at the same time the Ottoman Empire – in contrast to the preceding 1853–1856 [[Crimean War]] – of Western support.&lt;ref name="Ivanova" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12373">{{Economics sidebar}}The idea of '''convergence''' in economics (also sometimes known as the '''catch-up effect''') is the hypothesis that poorer [[Economic system|economies]]' [[per capita income]]s will tend to grow at faster rates than richer economies. As a result, all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income. [[Developing country|Developing countries]] have the potential to grow at a faster rate than [[developed country|developed countries]] because [[diminishing returns]] (in particular, to [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) are not as strong as in capital-rich countries. Furthermore, poorer countries can replicate the production methods, [[technology|technologies]], and [[institutions]] of developed countries.

In [[economic growth]] literature the term "convergence" can have two meanings. The first kind (sometimes called "sigma-convergence") refers to a reduction in the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of levels of income across economies. "Beta-convergence" on the other hand, occurs when poor economies grow faster than rich ones. Economists say that there is "conditional beta-convergence" when economies experience "beta-convergence" but conditional on other variables (namely the investment rate and the population growth rate) being held constant. They say that "unconditional beta-convergence" or "absolute beta-convergence" exists when the growth rate of an economy declines as it approaches its [[Steady-state economy|steady state]]. According to [[Jack Goldstone]], "in the twentieth century, the [[Great Divergence]] peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s, then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=378&amp;Itemid=1 Phases of global demographic transition correlate with phases of the Great Divergence and Great Convergence. ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change''. Volume 95, June 2015, Page 163]; see also [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319177793 ''Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective''].&lt;/ref&gt; thus the present-day convergence should be regarded as a continuation of the [[Great Divergence]].

==Limitations==

The fact that a country is poor does not guarantee that catch-up growth will be achieved.  [[Moses Abramovitz]] emphasised the need for 'Social Capabilities' to benefit from catch-up growth.  These include an ability to absorb new technology, attract capital and participate in global markets.  According to Abramovitz, these prerequisites must be in place in an economy before catch-up growth can occur, and explain why there is still divergence in the world today.

The theory also assumes that technology is freely traded and available to developing countries that are attempting to catch-up.  Capital that is expensive or unavailable to these economies can also prevent catch-up growth from occurring, especially given that capital is scarce in these countries.  This often traps countries in a low-efficiency cycle whereby the most efficient technology is too expensive to be acquired.  The differences in productivity techniques is what separates the leading developed nations from the following developed nations, but by a margin narrow enough to give the following nations an opportunity to catch-up.  This process of catch-up continues as long as the following nations have something to learn from the leading nations, and will only cease when the knowledge discrepancy between the leading and following nations becomes very small and eventually exhausted.

According to Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], convergence is not occurring everywhere because of the closed economic policy of some developing countries, which could be solved through [[free trade]] and openness. In a study of 111 countries between 1970 and 1989, Sachs and Andrew Warner concluded that the industrialized countries had a growth of 2.3%/year/capita, [[open economy]] developing countries 4.5% and [[closed economy]] developing countries only 2%.&lt;ref&gt;"Vapaakauppa on kriiseistä huolimatta kasvun eliksiiri", [[Jeffrey Sachs]], [[Helsingin Sanomat]] 1997-11-8 (the biggest newspaper in Finland)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of countries which have converged with developed countries which validate the catch-up theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J.

Science and Technology in the Transformation of the World, The United Nations University, 1982. {{ISBN|92-808-0339-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s the [[East Asian Tigers]] rapidly converged with developed economies.  These include [[Singapore]],  [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] - all of which are today considered developed economies.  In the post-war period (1945–1960) examples include [[West Germany]], [[France]] and [[Japan]], which were able to quickly regain their prewar status by replacing capital that was lost during [[World War II]].

Some economists criticise the theory, stating that [[endogenous]] factors, such as government policy, are much more influential in economic growth than [[exogenous factor]]s.  For example, [[Alexander Gerschenkron]] states that governments can substitute for missing prerequisites to trigger catch-up growth.  A hypothesis by economic historians [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] suggested that [[factor endowment]]s are a central determinant of [[structural inequality]] that impedes institutional development in some countries.  Sokoloff and Engerman proposed that in the 19th century, countries such as Brazil and Cuba with rich factor endowments such as soil and climate are predisposed to a guarded franchise with limited institutional growth.  Land that is suitable for sugar and coffee such as Cuba experienced economies of scale from the establishment of plantation that in turn created the small elite families with vested interest in guarded franchise.  The exogenous suitability of land for wheat versus sugar determines the growth rate for many countries.  Therefore, countries with land that is suitable for sugar converge with other countries that also have land that is suitable for growing sugar.

Sokoloff and Engerman explained this convergence in their article "History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World." They explained that the United States and Canada started out as two of the poorest colonies in the New World but grew faster than other countries as a result of their soil qualities. They argued that the United States and Canada had land suitable for growing wheat which meant that they had small scale farming, since wheat does not benefit from economies of scale, and this led to a relatively equal distribution of wealth and political power enabling the population to vote for broad public education. This differentiated them from countries such as Cuba that had land suitable for growing sugar and coffee. Such countries did benefit from economies of scale and so had large plantation agriculture with slave labor, large income and class inequalities, and limited voting rights. This difference in political power led to little spending on the establishment of institutions such as public schools and slowed down their progress. As a result, countries with relative equality and access to public education grew faster and were able to converge on countries with inequality and limited education.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Sokoloff, Stanley L. Engerman. "History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'' Vol 14 No.3 (2000): pp. 217-232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Convergence==

* Absolute Convergence: Lower initial GDP will lead to a higher average growth rate. The implication of this is that poverty will ultimately disappear 'by itself'. It does not explain why some nations have had zero growth for many decades (e.g. in Sub-Saharan Africa)

* Conditional Convergence: A country's income per worker converges to a country-specific long-run level as determined by the structural characteristics of that country. The implication is that structural characteristics, and not initial national income, determine the long-run level of GDP per worker. Thus, foreign aid should focus on structure (infrastructure, education, financial system etc.) and there is no need for an income transfer from richer to poorer nations.

* Club Convergence: It is possible to observe different "clubs" or groups of countries with similar growth trajectories. Most importantly, several countries with low national income also have low growth rates. Thus, this is in contrast to the theory of conditional convergence, and would suggest that foreign aid should also include income transfers and that initial income does in fact matter for economic growth.

'''''Each In His Own Way''''' ({{lang-it|Ciascuno a suo modo}} {{IPA-it|tʃaˈskuːno a ˈsuːo ˈmɔːdo|}}) is a 1924 play by [[Luigi Pirandello]]. Like his more famous ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', it forms part of his "trilogy of the [[Metatheatre|theatre in the theatre]]."

''Each In His Own Way'' concerns the production of a play based on "real" goings-on: the scandal of the artist Giorgio Salvi's suicide on the eve of his marriage, committed when he discovered that his fiancée, the actress Delia Morello, had begun a short-lived affair with Salvi's brother-in-law Michele Rocca, is ostensibly based on events concerning the sculptor La Vela, the actress Amelia Moreno, and Baron Nuti. The people in question have come separately to see the "play" to determine if it is really based on the real events.

The "play" begins ''[[in medias res]]'', with the characters discussing Delia. Two characters, Doro Palegari and Francesco Savio, debate her rationale: was it a well-intentioned move to break off a marriage that would have been a mistake, or was it spite against Salvi?

By the end of Act I, Moreno and Nuti have independently confirmed that the play is based on their story, and Moreno wishes to stop it from going on. However, it continues, and Act II shows Rocca's arrival to tell Delia that he has realized their mutual hatred is concealed love; she rejects him and they fight, but then she realizes he is right, and they embrace. In the auditorium, Moreno and Nuti, still furious, catch sight of each other and likewise embrace. Act III is "canceled."

The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]] ({{lang-pt|Assembleia Nacional}}) has 72 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]]. Cape Verde has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]], with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

'''Faragism''' is an [[ideology]] and practice associated with the followers and supporters of [[Nigel Farage]], leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] from 2006 to 2009 and then again from 2010 to 2016. Faragism is a [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Populism|populist]] and strongly [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] ideology. It is the leading ideology among members of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]], but it is also popular with many in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

==2016 UKIP leadership election==
One of the first declared Faragists was [[Raheem Kassam]], when he announced his intention to run for the leadership of UKIP in the [[UK Independence Party leadership election, November 2016|November 2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37799679 |title='Farage-ist' Raheem Kassam launches UKIP leadership bid |publisher=BBC News |date=2016-10-28 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kassam defined it as "a belief in your country, a belief in your culture, a belief in the people of this great nation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/28/ukip-leadership-candidate-raheem-kassam-donald-trump-niqab-referendum |title=leadership candidate defends Trump and calls for niqab referendum |publisher=The Guardian |date=2016-10-28 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another declared Faragist candidate in November 2016 was [[John Rees-Evans]]. Sam Gould, the Chairman of UKIP Caerphilly confirmed this, commenting “Yes – policy-wise he is similar to Raheem. John is a gentlemen and has done so much for UKIP, helping them produce party political broadcasts and has raised a lot of money for the party, too.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Jack |url=http://newmediacentral.net/ukip-leadership-latest-john-rees-evans-walks-out-of-hustings-event/ |title=UKIP leadership latest – John Rees-Evans walks out of hustings event |publisher=New Media Central |date=2016-11-03 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Nuttall]], who won the 2016 leadership contest having pitched himself as the unity candidate, appointed [[Suzanne Evans]] as co-deputy chairwoman of the party and [[Patrick O'Flynn]] as his principal political adviser. Both individuals have been seen as opponents of Farage within the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Lucy|title=Farage's old foe gets seat at top table|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/farage-s-old-foe-gets-seat-at-top-table-fb86kl9jz|work=The Times|subscription=y|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hungarian mixed grill''' or '''Fatányéros'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages=83 |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous traditional Hungarian mixed meat [[barbecue]] dish (or ''pecsenye'' in Hungarian), originating from Transylvania.

The dish ''Fatányéros'' was on the menu since 1900 at the famous restaurant [[Wampetich]] (later [[Gundel]]) in the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]] (''Városliget'') in Budapest, as "''fatányéros''—Hungarian mixed grill on wooden platter". The dish was served on wooden platter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://grocceni.com/recipes/mixedgrill.html Famous Hungarian recipes]&lt;/ref&gt; and contained grilled slices of veal, beef, pork cutlets, and a slice of goose liver and a slice of bacon—grilled or roasted on a spit. As a side dish [[french fries]] or thick slices of fried potatoes are served, together with fresh mixed green salad, with a big knife with Hungarian motifs stuck in the middle of the steak.
 
Steaks called ''pecsenye'' are part of the traditional [[Hungarian cuisine]] and may refer to any kind of [[pan frying|pan fried]] meat: pork, beef, poultry or game. Other Hungarian ''pecsenye'' or steaks are for example ''Cigánypecsenye'' (Gypsy roast).

These steaks are often served on a wooden platter, like ''Bakonyi pecsenye'', ''Tordai pecsenye'' or ''Erdélyi fatányéros'', arranged in a very decorative way with garnishing, fried vegetables and salad. 

The dish is also popular in [[Sweden]] as "Plankstek"

The '''Harsdorff House''' is a historic property located on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in central [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It was built by [[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff]] in 1780 and was in the same time to serve as inspiration for the many uneducated master builders of the time. The [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] was based in the building from 1864 to 1823.

==History==
[[File:Charlottenborg 1749 (2).png|thumb|200px|left|The small buildings located next to Charlottenborg seen on a drawing from the middle of the 18th century]] 
[[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff]] became professor of perspective at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1766. In 1770 he succeeded [[Nicolas-Henri Jardin]] as royal building master and the following year he took over his residence in the south wing of [[Charlottenborg Palace]].The Royal Academy's secretary, C. E. Biehl, had a residence next to the palace. His daughter, [[Charlotte Dorothea Biehl]], spend some of her childhood in the building. After Biehl's death the worn-out building was designated for demolition and Harsdorff was consulted on the matter. He proposed that the site was given to him and he would then build a house which could serve as inspiration for the builders of the increasing number of bourgeois houses in the city. Architects who had studied at the Academy were in general only used by the state and members of the aristocracy. The king accepted the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/kko/h/kko_h-3.html|title=Harsdorffs Hus, Kongens Nytorv 3-5|language=Danish|website=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1779 and was completed in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multimediakontoret.dk/programmer/arkitektur/klasicm/H1_004.htm#hars|title=Borgerhuset|language=Danish|website=multimediakontoret.dk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was never actually used by Harsdorff personally. It was instead used as the city home of C. F. E. Rantzau .

[[File:Jacques Eugene Pierre Vincent (1806-1849).jpg|thumb|160px|Jacques Eugene Pierre Vincent]] 
A Frenchman, Eugen Vincent, who had previously served as cook for Prince Ferdinand, opened Restairant Vincent in the building in the first half of the 19th century. The restaurant was later operated by his widow Eva Severine Vincent (née Rasmussen) and son Alexander Vincent under the name Madame Vincent. It was visited y [[Jules Verne]] during his visit to Copenhagen in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jules-verne.dk/verneikoebenhavn1861.html|title=Jules Verne i København i billeder|language=Danish|website=jules-verne.dk|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merchant and politician [[Alfred Hage (1803–1872)|Alfred Hage]] lived in the building from 1862 and until his death in 1872.

[[File:Harsdorffs Hus 1866.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Harsdorff House photographed in 1866]]
The [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] was based in the building from 1864 until 1923. It was from then on based partly at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and the [[Yellow Mansion, Copenhagen|Yellow Mansion]] in [[Amaliegade]] until its new building at [[Asiatisk Plads]] was completed in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indenforvoldene.dk/kongens%20nytorv%203-5.html|title=Kongens Nytorv 3-5|language=Danish|website=indenforvoldene.dk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was restored by Fogh &amp; Følner in 1999.&lt;ref name=arkark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1896|title=Harsdorffs Palæ, København|language=Danish|website=aarkark.dk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court photographyer Jens Petersen, 1829-1905 operated a photographic studio in the building from 1865 to 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fotohistorie.com/petersen-jens-kbh.html|title=Harsdorffs Palæ, København|language=Danish|website=fotohistorie.com|accessdate=10  September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
As Jardin's successor,c. f. Harsdorff favoured French classicism inspired by ancient Greece and Rome.&lt;ref name=arkark/&gt;

The odd-shaped corner site inspired Harsdorff to build a property with three different model facades. The more monumental, central section is decorated with Ionic order pilasters and crowned by a triangular pediment with relief decoration.

The house came to serve as inspiration for hundreds of houses in the rebuilding of Copenhagen during the years after the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1795|Great Fire of 1795]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guldalder.dk/Harsdorffs_Hus.html|title=1. Harsdorffs Hus|language=Danish|website=Golden Days|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The building is owned by [[Karberghus]]. The tenants include the IT consultency Nine (No. 3-5, 1st floor) and Russel Reynolds Associates (No. 3, 2md floor)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''Landen Group''' is a [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] unit (a "[[group (stratigraphy)|group]]" of [[stratum|rock strata]]) in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]]. The group consists of two [[formation (stratigraphy)|formations]] of [[Thanetian]] (late [[Paleocene]]) to [[Ypresian]] (early [[Eocene]]) age. The Landen Group is named after the town of [[Landen]] in [[Flemish Brabant]].

==Subdivision==
The Landen Group is subdivided into two formations:
* The [[Hannut Formation]], an alternation of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[clay]]s, [[sand]]s and [[limestone]]s;
* The [[Tienen Formation]], a [[lagoon]]al-[[continent]]al alternation of clay, sand and [[lignite]]. This formation is known for its fossils.

Both formations can be found in the subsurface of all northern Belgium. They [[outcrop|crop out]] in the [[Hainaut (province)|province of Hainaut]].

==Stratigraphy==
The Landen Group is stratigraphically on top of the [[Bertaimont Formation]] or [[Heers Formation]] (marine [[marl]]s, sands and clays of [[Selandian]] to Thanetian age). In the Belgian lithostratigraphy, the Landen Group is overlain by the [[Ieper Group]], marine clays and sands of Ypresian age.

The Landen Group shares its name with the [[Landen Formation]] in the lithostratigraphy of the [[Netherlands]]. However, this Dutch formation contains not only the equivalents of the Belgian Landen Group but also strata that [[correlation|correlate]] with the Belgian [[Opglabbeek Formation]] and Heers Formation.

Malta became a British colony in 1815, serving as a way station for ships and the headquarters for the British Mediterranean Fleet.

Malta has a long Christian legacy and its Archdiocese is claimed to be an [[apostolic see]] because [[Paul the Apostle]] was shipwrecked on "Melita", according to [[Acts of the Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|27:39–28:11|KJV}}.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The origin of the name ''Malta'' is uncertain, and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is that the word ''Malta'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|μέλι}}, ''meli'', "honey".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|me/li^|μέλι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks called the island {{lang|grc|Μελίτη}} (''Melitē'') meaning "honey-sweet", possibly for Malta's unique production of honey; an endemic subspecies of [[Maltese honey bee|bee]] lives on the island.&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; The Romans called the island ''Melita'',&lt;ref&gt;http://maltaramc.com/imggen/brucellosis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which can be considered either a latinisation of the Greek {{lang|grc|Μελίτη}} or the adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation of the same word {{lang|grc|Μελίτα}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|Melita|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conjecture suggests that the word ''Malta'' comes from the Phoenician word ''Maleth'', "a haven",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickles |first=Tim|title= Malta 1565: Last Battle of the Crusades |publisher=Osprey Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LuvbRQ78sIC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-85532-603-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'port'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111001/letters/Renaming-Malta-the-Republic-of-Phoenicia.387184|title=Renaming Malta the Republic of Phoenicia|work=The Times|location=Malta|publisher=Allied Newspapers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to Malta's many bays and coves.

The fate of the population after the Arab invasion is unclear but it seems the islands may have been completely depopulated and were likely to have been repopulated in the beginning of the second millennium by settlers from Arab-ruled Sicily who spoke [[Siculo-Arabic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| title=So who are the 'real' Maltese|quote=There's a gap between 800 and 1200 where there is no record of civilisation.

The influence is probably indirect, since the Arabs raided the island and left no-one behind, except for a few people. There are no records of civilisation of any kind at the time. The kind of Arabic used in the Maltese language is most likely derived from the language spoken by those that repopulated the island from Sicily in the early second millennium; it is known as Siculo-Arab.

Henri Bresc has written that there are indications of further Muslim political activity on Malta during the last Suabian years. Anyhow there is no doubt that by the beginning of Angevin times no professed Muslim Maltese remained either as free persons or even as serfs on the island.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] until 1530, and were briefly controlled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou]]. In 1530 [[Charles I of Spain]] gave the Maltese islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]] in perpetual lease.

The French under [[Napoleon]] took hold of the Maltese islands in 1798, although with the aid of the British the Maltese were able to oust French control two years later. The inhabitants subsequently asked Britain to assume sovereignty over the islands under the conditions laid out in a Declaration of Rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Holland| first = James| title = Fortress Malta An Island Under Siege 1940–43| year = 2003| publisher = Miramax| isbn = 978-1-4013-5186-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control." As part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris in 1814]], Malta became a British colony, ultimately rejecting an attempted integration with the United Kingdom in 1956.

Malta became independent on 21 September 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 constitution Malta initially retained Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]], with a [[Governor-General]] exercising executive authority on her behalf. On 13 December 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]) it became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malta|President]] as [[head of state]]. On 31 March 1979 Malta saw the withdrawal of the last British troops and the [[Royal Navy]] from Malta. This day is known as [[Freedom Day (Malta)|Freedom Day]] and Malta declared itself as a neutral and non-aligned state. Malta joined the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004 and joined the [[Eurozone]] on 1 January 2008.

===Prehistory===
{{See also|Megalithic Temples of Malta|Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni|Għar Dalam}}

[[Pottery]] found by [[archaeologists]] at the [[Skorba Temples]] resembles that found in Italy, and suggests that the Maltese islands were first settled in 5200 BCE mainly by [[Stone Age]] hunters or farmers who had arrived from the Italian island of [[Sicily]], possibly the [[Sicani]]. The extinction of the [[Hippopotamus melitensis|dwarf hippos]] and [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|dwarf elephants]] has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:39:06 Palaeolithic Man in the Maltese Islands], A.

Pottery from the Għar Dalam phase is similar to pottery found in [[Agrigento]], Sicily. A culture of [[megalith]]is temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around the time of 3500 BCE, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic [[Ġgantija]] temples on [[Gozo]];&lt;ref name=otsf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otsf.org/ |title=Old Temples Study Foundation |publisher=OTSF |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; other early temples include those at [[Ħaġar Qim]] and [[Mnajdra]].&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Daniel Cilia, ''Malta Before History'' (2004: Miranda Publishers) {{ISBN|9990985081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|title=Malta|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRGrRy7S750C&amp;pg=PA87|isbn=978-0-7614-0993-9|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.aber.ac.uk/jpg/malta/arch.html |title=Archaeology and prehistory |publisher=Aberystwyth, The University of Wales |accessdate=31 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212031419/http://users.aber.ac.uk/jpg/malta/arch.html |archivedate=12 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex trefoil design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BCE. Animal bones and a knife found behind a removable altar stone suggest that temple rituals included [[animal sacrifice]]. Tentative information suggests that the sacrifices were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmalta.com/museum-of-archaeology |title=Visit Malta-Malta, Gozo, Comino-Museums in Malta-Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Visitmalta.com |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture apparently disappeared from the Maltese Islands around 2500 BCE. Archaeologists speculate that the temple builders fell victim to famine or disease, but this is not certain.

Another archaeological feature of the Maltese Islands often attributed to these ancient builders is equidistant uniform grooves dubbed "cart tracks" or "cart ruts" which can be found in several locations throughout the islands, with the most prominent being those found in [[Misraħ Għar il-Kbir]], which is informally known as "Clapham Junction". These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/archive2009/april2009/title,94480,en.html |title=Ancient mystery solved by geographers |publisher=Port.ac.uk |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229050005/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/archive2009/april2009/title%2C94480%2Cen.html |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mottershead, Derek |author2=Pearson, Alastair |author3=Schaefer, Martin |title=The cart ruts of Malta: an applied geomorphology approach|journal=Antiquity|volume=82|issue=318|year=2008|pages=1065–1079 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00097787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2500 BCE, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of [[Bronze Age]] immigrants, a culture that [[cremation|cremated]] its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called [[dolmen]]s to Malta.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cilia, [http://web.infinito.it/utenti/m/malta_mega_temples/linetime.html "Malta Before Common Era", in ''The Megalithic Temples of Malta''].

They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples.

The Muslim chronicler and geographer [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar|al-Himyari]] recounts that in 870 CE, following [[Siege of Melite (870)|a violent struggle]] against the occupying Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad,&lt;ref name="Travel Malta"&gt;{{cite book|title=Travel Malta|publisher=MobileReference|location=The Arab period and the Middle Ages|isbn=9781611982794}}&lt;/ref&gt; looted and pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048–1049 CE.&lt;ref name="Travel Malta"/&gt; It is uncertain whether this new settlement took place as a consequence of demographic expansion in Sicily, as a result of a higher standard of living in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or as a result of civil war which broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038.&lt;ref&gt;Brincat, M.J.

The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] introduced new irrigation, some fruits and cotton, and the [[Siculo-Arabic]] language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it would eventually evolve into the [[Maltese language]].&lt;ref&gt;

The Norman period was productive; Malta became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Sicily]] which also covered the island of Sicily and the southern half of the [[Italian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; The Catholic Church was reinstated as the state religion with Malta under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|See of Palermo]], and some [[Norman architecture]] sprung up around Malta especially in its ancient capital [[Mdina]].&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; [[Tancred, King of Sicily]], the last Norman monarch, made Malta a [[fief]] of the kingdom and installed a [[count of Malta]]. As the islands were much desired due to their strategic importance, it was during this time the men of Malta were [[Militarization|militarised]] to fend off capture attempts; early counts were skilled [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[privateer]]s.&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt;

The kingdom passed on to the dynasty of [[Hohenstaufen]] from 1194 until 1266. During this period, when Frederick II of Hohenstaufen began to reorganise his Sicilian kingdom, Western culture and religion began to exert their influence more intensely.&lt;ref&gt;Blouet, B. (1987) The Story of Malta. Third Edition. Malta: Progress Press, p.37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Malta was declared a county and a [[Marquess|marquisate]], but its trade was totally ruined.

The island was after the period of Count Roger of the Normans afterwards given up to the Germans, on account of the marriage between Constance, heiress of Sicily, and Henry VI, son of the Emperor Friedrick Barbarossa. Malta was elevated to a county and a marquisate, but its trade was now totally ruined, and for a considerable period of it remained solely a fortified garrison."&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief period the kingdom passed to the [[Capetian House of Anjou]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2017(1951)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf Malta under the Angevins]. melitensiawth.com&lt;/ref&gt; but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in Malta, due in part to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]]'s war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of [[Gozo]] was sacked in 1275.&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; A large revolt on Sicily known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]] followed these attacks, a revolt that saw the Peninsula separating into the Kingdom of Naples.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Relatives of the [[List of Aragonese monarchs|kings of Aragon]] ruled the island until 1409, when it formally passed to the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchy received the title, "Count of Malta". During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the title "Count of Malta" reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction, which caused some conflict. This led the [[Martin I of Sicily]] to abolish the title. Dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count Gonsalvo Monroy.&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; Although they opposed the Count, the Maltese voiced their loyalty to the [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicilian Crown]], which so impressed [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party, and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of [[Mdina]] was given the title of ''Città Notabile'' as a result of this sequence of events.&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt;

===French period===
{{Main|French occupation of Malta}}

The Knights' reign ended when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] captured Malta on his way to [[Egypt]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. Over the years preceding Napoleon's capture of the islands, the power of the Knights had declined and the Order had become unpopular. This was around the time when the universal values of freedom and liberty were incarnated by the [[French Revolution]]. People from both inside the Order and outside appealed to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to oust the Knights. Napoleon Bonaparte did not hesitate. His fleet arrived in 1798, en route to his expedition of Egypt. As a ruse towards the Knights, Napoleon asked for safe harbour to resupply his ships, and then turned his guns against his hosts once safely inside Valletta. Grand Master [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim|Hompesch]] capitulated, and Napoleon entered Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frendo|first=Henry|date=December 1998|title=The French in Malta 1798 – 1800 : reflections on an insurrection|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/camed_0395-9317_1998_num_57_1_1231|journal=Cahiers de la Méditerranée|volume=57|issue=1|pages=143–151|issn=1773-0201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French forces left behind became unpopular with the Maltese, due particularly to the French forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund Napoleon's war efforts. French financial and religious policies so angered the Maltese that they rebelled, forcing the French to depart. Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], sent ammunition and aid to the Maltese and Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|her navy]], which blockaded the islands.&lt;ref name=stbenedict/&gt;

Before the [[Second World War]], Valletta was the location of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[British Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Fleet]]'s headquarters.

During the Second World War, Malta played an important role for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; being a British colony, situated close to Sicily and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes, Malta was bombarded by the Italian and German air forces. Malta was used by the British to launch attacks on the Italian navy and had a submarine base.

Malta achieved its independence as the [[State of Malta]] on 21 September 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]) after intense negotiations with the United Kingdom, led by Maltese Prime Minister [[George Borġ Olivier]]. Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]] and thus [[head of state]], with a [[governor-general]] exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the [[Malta Labour Party]] led by [[Dom Mintoff]] won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]) within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malta|President]] as [[head of state]]. A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Eric R.|title=Religion, Power and Protest in Local Communities: The Northern Shore of the Mediterranean|date=1984|isbn=978-3-11-086116-7|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its expiry, the British base closed down and all lands formerly controlled by the British on the island were given up to the Maltese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenech|first1=Dominic|title=Malta's external security|journal=Geojournal|date=February 1997|volume=41|pages=153–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics of Malta|Government of Malta|Law of Malta}}
Malta is a republic&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt; whose [[parliamentary system]] and [[public administration]] are closely modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. Malta had the second-highest [[voter turnout]] in the world (and the highest for nations without [[mandatory voting]]), based on election turnout in national [[lower house]] elections from 1960 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N. Franklin. "Electoral Participation." in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[unicameral]] Parliament is made up of the President and the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] (Maltese: ''Kamra tad-Deputati''), which is elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the [[President of Malta|President]] either on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|Prime Minister]] or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] and not overturned within three days. In either of these cases, the President may alternatively choose to invite another Member of Parliament who invariably should command the majority of the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] to form an alternative government for the remainder of the legislature.

The House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The 80th article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the president appoint as prime minister "... the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House".&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

The [[President of Malta]] is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority. The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial. The main political parties are the [[Partit Nazzjonalista|Nationalist Party]], which is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party, and the [[Partit Laburista|Labour Party]], which is a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party. As of 2018 the Labour Party is at the helm of the government, the Prime Minister being [[Joseph Muscat]]. The Nationalist Party, with [[Adrian Delia]] as its leader, is in opposition. The [[Democratic Party (Malta)|Democratic Party]] is the only small party which has two seats in parliament; the seats were gained when the Democratic Party contested under the Nationalist Party candidate grouping in the 2017 elections but this arrangement was later terminated in that same year. There are small political parties in Malta which have no parliamentary representation.

Until the [[Second World War]], Maltese politics was dominated by the [[Languages of Malta|language question]] fought out by [[Italophone]] and [[Anglophone]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906002153/http://www.maltavoyager.com/history_independence.html Maltavoyager.com&amp;nbsp;– History&amp;nbsp;– The Independence&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.maltavoyager.com&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war politics dealt with constitutional questions on the relations with Britain (first with [[Maltese integration into the United Kingdom referendum, 1956|integration]] then [[Independence Day (Malta)|independence]]) and, eventually, relations with the [[History of Malta#EU membership|European Union]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Local councils of Malta|Districts of Malta|Regions of Malta}}
{{Largest administrative units of Malta}}
[[File:Malta - administrative division.svg|thumb|[[Local councils of Malta|Administrative divisions]] of Malta]]

Malta has had a system of local government since 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltadata.com/loc-act.pdf |title=Local Council Act of Malta |format=PDF |accessdate=20 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616004627/http://www.maltadata.com/loc-act.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]]. The country is divided into [[Regions of Malta|five regions]] (one of them being Gozo), with each region having its own Regional Committee, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{mt icon}} {{cite book|title=Protokol Lokali u Reġjonali|publisher=Dipartiment tal-Informazzjoni|location=[[Valletta]]|pages=5–6|url=http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Protocol.revised.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617100535/http://www.lc.gov.mt/mediacenter/PDFs/1_Protocol.revised.pdf|archive-date=17 June 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regions are divided into [[Local councils of Malta|local councils]], of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in [[Gozo]]). Sixteen "hamlets", which form part of larger councils, have their own Administrative Committee. The [[Districts of Malta|six districts]] (five on Malta and the sixth being Gozo) serve primarily statistical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta |url=http://www.aer.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/MainIssues/Regional_Democracy/AER_Regionalism_Report/Report_by_country/MALTA_2010.pdf |publisher=[[Assembly of European Regions]] |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208122702/http://www.aer.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/MainIssues/Regional_Democracy/AER_Regionalism_Report/Report_by_country/MALTA_2010.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each council is made up of a number of councillors (from 5 to 13, depending on and relative to the population they represent). A mayor and a [[deputy mayor]] are elected by and from the councillors. The executive secretary, who is appointed by the council, is the executive, administrative and financial head of the council. Councillors are elected every four years through the [[single transferable vote]]. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] as well as resident [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the EU]] are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.

Local councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries. Additionally, a number of individual towns and villages in the Republic of Malta have [[List of twin towns and sister cities in Malta|sister cities]].

===Military===

The objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by the government in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The AFM also engages in combating terrorism, fighting against illicit drug trafficking, conducting anti-illegal immigrant operations and patrols and anti-illegal fishing operations, operating [[search and rescue]] (SAR) services, and physical or electronic security and surveillance of sensitive locations. Malta's search-and-rescue area extends from east of [[Tunisia]] to west of [[Crete]], covering an area of around 250,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As a military organisation, the AFM provides backup support to the [[Malta Police Force]] (MPF) and other government departments/agencies in situations as required in an organised, disciplined manner in the event of national emergencies (such as natural disasters) or internal security and bomb disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afm.gov.mt/en/Pages/AFM.aspx Armed Forces of Malta]. Afm.gov.mt. Retrieved 1 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On another level, the AFM establishes or consolidates [[bilateralism|bilateral co-operation]] with other countries to reach higher operational effectiveness related to AFM roles.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Malta}}
[[File:General map of Malta.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Malta]]

Malta is an [[archipelago]] in the central [[Mediterranean]] (in its eastern basin), some {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the Italian island of [[Sicily]] across the [[Malta Channel]]. Only the three largest islands&amp;nbsp;– [[Malta Island|Malta]] (Malta), [[Gozo]] (Għawdex) and [[Comino]] (Kemmuna)&amp;nbsp;– are inhabited. The smaller islands (see below) are uninhabited. The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a [[land bridge]] between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last [[Ice Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=12783|title=Island Landscape Dynamics: Examples from the Mediterranean|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago is therefore situated in the zone between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.geology.yale.edu/RETREAT/maps/Mediterranean%20map2001sheet1%20tectonics&amp;kinematics.jpg |title=Geodynamic Map of the Mediterranean |author=Commission for the Geological Map of the World |accessdate=28 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180807/http://earth.geology.yale.edu/RETREAT/maps/Mediterranean%20map2001sheet1%20tectonics%26kinematics.jpg |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerom.org/page.asp?ID=7 |title=Geothermal Engineering Research Office Malta |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404163225/http://gerom.org/page.asp?ID=7 |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falconer|first1=William|last2=Falconer|first2=Thomas|title=Dissertation on St. Paul's Voyage|date=1872|publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=978-1-113-68809-5|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3Q29kWRdtgC&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape consists of low hills with terraced fields. The highest point in Malta is [[Ta' Dmejrek]], at {{convert|253|m|ft|abbr=on}}, near [[Dingli]]. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round at [[Baħrija]] near [[Ras ir-Raħeb]], at l-Imtaħleb and San Martin, and at Lunzjata Valley in Gozo.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Malta belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of "Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/ecoregions/mediterranean_forests_scrub.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313050219/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/ecoregions/mediterranean_forests_scrub.cfm |archivedate=13 March 2008 |title=Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub&amp;nbsp;– A Global Ecoregion |publisher=Panda.org |accessdate=28 November 2008 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanisation===
[[File:Valletta, Malta.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The main urban area of Malta. [[Valletta]] is the central peninsula.]]
According to [[Eurostat]], Malta is composed of two [[larger urban zones]] nominally referred to as "Valletta" (the main island of Malta) and "Gozo". According to [[Demographia]], state{{clarify|date=July 2018}} is identified as an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |title=Demographia: World Urban Areas |format=PDF |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]], Malta is identified as functional urban area (FUA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf "Study on Urban Functions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002318/http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }} – European Spatial Planning Observation Network, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to United Nations, about 95 per cent of the area of Malta is urban and the number grows every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2007/2007WUP_Highlights_web.pdf "World Urbanization Prospects"] – Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Population Division, United Nations (Table A.2; page 79)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the results of ESPON and EU Commission studies, "''the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/coheter/coheter_en.pdf "Interim Territorial Cohesion Report"] – Preliminary results of ESPON and EU Commission studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally in the media and official publications Malta is referred to as a [[city-state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terterov|first1=Marat|last2=Reuvid|first2=Jonathan|title=Doing Business with Malta|date=2005|publisher=[[GMB Publishing]]|isbn=9781905050635|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltaculture.com/files/uploads/misc/PART%203%20Education-%20Route%20to%20Market%20-%20Internationalisation%20(8).pdf |title=Creativity Works – A report on Malta's Creative Economy strategy for the Cultural and Creative Industries – Part 3 |publisher=Malta Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Tourism |year=2012 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Maltese coat-of-arms bears a [[mural crown]] described as "representing the fortifications of Malta and denoting a City State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/state/symbols.asp |title="The emblem of Malta", Department of Information |publisher=Doi.gov.mt |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta, with area of {{convert|316|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and population of 0.4&amp;nbsp;million, is one of the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|most densely populated]] countries worldwide.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Malta}}
[[File:AIDAcara Valetta.jpg|thumb|Valletta's maritime industrial zone]]
Malta is classified as an [[advanced economy]] together with 32 other countries according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/02/index.htm |title=IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO)&amp;nbsp;– Recovery, Risk, and Rebalancing, October 2010&amp;nbsp;– Table of Contents |publisher=Imf.org |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1800 Malta depended on cotton, tobacco and its shipyards for exports. Once under British control, they came to depend on [[Malta Dockyard]] for support of the [[Royal Navy]], especially during the [[Crimean War]] of 1854. The military base benefited craftsmen and all those who served the military.

In 1869, the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] gave Malta's economy a great boost, as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered the port. Ships stopping at Malta's docks for refuelling helped the [[Entrepôt]] trade, which brought additional benefits to the island.

However, towards the end of the 19th century the economy began declining, and by the 1940s Malta's economy was in serious crisis. One factor was the longer range of newer merchant ships that required less frequent refuelling stops.
[[File:Mediterraneo dolphin show 1.JPG|thumb|left|The dolphin show at Mediterraneo Marine Park. Tourism generates a significant part of the GDP of Malta.]]
Currently, Malta's major resources are [[limestone]], a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20 per cent of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies because of the drought in the summer and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles) and tourism.

[[File:Eurozone.svg|thumb|right|Malta is part of a monetary union, the [[eurozone]] (dark blue)]]
The government is investing heavily in education, including college.

In preparation for Malta's membership in the [[European Union]], which it joined on 1 May 2004, it [[Privatization|privatised]] some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets. For example, the government announced on 8 January 2007 that it was selling its 40 per cent stake in [[MaltaPost]], to complete a privatisation process which has been ongoing for the past five years. In 2010, Malta managed to privatise telecommunications, postal services, shipyards and shipbuilding.

Malta has a financial regulator, the [[Malta Financial Services Authority]] (MFSA), with a strong business development mindset, and the country has been successful in attracting gaming businesses, aircraft and ship registration, credit-card issuing banking licences and also fund administration. Service providers to these industries, including fiduciary and trustee business, are a core part of the growth strategy of the island. Malta has made strong headway in implementing EU Financial Services Directives including UCITs IV and soon AIFMD. As a base for alternative asset managers who must comply with new directives, Malta has attracted a number of key players including IDS, Iconic Funds, [[Apex Fund Services]] and TMF/Customs House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financemalta.org/funds |title=Malta funds |publisher=Financemalta.org |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta and [[Tunisia]] are currently discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for petroleum exploration. These discussions are also undergoing between Malta and [[Libya]] for similar arrangements.

Malta does not have a property tax. Its property market, especially around the harbour area, has been in constant boom, with the prices of apartments in some towns like St Julian's, Sliema and Gzira skyrocketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apartments.com.mt/location/sliema/ |title=Apartments.com.mt |publisher=apartments.com.mt |date=10 February 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Maltese GDP per capita stood at [[Economy of the European Union#Richest and poorest NUTS regions (GDP PPP 2010)|88 per cent of the EU average]] in 2015 with €21,000.&lt;ref name="Eurostat 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Europa web portal|author=Eurostat|date=1 December 2016|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking and finance===
[[File:Malta - St. Julian's (Triq it-Torri (Sliema)) 03 ies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Portomaso Business Tower]], the tallest building in Malta]]
The two largest commercial banks are [[Bank of Valletta]] and [[HSBC Bank Malta]], both of which can trace their origins back to the 19th century.

The [[Central Bank of Malta]] (Bank Ċentrali ta' Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. It was established by the Central Bank of Malta Act on 17 April 1968. The Maltese government entered [[ERM II]] on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6288084.stm|title=Cyprus and Malta to adopt euros|date=10 July 2007|work=BBC News Business|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FinanceMalta is the quasi-governmental organisation tasked with marketing and educating business leaders in coming to Malta and runs seminars and events around the world highlighting the emerging strength of Malta as a jurisdiction for banking and finance and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financemalta.org |title=promoting financial services in Malta |publisher=FinanceMalta |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Malta|Malta bus}}
[[File:Map of Malta 2.png|thumb|Principal highways]]
Traffic in Malta [[Driving on the left or right|drives on the left]]. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union. The number of registered cars in 1990 amounted to 182,254, giving an automobile density of {{Pop density|182254|316|km2|sqmi|prec=0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/33384971|author1=Sammut, Michael |author2=Savona-Ventura, Charles |title=Petrol Lead in a Small Island Environment|journal=International Journal of Risk &amp; Safety in Medicine|volume=9 |year=1996|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has {{convert|2254|km|0|abbr=off}} of road, {{convert|1972|km|0|abbr=on}} (87.5 per cent) of which are paved and {{convert|282|km|0|abbr=on}} were unpaved (as of December 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country/mt-malta/tra-transportation|title=''NationMaster''&amp;nbsp;– Transportation statistics|accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main roads of Malta from the southernmost point to the northernmost point are these: Triq Birżebbuġa in [[Birżebbuġa]], [[Għar Dalam]] Road and [[Tal-Barrani]] Road in [[Żejtun]], Santa Luċija Avenue in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], Aldo Moro Street (Trunk Road), 13 December Street and [[Ħamrun]]-Marsa Bypass in [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]], Regional Road in [[Santa Venera]]/[[Msida]]/[[Gżira]]/[[San Ġwann]], St Andrew's Road in [[Swieqi]]/[[Pembroke, Malta]], Coast Road in [[Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq]], Salina Road, Kennedy Drive, St. Paul's Bypass and [[Xemxija]] Hill in [[San Pawl il-Baħar]], Mistra Hill, Wettinger Street (Mellieħa Bypass) and Marfa Road in [[Mellieħa]].

[[File:Malta Busse 2016.jpg|thumb|Maltese ''Otokar'' buses]]
[[Malta bus|Buses]] (''xarabank'' or ''karozza tal-linja'') are the primary method of public transport. Established in 1905, they operated in the Maltese islands up to 2011 and became popular tourist attractions in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/malta/8606494/End-of-the-road-no-more-fares-for-Maltas-vintage-buses.html|title=End of the road: no more fares for Malta's vintage buses|first=Jake Wallis|last=Simons|date=1 July 2011|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are depicted on many Maltese advertisements to promote tourism as well as on gifts and merchandise for tourists.

The bus service underwent an extensive reform in July 2011. The management structure changed from having self-employed drivers driving their own vehicles to a service being offered by a single company through a public tender (in Gozo, being considered as a small network, the service was given through direct order).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitc.gov.mt/page.aspx?pageid=52 |title=Ministeru għall-Infrastruttura Transport u Komunikazzjoni&amp;nbsp;– Transport Pubbliku |publisher=Mitc.gov.mt |accessdate=15 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113172538/https://mitc.gov.mt/page.aspx?pageid=52 |archivedate=13 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public tender was won by Arriva Malta, a member of the [[Arriva]] group, which introduced a fleet of brand new buses, built by [[King Long]] especially for service by Arriva Malta and including a smaller fleet of [[articulated bus]]es brought in from [[Arriva London]]. It also operated two smaller buses for an intra-[[Valletta]] route only and 61 nine-metre buses, which were used to ease congestion on high density routes. Overall Arriva Malta operated 264 buses. On 1 January 2014 Arriva ceased operations in Malta due to financial difficulties, having been nationalised as ''Malta Public Transport'' by the Maltese government, with a new bus operator planned to take over their operations in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arriva Future Decided|url=http://www.di-ve.com/news/arriva-future-decided|accessdate=25 August 2014|work=di-ve.com news|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sansone|first1=Kurt|title=New Year in, Arriva out|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20131223/local/New-Year-in-Arriva-out.500112|accessdate=25 August 2014|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times]]|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government chose Autobuses Urbanos de León as its preferred bus operator for the country in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalli|first1=Kim|title=New bus operator to start in January|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141001/local/New-bus-operator-to-start-in-January.537947|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times]]|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company took over the bus service on 8 January 2015, while retaining the name ''Malta Public Transport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spanish company takes over bus service|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150108/local/spanish-company-takes-over-bus-service.551080|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times]]|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced the pre-pay 'tallinja card'.

From 1883 to 1931 Malta had a railway line that connected [[Valletta]] to the army barracks at [[Mtarfa]] via [[Mdina]] and a number of towns and villages. The railway fell into disuse and eventually closed altogether, following the introduction of electric trams and buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20161002/life-features/The-end-of-the-Malta-Railway.626750|title=The end of the Malta Railway|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the bombing of Malta during the Second World War, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] announced that his forces had destroyed the railway system, but by the time war broke out, the railway had been mothballed for more than nine years.

[[File:Valletta-Harbour.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Harbour]]]]
[[File:Malta Freeport from Pretty Bay at Birzebbuga.jpg|thumb|[[Malta Freeport]], one of the largest European ports]]

Malta has three large natural harbours on its main island:
* The [[Grand Harbour]] (or Port il-Kbir), located at the eastern side of the capital city of [[Valletta]], has been a harbour since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. It has several extensive [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[Wharf|wharves]], as well as a cruise liner terminal. A terminal at the Grand Harbour serves [[ferries]] that connect Malta to [[Pozzallo]] &amp; [[Catania]] in Sicily.
* [[Marsamxett Harbour]], located on the western side of Valletta, accommodates a number of yacht marinas.
* [[Marsaxlokk Harbour]] (Malta Freeport), at [[Birżebbuġa]] on the south-eastern side of Malta, is the islands' main cargo terminal. Malta Freeport is the [[List of world's busiest container ports|11th busiest container ports in continent of Europe and 46th in the World]] with a trade volume of 2.3&amp;nbsp;million [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU's]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/Statistics/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%2020081.pdf |title=AAPA World Port Rankings 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two-man-made harbours that serve a passenger and car ferry service that connects [[Ċirkewwa]] Harbour on Malta and [[Mġarr (Gozo)|Mġarr Harbour]] on [[Gozo]]. The ferry makes numerous runs each day.

[[File:Malta International Airport2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Malta International Airport]]]]

[[Malta International Airport]] (Ajruport Internazzjonali ta' Malta) is the only airport serving the Maltese islands. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the [[RAF Luqa]] air base. A heliport is also located there, but the scheduled service to Gozo ceased in 2006. The heliport in Gozo is at [[Xewkija]]. Since June 2007, [[Harbour Air Malta]] has operated a thrice-daily floatplane service between the sea terminal in Grand Harbour and Mgarr Harbour in Gozo.

Two further airfields at [[Ta' Qali]] and [[Ħal Far]] operated during the Second World War and into the 1960s but are now closed. Today, [[Ta' Qali]] houses a national park, [[Ta' Qali Stadium|stadium]], the Crafts Village visitor attraction and the [[Malta Aviation Museum]]. This museum preserves several aircraft, including [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] and [[Spitfire]] fighters that defended the island in the Second World War.

[[File:9H-AEP A320 Air Malta (14806272801).jpg|thumb|An Air Malta [[Airbus A320]].]]

The national airline is [[Air Malta]], which is based at Malta International Airport and operates services to 36 destinations in Europe and North Africa. The owners of Air Malta are the [[Government of Malta]] (98 per cent) and private investors (2 percent). Air Malta employs 1,547 staff. It has a 25 per cent shareholding in [[Medavia]].

Air Malta has concluded over 191 interline ticketing agreements with other IATA airlines. It also has a codeshare agreement with [[Qantas]] covering three routes. In September 2007, Air Malta made two agreements with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways by which Air Malta wet-leased two Airbus aircraft to [[Etihad Airways]] for the winter period starting 1 September 2007, and provided operational support on another Airbus A320 aircraft which it leased to Etihad Airways.

Telephone and cellular subscribers' numbers have eight digits. There are no [[area code]]s in Malta, but after inception, the original first two numbers, and currently the 3rd and 4th digit, were assigned according to the locality. [[Fixed line]] telephone numbers have the prefix 21 and 27, although businesses may have numbers starting 22 or 23. An example would be 2*80**** if from [[Żabbar]], and 2*23**** if from [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]]. Gozitan landline numbers generally are assigned 2*56****. Mobile telephone numbers have the prefix 77, 79, 98 or 99. When calling Malta from abroad, one must first dial the international access code, then the country code +356 and the subscriber's number.

The number of pay TV subscribers fell as customers switched to [[IPTV|Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV): the number of IPTV subscribers doubled in the six months to June 2012.

In late 2012, [[GO (Malta)|GO]] began expanding its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) network and capabilities, offering speeds of up to 200Mbit/s for its 'rapido' service.

In early 2012, the government called for a national FttH network to be built, with a minimum broadband service being upgraded from 4Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddeblog.com.au/frompaulsdesk/investment-in-fibre-networks-stimulates-national-ftth-ambitions-in-malta/ |title=Investment in fibre networks stimulates national FttH ambitions in Malta – BuddeBlog |publisher=Buddeblog.com.au |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency===
{{Main|Maltese euro coins|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Malta)}}
[[Maltese euro coins]] feature the [[Maltese cross]] on €2 and €1 coins, the [[coat of arms of Malta]] on the €0.50, €0.20 and €0.10 coins, and the [[Mnajdra]] Temples on the €0.05, €0.02 and €0.01 coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymalta.com/wt/2006/06/maltese-cross-on-euro-coins.shtml|title=Maltese Cross on the Euro coins|work=Malta Media|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has produced collectors' coins with face value ranging from 10 to 50 euro. These coins continue an existing national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not accepted in all the eurozone. For instance, a €10 Maltese commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

From 1972 until introduction of the Euro in 2008, the currency was the [[Maltese lira]], which had replaced the Maltese pound. The pound replaced the [[Maltese scudo]] in 1825.

===Tourism===

Malta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6&amp;nbsp;million tourists per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/en/publication/unwto-tourism-highlights-2014-edition|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights, 2015 Edition|work=''unwto.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three times more tourists visit than there are residents. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=57309 |title=More Maltese travel abroad |work=The Malta Independent |accessdate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215013655/http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=57309 |archivedate=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a [[medical tourism]] destination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=61027|title=M for Malta and medical tourism|accessdate=7 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216064632/http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=61027 |archivedate=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of [[health tourism provider]]s are developing the industry. However, no Maltese hospital has undergone independent [[international healthcare accreditation]]. Malta is popular with British medical tourists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treatmentabroad.net/medical-tourism/news/november-2007/malta-popular-with-uk-medical-tourists |title=Malta popular with UK medical tourists |publisher=Treatmentabroad.net |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]].

===Science and technology===
Malta signed a co-operation agreement with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) for more-intensive co-operation in ESA projects.&lt;ref name="Malta signs Cooperation Agreement with ESA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMH012YRYG_index_0.html Malta signs Cooperation Agreement with ESA].

The Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is the civil body responsible for the development of science and technology on an educational and social level. Most science students in Malta graduate from the University of Malta and are represented by S-Cubed (Science Student's Society), UESA (University Engineering Students Association) and ICTSA (University of Malta ICT Students' Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scubed.org.mt/|title=SCubed – Science Student Society|work=S-Cubed – Science Student Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictsamalta.org/|title=ICTSA|work=''ictsamalta.org'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta conducts a census of population and housing every ten years. The census held in November 2005 counted an estimated 96 per cent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nso.gov.mt/en/publicatons/Publications_by_Unit/Documents/01_Methodology_and_Research/Census2005_Vol2.pdf Census of Population and Housing 2005]. Vol. 2. National Statistics Office, Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report was issued in April 2006 and the results were weighted to estimate for 100 per cent of the population.

Native [[Maltese people]] make up the majority of the island. However, there are minorities, the largest of which are [[British people|Britons]], many of whom are retirees.

All censuses since 1842 have shown a slight excess of females over males. The 1901 and 1911 censuses came closest to recording a balance&lt;!-- (1000:1000 and 1003:1000 respectively) --&gt;. The highest female-to-male ratio was reached in 1957 (1088:1000) but since then the ratio has dropped continuously. The 2005 census showed a 1013:1000 female-to-male ratio&lt;!--Table 2: Population and sex ratio: 1842–2005--&gt;.
Population growth has slowed down, from +9.5 per cent between the 1985 and 1995 censuses, to +6.9 per cent between the 1995 and 2005 censuses (a yearly average of +0.7 per cent)&lt;!--Commentary p. xvii &amp; Chart 3: Percentage population change between censuses--&gt;. The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8 per cent from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents).&lt;ref name="NSO 20060711"&gt;{{cite press release|title=World Population Day&amp;nbsp;– 2006: Special Observances |publisher=National Statistics Office |location=Valletta |date=10 July 2006 |url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1719 |accessdate=12 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190022/http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=1719 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
[[File:Il-Kantilena.png|thumb|right|''[[Il-Kantilena]]'' by [[Pietru Caxaro]], the oldest text in [[Maltese language]], 15th century]]
{{Main|Languages of Malta}}
{{See also|#Education}}
The [[Maltese language]] ({{lang-mt|Malti}}) is one of the two constitutional [[languages]] of Malta, having become official, however, only in 1934, and being considered as the national language. Previously, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] was the official and cultural language of Malta from the 12th century, and [[Tuscan dialect]] of [[Italian language|Italian]] from the 16th century. Alongside Maltese, English is also an official language of the country and hence the laws of the land are enacted both in Maltese and English. However, article 74 of the Constitution states that "... if there is any conflict between the Maltese and the English texts of any law, the Maltese text shall prevail."&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

Maltese is a [[Semitic language]] descended from the now defunct Sicilian-Arabic ([[Siculo-Arabic]]) dialect (from [[southern Italy]]) that developed during the [[Emirate of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=MED&gt;Joseph M. Brincat [http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm Maltese&amp;nbsp;– an unusual formula], MED Magazine (February 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maltese alphabet]] consists of 30 letters based on the [[Latin alphabet]], including the [[diacritic]]ally altered letters ''[[ż]]'', ''[[ċ]]'' and ''[[ġ]]'', as well as the letters ''[[għ]]'', ''[[ħ]]'', and ''[[Ie (digraph)|ie]]''.

Maltese has a Semitic base with substantial borrowing from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], Italian, a little French, and more recently and increasingly, English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/study2.html|title=Evolution of the Maltese Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid character of Maltese was established by a long period of Maltese-Sicilian urban bilingualism gradually transforming rural speech and which ended in the early 19th century with Maltese emerging as the vernacular of the entire native population. The language includes different dialects that can vary greatly from one town to another or from one island to another.

The [[Eurobarometer]] states that 97% per cent of the Maltese population consider Maltese as mother tongue. Also, 88 per cent of the population speak English, 66 per cent speak Italian, and 17 per cent speak French.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt; This widespread knowledge of [[second language]]s makes Malta one of the most multilingual countries in the [[European Union]]. A study collecting public opinion on what language was "preferred" discovered that 86 per cent of the population express a preference for Maltese, 12 per cent for English, and 2 per cent for Italian.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt; Still, Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as [[Mediaset]] and [[RAI]], reach Malta and remain popular.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView&gt;Ignasi Badia i Capdevila (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120312145908/http://www6.gencat.cat/llengcat/noves/hm04primavera-estiu/a_badia2_3.htm A view of the linguistic situation in Malta].

{{Main |Religion in Malta}}
{{Further |History of the Jews in Malta|Christianity in Malta|Islam in Malta}}

The predominant religion in Malta is [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. The second article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] establishes Catholicism as the [[state religion]] and it is also reflected in various elements of [[Culture of Malta|Maltese culture]], although [[Entrenched clause|entrenched provisions]] for the freedom of religion are made.&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

There are more than 360 churches in Malta, Gozo and Comino, or one church for every 1,000 residents. The parish church (Maltese: ''"il-parroċċa"'', or ''"il-knisja parrokkjali"'') is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village, and its main source of civic pride. This civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village ''festas'', which mark the day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands, religious processions, special [[Holy Mass|Masses]], [[fireworks]] (especially petards) and other festivities.

Malta is an [[Apostolic See]]; the [[Acts of the Apostles]] tells of how [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], on his way from Jerusalem to Rome to face trial, was shipwrecked on the island of "Melite", which many Bible scholars identify with Malta, an episode dated around AD 60.&lt;ref name="doi.gov.mt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/islands/dates.asp |title=Department of Information |publisher=Doi.gov.mt |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul spent three months on the island on his way to Rome, curing the sick including the father of Publius, the "chief man of the island". Various traditions are associated with this account. The shipwreck is said to have occurred in the place today known as [[St Paul's Bay]]. The Maltese saint, [[Saint Publius]] is said to have been made Malta's first bishop and a grotto in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], now known as "St Paul's Grotto" (and in the vicinity of which evidence of Christian burials and rituals from the 3rd century AD has been found), is among the earliest known places of Christian worship on the island.

Further evidence of Christian practices and beliefs during the period of Roman persecution appears in [[catacombs]] that lie beneath various sites around Malta, including St Paul's Catacombs and St Agatha's Catacombs in Rabat, just outside the walls of [[Mdina]]. The latter, in particular, were beautifully frescoed between 1200 and 1480, although marauding [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] defaced many of them in the 1550s. There are also a number of cave churches, including the grotto at [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa|Mellieħa]], which is a Shrine of the Nativity of Our Lady where, according to legend, [[St. Luke]] painted a picture of the [[The Madonna|Madonna]]. It has been a place of pilgrimage since [[medieval]] times.

The Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] record that in 451 AD a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (''Melitenus Episcopus''). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, ''Episcopus Melitenensis'', was present at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. In 588 AD, [[Pope Gregory I]] deposed Tucillus, ''Miletinae civitatis episcopus'' and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD. The last recorded Bishop of Malta before the invasion of the islands was a Greek named Manas, who was subsequently incarcerated at [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09574a.htm | work = Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Malta | publisher =New advent |accessdate= 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltese historian [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]] states that following their conversion to Christianity at the hand of [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], the Maltese retained their Christian religion, despite the [[Fatimid]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Abela, G.F. (1647) ''Della Descrittione di Malta (1647) Malta''.&lt;/ref&gt; Abela's writings describe Malta as a divinely ordained "bulwark of Christian, European civilization against the spread of Mediterranean Islam".&lt;ref&gt;Luttrell, A. (2002) ''The Making of Christian Malta: From the Early Middle Ages to 1530'', Aldershot, Hants.: Ashgate Varorium. {{ISBN|0-86078849-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The native Christian community that welcomed [[Roger I of Sicily]]&lt;ref name="malticross"/&gt; was further bolstered by immigration to Malta from Italy, in the 12th and 13th centuries.

For centuries, the Church in Malta was subordinate to the [[Diocese of Palermo]], except when it was under [[Charles of Anjou]], who appointed bishops for Malta, as did&amp;nbsp;– on rare occasions&amp;nbsp;– the Spanish and later, the Knights. Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the [[History of Malta#Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisitor of Malta]] had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the period of the [[Republic of Venice]], several Maltese families emigrated to [[Corfu]]. Their descendants account for about two-thirds of the community of some 4,000 Catholics that now live on that island.

[[File:Greek Orthodox Church of Saint George in Valletta.jpeg|thumb|The Greek Orthodox church of St. Georg in Valletta]]
The patron saints of Malta are [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], [[Saint Publius]] and [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]]. Although not a patron saint, [[George Preca|St George Preca]] (San Ġorġ Preca) is greatly revered as the second canonised Maltese saint after [[St. Publius]] Malta's first acknowledged saint (canonised in the year 1634). [[Pope Benedict XVI]] canonised him on 3 June 2007. Also, a number of Maltese individuals are recognised as [[Beatification|Blessed]], including [[Maria Adeodata Pisani]] and [[Nazju Falzon]], with [[Pope John Paul II]] having [[beatified]] them in 2001.

Various Catholic religious orders are present in Malta, including the [[Jesuits]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Little Sisters of the Poor]].

Most congregants of the local [[Protestant]] churches are not Maltese; their congregations draw on the many British retirees living in the country and vacationers from many other nations. There are approximately 600 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| year = 2015 | title = Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses |publisher=Watch Tower Society |page= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the Bible Baptist Church, and the [[Fellowship of Evangelical Churches]] each have about 60 affiliates. There are also some churches of other denominations, including [[St. Andrew's Scots Church, Malta|St. Andrew's Scots Church]] in Valletta (a joint [[Presbyterian]] and [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] congregation) and [[St Paul's Anglican Cathedral]], and a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] church in [[Birkirkara]]. A [[New Apostolic Church]] congregation was founded in 1983 in Gwardamangia.&lt;ref name="archive.maltatoday.com.mt"&gt;Vassallo, Harry (8 April 2009) [http://archive.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/04/08/t5.html A map of faith in Malta].

The Jewish population of Malta reached its peak in the Middle Ages under Norman rule. In 1479, Malta and [[Sicily]] came under [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] rule and the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492 forced all Jews to leave the country, permitting them to take with them only a few of their belongings. Several dozen Maltese Jews may have [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity at the time to remain in the country. Today, there is one Jewish congregation.&lt;ref name="archive.maltatoday.com.mt" /&gt;

In a survey held by the [[Malta Today]], it was found that approximately 4.5 per cent of the population of Malta gives no preference to any religious belief. The number of [[Atheists]] has exponentially grown, by doubling from 2014 to 2016. [[Non-religious]] people have a higher risk to suffer from discrimination, such as lack of trust by society and unequal treatment by institutions. In the 2015 edition of the annual [[International Humanist and Ethical Union#The Freedom of Thought Report|Freedom of Thought Report]] from the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]], Malta was in the category of "severe discrimination". In 2016, following the [[Blasphemy law#Malta|abolishment of blasphemy law]], Malta was shifted to the category of "systematic discrimination" (which is the same category as most EU countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=9 December 2016|first=Philip Leone |last=Ganado|title=Malta still discriminating against the non-religious – report|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20161209/local/malta-still-discriminating-against-the-non-religious-report.633311|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210140814/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20161209/local/malta-still-discriminating-against-the-non-religious-report.633311|archivedate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Immigration to Malta}}

Most of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on [[Sliema]] and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, Libyans and Serbians, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070805/opinion/genetic-origin-of-contemporary-maltese|title=Genetic origin of contemporary Maltese|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Malta guards Europe's gates against African immigrants|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/09/world/la-fg-malta-refugees-20101009|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[European Union]] and of the [[Schengen agreement]], Malta is bound by the [[Dublin Regulation]] to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Maltese Anger Mounts Over Rising Illegal Immigration|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,3621641,00.html|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular migrants who land in Malta are subject to a [[immigration detention|compulsory detention policy]], being held in several camps organised by the [[Armed Forces of Malta]] (AFM), including those near [[Ħal Far]] and [[Safi, Malta|Ħal Safi]]. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that Malta's detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/18/malta-migrant-detention-violates-rights|title=Malta: Migrant Detention Violates Rights|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Malta faces problems with children of illegal immigrants|work=[[The Times (Malta)|The Times]]|url= http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080610/local/malta-faces-problems-with-children-of-illegal-immigrants.211803|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Malta started granting citizenship for a €650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=Passport King Christian Kalin Helps Nations Sell Citizenship – Bloomberg Business|author=Clenfield, Jason |date=11 March 2015|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Emigration from Malta}}
In the 19th century, most emigration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East, although rates of [[Repatriation|return migration]] to Malta were high.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modern emigration from Malta|first=Huw R.|last=Jones|year=1973|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|volume=60|issue=60|pages=101–119|jstor=621508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in [[Tunisia]], and in 1903 it was claimed that 15,000 people of Maltese origin were living in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name=Attard&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Exodus (1918–1939)|first=Lawrence E.|last=Attard|year=1989|location=Malta|publisher=Publishers Enterprises Group|url=http://www.maltamigration.com/history/exodus/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta experienced significant emigration as a result of the collapse of a construction boom in 1907 and after the Second World War, when the [[birth rate]] increased significantly, but in the 20th century most emigrants went to destinations in the [[New World]], particularly to Australia, Canada and the United States. After the Second World War, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Between 1946 and the late-1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6% migrating to Australia, 22% to the UK, 13% to Canada and 7% to the United States.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Maltese migration cycle: An archival survey|first=Russell|last=King|year=1979|journal=Area|volume=11|issue=3|pages=245–249|jstor=20001477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 [[expatriate]] communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in [[Maltese in Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Malta}}
{{See also|List of schools in Malta}}
[[File:Uni-20malta.jpg|thumb|[[University of Malta]]]]
[[File:Bibliothek in Malta, in Valletta.JPG|thumb|Library in [[Valletta]]]]

Primary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971. The state and the [[Catholic Church|Church]] provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and [[Gozo]], including [[De La Salle College (Malta)|De La Salle College]] in [[Cospicua]], [[St Aloysius' College (Malta)|St. Aloysius' College]] in [[Birkirkara]], [[St. Paul's Missionary College]] in [[Rabat, Malta]], St. Joseph's School in [[Blata l-Bajda]] and [[List of schools in Malta|Saint Monica Girls' School]] in [[Mosta]]. {{As of|2006}}, state schools are organised into networks known as Colleges and incorporate kindergarten schools, primary and secondary schools. A number of private schools are run in Malta, including [[San Andrea School]] and [[San Anton School]] in the valley of L-Imselliet (l/o [[Mġarr]]), [[St. Martin's College]] in Swatar and St. Michael's School in [[San Ġwann]]. St. Catherine's High School, Pembroke offers an International Foundation Course for students wishing to learn English before entering mainstream education. {{As of|2008}}, there are two international schools, Verdala International School and QSI Malta. The state pays a portion of the teachers' salary in Church schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/education.html|title=Education in Malta|publisher=aboutmalta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education in Malta is based on the [[Education in the United Kingdom|British model]]. Primary school lasts six years. At the age of 11 pupils sit for an examination to enter a secondary school, either a [[church school]] (the Common Entrance Examination) or a [[state school]]. Pupils sit for SEC [[O-level]] examinations at the age of 16, with passes obligatory in certain subjects such as mathematics, English and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. Pupils may opt to continue studying at a [[sixth form college]] such as [[Gan Frangisk Abela Junior College]], [[St Aloysius' College (Malta)|St. Aloysius' College]], Giovanni Curmi Higher Secondary, [[De La Salle College (Malta)|De La Salle College]], St Edward's College, or else at another post-secondary institution such as [[MCAST]]. The sixth form course lasts for two years, at the end of which students sit for the Matriculation examination. Subject to their performance, students may then apply for an undergraduate [[academic degree|degree]] or diploma.

The [[University of Malta]] (U.o.M.) provides Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level. The adult [[literacy rate]] is 99.5 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/malta/literacy-rate |title=Malta – Literacy rate |publisher=Indexmundi.com |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This section is linked to from the "Languages" section above. If changing the section title, update the link as well. --&gt;

Maltese and English are both used to teach pupils at primary and secondary school level, and both languages are also compulsory subjects. [[Public school (government funded)|Public schools]] tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the [[University of Malta]]; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt; Most university courses are in English.&lt;ref name=MED/&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2015}}

Of the total number of pupils studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51 per cent take Italian whilst 38 per cent take French. Other choices include German, Russian, Spanish, Latin, Chinese and Arabic.&lt;ref name=LinguisticView/&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=580 |title=Foreign Language Learning; National Statistics Office&amp;nbsp;– Malta; 1 September 2004 |work=gov.mt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114113545/http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=580 |archivedate=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta is also a popular destination to study the English language, attracting over 80,000 students in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Malta on the rebound, language student arrivals up 18.2 per cent over last year – ICEF Monitor – Market intelligence for international student recruitment|url = http://monitor.icef.com/2013/04/malta-on-the-rebound-language-student-arrivals-up-18-2-over-last-year/|accessdate = 23 September 2015|date = 12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has a long history of providing [[publicly funded health care]]. The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/hotsprings/2615/medhist/hospital2.htm |title=Civil Hospitals in Malta in the Last Two Hundred Years |publisher=Geocities.com |accessdate=31 March 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hotsprings/2615/medhist/hospital2.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:12:01|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, Malta has both a public healthcare system, known as the government healthcare service, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a [[private healthcare]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahha.gov.mt/pages.aspx?page=156 |title=The Health Care System in Malta_1 |publisher=Sahha.gov.mt |accessdate=31 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711220500/http://www.sahha.gov.mt/pages.aspx?page=156 |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.mt/servicecluster.asp?s=4&amp;l=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305122930/http://www.gov.mt/servicecluster.asp?s=4&amp;l=2|archivedate=5 March 2005 |title=Government of Malta&amp;nbsp;– Health Services |publisher=Gov.mt |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care.

Malta also boasts voluntary organisations such as Alpha Medical (Advanced Care), the Emergency Fire &amp; Rescue Unit (E.F.R.U.), St John Ambulance and Red Cross Malta who provide first aid/nursing services during events involving crowds.

The [[Mater Dei Hospital]], Malta's primary hospital, opened in 2007. It has one of the largest medical buildings in Europe.

The [[University of Malta]] has a [[medical school]] and a Faculty of [[Health Sciences]], the latter offering diploma, degree (BSc) and postgraduate degree courses in a number of health care disciplines.

The [[Medical Association of Malta]] represents practitioners of the medical profession. The [[Malta Medical Students' Association]] (MMSA) is a separate body representing Maltese medical students, and is a member of [[European Medical Students' Association|EMSA]] and [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations|IFMSA]]. [[Malta Institute for Medical Education|MIME]], the Maltese Institute for Medical Education, is an institute set up recently to provide CME to physicians in Malta as well as medical students. The [[Foundation Program]] followed in the UK has been introduced in Malta to stem the 'brain drain' of newly graduated physicians to the British Isles. The [[Malta Association of Dental Students]] (MADS) is a student association set up to promote the rights of Dental Surgery Students studying within the faculty of Dental Surgery of the University of Malta. It is affiliated with [[IADS]], the International Association of Dental Students.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Malta}}
The culture of Malta reflects the various cultures, from the Phoenicians to the British, that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries, including neighbouring Mediterranean cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled Malta for long periods of time prior to its [[Independence Day (Malta)|independence]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180926/community/the-struggle-for-independence.690050|title=The struggle for independence|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=26 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manoel theatre (12851453033).jpg|thumb|[[Manoel Theatre]], Europe's third-oldest working theatre. Now Malta's National Theatre and home to the [[Malta Philharmonic Orchestra]].]]
While Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as [[Għana (folk music)|għana]]. This consists of background [[folk guitar]] music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice. The aim of the lyrics, which are improvised, is to create a friendly yet challenging atmosphere, and it takes a number of years of practice to be able to combine the required artistic qualities with the ability to [[debate]] effectively.

===Literature===
{{Main|Maltese literature}}
Documented Maltese literature is over 200 years old. However, a recently unearthed love ballad testifies to literary activity in the local tongue from the Medieval period. Malta followed a Romantic literary tradition, culminating in the works of [[Dun Karm Psaila]], Malta's National Poet. Subsequent writers like [[Ruzar Briffa]] and [[Karmenu Vassallo]] tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The next generation of writers, including [[Karl Schembri]] and [[Immanuel Mifsud]], widened the tracks further, especially in prose and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|publisher=Int'l Business Publications, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781433063503|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vallettaupperbarraccagardens.JPG|thumb|left|Lower Barrakka Gardens]]

Maltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history. The first settlers on the island constructed [[Ġgantija]], one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world. The Neolithic temple builders 3800–2500 BC endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas relief designs, including spirals evocative of the tree of life and animal portraits, designs painted in red ochre, ceramics and a vast collection of human form sculptures, particularly the Venus of Malta. These can be viewed at the temples themselves (most notably, the [[Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni|Hypogeum]] and Tarxien Temples), and at the National Museum of Archaeology in [[Valletta]]. Malta's temples such as Imnajdra are full of history and have a story behind them. Malta is currently undergoing several large-scale building projects, including the construction of [[SmartCity Malta]], the [[M-Towers]] and [[Pendergardens]], while areas such as the [[Valletta Waterfront]] and [[Tigné Point]] have been or are being renovated.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Roman period introduced highly decorative mosaic floors, marble colonnades and classical statuary, remnants of which are beautifully preserved and presented in the Roman Domus, a country villa just outside the walls of [[Mdina]]. The early Christian frescoes that decorate the [[catacombs]] beneath Malta reveal a propensity for eastern, [[Byzantine]] tastes. These tastes continued to inform the endeavours of [[medieval]] Maltese artists, but they were increasingly influenced by the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Southern Gothic]] movements. Towards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in neighbouring Sicily, came under the influence of the School of [[Antonello da Messina]], which introduced [[Renaissance]] ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta.&lt;ref name="hopeandoptimism1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopeandoptimism.com/essay.htm |title=An Overview of the Art of Malta|author=Cutajar, D. |publisher=Hopeandoptimism.com |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaravaggioJeromeValletta.jpg|thumb|Saint Jerome Writing, by Caravaggio. Held in St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta.]]

The artistic heritage of Malta blossomed under the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]], who brought Italian and Flemish [[Mannerist]] painters to decorate their palaces and the churches of these islands, most notably, [[Matteo Perez d'Aleccio]], whose works appear in the [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta|Magisterial Palace]] and in the [[St. John's Co-Cathedral|Conventual Church of St. John]] in Valletta, and Filippo Paladini, who was active in Malta from 1590 to 1595. For many years, Mannerism continued to inform the tastes and ideals of local Maltese artists.&lt;ref name="hopeandoptimism1"/&gt;

The arrival in Malta of [[Caravaggio]], who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|Saint Jerome Writing]]'', are on display in the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582–1637) and [[Stefano Erardi]] (1630–1716). However, the [[Baroque]] movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, [[Mattia Preti]] transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Valletta]]. During this period, local sculptor [[Melchiorre Cafà|Melchior Gafà]] (1639–1667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Siege of malta 3.jpg|thumb|left|''The Siege of Malta&amp;nbsp;– Flight of the Turks'', by Matteo Perez d'Aleccio]]

During the 17th and 18th century, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] and [[Rococo]] influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters [[Luca Giordano]] (1632–1705) and [[Francesco Solimena]] (1657–1747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as [[Gio Nicola Buhagiar]] (1698–1752) and [[Francesco Zahra]] (1710–1773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of [[Antoine de Favray]] (1706–1798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Neo-classicism]] made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities&amp;nbsp;– perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta&amp;nbsp;– favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the [[Nazarene movement]] of artists. [[Romanticism]], tempered by the naturalism introduced to Malta by [[Giuseppe Calì]], informed the "salon" artists of the early 20th century, including Edward and Robert Caruana Dingli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malta Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|publisher=|isbn=9781438774978|location=|pages=|last1=Publications|first1=U.S.A.

Parliament established the National School of Art in the 1920s. During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the "Modern Art Group", whose members included [[Josef Kalleya]] (1898–1998), [[George Preca (artist)|George Preca]] (1909–1984), [[Anton Inglott]] (1915–1945), [[Emvin Cremona]] (1919–1987), [[Frank Portelli]] (1922–2004), [[Antoine Camilleri (artist)|Antoine Camilleri]] (1922–2005) and [[Esprit Barthet]] (1919–1999) greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group of forward-looking artists came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group. Together they forced the Maltese public to take seriously modern aesthetics and succeeded in playing a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to the explosive development of a wide spectrum of views and to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art.  In Valletta, the [[National Museum of Fine Arts, Malta|National Museum of Fine Arts]] features work from artists such as [[H. Craig Hanna]].&lt;ref name=MaltaInd&gt;[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-04-23/news/right-outside-my-window-90329/ "Right Outside my Window"], ''The Malta Independent'', 23 April 2006.

Maltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and English influences as well as influences of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[Maghreb cuisine|Maghrebin]] and [[Provençal cuisine|Provençal]] cuisines. A number of regional variations, particularly with regards to Gozo, can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as [[Lent]], Easter and Christmas). Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional ''fenkata'' (i.e., the eating of stewed or fried rabbit).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Customs===
{{Main|Maltese folklore}}
A 2010 [[Charities Aid Foundation]] study found that the Maltese were the most generous people in the world, with 83% contributing to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David|last=Crary|title=Study finds Americans in generous mood|url=http://silentrebellion.newsvine.com/_news/2010/09/09/5079433-11-most-generous-countries-of-2010|work=The Huffington Post via Burlington Free Press|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that location of soft copy and hard copy differ. They are the same article, however---&gt;

Maltese folktales include various stories about mysterious creatures and supernatural events. These were most comprehensively compiled by the scholar (and pioneer in Maltese [[archaeology]]) [[Manuel Magri|Manwel Magri]]&lt;ref&gt;"Patri Manwel Magri u l-Ipoġew", Lil Ħbiebna, November 2003, pp. 195–197.&lt;/ref&gt; in his core criticism "''Ħrejjef Missirijietna''" ("Fables from our Forefathers"). This collection of material inspired subsequent researchers and academics to gather traditional [[Folklore|tales]], [[fable]]s and [[legend]]s from all over the Archipelago.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Magri's work also inspired a series of comic books (released by Klabb Kotba Maltin in 1984): the titles included ''Bin is-Sultan Jiźźewweġ x-Xebba tat-Tronġiet Mewwija'' and ''Ir-Rjieħ''. Many of these stories have been popularly re-written as Children's literature by authors writing in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], such as [[Trevor Żahra]]. While giants, witches and dragons feature in many of the stories, some contain entirely Maltese creatures like the [[Kaw kaw]], [[Il-Belliegħa]] and [[L-Imħalla]] among others. The traditional Maltese obsession with maintaining spiritual (or ritual) purity&lt;ref&gt;Zarb, T. (1998) ''Folklore of An Island''. PEG Ltd. {{ISBN|9990900973}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that many of these creatures have the role of guarding forbidden or restricted areas and attacking individuals who broke the strict codes of conduct that characterised the island's pre-industrial society.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Traditions===
Traditional Maltese proverbs reveal a cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: "''iż-żwieġ mingħajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija''" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one). This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures. In Maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula, "and they all lived happily ever after" is "''u għammru u tgħammru, u spiċċat''" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished).&lt;ref&gt;Cassar Pullicino, J. (1992) "A New Look at Old Customs", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=2TbaAAAAMAAJ ''Studies in Maltese Folklore''], Malta University Press (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural Malta shares in common with Mediterranean society a number of superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses. Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their [[food craving|cravings]] for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: ''xewqa'', literally "desire" or "craving"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried "high" or "low" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Traditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but "still a Turk". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include ''biskuttini tal-magħmudija'' (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), ''it-torta tal-marmorata'' (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as ''rożolin'', made with rose petals, violets and almonds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as ''il-quċċija'', where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, [[crucifix]] or [[rosary beads]], a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child's path and fortunes in adulthood.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Money refers to a rich future while a book expresses intelligence and a possible career as a teacher. Infants who select a pencil or pen will be writers. Choosing Bibles or rosary beads refers to a clerical or monastic life. If the child chooses a hard-boiled egg, it will have a long life and many children. More recent additions include calculators (refers to accounting), thread (fashion) and wooden spoons (cooking and a great appetite).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Maltesewedding.jpg|thumb|Re-enactment of a traditional Maltese 18th century wedding]]

Traditional Maltese weddings featured the bridal party walking in procession beneath an ornate canopy, from the home of the bride's family to the parish church, with singers trailing behind serenading the bride and groom. The Maltese word for this custom is ''il-ġilwa''. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

New wives would wear the [[għonnella]], a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of [[Żurrieq]]. This included ''il-ġilwa'', which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the [[parvis]] of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (''[[għana]]'') and dancing.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Festivals===
[[File:The statue of St. George issuing from the Basilica on the third Sunday of July.jpg|thumb|The statue of St. George at the ''festa'' of [[Victoria, Gozo]]]]

Local festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, [[Baptism|christenings]] and, most prominently, [[saints]]' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, the ''festa'' reaches its apex with a [[Mass (liturgy)|High Mass]] featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint, after which a [[statue]] of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion quickly gives way to several days of celebration and revelry: band processions, [[fireworks]], and late-night parties.

[[Maltese Carnival|Carnival]] (Maltese: ''il-karnival ta' Malta'') has had an important place on the cultural calendar after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] introduced it to the islands in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]], and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical [[float (parade)|floats]] presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ''ir-Re tal-Karnival''), marching bands and costumed revellers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Holy Week in Malta|Holy Week]] (Maltese: ''il-Ġimgħa Mqaddsa'') starts on [[Palm Sunday]] (''Ħadd il-Palm'') and ends on [[Easter Sunday]] (''Ħadd il-Għid''). Numerous religious traditions, most of them inherited from one generation to the next, are part of the [[Easter|paschal]] celebrations in the Maltese Islands, honouring the death and resurrection of Jesus.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

&lt;!-- This section is linked from 29 June --&gt;
Mnarja, or l-Imnarja (pronounced ''lim-nar-ya'') is one of the most important dates on the Maltese cultural calendar. Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of [[Saint]]s [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan [[Roman Republic|Roman]] feast of ''Luminaria'' (literally, "the illumination"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;''Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments'' {{ISBN|978-1-433-06350-3}} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A national feast since the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the ''"bandu"'', an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], in [[Mdina]], and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of [[Buskett]], just outside the town of [[Rabat Malta|Rabat]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

It is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat [[hare|wild rabbit]], which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and [[rabbit stew]] (Maltese: ''"fenkata"'') remains strong today.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1854 British governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today. The farmers' exhibition is still a seminal part of the Mnarja festivities today.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Mnarja today is one of the few occasions when participants may hear traditional Maltese "[[għana]]". Traditionally, grooms would promise to take their brides to Mnarja during the first year of marriage. For luck, many of the brides would attend in their wedding gown and veil, although this custom has long since disappeared from the islands.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Isle of MTV is a one-day music festival produced and broadcast on an annual basis by MTV. The festival has been arranged annually in Malta since 2007, with major pop artists performing each year. 2012 saw the performances of worldwide acclaimed artists Flo Rida, Nelly Furtado and Will.I.Am at Fosos Square in Floriana. Over 50,000 people attended, which marked the biggest attendance so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gozoandmalta.com/galleries/index.php/Isle-of-MTV-2012---Photos-by-Clint-Gerald-Attard |title=Isle of MTV 2012 |publisher=gozoandmalta |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the first New Year's Eve street party was organised in Malta, parallel to what major countries in the world organise. Although the event was not highly advertised, and was controversial due to the closing of an arterial street on the day, it is deemed to have been successful and will most likely be organised every year.

The Malta International Fireworks Festival is an annual festival that has been arranged in the Grand Harbour of Valletta since 2003. The festival offers fireworks displays of a number of Maltese as well as foreign fireworks factories. The festival is usually held in the last week of April every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maltauncovered.com/things-to-do/top-events/|title=Top 25 Annual Events in Malta Not to Miss|date=25 February 2016|work=MaltaUncovered.com|access-date=4 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly ''[[The Times of Malta]]'' (27 per cent) and its Sunday edition ''The Sunday Times of Malta'' (51.6 per cent).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Due to [[bilingualism]] half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The Sunday newspaper ''It-Torċa'' ("The Torch") published by the Union Press, a subsidiary of the [[General Workers' Union (Malta)|General Workers' Union]], is the widest Maltese language paper. Its sister paper, ''[[L-Orizzont]]'' ("The Horizon"), is the Maltese daily with biggest circulation. There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers; there is one paper for every 28,000&amp;nbsp;people. Advertising, sales and [[subsidies]] are the three main methods of financing newspapers and magazines.

'''Mbum''' proper, or '''West Mbum''', is an [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] language of [[Cameroon]] spoken by about 51,000 people. Speakers are mostly bilingual in [[Fulfulde]]. It is also known as Buna, Mboum, Mboumtiba, and Wuna.

The Mbum are considered the original population of the [[Adamawa Plateau]] in [[Cameroon]].  However, some histories recall that there were a people already in the area when they arrived there centuries ago.  They have had a long and close relationship with the neighboring Dii people in the eastern parts of [[Adamawa Province]] to the extent that it is frequently difficult to make any distinction between the two.  Their relationship with the [[Fulani]], who entered the region in the early-19th century, is more complex.  The [[Fulani]] are often perceived as a ruling class; nevertheless, the Mbum have historically participated actively in the states set up by the [[Fulani]].

Blench (2006) considers Gbete to be a separate language.

The '''Meiktila War Cemetery''' is one of the two memorial burial grounds of [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman soldiers]] in [[Burma|Burma (Myanmar)]]. It is situated in [[Meiktila]], [[Meiktila District]] of central [[Mandalay Region]]. Ottoman soldiers are buried in the cemetery, who died after they became [[prisoner of war]] in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]] and were sent by [[British Armed Forces]] to a [[labor camp]] in this country.&lt;ref name="ntv"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/445511.asp |newspaper=[[NTV (Turkey)|NTV-MSNBC]] |title=Myanmar’da Türk Şehitliği’nin akıbeti meçhul |date=2008-05-08 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aspb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sehityakinlari.aile.gov.tr/tr/5050/Myanmar-Turk-Sehitlikleri-Yapim-Projesi |publisher=Aile ve Sosyal Politikalar Bakanlığı |title=Myanmar Türk Şehitlikleri Yapım Projesi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h7"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haber7.com/guncel/haber/953169-yurtdisinda-en-fazla-turk-sehitligi-nerede |newspaper=Haber7 |title=Yurtdışında en fazla Türk şehitliği nerede? |date=2012-11-17 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around twelve thousand soldiers of the Ottoman Army fell into the hands of British Forces during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai, Palestine]] and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s in the [[World War I]]. The Ottoman prisoners of war were transferred to Burma, which was then [[British rule in Burma|under British rule]]. The POW's were forced to work in the construction of railroad, bridge and artificial lake. More than 800 soldiers died as a result of [[epidemic]]s, hard physical labor conditions and cruel treatment. It is not known how many of the Ottoman POW's in Burma were able to return home.&lt;ref name="ntv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aspb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h7"/&gt;

The cemetery in Meiktila is the most devastated one of the two Turkish military memorials in Myanmar. Currently, it is in state of an empty field and its exact location is unknown. The stone walls of the cemetery and some gravestones were plundered during and after the [[World War II]]. Around 180-190 gravestones are preserved so far, after [[Muslim]] residents in the area removed and carried them to a nearby [[mosque]]'s yard.&lt;ref name="ntv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aspb"/&gt;

Turkish government's initiatives for its reconstruction since 1965 accomplished finally in 2012 with granting of the required permission. The works, commissioned by the Military Cemeteries and Memorials Department ({{lang-tr|Şehitlikler ve Anıtlar Şubesi}}) of the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, began on January 29, 2013.&lt;ref name="aspb"/&gt;

'''Party of the Angolan Communist Community''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Partido da Comunidade Comunista Angolana'') is a [[political party]] in [[Angola]]. Baptista André José Simão is the chairman of the party.

The party was registered at the Supreme Court in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmi.no/pdf/%3Ffile%3D/publications/2004/rep/r2004-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ahead of the [[Angolan parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]], the party was not allowed to participate as it failed to obtain the necessary 5 000 voters signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200807220376.html|title=Angola: Constitutional Court Reaffirms Rejection of Candidatures|date=2008-07-22|work=Angola Press Agency (Luanda)|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party presented 4,573 signatures, out of which 1,846 were deemed correct according to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actsa.org/page-1404-Angola%20Peace%20Monitor%20August%202008.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108041612/http://www.actsa.org/page-1404-Angola%20Peace%20Monitor%20August%202008.html |date=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party forms part of the 'Group of Seven', a grouping of parties which either had their candidacies rejected or never attempted to put candidates in the election. The grouping supported the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) in the 2008 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amundsen|first=Inge|last2=Weimer|first2=Markus|date=2008|title=Opposition Parties and the 2008 Parliamentary Elections in Angola|url=http://www.cmi.no/publications/file/?3103=opposition-parties-and-the-upcoming-2008|journal=CMI Working Paper|language=en|volume=WP 2008:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FrenchTrenchWWI--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpeg|thumb|''Poilus'' in a trench]]
'''Poilu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|w|ɑː|l|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|pwaly|lang}})&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire canadien / The Canadian Dictionary'', [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]], Toronto, Ontario, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; is an informal term for a French [[World War I]] [[infantry|infantryman]], meaning, literally, ''hairy one''. It is still widely used as a term of endearment for the French infantry of World War I. The word carries the sense of the infantryman's typically [[Rural|rustic]], agricultural background. [[Beard]]s and bushy [[moustache]]s were often worn. The poilu was particularly known for his love of [[pinard (wine)|pinard]], his ration of cheap wine.&lt;ref name="NoraJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pierre Nora|author2=David P. Jordan|title=Rethinking France: Les Lieux de Memoire, Volume 3: Legacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMsrAQAAIAAJ|date=15 August 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-59134-6|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prestwich1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia E.

[[File:Alone at last2.jpg|thumb|''Journée du Poilu. 25 et 26 décembre 1915'' (trans. "The poilu's holiday, December 25 and 26, 1915").  French [[World War I]] poster by [[Adolphe Willette]] about a poilu's Christmas leave from the front.]]
The image of the [[Wiktionary:dogged#Adjective|dogged]], bearded French soldier was widely used in propaganda and war memorials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centenaire.org/fr/tresors-darchives/carte-postale/la-representation-du-poilu-dans-les-cartes-postales La représentation du poilu dans les cartes postales] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The stereotype of the Poilu was of bravery and endurance, but not always of unquestioning obedience. At the disastrous [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Chemin des Dames]] offensive of 1917 under General [[Robert Nivelle]], they were said to have gone into [[no man's land]] making baa'ing noises—a collective bit of [[gallows humour]] signalling the idea that they were being sent as lambs to the slaughter. Outstanding for its mixture of horror and heroism, this spectacle proved a sobering one. As the news of it spread, the French high command soon found itself coping with [[1917 French Army mutinies|a widespread mutiny]]. A minor revolution was averted only with the promise of an end to the costly offensive.

The last surviving poilu from World War I was Pierre Picault. However, French authorities recognised [[Lazare Ponticelli]] as the last poilu, as he was the last veteran whose service met the strict official criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dersdesders.free.fr/france.html "France, derniers poilus de la Guerre 14-18"] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lazare Ponticelli died in [[Le Kremlin-Bicêtre]] on 12 March 2008, aged 110.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/national/last-french-world-war-i-veteran-dies-at-110/72831/ "Last French World War I Veteran Dies at 110",] (13 March 2008) ''The New York Sun'',  Retrieved on 2008-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also along its course a highway road runs.The Army Canal, which runs a total of 25 kilometers spanning from Adhamiyah in northeastern Baghdad to Rustimiyah in southeastern Baghdad, was built in 1959 by Abd al-Kassem Quassim, the former president of Iraq. It later became a ribbon of stagnant water and because of sludge, low water levels and lack of maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">'''''Rilindja''''' (English: ''Renaissance'') was a [[Albanians in Kosovo|Kosovo Albanian]] newspaper.

==History==
It came out first on February 12, 1945, in [[Prizren]], and was the first newspaper in Albanian language inside [[Yugoslavia]]. It was initially printed in State Printing Shop in Prizren during the issues 1 to 60. Since issue 61 it was printed in [[Prishtina]] Regional Printing House of the [[Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia|People's Front]].&lt;ref name="GSH.eu"&gt;[http://www.gazetashqiptare.eu/gazeta_rilindja.html Gazeta Rilindja]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, it had only four pages, being published weekly until June 27, 1948. After that it begins to come out twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays. Then, from November 1958 starts out as a [[daily paper]] (beside Fridays). By the year 1964, it appears every day in a 20-page standard format, while on Saturdays and holidays in a 24-32 page format. On September 5, 1990, the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian government]] banned its publication, with the entry of [[NATO]] forces, on June 12, 1999 it appears again.&lt;ref name="GSH.eu"/&gt;

It was undoubtedly one of the best sold newspapers in the Albanian sphere. Its maximum circulation reached up to 234,000 copies during the New Year holidays.

In 2002, the premises were blocked by [[UNMIK]] administration and listed as a property of [[Kosovo Agency of Privatization]], shutting it down abruptly.&lt;ref name="koha"&gt;{{citation|language=Albanian| accessdate=2 December 2013| url=http://koha.net/?page=1,13,98031| publisher=Koha TV| title="Rilindja" - gazeta e harruar me objekt të uzurpuar|trans-title=Rilindja: The forgotten newspaper with usurped premises}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sariwon'' class corvette''' is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-designed c[[Corvette|orvette]] used by [[North Korea]]. They are based on the Soviet [[Tral class]] fleet minesweepers, but were built in North Korea in the 1960s. There are currently five active ships of this type in the [[Korean People's Navy]].

Stationed on the east coast, these ships were likely built at either '''Mayang-do Naval Shipyards''' or '''Bong Dao Bo Shipyards''' in nearby Sinpo on the mainland.
