'''[[Ugandan Cup|Uganda Cup]] 1982''' was the eighth season of the main Ugandan [[Association football|football]] Cup.

==Overview==
The competition has also been known as the '''Kakungulu Cup''' and was won by [[Kampala City Council FC]] who were awarded the tie after [[Nile Breweries FC]] left the field of play after 75 minutes. KCC were leading Nile 1-0 when the final was abandoned. The Nile players walked off the pitch in protest to a foul committed by KCC’s John Latigo on Moses Musoke.  The Nile players wanted the referee to send off Latigo, but the referee gave Latigo a caution. This annoyed Nile players and they walked off the pitch leaving KCC to be awarded the trophy.&lt;ref name="The Observer"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4807&amp;Itemid=80|title= Inconsistency, impatient fans killed Nile FC |work=The Observer |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are not available for the earlier rounds&lt;ref name="RSSSF"&gt;{{cite news |title= Uganda - List of Cup Finals - RSSSF (Mikael Jönsson, Ian King and Hans Schöggl) |publisher=RSSSF Archive |year=1997–2013 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oegcuphist.html |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawowo Sports"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kawowo.com/index.php/football/item/13292-uganda-cup-past-finalists.html|title= Uganda Cup Past Finalists  |work=Kawowo Sports |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soccer256"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://soccer256.com/Kakungulu%20Cup%20winners.htm|title= Tournaments: Kakungulu cup |work=Soccer256 Magazine |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baseball pitch release.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A U.S. Naval Academy pitcher wearing stirrups]]

'''Stirrups''' were [[Baseball uniform|uniform]] socks commonly worn by [[baseball]] players up until the mid-1990s, when major-league players began wearing their pants down to the ankles, setting a trend soon picked up by players in minor and amateur leagues. Until then, stirrup socks had been an integral part of the traditional [[baseball uniform]], giving them a distinctive look. A high sock was needed because baseball players wore [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] ("knickers"), worn by many boys in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The stirrup socks served to display team colors, stripes or team logos. For example, for several years the [[Minnesota Twins]] wore navy-blue stirrups with "TC" on the side, for "Twin Cities", and in 1987 an "m" was placed on side. The [[Houston Astros]] wore navy blue stirrup socks with an orange star on the side. The stirrup sock colors were also the basis of team names, including the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], [[Boston Red Sox]], and [[Chicago White Sox]].  For these reasons, traditionalists lament the recent "sockless" look in baseball uniforms.

Stirrup socks are worn on top of long socks called "sanitaries," usually white in color.&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks&gt;'''''At''''' [http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-29/sports/29941646_1_pants-socks-cuffs Baseball and socks appeal]. Vitez, Michael (August 29, 2011). Philly.com. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. Retrieved 2011-09-02. "This led to the invention of the two-in-one, a white sock with a colored stripe down the side, an innovation that all but ensured the demise of the stirrup."&lt;/ref&gt; This is because early color dyes in the outer stirrup sock were thought to pose health issues,&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks/&gt; as well as the fact that the inner, less expensive white sock could be changed more frequently. The stirrup sock lacked a foot, instead having a loop ("stirrup") which fits within the arch of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball.

However, by the 1980s many players were pulling the loop so high that only the white undersock and the loop itself showed - the rest of the game sock being hidden by their pants. Eventually, this reached a point where some players only wore vertical lines for stirrups. For many years teams had enforced rules so that uniforms were worn "uniformly", including team socks. For example, [[Leo Durocher]], longtime manager of the [[Chicago Cubs]], had a measuring stick in the clubhouse. Players were required to match the length of their stirrup loops to this stick at about 4&amp;nbsp;inches, exposing only a small part of the white sanitary. Increasingly lax regulation of uniform codes by [[Major League Baseball]] eventually contributed to players ignoring the traditional look.

The [[Official Baseball Rules]] are silent on stirrups, but the fact that some players on a team wear them while others do not seems to be in violation of Rule 1.11(a)(1) which states that “all players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style,”  as well as Rule 1.11(a)(3) that states “no player whose uniform does not conform to that of his teammates shall be permitted to participate in a game.”&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The freedom to wear high stirrups or not is remarkable considering how nowadays uniformity is otherwise enforced by MLB. For example, during a 2007 game against the [[Yankees]], with the Yankees threatening to score, [[Red Sox]] manager [[Terry Francona]] was suddenly called away from the game and questioned by a league executive as to whether he was wearing the required uniform jersey beneath his blue pullover. He wasn’t pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although some teams — particularly college teams — continue to wear traditional baseball stirrup socks, another option has been to replace the stirrup/undersock with a "2 in 1" combination sock&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks/&gt; that mimics the real thing, or simply to wear a single solid knee-high sock with knickers. The trend back to knickers and high socks is particularly evident among youth and high-school teams. A few pro players, such as [[Taijuan Walker]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Derek Holland]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] of the [[San Diego Padres]], [[Bryce Harper]] &amp; [[Casey Janssen]] of the [[Washington Nationals]], [[Daniel Descalso]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Josh Outman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Steve Cishek]] &amp; [[Juan Pierre]] of the [[Miami Marlins]], [[Chris Archer]] of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[J.R. Graham]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Chris Taylor (baseball) | Chris Taylor]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and [[Francisco Lindor]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] have been spotted wearing genuine stirrups recently to much fanfare. Several players on the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] will either wear stirrups over white sanitary socks, or over red socks, as the Phillies stirrups sport their Liberty Bell logo.  The minor-league [[Springfield Cardinals]] wear a 2-in-1 version of the traditional [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' game sock that looks very much like the real thing.

Other sports also use, or have used, stirrup socks, but traditionally wore a white sweat sock over, instead of under, the colored stirrup game sock (e.g. basketball, football, hockey). For many years [[Official (American football)|American football officials]] commonly wore black baseball-style stirrups as part of their uniform, although this was done away with in the 2010s as full-length pants replaced the traditional knickers.  There are still some sock companies manufacturing stirrup socks for baseball and other sports, including Twin City Knitting Company in [[Conover, North Carolina]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">A '''Beer League''' (North American English) is a recreational league for adults to drink beer and compete in different sports. While the '''pub league''' (British English) is a form of [[sports league]] actually primarily funded by sponsorships from [[pub]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bars]]. The bars often provide funding for a team's uniforms and equipment, and often a free drink for each player, in exchange for advertising the establishment on the uniform and usually [[naming rights]] to the team itself. Beer leagues can be of virtually any sport but are usually [[amateur sports|amateur]] and recreational in nature, not being tied to a larger competitive [[league system]], and contested by adults. The consumption of alcohol is often encouraged during the contest, as the actual competition is secondary. This is beneficial to the adults that compete in these beer league events because not only are they supporting a small business, but they are getting physical activity, all while being social. For example, with Beer League Hockey over 174,000 adults play. The special thing behind these leagues is that "It’s organized hockey in its purest form, unencumbered by money, skill, ambition, fans or advancement." &lt;ref&gt;Bonander, Ross. “Inside the World of Beer League Hockey.” DRAFT, 14 Dec. 2015,

The '''Harvard-Yale chess match''' is held annually around the time of the [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard-Yale football game]] in November on the campus of the university hosting the football game that year. It is a relatively informal match and the schools don't typically submit the games to the [[United States Chess Federation]] for rating. Nevertheless, it is one of the highlights of the year for each school's chess club. The match typically consists of five games, pitting five current Harvard students against five current Yale students (undergraduate or graduate), with each board numbered 1 through 5 (with 1 having the strongest players and 5 having the weakest). The team with the most game points is declared the winner of the match, with a win worth 1 point, a draw worth half a point, and a loss worth 0 points. In the case of a tie, either the match is declared a tie, or a tie-breaking procedure is applied. Tie-breaking procedures applied in the past included using the result of the strongest non-drawing board as the result of the match, or using results achieved on boards numbered higher than 5 by players from each school who were not selected to be in the top five. Match details vary each year depending on the preferences of current members of each school’s chess club.

Those who play in the match are typically strong tournament players. The ratings range from around 1800 to 2400 [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]]. Players occasionally are [[FIDE]] [[International Master]]s or [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grand Masters]].

As of 2018, the champion is Harvard, after defeating Yale 4-1.

'''Liga II''' is the second level [[women's association football|women's football]] league in Romania. A second tier women's football competition was first created in 1990 under the name ''Divizia B''. After the fall of communism, organised women's football started to take off, and the founded clubs were distributed  into 2 leagues - ''Divizia A'' with 12 teams and ''Divizia B'' with 30 teams grouped into 3 series, following a tournament called ''Cupa Libertății''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Celălalt fotbal | url=http://www.mygeographic.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fotbal-feminin-mic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after, the number women's clubs declined, and the division was disbanded.

The second level league was reintroduced starting with the 2013–14 season, when it formally received the name ''Liga I'', following the introduction of ''Superliga'' as the top-tier league. However, as of the 2017-18 season, it was rebranded as ''Liga II'', since the ''Superliga'' brand was quietly dropped altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frfotbal.ro/index.php?competition_id=94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Since it's reintroduction, Liga II has always had two parallel regional divisions. Second teams of clubs in the top league cannot promote. The promoting teams in each series for every year are denoted in italics.

==Winners==
The following is a list of all Romanian women's second-tier football league winners. The first place is declared the champion of the series, promotes to Liga I, and is presented with a trophy. The top three teams currently also receive gold, silver and bronze medals from the [[Romanian Football Federation]].

'''Mitchell &amp; Ness Nostalgia Co.''', is an American [[sports]] clothing company located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The company was established in 1904, and is the oldest sporting goods company in Philadelphia. By license agreements with [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Football League]], [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Soccer]] and the Collegiate Licensing Company, the company has been producing vintage sports goods such as jerseys, jackets, hats, and wool-felt historic pennants.

==Company history==
Mitchell &amp; Ness Sporting Goods first opened its doors in Philadelphia in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Al Hunter, Jr., "Jersey Story", ''Philadelphia Daily News'', (February 4, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Frank P. Mitchell, a former AAU tennis and wrestling champ, and Charles M. Ness, an avid golfer born in [[Scotland]], together founded Mitchell &amp; Ness Sporting Goods in 1904. Their original store made and strung hand-crafted tennis rackets and, using imported woods from Scotland, stolen from England, constructed custom-made golf clubs.  In time, they expanded their business, selling uniforms to local baseball and football teams. When the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] entered the young National Football League in 1933, M&amp;N supplied the team jerseys and equipment. Mitchell &amp; Ness would continue to outfit the Eagles through the 1963 season.

The first time that the Mitchell &amp; Ness label appeared on a major league baseball uniform –the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]– was in 1938. In the early 1940s, M&amp;N began to supply Philadelphia's other major league baseball team –the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]]. By the end of the decade, the Mitchell &amp; Ness label was appearing on high school and college team uniforms throughout the Philadelphia area.

In the late 1970s, Mitchell &amp; Ness had dropped the team business to concentrate on its retail operation. The store became a leading outlet for field hockey equipment and ski gear.

Mitchell &amp; Ness almost went bankrupt in 1983. Owner Peter Capolino told the ''Detroit Free Press'', "By 1983 all the expansion I had done had gone to hell. I fired 100 people, closed two warehouses. I reduced the company to a little store at 13th and [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut Streets]] (in Philadelphia). It was down to just me and my wife."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rosenberg, "New twist makes 'old' jerseys fashionable", ''Detroit Free Press'' (April 29, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a customer walked into the store and asked if M&amp;N could repair his 1960 Pirates game-worn vest, and his 1949 St Louis Browns game-worn shirt. They were both made of wool flannel as all baseball uniforms had been during that era. Mitchell &amp; Ness found that it could do it, and with the realization that M&amp;N was capable of this task, an idea was born: Reproduce historically accurate wool-flannel baseball uniforms.

Mitchell &amp; Ness recruited history buffs and sports gurus most notably Capolino's friend Bob Downes. They dug through old newspapers, periodicals, books, programs, and old film footage. They consulted vintage uniform collectors throughout the country and visited the archives at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in Cooperstown, NY.

Major League Baseball teams had stopped wearing wool flannel jerseys by 1972. Teams now wear double-knit polyester jerseys. In a dusty warehouse in [[North Philadelphia]], Mitchell &amp; Ness discovered rolls of old baseball flannel from 50 years earlier. They were still carefully wrapped, untouched, and in like-new condition ready to be cut and sewn.

The flannel was sewn. The lettering and patches were recreated and applied. The jerseys were completed, and they were offered for sale. The first shirts sold almost overnight. So did the second batch of a dozen or more. In time, Mitchell &amp; Ness attracted customers from across the United States. [[Sports Illustrated]] wrote a flattering piece about M&amp;N in June 1987. [[The New York Times]] wrote about the company two years later.

In 1999, M&amp;N expanded into the history of the NBA when it introduced its Hardwood Classics collection of basketball jerseys. Football followed a year later with the M&amp;N Throwback Collection. In 2002, the NHL granted M&amp;N rights to remake vintage hockey sweaters.

Mitchell &amp; Ness now has on file every MLB uniform worn since the founding of the original [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] in 1869.

In 2007, [[Adidas]] purchased Mitchell &amp; Ness in order to get into the retro-apparel style market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2007/11/05/daily51.html |title=Adidas buys throwback jersey maker Mitchell &amp; Ness |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies announced that they had signed Mitchell &amp; Ness as a naming-rights partner of its clothes store at the Phillies' [[Citizens Bank Park]]. The Mitchell &amp; Ness Alley Store is in [[Ashburn Alley]] beyond left-center field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=Philadelphia Phillies| coauthors=| title=Press Release: Phillies announce new Mitchell &amp; Ness Alley store at Citizens Bank Park| date=2008-05-29| publisher=[[MLB.com]]| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080529&amp;content_id=2793349&amp;vkey=pr_phi&amp;fext=.jsp| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2011, the [[Reading Phillies]], AA affiliate of the Phillies announced that they had signed Mitchel &amp; Ness as a naming-rights partner of its apparel store at the R-Phils' [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Reading, Pennsylvania)|FirstEnergy Stadium]].

On March 23, 2012, Jonathan Yuska was brought on as Head of Mitchell and Ness.

==Sales history==
Owner Peter Capolino reported to ''Sports Illustrated'' that Mitchell &amp; Ness had annual sales revenue of $1.5 million per-year in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Style File: Vintage Jerseys", ''Sports Illustrated'', (June 3, 2002) page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Revenues rose to $2.2 million in 1999&lt;ref name=DarrenRovell&gt;Darren Rovell, "Old-school is still cool with today's star athletes", ''ESPN Sports Business'', http://www.espn.com, (May 8, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and were $2.8 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=DouglasCentury&gt;Douglas Century, "In Hip-Hop, Unitas and Chamberlain Live Again", ''New York Times'', (January 5, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were more than $5 million in 2001 according to ESPN.com&lt;ref name=DarrenRovell/&gt; while Capolino reported annual sales of $4.5 million in 2001 to ''USA Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hiestand, "Sports gear so out of style it's in style", ''USA Today'', (August 20, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Sales rose to $23 million in 2002.&lt;ref name=DouglasCentury/&gt;

==Popular products==
Mitchell &amp; Ness's [[Throwback uniform|throwback]] jerseys were created to reproduce classic to very modern team and player sports jerseys which are either no longer available or hard to find. Mitchell &amp; Ness began producing [[baseball]] (Cooperstown Collection) jerseys in 1988, although the company gained popularity in the international [[retail]] [[Market (economics)|market]] ten years after with the introduction of the NBA "Hardwood Classics" line. The company later moved on to reproducing popular throwbacks of [[American football|football]] and [[NHL]] players.

''USA Today'' reported that as of May 2002, the most popular NBA players for Mitchell &amp; Ness were Michael Jordan and Julius Erving, followed by Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Larry Bird.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Carter, "Celebs live sporting life via vintage team jerseys", ''USA Today'', (May 14, 2002) page 2D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia Sports==
Mitchell &amp; Ness has involved itself with Philadelphia sports history and projects.

The company sponsored a Turn Back the Clock alumni game on November 21, 2003 between players from the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]] [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple Owls]] and [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball#1985 National Champions|1985 Villanova Wildcats]] at the [[Liacouras Center]] on the campus of [[Temple University]] in [[North Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://owlsports.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111103aaa.html|title=Owls "Turn Back the Clock" for Alumni Hoops Battle with Villanova|accessdate=2009-04-06 |work=Temple Athletics: Men's Basketball|publisher=[[CBS College Sports Network]]|date=2003-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell &amp; Ness is partnering with the [[Betsy Ross House]] to present an exhibition opening May 22, "Play Ball!

The '''Nevill Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground at [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] in the [[English county]] of [[Kent]]. It is owned by [[Borough of Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells Borough Council]] and is used by [[Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club]] in the summer months and by Tunbridge Wells Hockey Club in the winter. It was opened in 1898 and was first used by [[Kent County Cricket Club]] in 1901. The county has held the [[Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week]] on the ground annually, despite a suffragette arson attack which destroyed the pavilion in 1913.

As well as hosting over 180 of Kent's [[first-class cricket]] matches, the ground played host to a single [[One Day International]] during the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]] and was used for one match during the [[1993 Women's Cricket World Cup]].

The ground is known for being one of the more picturesque county grounds in England and particularly for having [[rhododendron]] bushes around the perimeter.&lt;ref name=ci&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/57367.html Nevill Ground], [[CricInfo]].

==History==
The ground was established after the purchase of the land, in 1895, by the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club and the Bluemantle's Cricket Club on a 99-year lease from [[William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny]]. It had formed part of his [[Eridge Park]] estate on the edge of Tunbridge Wells. Building of the ground's facilities started in 1896 and it was officially opened by the Marquess, after whom the ground was named, in 1898.&lt;ref name=cihistory&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/60218.html A brief history of the Nevill Ground], [[CricInfo]].

The original [[cricket pavilion]] on the ground was designed by local architect CH Strange and built in 1903 at a cost of £1,200.&lt;ref name=strange&gt;''The Builder'', vol. 104, no.1, 1913, p.504.&lt;/ref&gt; It was destroyed in an arson attack, generally believed to have been the responsibility of militant suffragettes, in April 1913.&lt;ref name=ci12apr08&gt;Williamson M (2008) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/345988.html Blowing up a blind man and his dog], [[Cricinfo]], 12 April 2008.

===1913 arson===
[[File:Nevill Pavilion, Royal Tunbridge Wells.jpg|thumb|right|The Nevill Ground pavilion after the 1913 arson attack]]
On 11 April 1913, the original pavilion was burnt down in an arson attack attributed to militant suffragettes. The fire was discovered by a passing [[lamplighter]] and the fire brigade extinguished the fire in an hour, too late to save the pavilion. In front of the remains of the building firemen found suffragette literature, an electric lantern and a photograph of leading suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]].&lt;ref name=mq117&gt;Moseling M, Quarrington T (2013) ''A Half-Forgotten Triumph: The story of Kent's County Championship title of 1913'', pp.117–125.

The fire destroyed archives, including a print of the first [[Canterbury Cricket Week]] and the Bluemantle's Cricket Club's archives.&lt;ref name=times12apr13 /&gt; The attack has often been linked to a comment from an unknown Kent official who is reported to have said "It is not true that women are banned from the pavilion. Who do you think makes the teas?".&lt;ref name=mq118&gt;Moseling &amp; Quarrington ''op. cit.'', p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; However women were admitted to all of Kent's pavilions by 1913 and there is no evidence that the comment was ever made.&lt;ref name=mq117 /&gt; 

There was an angry reaction to the attack locally and nationally. The [[National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage]] held a meeting in the town with Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who was a member of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club, attending, where he called the suffragettes "female hooligans"&lt;ref name=ci12apr08 /&gt; and compared the attack to "blowing up a blind man and his dog".&lt;ref name=ci12apr08 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mq117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lycett&gt;Lycett A (2007) ''The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'', p.363. New York City: Simon and Schuster. {{isbn|0743275233}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new pavilion was built using the original designs after a series of fund raising concerts at the [[Opera House, Royal Tunbridge Wells|Opera House]]. Construction was finished in nine weeks, with the building completed just before the start of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week in July 1913.&lt;ref name=ci12apr08 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mq117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=times15jul14 /&gt;

[[Kent County Cricket Club]] use the ground as one of its outgrounds for at least one match each year. After a single match in 1901, the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Festival was established in 1902 and two [[first-class cricket]] matches were played every year, with the exception of the truncated 1919 season, until 1992, when the number was reduced.&lt;ref name=mq117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;&lt;ref name=twcchistory&gt;[http://www.tunbridgewellscc.org.uk/history/ History], [[Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5038">[[File:RobertsonFieldHouseDemo1.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the Field House, April 2008]]
'''Robertson Memorial Field House''' was a multi-purpose [[arena]] on the [[Bradley University]] campus in [[Peoria, Illinois]].  The arena, built inside two surplus [[World War II]] [[airplane hangar]]s in 1949 for $400,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|400000|1949|r=-5}}}} in present terms), had a 3-foot (1 meter) raised floor as its sports court and event stage.&lt;ref name="bub-rmfh"&gt;{{cite web | title = Robertson Memorial Field House | url = http://www.bubraves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3400&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=130292&amp;SPID=1497&amp;SPSID=19327 | date = 2005-06-22 | accessdate = 2008-02-24 | publisher = [[Bradley University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Field House was dedicated on December 17, 1949, and named in honor of [[Alfred J. Robertson]], usually known as "Robbie" or "A.J.", who served as Bradley's coach and athletic director for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?/fieldhouse/archives/robertson_reunion1/ | title = Robertson Reunion | first = Kirk | last = Wessler | work = [[Peoria Journal Star]] | date = 2008-02-22 | accessdate = 2008-11-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229081722/http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?%2Ffieldhouse%2Farchives%2Frobertson_reunion1%2F | archivedate = 2008-02-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it opened, it had a [[seating capacity]] of 8,300, but more aisles and wider seats soon reduced capacity to 7,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?/fieldhouse/archives/origins_of_a_mecca/ | title = Origins of a Mecca | first = Ryan | last = Ori | work = [[Peoria Journal Star]] | location = [[Peoria, Illinois]] | date = 2008-03-28 | accessdate = 2008-11-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715090824/http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?%2Ffieldhouse%2Farchives%2Forigins_of_a_mecca%2F | archivedate = 2011-07-15 | df =  }}  Part of the "Remembering Robertson" section.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since a 2004 renovation, its capacity had been 5,000.&lt;ref name="bub-rmfh" /&gt;

From 1949 to 1982, it was home to the [[Bradley University]] men's [[basketball]] team, whose winning record there was 400&amp;ndash;100 before they moved to [[Carver Arena]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="bub-rmfh" /&gt;  From 1982 until 2008, the women's basketball and [[volleyball]] teams played their home games at the arena.  It hosted the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament title game in 1980.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  The 2007&amp;ndash;2008 season was the final year of use for Robertson Memorial Field House; it hosted [[NCAA]] women's basketball and volleyball.&lt;ref name="mcm-080309"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?/fieldhouse/archives/robertson_takes_one_final_shot/ | date = 2008-03-09 | title = Robertson takes one final shot | first = Ed | last = McMenamin | accessdate = 2008-11-10 | location = [[Peoria, Illinois]] | work = [[Peoria Journal Star]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715090832/http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?%2Ffieldhouse%2Farchives%2Frobertson_takes_one_final_shot%2F | archivedate = 2011-07-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Robertson Memorial Field House was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?/fieldhouse/archives/the_field_house_is_coming_down/ | title = The Field House is coming down: How will they do it? | work = [[Peoria Journal Star]] | location = [[Peoria, Illinois]] | date = 2008-04-15 | accessdate = 2008-11-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715090837/http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php?%2Ffieldhouse%2Farchives%2Fthe_field_house_is_coming_down%2F | archivedate = 2011-07-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradley's new women's basketball arena, the [[Renaissance Coliseum]], opened in October 2011 on the same plot previously occupied by the Field House.

The '''Shrine Bowl''' was a postseason [[college football]] bowl game. The first game was played on December 18, 1948, at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] between [[Hardin–Simmons University]] and [[Ouachita Baptist University|Ouachita Baptist College]].&lt;ref&gt;Foldesy, Jody. "Bowls burgeon as big business", ''The Washington Times''. December 21, 1997. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1949 edition was held in Carbondale, Illinois as the [[Indiana State Sycamores football|Indiana State]] Sycamores faced the Salukies of [[Southern Illinois University]].

A series of games sponsored by the Shriners as a charity event in Honolulu in December 1941 and referred to by some as the Shrine Bowl was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Teams from Willamette University and San Jose State travelled to Hawaii to play against each other and the University of Hawaii. The Willamette team lost to the Hawaiians in the opening game on Saturday, December 6, but other games were cancelled due to the onset of the war. The teams were among the first civilians evacuated in a convoy to San Francisco a couple of weeks later.

'''[[Spain]]''' boycotted the '''[[1956 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] because of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|invasion]] of [[Hungary]].  However, the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] for the 1956 Games were held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] five months earlier (because of Australian quarantine regulations), and six Spanish riders competed.

'''The Oval''' was a [[cricket]] and [[association football|football]] ground in [[Wednesbury]], [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Wednesbury Old Athletic F.C.|Wednesbury Old Athletic]], and also hosted two [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] matches at the start of the [[1893–94 Football League|1893–94 season]].

==History==
The ground was located to the north-west of Wednesbury town centre, and featured a pavilion located close to St Paul's road, which ran along the northern boundary. At the end of the [[1892–93 Football League|1892–93 season]] Walsall left [[the Chuckery]] to move to [[West Bromwich Road]]. However, the new ground was not ready at the start of the 1893–94 season, so the club played two matches at the Oval. The first on 2 September 1893 saw Walsall lose 3–1 to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], whilst the second match was played on 9 September, with Walsall losing 5–0 to [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]].&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p35, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it being a temporary home, the 5,000 spectators present at the Small Heath game was higher than the club's highest League attendances at either the Chuckery or West Bromwich Road.&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Smith, p35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Smith, p144&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground is now an open sports field, with Walsall's modern [[Bescot Stadium]] located a few hundred metres away on the other side of the [[M6 motorway]].

}}
A '''throw''', in [[martial arts]], is a [[grappling]] technique that involves off-balancing or lifting an opponent, and throwing them to the ground, in [[Japanese martial arts]] referred to as ''nage-waza'', 投げ技,  "throwing technique". Throws usually involve a rotating motion, the practitioner performing the throw disconnects with the opponent, and ends balanced and on their feet as opposed to a [[takedown (grappling)|takedown]] where both finish on the ground. Throws can however also be followed into a [[grappling position#Ground grappling position|top position]], in which case the person executing the throw does not disengage from the opponent. Certain throwing techniques called '''sacrifice throws''' (''sutemi-waza'', 捨身技, "sacrifice technique") involve putting oneself in a potentially disadvantageous position, such as on the ground, in order to execute a throw.

==Types of throws==
There are several major types of throw, among Asian martial arts, judo has the most developed throwing techniques and throws are considered its specialty.

Most throws are named by describing the circumvention point of the throw (e.g., hip throw, shoulder throw, wrist throw etc.), or the nature of effect of the throw on the opponent (e.g., heaven and earth throw, valley drop, body drop) with variations are given descriptive names. The names used here are attributed to Jujutsu throws (and hence judo/aikido throws) are descriptions in Japanese. It is conventional for the Japanese to name their throws in this manner, and many western martial art dojos have given English names to the throws feeling that it is easier for English speaking students to remember the names of throws if they can associate the throws by the descriptive nature of the throw name.

In judo, throws are divided into six categories—hand techniques, leg techniques, hip techniques, shoulder techniques, as well as sacrifice throws to the rear and side.

===Shoulder and Back throws===
A '''shoulder throw'''  involves throwing an opponent over the shoulder. A shoulder throw which lifts the opponent from the ground is in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] referred to as ''[[seoi-nage]]'' (背負い投げ, "Back Throw"), while a throw which involves upsetting the opponents balance and pulling the opponent over the shoulder is referred to as ''seoi-otoshi'' (背負落とし, "Back Drop").&lt;ref&gt;The Kodokan Judo Institute. [http://www.kodokan.org/e_waza/seoiotoshi.html http://www.kodokan.org/e_waza/seoiotoshi.html] Seoi-Otoshi (hand technique)]. ''[http://www.kodokan.org www.kodokan.org]''. URL last accessed February 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Seoi-nage is one of the most used throws in  Judo competition. One study indicated that approximately 56% of [[judoka]]s implemented the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Weers, George. [http://judoinfo.com/weers1.htm http://judoinfo.com/weers1.htm] Skill Range of the Elite Judo Competitor]. ''judoinfo.com''. URL last accessed February 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common shoulder throw is judo's [[ippon seoinage]] ("Single-Handed Back Throw")&lt;ref&gt;Judoinfo.com. [http://judoinfo.com/images/animations/blue/ipponseoi.htm ipponseoi]. Accessed 2012-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt; or the similar ''flying mare'' in [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wrestling |volume=26 |pages=844–845 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri28chisrich#page/844/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leg throws, reaps, and trips===
In a ''leg reap'', the attacker uses one of their legs to reap one or both of their opponent's legs off the ground. Generally the opponent's weight is placed on the leg that is reaped away. This coupled with the attacker controlling the opponent's body with their hands causes the opponent to fall over. Common leg reaps are judo's [[Ouchi Gari]], [[Kouchi Gari]], [[Osoto Gari]], and [[Kosoto Gari]] there are similar techniques in wrestling, including the inside and outside trips.

Somewhat similar to leg reaps involve a hooking or lifting action with the attacking leg instead of a reaping action. The border between the two types of throw can be unclear, and many throws will exhibit characteristics of both reaps and trips, however, the difference is that a reap is one smooth move, like that of a [[scythe]], whereas a hook is pulling the opponents leg up first, and then swinging it away. Common leg trips are hooking variations of Ouchi Gari and Osoto Gari along with [[Kosoto Gake]], referred to as inside and outside trips in Western wrestling.

===Hip throws===
A '''hip throw''' involves using the thrower's hip as a pivot point, by placing the hip in a lower position than an opponent's center of gravity. There are several types of hip throws such as O Goshi, which is often taught first to novices. Hip throws in Judo are called Koshi Waza, and in [[Aikido]] or [[Sumo]] they are called koshinage.

===Sacrifice throws===
Sacrifice throws require the thrower to move into a potentially disadvantageous position in order to be executed, such as falling to the ground. The momentum of the falling body adds power to the throw and requires comparatively little strength, compared to the effect. In Judo (as well as in other martial arts) these throws are called Sutemi Waza and are further divided into rear (Masutemi waza) and side (Yoko Sutemi Waza) throws. In Judo, these throws are limited to a specific grade and higher due to the element of danger that is placed upon both the Uke (receiver) and the Tori (thrower).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohlenkamp|first=Neil|title=Judo Unleashed|year=2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers Ltd.|isbn=0-07-147534-6|pages=160|url=http://judounleashed.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913064230/http://judounleashed.com/|archivedate=2007-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pick-ups===
Pickups involve lifting the opponent off the ground and then bringing them down again. Common pick-ups are lifting variations of the double leg [[Takedown (grappling)|takedown]], judo's [[Te Guruma]] or ''sukui nage'' (both classified as hand throws) and the suplex from wrestling, in which the attacker lifts their opponents body vertically and throws the opponent over their own center of gravity while executing a back fall (usually accompanied by a back arch). Variations of the suplex are common in most forms of [[wrestling]] and sometimes used in [[Mixed Martial Arts]] competition. In Judo the ''ura-nage'' throw is a version of the suplex, but it is importantly classified as a sacrifice throw.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">'''Wally''' is the name of the official mascot of the [[The Wallabies|Australian rugby union team]], [[the Wallabies]].
[[File:Wallabies-mother-and-son.jpg|thumb|right|[[wallaby|Wallabies]] in the wild]]
Wally is a [[wallaby]].

The [[stuffed toy]] version of the mascot is carried with the Wallabies on overseas tours to Europe. It then becomes the duty of the youngest member of the touring party to protect the mascot from pranks by older players to hide and sabotage it. It is considered an embarrassment to the protector if Wally is not safely guarded.   The protector is forced to hold Wally at all times.  It becomes a source of entertainment for senior players when the team is out socialising.

==Events==
When [[Berrick Barnes]] was forced to protect Wally during the 2007 World Cup in France he had to stitch it up several times and perform a search of every member's hotel room to retrieve it, despite the help of [[Lote Tuqiri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyheaven.com.au/news/news/lote-cures-berricks-insomnia/2007/09/11/1189276644284.html Lote cures Berrick's insomnia] Greg Growden and Rupert Guinness | September 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 tour it became a long-running joke among the players that the mascot could be used by 18-year-old [[James O'Connor (rugby)|James O'Connor]] to break the ice with young ladies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,24559464-23217,00.html Tour rookie gets Wally] FOX Sports - October 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 a Welsh rugby fan was ejected from a stadium in Sydney during a match for attempting to dance with the life-size version of Wally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6701251.stm Fan, 72, ejected for mascot dance] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center''' is a museum on the campus of [[Montclair State University]] in [[Little Falls, New Jersey]]. It serves to honor the career of [[Yogi Berra]], who played for the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]] and was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]. The museum, which contains artifacts from Berra's career, opened on December 4, 1998. It is adjacent to [[Yogi Berra Stadium]].

==History==
[[File:Ron Guidry 05122013.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Ron Guidry]] autographing a baseball at the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center on May 12, 2013]]
"The Friends of Yogi Inc.", a [[nonprofit organization]], raised $2&amp;nbsp;million through donations to build the museum to honor [[Yogi Berra]], who played his entire [[Major League Baseball]] career for the [[New York Yankees]]. [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]], the owner of the [[New Jersey Devils]] of the [[National Hockey League]], was among the museum's benefactors.&lt;ref name=timesdaily&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19980111&amp;id=w04eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U8cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3872,1501803|title=Berra Museum opens in June|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[TimesDaily]]|page=20|location=[[Florence, Alabama]]|date=January 11, 1998|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was built adjacent to [[Yogi Berra Stadium]], which hosts the [[New Jersey Jackals]], a [[Minor League Baseball]] team in the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]], and the Montclair State Red Hawks baseball team. The museum was dedicated in October 1998, with fellow [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]rs [[Ted Williams]] and [[Larry Doby]] in attendance.&lt;ref name=dedicate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19981025&amp;id=9PoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2kcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6920,3839348|title=Hall of Famers help Yogi dedicate his museum|first=Jeffrey|last=Gold|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Bowling Green Daily News]]|page=5B|date=October 25, 1998|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened to the public on December 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19981027&amp;id=z2JWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4vEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6511,5576262|title=Baseball was berra, berra good to him|page=C2|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=October 27, 1998|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[IKON 5 Architects]] redesigned the museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/332797/yogi-berra-museum-and-learning-center-ikon-5-architects/|title=Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center / ikon.5 architects|work=ArchDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Hanlon]] sculpted a statue of Berra to go in front of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=5215368|title=Statue of Hall of Famer Yogi Berra to stand in front of his museum|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=ESPN New York|publisher=ESPN.com|date=May 24, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berra had feuded with Yankees' owner [[George Steinbrenner]] since his firing 16 games into the [[1985 New York Yankees season|1985 season]]. Berra refused to have any part of Yankees events, including Yankees games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/28/sports/sp-37035|title=Berra's Exile Self-Imposed|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Mike|last=Lupica|authorlink=Mike Lupica|date=September 28, 1997|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1999, Berra and Steinbrenner resolved their feud with a public event at the Yogi Berra Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-yogi-and-the-boss-complete-makeup-game.html|title=Sports of The Times; Yogi and the Boss Complete Makeup Game|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Harvey|last=Araton|date=January 6, 1999|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berra frequently visited the museum for signings, discussions, and other events. It was his intention to teach children important values such as sportsmanship and dedication, both on and off the baseball diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Posnanski|first= Joe|title=Yogi Berra Will Be A Living Legend Even After He's Gone|newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date= July 4, 2011|pp=64–68|volume=115|issue= 1|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1187819/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2014, a [[burglary]] occurred at the museum, in which a team of "professional" thieves stole specific pieces of Berra's memorabilia.&lt;ref name=breakin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/break-yogi-berra-museum-priceless-memorabilia-stolen-article-1.1967277|title=Break in at Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, priceless memorabilia linked to Yankees legend stolen|first1=Bill|last1=Madden|first2=Filip|last2=Bondy|first3=Michael|last3=O'Keeffe|first4=Thomas|last4=Tracy|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The museum contains items from Berra's career, including [[baseball card]]s, a jacket worn by Berra while throwing out the [[first pitch]] of Game 1 of the [[2009 World Series]], two of his [[MLB MVP]] awards, and all 10 [[World Series ring]]s he received as a player.&lt;ref name=timesdaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=breakin/&gt; Following the resolution of Berra's feud with Steinbrenner, the Yankees loaned the [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] from the [[1998 World Series]] to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19990109&amp;id=QElUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bI4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6056,2393759|title=Berra museum to show Yankees' trophy|page=2B|work=[[Boca Raton News]]|date=January 9, 1999|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the museum teamed up with [[Athlete Ally]] to develop an exhibit called "Championing Respect", which aims to support the inclusion of [[LGBT]] athletes in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branch|first=John|title=Berra Museum to Highlight Inclusion in Sports|url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/berra-museum-to-highlight-inclusion-in-sports/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibit in 2014 celebrated the 75th anniversary of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s farewell speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.yankees.mlb.com/news/article/93967536/new-exhibit-at-yogi-berra-museum-pays-homage-to-lou-gehrig-pete-frates|title=New exhibit pays homage to Gehrig, Frates|first=Jamal|last=Collier|work=MLB.com |date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum offers a wide range of school and public programs on all aspects of sports and society. It conducts guided school tours and education programs, provides off-site assemblies on anti-bullying and sportsmanship, and also collaborates with Montclair State University on programs examining topical issues in media and sports.

In promoting the values of respect and sportsmanship, the Museum, in partnership with Investors Bank and the Super Essex Conference, developed a Best Teammate Award program in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hssports/blog/football/index.ssf/2014/05/yogi_berra_honors_unsung_high_school_athletes_with_best_teammate_award.html|title=Yogi Berra honors unsung high school athletes with "Best Teammate Award" (Politi)|work=NJ.com|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing outstanding leadership by student-athletes.

The Museum also offers an array of summer camps, including youth baseball and softball camps.
