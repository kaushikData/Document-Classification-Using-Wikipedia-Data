The '''[[1973–74 WHA season|1973–74]] [[Quebec Nordiques]] season''' was the Nordiques second season, as they were coming off a 33–40–5 record, earning 71 points, failing to qualify for the playoffs in their first season.

The Nordiques would replace head coach [[Maurice Filion]] in the off-season, and name recently retired NHL superstar goaltender [[Jacques Plante]] as head coach of the team.  The club also acquired [[Serge Bernier]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[Réjean Houle|Rejean Houle]] from the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] to try to spark the offense.

The Nordiques would improve and finish over .500 for the first time in team history with a 38–36–4 record, however, they would once again come up short for a playoff berth, finishing only 1 point behind the [[Chicago Cougars]] for the final spot.

Offensively, Quebec was led by [[Serge Bernier]], as he would post a team best 86 points, scoring a Nordiques record 37 goals along the way.  [[Bob Guindon]] would have a very solid season, scoring 31 goals and 70 points, while [[Alain Caron (ice hockey)|Alain Coron]] would also score 31 goals while appearing in only 59 games due to injuries.  Defenseman [[J. C. Tremblay]] would anchor the defense, scoring 9 goals and earning 53 points, while [[Pierre Roy]] supplied the team toughness, recording 137 penalty minutes in only 44 games.

In goal, [[Richard Brodeur]] would lead the Nordiques in wins with 15 and save percentage at .901, while [[Michel DeGuise]] would post a team best 3.29 GAA, playing in a team high 32 games.  [[Serge Aubry]] also had some playing time, winning 11 games.

The '''2009 European football betting scandal''' was an attempt to [[match fixing|influence the outcome]] of professional [[association football]] matches in Europe, and to defraud the gambling industry by betting on the results.&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/20/uefa-match-fixing-germany|title=Europe hit by 'biggest-ever' match-fixing scandal|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 November 2009|date=20 November 2009 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Gibson| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091123171042/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/nov/20/uefa-match-fixing-germany| archivedate= 23 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation centres on around two-hundred fixtures, including domestic league games in nine European countries: Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, Hungary, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Austria.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; It also involved twelve qualifying matches in the [[UEFA Europa League]], and three in the [[UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name=UEFA1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=922086.html |title=UEFA statement on match-fixing case |publisher=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=21 November 2009 |date=20 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061118/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind%3D64/newsid%3D922086.html |archivedate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Limacher, a spokesman for European football's governing body [[UEFA]], described it as "the biggest match-fixing scandal ever to hit Europe."&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8370748.stm|title=Match-fixing inquiry probes 200 European football games|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|date=20 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120303175141/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8370748.stm| archivedate=3 March 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote="If results are fixed in advance, football has no further reason to exist."|source=[[Michel Platini]].&lt;ref name=guard2/&gt;'''}}
The 2009 European football betting scandal was considered to be the biggest affair in European football since the [[Bundesliga scandal (2005)|2005 football scandal]] of referee Robert Hoyzer and the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|Bundesliga-scandal]] in the 1970/71 season when numerous players, coaches and officials were involved in game shifts. The extent and effects were regarded as even greater than in the previous manipulations in football.&lt;ref name="Wettskandal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/betrugsverdacht-bei-200-spielen-riesiger-wettskandal-erschuettert-europas-fussball-a-662480.html |title=Riesiger Wettskandal erschüttert Europas Fußball |last1=Glindmeier |first1=Mike |last2=Korge |first2=Johannes |date=20 November 2009 |publisher=Spiegel |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspapers refer to this scandal as the "biggest fraud scandal of all time" and Peter Limacher, head of the disciplinary department of [[UEFA]], spoke of it as the "biggest fraud scandal ever in European football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diepresse.com/home/sport/fussball/523142/Fussball_Der-grosste-Betrugsskandal-aller-Zeiten |title=Fußball: Der größte Betrugsskandal aller Zeiten |last1=Leingruber |first1=Martina |date=20 November 2009 |publisher=Die Presse |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to information from the Bochum prosecutor's office on 20 November 2009, at least 200 football matches had been manipulated in nine European countries since the beginning of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/wettskandal-im-fussball-die-gekauften-tore-der-profikicker-1.151061 |title=Die gekauften Tore der Profikicker |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraudsters had bribed players, coaches and officials to influence gameplay.

The two Croatian brothers Ante and Milan Sapina were arrested on 19 November 2009 and held responsible for fraud involving the betting manipulated games in Asia (provider: SBOBET with license in the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/tid-16317/fussball-manipulationen-osnabruecker-abstieg-herbeigepfiffen_aid_456051.html |title=Fußball-ManipulationenOsnabrücker Abstieg herbeigepfiffen? |last1=Derichs  |first1=Gregor |date=20 November 2009 |publisher=Focus |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe, totaling about 10 million Euro. They had already been given a prison sentence after the 2005 football scandal.&lt;ref name="Wettskandal" /&gt; A further 15 persons were arrested in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/welt_print/politik/article5282346/Wettskandal-Groesster-Betrug-der-Fussball-Geschichte.html |title=Wettskandal: Größter Betrug der Fußball-Geschichte |last1=Müller |first1=Oliver |date=21 November 2009 |publisher=WeltN24 |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 [[Search and seizure|house searches]] were carried out in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Baden-Wurttemberg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Berlin]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Switzerland, Austria and the United Kingdom. Cash and assets of more than one million Euro were ceased.&lt;ref name="Wettskandal" /&gt;

The UEFA European Football Association suspended the Ukrainian referee Oleg Orijechow, in connection with the betting scandal, and who had supposedly been in personal contact with a member of the betting mafia, according to Spiegel Online. He was summoned to Nyon for a personal hearing at the Federation Center following an investigation by UEFA's anti-corruption unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fussball-wettskandal-uefa-suspendiert-ukrainischen-schiedsrichter-sandhausen-entlaesst-schuon-a-664364.html |title=Uefa suspendiert ukrainischen Schiedsrichter, Sandhausen entlässt Schuon |last1=Wulzinger |first1=Michael |date=30 November 2009 |publisher=Spiegel |access-date=6 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;
UEFA revealed in March 2009 that they were bringing charges against an unnamed European club, later revealed to be Macedonian side [[FK Pobeda]]. Pobeda were found guilty of match-fixing in a tie against Armenian club [[Pyunik]] in 2004. As a consequence, the club was handed an eight-year ban from all European competitions, and club president [[Aleksandar Zabrčanec]] and former captain Nikolce Zdravevski were given lifetime European football bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8004987.stm|title=Match-fix ban for Macedonian club|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=21 November 2009|date=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA president [[Michel Platini]] revealed that his organisation were stepping up their efforts to eradicate match fixing in the game, and that 27,000 fixtures would be monitored in the 2009&amp;ndash;10 season.&lt;ref name=guard2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/26/uefa-match-fixing-charges-platini|title=Uefa to bring match-fixing charges against mystery club|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 November 2009|date=26 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fraud]] was discovered through [[telephone tapping]] of [[organized crime]] activities and has been investigated by the Prosecutorial Office at [[Bochum]], Germany.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sta-bochum.nrw.de/presse/pressemit/index.php|title=Press release, Prosecutorial Office, Bochum|language=German|accessdate=3 December 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630093212/http://www.sta-bochum.nrw.de/presse/pressemit/index.php|archive-date=30 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 November 2009 a series of raids were conducted in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Austria in relation to the betting investigation. They resulted in fifteen arrests in Germany, and a further two in Switzerland, as well as the seizure of cash and property.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

==Affected games and suspects==

===Germany===
In Germany at least 32 games from the [[2. Bundesliga]] to the junior area were manipulated. Including four games of the 2. Bundesliga, three games of the [[3. Liga]], 18 games in the [[Regionalliga]], [[Oberliga (football)|Oberliga]] games and two games from the U-19 division.&lt;ref name="Fussball"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/wettskandal-erklaerung-der-staatsanwaltschaft-im-wortlaut-a-662548.html |title=Erklärung der Staatsanwaltschaft im Wortlaut|date=20 November 2009 |publisher=Spiegel |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the public-law TV magazine Fakt reported that thirteen 2nd and five 3rd league games, 20 regional league games, five league games, as well as, two games in the [[DFB-Pokal]], five U-19 games and other individual friendly games, were under suspicion of manipulation.

A DFB referee was also accused of having been bribed by the alleged fraudulent betters in a regional league game in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fussball-wettskandal-auch-dfb-schiedsrichter-im-visier-der-ermittler-a-662561.html |title=Auch DFB-Schiedsrichter im Visier der Ermittler |date=21 November 2009 |publisher=Spiegel |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In course of the investigation, basketball player of the [[Brose Bamberg|Brose Baskets]] from [[Bamberg]], Ivan Pavic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnn.de/titelseite/238405/ |title=Fußball-Wettskandal: Basketballer in Haft |date=23 November 2009 |publisher=Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Würzburger landes league player, [[Kristian Sprećaković]], were also arrested on 19 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball/bundesliga/wettskandal-fussballprofis-im-zockermilieu-1582858.html |title=Fußballprofis im Zockermilieu |last1=Ashelm |first1=Michael |date=|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four games of the [[SSV Ulm 1846]] in the final phase of the Regionalliga season 2008/09 were under suspicion of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/wettskandal-dfb-schiedsrichter-im-visier-der-ermittler_aid_456123.html |title=Wettskandal: DFB-Schiedsrichter im Visier der Ermittler |date=21 November 2009 |publisher=Focus |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November 2009, the club announced the denunciation of the Croatian players Davor Kraljevic, Marijo Marinovic and Dinko Radojevic in association with the betting scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/wettskandal-ssv-ulm-kuendigt-drei-spielern_aid_458108.html |title=Wettskandal: SSV Ulm kündigt drei Spielern |date=27 November 2009 |publisher=Focus |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2009, [[Fußball-Regionalliga|football regional league club]] [[SC Verl]], suspended midfielders Patrick Neumann and Tim Hagedorn from games and training. The club received indications of attempted tampering for the game against Borussia Mönchengladbach II (4-3) and 1. FC Köln II (0-1) in the 2008/09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftd.de/sport/%3Awettskandal-festnahmen-verl-suspendiert-spieler/50041877.html |title=Festnahmen - Verl suspendiert Spieler |date=24 November 2009 |publisher=Financial Times Deutschland |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130206150331/http://www.ftd.de/sport/:wettskandal-festnahmen-verl-suspendiert-spieler/50041877.html |archivedate=6 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 2009, Neumann admitted to Bochum prosecutor's office that he receive 500 Euro, making him the first professional to sign a confession in the betting scandal. However, he continued to deny any activity in the manipulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/wm-2010/national-wettskandal-erstes-spieler-gestaendnis_aid_458235.html |title=National: Wettskandal: Erstes Spieler-Geständnis |date=28 November 2009 |publisher=Focus |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defencemen [[Marcel Schuon]] confirmed to the Bochum prosecutor's office, that during his time at [[VfL Osnabrück]], manipulation took place in the second league game against FC Augsburg (0-3) on 17 April 2009. In which he refused to inform anyone of until after the game, which ended as planned 0-3, therefore Schuon was issued a five-digit fine. At the beginning of the 2009/10 season, Schuon switched to the third division team [[SV Sandhausen]], where he was removed by the team  at the end of November 2009 due to his involvement in the betting scandal.

===Austria===
In Austria, 11 matches of the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] and the [[Austrian Football First League|First League]] were affected.&lt;ref name="Fussball" /&gt;

According to UEFA, no Austrian clubs were specifically involved in the betting scandal. Only two European League qualifying matches of the [[SK Rapid Wien]] against [[KF Vllaznia Shkodër|KS Vllaznia Shkodra]] (5-0 and 3-0 for Rapid) were suspected of manipulation according to press reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://derstandard.at/1256745648077/Ermittlungen-Rapid-Spiele-in-Wettskandal-involviert |title=Rapid-Spiele in Wettskandal involviert |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=Der Standard |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of March 2011, betting allegations about the Austrian Bundesliga club [[Kapfenberger SV]] were announced, where, according to various media reports, players of the club had been handed large sums of money, and accused of having perilously lost the [[2009–10 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2009/10 season]] games against [[FC Red Bull Salzburg]] (0-4), the [[SK Rapid Wien]] (0-1) and [[FK Austria Wien]] (0-1). Also at this time, a defensive player from [[Kapfenberg]], among others, was reported to have received €200,000 through a middleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/int_ligen/international-ante-sapina-bestach-spieler-in-oesterreich_aid_605512.html |title=International: Ante Sapina bestach Spieler in Österreich |date=4 March 2011 |publisher=Focus |access-date=8 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, 22 matches of the [[Swiss Challenge League|Challenge League]] and six test games were affected.&lt;ref name="Fussball" /&gt; At least one attempt to manipulate games of the [[Swiss Super League|Super League]] had occurred, but the addressed player reported the bribery attempt to the federation. Two suspects have been arrested.

====Suspicions towards games of FC Thun====
The federal prosecutor suspected [[FC Thun]] players to have manipulated the game against [[Yverdon Sport FC]] on 26 April. The suspicion was that FC Thun should lose the game with four goals difference, and the game actually ended 5-1. The Thun striker [[Pape Omar Faye]] was interrogated by the police, the week before the trophy game against Winterthur (22 November 2009) and then suspended by the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/sport/fussball/Faye-gehoert-nach-wie-vor-zu-unserer-Thuner-Familie/story/22226945 |title=«Faye gehört nach wie vor zu unserer Thuner Familie» |last1=Wäfler  |first1=Alexander |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=BZ Berner Zeitung |access-date=9 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a striker, from his playing position, can hardly be responsible for five goals against, other players were suspected of having received several 10,000 euros.

====Suspicions towards games of FC Gossau====
[[FC Gossau]] suffered a striking series of defeats at the end of the 2008/09 season. The federal prosecutor suspected specifically players of FC Gossau of having manipulated the games against FC Locarno on 24 May 2009 and against [[Servette FC]]. FC Gossau was expected to lose the game against Locarno with at least four goals difference and the game actually ended 0-4.  The then goalkeeper of Gossau, Darko Damjanovic, was said have been taken into custody by police, but went undercover. Gossau’s midfielder, Mario Bigoni, publicly stated that a previous season's game was "not clean" and that he had received a bid from a fellow player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vol.at/ex-fc-gossau-spieler-bigoni-verschwunden/3054622 |title=Ex-FC-Gossau-Spieler Bigoni verschwunden |date=14 October 2011 |publisher=Vorarlberg Online |access-date=9 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not known if Bigoni had accepted the offer, he was suspended by his club. Also supposedly Gossau received tens of thousands of euros, 20,000 alone for the game against Locarno.  On 26 October 2011, the police confirmed that Bigoni had been found dead three days earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/ostschweiz/tb-os/Ist-Mario-Bigoni-tot;art120094,2706039 |title=Ist Mario Bigoni tot? |last1=Kamber  |first1=Marco |date=24 October 2011 |publisher=Tagblatt |access-date=9 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alter Rhein]] near [[Rheineck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport.orf.at/stories/2086333/ |title=Fußballprofi Mario Bigoni tot aufgefunden |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=ORF |access-date=9 December 2016 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Test game====
The Bosnian club, [[NK Travnik]], completed a training camp in Switzerland in the summer of 2009, with test matches against the clubs [[Neuchâtel Xamax]] (2-3), Servette FC Genève (1-3) and [[FC Sion]] (1-4). It became known that a betting syndicate from Asia was financially involved in the costs of the training camp. The president of FC Sion, [[Christian Constantin]], publicly voiced the suspicions that the Bosnians let win FC Sion.

===China===
The Chinese police arrested a total of 16 people, including 12 club members and four high-ranking football officials, including the former vice president of the [[Chinese Football Association]], Yang Xu, on 25 November 2009, in the wake of the international inquiries of the betting scandal.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/welt_print/sport/article5332162/Wettskandal-Erste-Festnahmen-in-China.html |title=Wettskandal: Erste Festnahmen in China |date=26 November 2009 |publisher=WeltN24 |access-date=10 December 2016|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AT&amp;T Stadium''', formerly '''Cowboys Stadium''', is a [[retractable roof]] stadium in [[Arlington, Texas]], United States. It serves as the home of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and was completed on May 27, 2009.  It is also the home of the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] and the [[Big 12 Championship Game]].  The facility, owned by the city of Arlington, can also be used for a variety of other activities such as concerts, basketball games, college and high school football contests, soccer matches, rodeos and [[motocross]] and Spartan races. It replaced the partially covered [[Texas Stadium]], which served as the Cowboys' home from 1971 through the 2008 season.

The stadium is sometimes referred to as "'''Jerry World'''" after Dallas Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]], who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment mecca.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cowboyswire.usatoday.com/2018/05/29/dallas-cowboys-att-stadium-nfl-rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium seats 80,000,&lt;ref name="stadiumsofprofootball.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumsofprofootball.com/nfc/AT&amp;TStadium.htm |title=AT&amp;T Stadium, Dallas Cowboys football stadium |publisher=Stadiums of Pro Football |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fourth largest [[List of current National Football League stadiums|stadium in the NFL]] by [[seating capacity]]. The maximum capacity of the stadium with [[Standing-room only|standing room]] is 105,000.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/united_states/texas.shtml |title=Stadiums in the United States :: Texas |publisher=World Stadiums |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record attendance for an NFL game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; The Party Pass (open areas) sections are behind seats in each end zone and on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways.&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aqtlnqwjSsP8|accessdate=July 5, 2010|date=August 3, 2009|title=Dallas Cowboys Target NFL Record by Making Fans Stand for $29|publisher=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the [[List of largest video screens|world's 29th largest high definition video screen]], which hangs from 20-yard line to 20-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/12/13/cowboys-new-stadium-to-get-over-20-000-square-feet-of-video-scr/|title=Cowboys' new stadium to get over 20,000 square feet of video screen|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design==
[[File:Cowboys Stadium full view.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Interior]]
Originally estimated to cost $650 million, the stadium's current construction cost was $1.15 billion,&lt;ref name="football.ballparks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.ballparks.com/NFL/DallasCowboys/newindex.htm|title=Cowboys Stadium|publisher=Football.ballparks.com|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built. To aid Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5%, the hotel occupancy tax by 2%, and car rental tax by 5%. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding,&lt;ref name="football.ballparks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brb.state.tx.us/lgs_search.aspx?action=city |title=Local Government Services Database Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jones covered any cost overruns. Also, the NFL provided the Cowboys with an additional $150 million loan, following its policy for facilitating financing for the construction of new stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2695427|title=Cowboys unveil plans for new stadium|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=December 13, 2006|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of nearly {{convert|300|ft|m|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-tall arches spans the length of the [[stadium]] [[dome]], anchored to the ground at each end. The new stadium also includes "more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites, concourses, concession areas and more, offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonyinsider.com/2009/04/20/dallas-cowboys-new-stadium-chock-full-of-sony-hd/|title=Dallas Cowboys New Stadium Chock Full Of Sony HD|publisher=Sony Insider|date=April 20, 2009|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also houses a center-hung [[Mitsubishi]] video display board that was the largest [[high-definition television]] screen in the world at the time of their installation.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chase |first=Chris |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Guinness-World-Records-to-bw-1520012443.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003120755/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Guinness-World-Records-to-bw-1520012443.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2009 |title=Guinness World Records to Recognize Dallas Cowboys and Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision for World's Largest Video Display |publisher=finance.yahoo.com |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been surpassed in size by the [[Panasonic]] "Big Hoss" video board (218 feet (66 m) wide and 94.6 feet (28.8 m) tall) at [[Texas Motor Speedway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/texas-motor-speedway-unveils-largest-hd-screen-22979104|title=Sports News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass doors, allowing each end zone to be opened, were designed and constructed by Dallas-based Haley-Greer glass systems.

The retractable roof was designed by structural engineering firm [[Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants|Walter P Moore]] and the systems were implemented by mechanization consultants [[Uni-Systems]]. The [[Electrification (rail)|electrification]] of Cowboys Stadium's [[retractable roof]] was developed by VAHLE, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vahleinc.com/stadium-systems.html|title=Stadium Systems &amp; Technology : Vahle Electrification|publisher=Vahleinc.com|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These [[Kinetic Architecture]] fundamentals will be employed in order to create quick conversions of the facility to accommodate a variety of events. When the design was officially unveiled on December&amp;nbsp;12, 2006, it showed that, from inside the stadium, the roof (membrane installed by K&amp;nbsp;Post Company of Dallas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2009/03/09/focus5.html|accessdate=April 16, 2009|title=Snapshot: Key contracts awarded for Dallas Cowboys stadium|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|date=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; will look very similar to the Texas Stadium roof, with its trademark hole. However, it can be covered by the retractable roof panel to protect against the elements.

The football turf field was built by Hellas Construction. They developed a special SoftTop Convertible Turf System that has 26 interchangeable panels to allow the stadium to host a variety of events from concerts, dirt bike and monster truck rallies to college football, basketball, and soccer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame is planned for the Hall of Fame level. The drawings also include a site for a large sculpture northeast of the stadium, close to Randol Mill Road.

Mayor Robert Cluck claimed to use eminent domain as a last resort but most of the properties refused to sell to the city, indicating that the incentive program was not adequate according to Glenn Sodd, an attorney representing some home owners in the area. Attorney Bob Cohen, who is representing some of the property owners, said the city gave many of his clients little incentive to sell. He said he represents the owners of some rental properties who were counting on that monthly revenue for their retirement and said most homeowners cannot afford to re-build or buy in that area with the incentive package.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallas Morning News'': [https://archive.is/20130911153708/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/100205dnmetstadium.27f8919.html Arlington turning to eminent domain for stadium land].  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cowboys stadium panning.ogv|thumb|300px|Video of inside the stadium]]
*1994: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says he wants to expand the 65,000-seat [[Texas Stadium]] by up to 40,000 seats, add retractable roof panels and install a climate-control system to make the stadium a year-round venue for sporting events, including the [[Super Bowl]], concerts, and conventions.
*1997–2000: The Cowboys hold preliminary talks with Arlington officials about building a stadium there. The team also publicly discusses a $260&amp;nbsp;million plan to upgrade Texas Stadium. In 2000, the Cowboys compile a list of potential stadium sites, which include [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine]], [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], and Arlington. The team continues negotiating with [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] to renovate Texas Stadium.
*2001: Jones says Arlington is a leading contender for a $500 million stadium. The primary site considered is the {{convert|2000|acre|abbr=on}} Lakes of Arlington tract on Farm Road 157. Other cities in the running include Grapevine and [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]]. In October, Jones discusses the new stadium with the mayors of Arlington, Irving, Grapevine, and Dallas.
*2003: The Cowboys ask the Irving City Council to extend their lease at Texas Stadium, which expires at the end of the 2008 season, on a year-to-year basis. They narrow their search to sites in [[Las Colinas]] and Dallas, and state legislators file bills that would allow Dallas County to increase its hotel occupancy and car rental taxes to pay for a new stadium.
*2004: In April, the Cowboys announce plans to build a $650 million stadium at [[Fair Park]] in Dallas. The deal requires $425&amp;nbsp;million in public financing from a 3% hotel-occupancy tax and a 6% car-rental tax. The deal falls apart in June when [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] commissioners say they cannot justify asking voters to approve the team's request for $425&amp;nbsp; million in public funding. In July, the Cowboys and Arlington announce they are negotiating to locate the stadium near [[Globe Life Park]] (then Ameriquest Field). In August, the Arlington City Council agrees unanimously to put before voters a tax increase that would fund the city's $325&amp;nbsp;million portion of the project. Voters approve the tax increase on November&amp;nbsp;2.
*2005: Arlington and the Cowboys choose the site south of Randol Mill Road and east of Collins Street for the new stadium. The city begins notifying residents and property owners of its plans to acquire their property. The Cowboys hire the HKS architectural firm to design the stadium. Early blueprints show 414 luxury suites and a two-panel retractable roof. The city completes its sale of $297.9&amp;nbsp; million in bonds to pay for its portion of the construction.

==Video board==
[[Guinness World Records]] was on hand at the September 28, 2009 game against the Carolina Panthers to award certificates to the Chairman of [[Mitsubishi Electric]] and Dallas Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]] for the World's Largest [[High-definition video|High-Definition Video Display]].&lt;ref name="Chase"/&gt; For basketball events played in Cowboys Stadium, such as the [[2010 NBA All-Star Game]], the video board is actually larger than the court. It has since been surpassed in size by the video boards at [[TIAA Bank Field]].

During the debut preseason game of Cowboys Stadium on August 21, 2009, a punt by Tennessee Titans punter [[A. J. Trapasso]] hit the 175 feet (53.34 m) wide screen above the field. The punt deflected backwards and was ruled in-play until Titans coach [[Jeff Fisher]] informed the officials that the punt struck the [[scoreboard]]. By rule, the down was replayed. Jerry Jones believes that Trapasso was trying to hit the scoreboard, saying, "If you look at how you [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] the [[American football ball|football]], unless you're trying to hit the scoreboard, you punt the ball to get downfield. You certainly want to get some hangtime, but you punt the ball to get downfield, and you sure don't punt the ball down the middle. You punt it off to the side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chase|first=Chris|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Punt-hits-video-screen-at-new-Cowboys-Stadium?urn=nfl,184487|title=Punt hits video screen at new Cowboys Stadium – Shutdown Corner – NFL – Yahoo! Sports|publisher=Sports.yahoo.com|date=August 22, 2009|accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the screen would affect an opposing team's punting strategy has been debated. For teams with strategies centered on maximizing hang-time, physicist Christopher Moore of [[Longwood University]] has shown via computer simulation that well-kicked punts have the potential to hit the screen no matter the field position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Archer |first=Todd |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/football/cowboys/stories/082509dnspocowlede.3ff1433.html |title=The Cowboys Stadium digital board is a hot topic |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=August 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115043318/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/football/cowboys/stories/082509dnspocowlede.3ff1433.html |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trapasso disputed Jones' suggestion that he was intentionally trying to hit the board, and other NFL punters have suggested that the board may pose a problem for longer hang-time punts. The screen was retrofitted with 16 custom winches using 11,000 feet (3.35&amp;nbsp;km) of {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} domestic galvanized wire rope from [[Tway Lifting Products]] to accomplish the safe, efficient transport of the video board in time to make room for [[U2|U2's]] massive set during their [[360° Tour]], and was moved back down after the concert.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The video board is also the primary attachment point for up to 370,000&amp;nbsp;lb (168 metric tons) of concert and theatrical rigging.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On August 24, 2013, Cowboys punter [[Chris Jones (punter)|Chris Jones]] became the second player to hit the scoreboard.

The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport in that year. The award was decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist voted for their top two choices; their first preference was awarded two points, and their second preference was awarded one point. The winning sportsperson had the most total points. In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7735134.stm|title=Sports Personality voting &amp; judging: Terms &amp; conditions|date=18 November 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090118025110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7735134.stm| archivedate= 18 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the public voted for this award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1581">The '''Baxter Cup''' is the oldest New Zealand trophy in the sport of [[curling]]. First contested in 1884, it is thought to be the oldest still-contested New Zealand sporting trophy.&lt;ref name ="NZC"&gt;"[http://curling.org.nz/index.php/component/content/article/87/463-naseby-council--baxter-cup Naseby Council — Baxter Cup]", New Zealand Curling. Retrieved 15 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy competition was initially held in [[Dunedin]] at the Dunedin Curling Club, but went into abeyance in 1895 after that club was dissolved. The competition was next held in [[Central Otago]] in 1900, and has been contested irregularly since that time.&lt;ref&gt;Since the Naseby rink is an open-air natural ice venue, bonspiels can only be held in years where the weather is cold enough.&lt;/ref&gt; The competition is currently organised by the [[Naseby, New Zealand|Naseby]] Curling Council as a one-day [[bonspiel]].&lt;ref name="NZC"/&gt;

The Baxter Cup was named after David Baxter, a founding member of the Dunedin Curling Club who, who donated the trophy.&lt;ref name="NZC"/&gt;

The current (2017) champions are the Kyeburn Curling Club from [[Kyeburn]], who won the final in July 2017 against [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]]'s Mount Ida Curling Club.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.curling.org.nz/index.php/naseby-council-and-clubs/1203-2017-baxter-cup Weather gods smile on Baxter Cup]", New Zealand Curling, 31 July 2017.

It is the only part of Borleske that is not to move that is not part of seating part of Borleske Stadium that is not seating related. Alcohol is only available during [[Walla Walla Sweets|Sweets]] games. Also, absolutely no external food or drink is allowed past the gates of Borleske Stadium.

===Renovations===

====Field Boxes====
Six field boxes were added right along the fence along the first base line.&lt;ref name=wwsbshist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wallawallasweets.com/stadium/history/ |publisher=Walla Walla Sweets |title=Borleske Stadium history |accessdate=July 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819023027/http://wallawallasweets.com/stadium/history/ |archivedate=August 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each field box holds 10 seats and every two boxes are served by a stadium waiter. The first three boxes include protective netting - an indicator of just how close to the action these boxes are! All six come with drink/snack trays and daily, complimentary Sweets programs, stuffed with a Budweiser scorecard and the daily Sherwin Williams Borleske Bulletin.

====Diamond/Premier Seats====
The Diamond (AA &amp; BB) and Premier (CC &amp; DD) seating sections are located directly behind home plate. A total of 252 stadium-style seats were added, 14 of which are Physically Disabled Accessible along with 14 companion seats. The premier seats come with waiter service for your convenience, so you will never miss any of the action!

====The Sweets Shoppe====
The Sweets Shoppe at Borleske Stadium is a fully functioning point of sale for all Sweets' merchandise, hats, clothing and apparel. It opens one hour before first pitch and closes during the 9th inning on a daily basis. The Sweets Shoppe is located on the main concourse directly across from the Concessions Stand.

====Concessions Stand====
The complete overhaul of the Borleske Stadium Concessions Stand included a new range and freezer/refrigeration system, a new three-section sink for proper cleaning, a new floor, new walls and three new points of sale to allow customers to move in and out of the concessions area quickly.

====The Sweet Spot====
Located down the right field line, nestled up against the visiting bullpen is the Sweet Spot presented by Key Technology. The Sweet Spot serves as a party deck for group ticket holders over 20 that elect for an all-you-can-eat BBQ starting a half hour before gates open to the public and running up to first pitch. The Sweet Spot has a 100-person capacity and houses the Borleske Stadium covered grill.

====Dugouts====
The new and improved dugouts at Borleske Stadium are sunken into the ground and feature a double-deck seating area, artificial surface at ground level to walk on and view the game, a storage area for helmets and bats and a protective netting that runs the length of each dugout to keep foul balls from screaming into the sitting area without obstructing the view from within.

====Budweiser Beer Garden====
Many adults at Borleske Stadium find their way down the left field line to the [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] Beer Garden. The Bud Barn serves Budweiser products and local micro brews along with several local wines. It is a popular spectating area, providing umbrella-covered tables and chairs and starting in 2011, pub tables and bar stools.

[[File:Mordiro.jpg|thumb|Coasteering near [[Porthclais]], [[Pembrokeshire]]]]
'''Coasteering''' is a physical activity that encompasses movement along the [[intertidal zone]] of a rocky coastline on foot or by swimming, without the aid of boats, surf boards or other craft. It is difficult to define the precise boundaries between, for example, rockpooling and ocean swimming. Coasteering may include all or some of the following:
*''Swimming or Adventure Swimming:'' in calm water; rough or white water; and/ or tidal currents. Dressing for swimming in the sea ([[wetsuit]]s, buoyancy aids etc.) is an integral part of Coasteering; even on routes where it is possible to stay dry. A route, or activity, where the group start out with the intention of staying dry - whether through route choice or the use of ropes and harnesses - is not coasteering.
*''Climbing, scrambling, canyoning, sea level traversing:'' the very nature of the coastline that is needed for coasteering demands aspects of these activities. Ropes, as security on rock, are not used. Any climbing activity usually takes place above deep water, with safety spotters used where appropriate. There is a similarity to the sport of [[deep-water soloing]], but this would normally be carried out by experienced individuals not wearing equipment suitable for coasteering. Coasteering is never a dry, climbing activity.
*''Jumping and Diving:'' are often seen as an appealing and exciting part of coasteering. These activities actually make up minimal content of a coasteering session.

A defining factor of coasteering is the opportunity provided by the marine geology for moving in the “impact zone” where water, waves, rocks, gullies, caves etc., come together to provide a very high energy environment.

==History==
Although all aspects of coasteering have been informally practised by people for a very long time, if only as a means of access to a cut-off cove beyond a headland, the term appears first to have been used in 1973. In the book ''Sea Cliff Climbing'', John Cleare and Robin Collomb said "A few enthusiasts believe that coasteering will become popular and has a big future".

In the 1990s, it emerged as a commercially guided recreational activity initially along the cliff coastline of [[Pembrokeshire]] in [[Wales]]. By 1997 write-ups started appearing in the travel/recreational pages of the newspapers showing that several commercial companies were offering such activity.

In 1999, one guide company licensed a trade mark incorporating the word "Coasteering" in a distinctive script. However, the word was by then in general use to describe the activity.

The activity then spread to all regions of the UK where there are suitable rocky coasts, including Cornwall, Pembrokeshire, Anglesey and the Highlands and Isles of Scotland.

Dorset was one of the last counties with a suitable coastline to offer coasteering, with commercial providers starting to offer the activity as late as 2009; However Dorset is now arguably the busiest coasteering destination in the UK with upwards of 10,000 paying clients every year.

The advisory organisation for coasteering is the National Coasteering Charter (NCC).

In the UK the activity is recognized by the [http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/index.htm Adventure Activities Licensing Authority] which is a department of the [[Health and Safety Executive]].

==Guided adventure experience==
The rocky cliff coasts of western Britain provide the world's principal location for organised guided coasteering, where it is available from over 100 activity centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aals.org.uk/aals/provider_results.php?provider_name=&amp;town=&amp;county=&amp;region=&amp;Climbing=34&amp;Watersports=&amp;Trekking=&amp;Caving=&amp;Submit=Search List of AALA Recognized Providers for Combined Rock and Water Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually half day or one day trips are offered at a variety of levels catering for beginners, intermediates and advanced. Some trips are especially slanted towards study of the [[coastal ecology]].

Some centres cater for parties of school children.

==Adventure races==
Coasteering may be included as one of the disciplines for a stage of an [[adventure racing|adventure race]]. This is especially common in New Zealand, but is also to be found in Australia, Canada, and the USA.

==Safety==
In the UK, the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] has an information sheet of good practice for the Adventure Activities Industry [http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/etis13.pdf].

===Basic safety equipment===
Safety equipment reflects the environment in which the sport is performed and often includes:
*[[Wetsuit]] (for cooler waters outside the tropics)
*Protective clothing and gloves to prevent abrasions - may be provided by the wet suit
*Shoes to provide grip on rocks
*Buoyancy aid
*Helmet

===Hazards===
Because of the diverse practices involved in the sport there are a number of hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/etis13.pdf HSE Information Sheet for Combined Water and Rock Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impact with rocks
* Drowning
* Hypothermia

The '''Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement''' ('''CETA''') is a [[free-trade agreement]] between [[Canada]], the [[European Union]] and its member states.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMtentative"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/belgians-reach-deal-on-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement/article32542390/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been provisionally applied,&lt;ref&gt;http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/september/tradoc_156062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; so the [[treaty]] has eliminated 98% of the tariffs between Canada and the EU.

The negotiations were concluded in August 2014. All [[Member state of the European Union|28 European Union member states]] approved the final text of CETA for signature, with [[Belgium]] being the final country to give its approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/135717|title=Belgium green lights unchanged Ceta|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Trudeau]], Prime Minister of Canada, travelled to Brussels on 30 October 2016 to sign on behalf of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/6934897-trudeau-brussels-bound-to-sign-ceta-on-sunday/|title=Trudeau Brussels-bound to sign CETA on Sunday|last=YorkRegion.com|website=www.yorkregion.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Parliament approved the deal on 15 February 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | title=CETA: MEPs back EU-Canada trade agreement | author=Bálint Péter Linder | date=2017-02-15 | publisher=European Parliament Press Service | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170209IPR61728/ceta-meps-back-eu-canada-trade-agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is subject to ratification by the EU and national legislatures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prime-minister-trudeau-signs-canada-eu-trade-deal-in-brussels/article32586423/|title=Trudeau signs CETA but final ratification still required by European Union|first=Paul|last=Waldie|date=30 October 2016|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMtentative"/&gt; and can only enter into force if no adverse opinion is given by the European Court of Justice following a request for an opinion by Belgium.&lt;ref name=CJEUref/&gt; Until its formal entry into force, substantial parts are provisionally applied from 21 September 2017.&lt;ref name=prov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-17-1959_en.htm|work=European Commission|title=EU and Canada agree to set a date for the provisional application of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

The European Commission indicates the treaty will lead to savings of just over half a billion euros in taxes for EU exporters every year, mutual recognition in regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers, and easier transfers of company staff and other professionals between the EU and Canada. The European Commission claims CETA will create a more level playing field between Canada and the EU on intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154331.pdf|title=What will the EU gain from CETA?|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of CETA emphasize that the agreement will boost trade between the EU and Canada and thus create new jobs, facilitate business operations by abolishing customs duties, goods checks, and various other levies, facilitate mutual recognition of diplomas and regulate investment disputes by creating a new system of courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/croatia/news/eu_canada_trade_agreement_enters_into_force_hr|title=Trgovinski sporazum između EU-a i Kanade stupa na snagu—Hrvatska—European Commission|first=Ksenija|last=SKREBLIN|date=20 September 2017|website=Hrvatska—European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/hr/sporazum-o-slobodnoj-trgovini-ceta/a-40623781|title=Sporazum o slobodnoj trgovini CETA—Gospodarstvo—DW—21.09.2017|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents consider that CETA would weaken European consumer rights, including high EU standards concerning [[food safety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/gabriel-optimistic-over-eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal/a-36073644|title=Gabriel optimistic over EU-Canada CETA trade deal {{!}} Business {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 18.10.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticize it as a boon only for [[big business]] and [[multinational corporation]]s, while risking net-losses, unemployment, and environmental damage impacting individual citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37450742|title=EU Commission refuses to revise Canada Ceta trade deal|date=2016-09-23|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/files/download/ceta-isds-en_0.pdf|title=Trading Away Democracy, HOW CETA’S INVESTOR PROTECTION RULES THREATEN THE PUBLIC GOOD IN CANADA AND THE EU|author1=Pia Eberhardt |author2=Blair Redlin |author3=Cecile Toubeau |date=November 2014|website=tni.org|publisher=Published by Association Internationale de Techniciens, Experts et Chercheurs (Aitec), Vienna Chamber of Labour (AK Vienna), Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), Council of Canadians, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU), German NGO Forum on Environment &amp; Development, Friends of the Earth Europe (FoEE), PowerShift, Quaker Council for European Affairs (QCEA), Quebec Network on Continental Integration (RQIC), Trade Justice Network, Transnational Institute (TNI), Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E).|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cela.ca/sites/cela.ca/files/1085-Standing%20Committee%20Submissions%20on%20CETA_Nov_30_2016.pdf|title=Submissions to the Standing Committee on International Trade Re: An Act to Implement the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Bill C-30)|last=Blaise|first=Kerrie|date=30 Nov 2016|website=Canadian Environmental Law Association|publisher=Canadian Environmental Law Association|access-date=5 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal also includes a controversial [[investor-state dispute settlement]] mechanism which makes critics fear that multinational corporations could sue national governments for billions of dollars if they thought that the government policies had a bad impact on their business.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A poll conducted by [[Angus Reid Institute]] in February 2017 concluded that 55 percent of Canadians support CETA, while only 10 percent oppose it.

==History==
CETA is Canada's biggest bilateral initiative since [[NAFTA]]. It was started as a result of a joint study "Assessing the Costs and Benefits of a Closer EU-Canada Economic Partnership",&lt;ref name="link to study"/&gt; which was released in October 2008. Officials announced the launch of negotiations on 6 May 2009 at the Canada-EU Summit in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/canada/eu_canada/trade_relation/ceta/index_en.htm |website=Delegation of the EU to Canada |publisher=European External Action Service |accessdate=22 October 2014 |ref=towards-ceta |title=Towards a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505112357/http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/canada/eu_canada/trade_relation/ceta/index_en.htm |archivedate=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, after the Canada-EU Summit in Ottawa on 18 March 2004 where leaders agreed to a framework for a new Canada-EU Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement (TIEA). The TIEA was intended to move beyond traditional market access issues, to include areas such as trade and investment facilitation, competition, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, financial services, e-commerce, temporary entry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, [[sustainable development]], and sharing science and technology.
The TIEA was also to build on a Canada-EU regulatory co-operation framework for promoting bilateral co-operation on approaches to regulatory governance, advancing good regulatory practices and facilitating trade and investment. In addition to lowering barriers, the TIEA was meant to heighten Canadian and European interest in each other's markets.&lt;ref name="TIEA"/&gt; The TIEA continued until 2006 when Canada and the EU decided to pause negotiations. This led to negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and this agreement will go beyond the TIEA toward an agreement with a much broader and more ambitious scope.
[[File:Stop TTIP-CETA Protest in Brussels 20-09-2016 (06).jpg|thumb|The Stop TTIP-CETA protest in [[Brussels]], Belgium, 20 September 2016]]

An agreement in principle was signed by Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and [[European Commission]] President [[José Manuel Barroso]] on 18 October 2013. The negotiations were concluded on 1 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/entwurf-fuer-ceta-verhandlungen-ueber-freihandelsabkommen-mit-kanada-abgeschlossen-1.2078844 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |title=Verhandlungen über Freihandelsabkommen mit Kanada abgeschlossen (Negotiations with Canada on freetrade agreement completed) |date=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The trade agreement was officially presented on 25 September 2014 by Harper and Barroso during an EU - Canada Summit at the Royal York Hotel in downtown [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embassynews.ca/news/2014/09/24/%E2%80%98symbolic%E2%80%99-leaders%E2%80%99-summit-to-mark-the-end-of-ceta-talks/46100|accessdate=2014-09-25 |title="Symbolic" summit to mark end of CETA talks |date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canada Europe Roundtable for Business has served as the parallel business process from the launch to the conclusion of the CETA negotiations.

After it had been leaked by German public television on 14 August, the 1634 pages long Consolidated CETA text was published on the EU's official website on 26 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf |title=Consolidated CETA Text |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completion, translation of the final text into 24 EU languages, and ratification is expected to take years since the passage of the deal approval of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] as well as Canada and the individual [[EU member states|28 EU member states]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CETA: Canada-EU free trade deal lauded by Harper, Barroso | author=Laura Payton | date=2013-10-18 | publisher=CBC News | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ceta-canada-eu-free-trade-deal-lauded-by-harper-barroso-1.2125122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2012/04/26/canadaeurope_trade_deal_risks_derailment_over_visa_spat.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Canada-Europe deal risks derailment over visa spat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research commissioned by negotiating parties==
{{Update|documentation|date=February 2016}}
The EU-Canada Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA), a three-part study commissioned by the European Commission to independent experts and completed in September 2011, provides a comprehensive prediction on the impacts of CETA.&lt;ref name="SIAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SIAFA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FB"/&gt; It predicts a number of macro-economic and sector-specific impacts, suggesting the EU may see increases in real GDP of 0.02–0.03% in the long-term from CETA, whereas Canada may see increases of 0.18–0.36%; the Investment section of the report suggests these numbers could be higher when factoring in investment increases. At the sectoral level, the study predicts the greatest gains in output and trade to be stimulated by services liberalization and by the removal of tariffs applied on sensitive agricultural products; it also suggests CETA could have a positive social impact if it includes provisions on the ILO's Core Labour Standards and Decent Work Agenda. The study details a variety of impacts in various "cross-cutting" components of CETA: it advocates against controversial NAFTA-style [[Investor State Dispute Settlement|ISDS]] provisions; predicts potentially imbalanced benefits from a government procurement (GP) chapter; assumes CETA will lead to an upward harmonization in [[intellectual property|IPR]] regulations, particularly changing Canadian IPR laws; and predicts impacts in terms of competition policy and several other areas.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

==Economic ties between the EU and Canada==
Canada and the EU have a long history of economic co-operation. Comprising 28 Member States with a total population of over 500 million and a GDP of €13.0 trillion in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross domestic product at market prices|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/refreshTableAction.do;jsessionid=9ea7d07d30df81d7d40a2e93409b986efd20d5e17291.e34MbxeSaxaSc40LbNiMbxeNaNaNe0?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00001&amp;language=en|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Union (EU) is the world's largest single market, foreign investor and trader. As an integrated bloc, the EU represents Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. In 2008, Canadian goods and services exports to the EU totalled [[Canadian dollar|C$]]52.2 billion, an increase of 3.9% from 2007, and imports from the EU amounted to $62.4 billion.

According to [[Statistics Canada]], the EU is also the second largest source of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in Canada, with the stock of FDI amounting to $133.1 billion at the end of 2008. In 2008, the stock of Canada's direct investment in the EU totalled $136.6 billion, and the EU is the destination of 21.4% of Canadian direct investment abroad. According to [[Eurostat]], the EU identified Canada as its third largest destination and its fourth largest source of FDI in 2007.

== Copyright provisions ==
{{POV|date=November 2017}}

Many of its [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement#Copyright provisions|provisions on copyright]] were initially thought to be identical to the controversial [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA]], which was rejected by the [[European Parliament]] in 2012. The European Commission has indicated&lt;ref&gt;http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2012/august/tradoc_149866.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that this is not the case.

Part of the Agreement is stricter enforcement of intellectual property, including [[Legal liability|liability]] for [[Internet Service Provider]]s, a ban on technologies that can be used to circumvent copyright.&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt; After failure of [[ACTA]] the copyright language in CETA was substantially watered down.&lt;ref name=AuFTA&gt;{{cite new|url=http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2018/08/02/future-eu-australia-fta-copyright-expect-ip-chapter/|title=Future EU-Australia FTA and copyright: what could we expect in the IP chapter?|date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=7 September 2018|work=Kluwer Copyright Blog|author=Rita Matulionyte}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following provisions remain:

{{quote|
* '''WIPO ratification.''' The EU asked that Canada respect the rights and obligations under the [[WIPO]] Internet treaties. The EU only formally ratified those treaties in the week of 16 December 2009.
* '''Anti-circumvention provisions.''' The EU asked that Canada implement anti-circumvention provisions that include a ban on the distribution of circumvention devices. There is no such requirement in the WIPO Internet treaties.
* '''ISP Liability provisions.''' The treaty requires both EU and Canada to enact [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] statutory provisions that would limit ISPs liability where they act as mere conduits, cache content, or host content. These protections may not be conditioned on service provides monitoring their service for possible infringements.
* '''Enforcement provisions.''' The EU asked that Canada establish new enforcement provisions including measures to preserve evidence, ordering alleged infringers to disclose information on a wide range of issue[s], mandate disclosure of banking information in commercial infringement cases, allow for [[injunctive relief]], and destruction of goods. There is also a full section on new border measures requirements.
* '''Making available or distribution rights.''' The EU asked that Canada implement a distribution or making available right to copyright owners.

These are just the copyright provisions. There are sections dealing with patents, trademarks, designs, and (coming soon) geographical indications. These include:

* requiring Canada to comply with the [[Trademark Law Treaty]] (Canada is not a contracting party)
* requiring Canada to accede to the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs|Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs]]
* creating new legal protections for registered industrial designs including extending the term of protection from the current 10 years to up to 25 years
* requiring Canada to comply with the [[Patent Law Treaty]] (Canada has signed but not implemented)
* requiring Canada to establish enhanced protection for data submitted for pharmaceutical patents.|''Dr Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law, University of Ottawa''&lt;ref name="geist1"/&gt; }}

On 22 October 2012, five Polish NGOs criticized the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, the similarities to ACTA, and demanded more disclosures about the negotiations from the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wyślij |url=http://prawokultury.pl/newsy/list-5-organizacji-pozarzadowych-do-minstra-kultur/ |title=List 5 organizacji pozarządowych do Ministra Kultury i Ministra Gospodarki w sprawie umowy CETA :: Prawo kultury |language=pl |publisher=Prawokultury.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Consolidated CETA Text a long section on "Intellectual Property Rights", IPR, (pp.&amp;nbsp;339–375) deals comprehensively with copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, trade secrets and licensing. Here reference is made to the [[TRIPS]] agreement (p.&amp;nbsp;339 f). 
In addition to the interests of the pharmaceutical and software industries CETA encourages to prosecute "Camcording" (the so-called "film piracy", Art. 5.6, p.&amp;nbsp;343). Especially the negotiations on food exports lasted very long. The interests connected with European cheese exports and Canadian beef exports led to a protection of these kinds of intellectual properties and long lists of "Geographical Indications Identifying a Product Originating in the European Union" (pp.&amp;nbsp;363–347).&lt;ref name="Consolidated CETA Text"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/ceta-dokument-101.pdf |accessdate=2014-08-15 |title=Consolidated CETA Text |work=EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Directorate-General for Trade |date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-tariff barriers ==
{{see also|Non-tariff barriers to trade}}
===Agricultural===
CETA does not alter EU non-tariff barriers such as European regulations on beef, which include a ban on the use of growth hormones. Canadian stakeholders have criticized the EU's delays in the approval process for genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and GMO traceability and labelling requirements, none of which are addressed in CETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada–European Union Economic and Trade Negotiations: The Agri-food Sector|publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]]|year=2011|accessdate=11 March 2014|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/cei-25-e.htm?Param=ce5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental ===
Both the EU and Canada will retain the right to regulate freely in areas of public interest such as environmental protection, or people's health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/#democracy|title=CETA—EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|newspaper=Trade—European Commission|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on fisheries===

The provincial government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has argued that the Federal government of Canada in Ottawa reneged on a deal to pay $280 million in exchange for its relinquishment of minimum processing requirements as part of CETA.  Those rules helped protect jobs in fish plants, especially in rural areas hit hard by the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|cod moratorium, which was instituted in 1992]].&lt;ref name=gm15&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/newfoundland-and-labrador-says-talks-at-stalemate-with-ottawa-over-fish-fund/article24616519/ G+M: "Newfoundland and Labrador says talks at stalemate with Ottawa over fish fund"], 26 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[exclusive economic zone]] of Canada, which was the subject of the 1992 [[Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case]] dispute, will no longer be in force where fishing boats from Europe are concerned.  Overly permissive Spanish fishing practices, as evinced by the [[Turbot War]], have been reduced, and the European practice of [[R v Secretary of State for Transport, ex p Factortame Ltd|Factortame Ltd]] will be pursued.{{Citation needed|reason=no articles seem to say that the EEZ will be changed|date=June 2017}}

== Investment protection and investor-state-tribunals ==
{{See also|Investor-state dispute settlement}}

Section 4 of the CETA agreement (pages 158–161) provides Investment Protection to foreign investors, and guarantees a "fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security".

CETA allows foreign corporations to sue states before [[Investor-state dispute settlement|arbitral tribunals]] if they claim to have suffered losses because a state had violated its Non Discriminatory Treatment obligations (CETA, section 3, p 156 f) or because of a violation of the guaranteed investment protection.

This license exists only in one direction—states cannot sue companies in these investor-state arbitrations. Such investors complaints are nothing new under public international law ([[UNCTAD]] listed 514 such cases at the end of 2012, most from the United States, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Germany) but for transatlantic trade and investment, this comprehensive level of parallel justice is new.

After much criticism of the hitherto often confidential arbitral proceedings, CETA now provides for a certain amount of transparency by declaring the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration applicable to all proceedings (article X.33: Transparency of proceedings, p.&amp;nbsp;174).

While there is no appeal mechanism against arbitration awards comparable to scrutiny of court judgments, awards made under CETA are subject to [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) annulment proceedings if the claim is brought under the ICSID Rules, or setting-aside proceedings if the claim is brought under the UNCITRAL Rules or any other rules the parties have agreed on. Only after time limits set for these review mechanisms have lapsed, is the tribunal's final award to "be binding between the disputing parties and in respect of that particular case". (article X.39: Enforcement of awards, p.&amp;nbsp;177)

On 26 March 2014, German Economics Minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] wrote an open letter to EU Trade Commissioner [[Karel De Gucht]], stating that investment protection was central sensitive  point, which could in the end decide whether a transatlantic free trade agreement would meet with German approval. He further stated that investment arbitration was unnecessary between countries with well-developed legal systems.

The CETA "[[Investor-state dispute settlement|Investor-State Dispute Settlement]]" (ISDS) provisions could create a precedent for similar arrangements within [[TTIP]]. Furthermore, critics allege that CETA would allow US companies to sue EU states through Canadian subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/us-multinationals-could-sue-eu-governments-through-ceta/|title=US multinationals could sue EU governments through CETA|website=EurActiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2016/09/19/canada-eu-deal-likely-result-deluge-big-business-cases-brought-against-european|title=Canada-EU Deal Likely to Result in ‘Deluge’ of Big Business Cases Brought Against European Governments|newspaper=Common Dreams|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/if-youre-worried-about-ttip-then-you-need-to-know-about-ceta-a6671886.html|title=If you're worried about TTIP, then you need to know about CETA|date=2015-09-29|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the EU Commission announced that it had agreed with the Canadian government to replace ''ad hoc'' arbitral tribunals in CETA with a permanent dispute settlement tribunal. The tribunal will consist of 15 members named by Canada and the EU, dealing with individual cases in panels of three. An appeals mechanism will be established to ensure "legal correctness" of awards. The tribunal's members may not appear as experts or party counsel in other investment cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1468 CETA: EU and Canada agree on new approach on investment in trade agreement], EU Commission Press Release, 29 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature and ratification==
[[Image:Parlement wallon - CETA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Banner opposing CETA at the [[Walloon Parliament]] in [[Namur]] on 19 October 2016.]]
It was initially unclear whether or not the EU member states had to ratify the agreement, as the European Commission considered the treaty to be solely in the competence of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8e9428d4-412a-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1|title=National ratification issue could derail EU-Canada trade deal|date=3 July 2016|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2016 it was decided that CETA be qualified as a "mixed agreement" and thus be ratified through national procedures as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/press-release/The-ratification-of-CETA-by-national-parliaments|title=The ratification of CETA by national parliaments – a stepping stone in the transition from the old world of trade towards the new world of international trade|date=13 July 2016|publisher=EPP Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the scheduled signature of CETA on 27 October 2016, Belgium announced it was unable to sign the treaty, as assent is required by all regional governments. The federal government and Flanders, which are governed by the centre-right [[Michel Government|Michel]] and [[Bourgeois Government|Bourgeois]] governments respectively, are in favour, whereas the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], which are led by centre-left parties that are in opposition at federal level, rejected signature in its current form. On 27 April 2016, the [[Walloon Parliament]] had already adopted a resolution in opposition to CETA. On 13 October 2016, [[David Lametti]] defended CETA before a Walloon Parliament committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_ceta-le-vice-ministre-canadien-defend-des-valeurs-communes-devant-le-parlement-wallon?id=9428885|title=CETA: le vice-ministre canadien défend des "valeurs communes" devant le Parlement wallon|publisher=RTBF|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next day the Walloon Parliament affirmed its opposition. Walloon Minister-President [[Paul Magnette]] led the intra-Belgian opposition shortly before the planned signature.

The intra-Belgian disagreement was solved in the final days of October, paving the way for CETA's signature. On 28 October, the Belgian regional parliaments allowed [[Full Powers]] to be given to the federal government, and the following day Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Didier Reynders]] gave his signature on behalf of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deredactie.be/permalink/1.2805902|title=Reynders heeft handtekening gezet onder Belgisch akkoord voor CETA|date=29 October 2016|publisher=deredactie.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautilus.parlement-wallon.be/Archives/2016_2017/MOTION/633_3.pdf MOTION déposée en conclusion du débat sur l’Accord économique et commercial global (AECG–CETA)].

N° 6 (2016–2017)—Vendredi 28 octobre 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, on Sunday 30 October 2016, the treaty was signed by Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], President of the European Council [[Donald Tusk]], President of the European Commission [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] and Slovak Prime Minister [[Robert Fico]] (as [[Slovakia]] held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in the second half of 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/2016/10/20161030_en.htm|title=EU and Canada sign CETA|date=30 October 2016|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the signature, the consent by the [[European Parliament]] and the ratification by Canada, CETA applies provisionally since 21 September 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice concerning the provisional application of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada, of the one part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the other part|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1515577599150&amp;uri=CELEX:22017X0916(02)|website=EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt; awaiting its ratification by the European Union member states.

==Information==

===Football in Tonga===
Tonga's greatest football triumph to date was their triumph in the first ever Polynesian Cup held in 1993 over Samoa and the Cook Islands. Although local players have not yet made their mark on big leagues abroad, the Chief Executive of the Tonga Football Association, Joe Topou, was appointed to the FIFA Executive Committee in 2002. The Tonga association is the only sports organization on the island that employs full-time administrative staff.

===The second Goal project===
Tonga's second Goal project will develop and improve the national football academy and the associations headquarters in Atele, Tongatapu, which was built in the country's first Goal project. This development work will ensure that all of the Tonga Football Associations needs are fully satisfied. Local matches will be held at the football academy, while the administration's requirements, including the needs of players, officials and spectators, will also be covered. The football school will be transformed into a House of Football.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1764">The '''forecheck''' is an [[ice hockey]] defensive play made in the [[ice hockey rink|offensive zone]] with the objective of applying pressure to the opposing team to regain control of the [[Hockey puck|puck]].&lt;ref&gt;Driver 2004, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Forechecking is generally executed in one of three situations: recovery of the puck after a dump in, after the rebound on a scoring attempt, or immediately after a turnover to regain possession.&lt;ref&gt;Walter 2009, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Forechecking can be aggressive or conservative depending on the [[coach (sport)|coaching style]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter 2009, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the skating skills of the players.  Aggressive forechecking strategies are more suited for players with good [[ice skate|skating]] mobility, while more conservative plays such as the [[neutral zone trap]] are better suited for players with less agility.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron 2003, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General Physical Preparation''', also known as GPP, lays the groundwork for later [[Specific Physical Preparation]], or SPP.  In the GPP phase, athletes work on general conditioning to improve strength, speed, endurance, flexibility, structure and skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mel Siff|title=Supertraining|publisher=Supertraining International|year=2000|isbn=1874856656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPP is generally performed in the off-season, with a lower level of GPP-maintenance during the season, when SPP is being pursued. GPP helps prevent imbalances and boredom with both specific and non-specific exercises by conditioning the body to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yuri V.Verkoshansky |title=Programming and Organization of Sports training |publisher=Sportiviny Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
GPP is the initial stage of training.  It starts every cycle of training from the macro-, meso- and microcycle after restoration and recovery.  It consists primarily of general preparatory and some specialized conditioning exercises to work all the major muscles and joints.  This preparation prepares the athlete for the more intense training such as explosive plyometrics.  This period is also used for rehabilitation of injured muscles and joints, strengthening or bringing up to par the lagging muscles and improvement of technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dr. Michael Yessis|title=Secrets of Russian Sports Fitness &amp; Training|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9817180-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Specific example==
For the high-level and elite athlete, GPP is used more for recovery and warm up rather than for developmental purposes.  This is based on the premise that high level and elite athletes maintain their physical conditioning throughout the year and train throughout the year on a specific periodization scheme.  This is a major distinguishing characteristic of the high-level athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dr. Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Plyometrics |publisher=Ultimate Athlete Concepts|year=2009 |isbn=978-098171806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Riley "Gordie" McKellen Jr.''' (born August 26, 1953) is an American former competitive [[figure skater]]. He is the 1973–75 [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national]] champion and placed tenth at the [[Figure skating at the 1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Winter Olympics]].

McKellen is now providing "Virtual" coaching assistance to figure skating coaches with respect to teaching technical elements of figure skating through his website at {{URL|www.gordiemckellen.com}}.

== Personal life ==
McKellen was born on August 26, 1953, in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; His parents, Leila and Gordon "Tuffy" Sr., owned an ice rink,&lt;ref name=RE840212 /&gt; and his father was a member of the 1940s ice skating duo, the McKellen Brothers.&lt;ref name=Mashf/&gt; In 1977, McKellen married American figure skater [[Kath Malmberg]], who gave birth to their two children in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=RE840212 /&gt;

== Career ==
McKellen won three consecutive U.S. national titles. He was selected to represent the United States at the [[Figure skating at the 1972 Winter Olympics|1972 Winter Olympics]] and finished tenth. His highest placement at the [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] was 5th, in 1975.

Although other skaters had practiced triple axels before then, McKellen was the first skater to attempt them in public performances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} He landed several in exhibition in 1974–1975, as King of the Lake Placid Winter Festival exhibition and during the exhibitions following his third National championship win in Providence. The triple axel was not landed in competition until Vern Taylor did it in 1978.

McKellen retired from competitive skating after the 1975 season after his coach, [[Slavka Kohout]], left her position at the Wagon Wheel rink in [[Rockton, Illinois]], where McKellen had been training. He toured with [[Toller Cranston]]'s "The Ice Show" company after turning professional.

McKellen was inducted into the [[United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] in 1998. In July 2001, he was banned for life from [[U.S. Figure Skating]] because of allegations of inappropriate behavior and actions with underage female skaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Grievance Report |publisher= ''Skating'' magazine |date= October 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grievances/&gt;

==Plot==
In 1970s [[Portland, Oregon]], four year-old Tonya Harding is forced to ice skate by her abusive mother, LaVona Golden. As Tonya grows up, her parents take her out of school to focus on her skating career, and she trains under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya rapidly becomes one of the best [[Figure skating|figure skaters]] in the United States, but is held back by her "[[white trash]]" reputation, home-made costumes and unconventional choice of performance music. At 15, she begins dating 18-year-old [[Jeff Gillooly|Jeff Gillooly]], and the two marry, but Jeff becomes abusive. When LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, Tonya blames LaVona for her raising her badly.

After a dispute with Diane, Tonya fires her and hires Dody Teachman as her coach. Tonya becomes the first female figure skater to complete two triple [[Axel jump]]s in competition. At the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], Tonya fails to stick her landings and finishes fourth. Defeated, she moves in again with Jeff and takes a job as a waitress, but Diane convinces her to train for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. On the day of her November 1993 competition at the Northwest Pacific Regional Championships in Portland, Tonya receives a death threat and chooses not to compete. In retaliation, Jeff instructs his friend [[Shawn Eckardt]] (who says he's Tonya's "bodyguard") to send death threats to Tonya's rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. Tonya makes a phone call trying to locate Nancy Kerrigan's training arena and her practice times. Eckardt hires two inept crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practice session in [[Detroit]]. On January 6, 1994, Eckardt’s henchmen strike Kerrigan's knee; she cannot compete at the next day's [[1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|National competition]]. The hired henchmen are arrested.

Eckardt's bragging quickly leads the FBI to him. He points the finger at Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Eckardt gave orders beyond sending the letters. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team and is in turn horrified by Jeff, realizing that she will be found guilty by association. She goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Eckardt did, but they show her interview transcript to Jeff after his arrest, and he races home to confront her. She briefly speaks to Jeff, then climbs out the window, leaving him for good. Jeff implicates Tonya, saying she knew about the attack.

LaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; however, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the crime, Tonya reaches into LaVona's jacket pocket, finds a [[tape recorder]], and throws her mother out of her home. Jeff, Eckardt, and the henchmen are charged, with Tonya's hearing postponed until after the Olympics. Tonya finishes eighth and Nancy Kerrigan wins the silver medal. Tonya avoids jail but is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time but not to take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge refuses and tells her his decision is made. Jeff acknowledges with honest regret that he ruined Tonya's career. He changes his name, remarries, opens a hair salon, divorces; he currently lives near Tonya, albeit having no contact with her, with his third wife and two children. LaVona moves to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and has no contact with Tonya. Tonya remarries, divorces, takes up professional [[boxing]], becomes a landscaper, house painter and deck builder. She lives happily with her seven-year-old son and third husband.

==Production==
Screenwriter [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] was inspired to write the film after watching a documentary about ice skating which mentioned [[Tonya Harding]].&lt;ref name=sagfull&gt;{{cite interview|last1=Robbie|first1=Margot|last2=Rogers|first2=Steven|last3=Gillespie|first3=Craig|last4=Janney|first4=Allison, et al.|title=Conversations with I, Tonya [Cast and Crew]|date=December 5, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqysxfvC94A|work=SAG-AFTRA Foundation|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers arranged separate interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly. Both remembered the events of the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 scandal]] very differently. Rogers decided, "Well, that's my way in - to put everyone's point of view out there, and then let the audience decide."&lt;ref name=sagfull/&gt; He later said that the film was really about "things we tell ourselves in order to…live with ourselves…how we change the [[narrative]], and then want that to be the narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/i-tonya-harding-movie|title=The Surreal Story of How Tonya Harding Inspired Awards Season's Scrappiest Contender|last=Miller|first=Julie|date=December 6, 2017|magazine=Vanity Fair|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Gillooly, Rogers stated "What's curious about Jeff is that he refused to take any money for [[Personality rights|life rights]], for his interview, for anything."&lt;ref name="floodmagazine_49584"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://floodmagazine.com/49584/in-conversation-steven-rogers-chose-the-indie-route-for-i-tonya/|title=In Conversation: Steven Rogers Chose the Indie Route for "I, Tonya"|department=The screenwriter reflects on the messiness of truth and memory, and how he worked to build a story that encompassed everyone's point of view|last=Beresford|first=Trilby|date=March 26, 2018|magazine=Flood Magazine|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remembered Jeff Gillooly saying that Harding was a great figure skater.&lt;ref name="vanityfair_2017-12"&gt;{{Cite magazine| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/i-tonya-harding-movie|title=The Surreal Story of How Tonya Harding Inspired Awards Season's Scrappiest Contender|last=Miller|first=Julie|date=December 6, 2017|magazine=Vanity Fair|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rogers, Gillooly also said that it was his own idea to threaten Nancy Kerrigan's ability to perform and [[Moral responsibility|took responsibility]] for his part in Harding's 1994 ruin: "he doesn't want to profit from it."&lt;ref name="floodmagazine_49584"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanityfair_2017-12"/&gt;

[[Margot Robbie]], who played Harding and co-produced the film, did not realize the screenplay was based on a real event until after she finished reading it.&lt;ref name=sagmargot&gt;{{cite interview|last=Robbie|first=Margot|title=Conversations with Margot Robbie|date=January 12, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TyMVrh8sQ|work=SAG-AFTRA Foundation|interviewer=[[Jenelle Riley]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately prior to filming, Robbie flew from Los Angeles to [[Portland, Oregon]] to meet Harding.&lt;ref name=sagmargot/&gt; To prepare for the skating scenes, Robbie trained for four months.&lt;ref name=sagmargot/&gt; Heidi Munger and Anna Malkova served as skating doubles and [[Sarah Kawahara]] provided coaching and choreography.&lt;ref name="IN171214"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/2017/12/14/263201022/|title=Kawahara crafts skating magic for 'I, Tonya'|last=Elfman|first=Lois|date=December 14, 2017|work=[[IceNetwork.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IW171213"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/i-tonya-skating-choreographer-sarah-kawahara-training-margot-robbie-tonya-harding-1201906171/|title=Training Margot Robbie to Be 'I, Tonya': Skating Choreographer Sarah Kawahara Tells All|last=Marotta|first=Jenna|date=December 13, 2017|work=[[IndieWire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers wrote the role of Tonya's mother LaVona for [[Allison Janney]]; she was a longtime friend of Rogers, but the "stars had [not] aligned" for them to work together until he completed the script for ''I, Tonya''.&lt;ref name=sagfull/&gt; Janney said the part was one of the most challenging of her career.&lt;ref name=sagfull/&gt; Shortly after the film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], she said "I think LaVona was actually a very smart woman, very articulate….She was not messing around and didn't want [Tonya] distracted….She wanted [Tonya] to know that it was going to be hard work, and knowing her daughter needed to be told she couldn't do it in order to do it was LaVona's way of saying, 'I was there to inspire her'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/allison-janney-i-tonya_us_59b57e05e4b0dfaafcf88937|title=Allison Janney's New Favorite Co-Star Is The Bird That Sits On Her Shoulder In 'I, Tonya'|last=Jacobs|first=Matthew|date=September 11, 2017|newspaper=HuffPost|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Craig Gillespie]] was interested in the project because "I realized it was a great opportunity to revisit the story and make a [[Criticism|commentary]] about [[Media ethics|how the media treats people]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/movies/1015946/director-craig-gillespie-takes-out-trash-i-tonya|title=Director Craig Gillespie takes out the trash with I, Tonya|last=Eisner |first=Ken|date=January 9, 2018|newspaper=The Georgia Straight|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did add that "I don't feel great about having to drag Nancy's name back into this". Gillespie said that he tried, in the film, to present Harding "in a very honest way" without "trying to pull those heartstrings…just showing you why she is the way she is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iris.theaureview.com/interview-director-craig-gillespie-on-taking-no-prisoners-when-filming-i-tonya/|date=January 25, 2018|title=DIRECTOR CRAIG GILLESPIE ON TAKING NO PRISONERS WHEN FILMING I, TONYA|last=Gray|first=Peter|website=Iris.theAUreview.com|department=The Iris|language=en-AU|access-date=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Some of the songs of the soundtrack were used in Harding's real routines, such as [[ZZ Top]]'s "[[Sleeping Bag (song)|Sleeping Bag]]". Others were selected by music supervisor Susan Jacobs:  tracks from 1970s such as [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "[[The Chain]]" or [[Supertramp]]'s "[[Goodbye Stranger]]" came from an era when music was "powerful and full" and "warm." Jacobs felt the "classic rock songs filled the picture without getting in the way of the story." Critic Emily Manning found that others, such as [[En Vogue]]'s "[[Free Your Mind (song)|Free Your Mind]]" and [[Heart (band)|Heart]]'s "[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]", created "an interesting parallel between Tonya's tenacity and ambition."&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4kmw/i-tonya-sets-figure-skating-to-siouxsie-and-the-banshees-and-it-works|title='I, Tonya' sets figure skating to siouxsie &amp; the banshees (and it works)|last=Manning|first=Emily|date=January 17, 2018|publisher=i-d.vice.com|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ends with [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' cover of "[[The Passenger (song)#Siouxsie and the Banshees version|The Passenger]]";&lt;ref name="week"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/11/i-tonya-soundtrack/|title=Best of 2017 (Behind the Scenes): The stories behind the best songs on the I, Tonya soundtrack|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|date=December 11, 2017|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning wrote: "There was something really right about seeing Tonya skate to Siouxsie."&lt;ref name=id /&gt; Jacobs said that "The Passenger" was "something obviously female and the lyrics [resonated]". The lyrics of [[Dire Straits]]' "[[Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits song)|Romeo and Juliet]]" were also important as "they felt like the story".&lt;ref name=week /&gt;

In January 2018, [[Dan Shaughnessy]], columnist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', asked [[Nancy Kerrigan]] in a telephone interview if she had seen the film – she had not. When Shaughnessy posited that Kerrigan was once "a victim of Harding's dysfunctional life", she agreed but emphasized that she was occupied with living her own life. Shaughnessy also asked Kerrigan to comment on whether she was "bothered by Hollywood's portrayal of Tonya"; she replied that the issue was no longer her business. Nancy Kerrigan said that her only "role" in the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 scandal]] was recovering from an attack, "That's it", she finished.

On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''I, Tonya'' holds an approval rating of 89% based on 338 reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Led by strong work from Margot Robbie and Alison Janney, ''I, Tonya'' finds the humor in its real-life story without losing sight of its more tragic — and emotionally resonant — elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_tonya|title=I, Tonya (2017)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-tonya|title=I, Tonya Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christy Lemire]] of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' described it as "an irresistible, soapy mix of jealousy, competition and class warfare, fortified by powerful performances and unexpected emotional resonance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-tonya-2017|title=I, Tonya|last=Lemire|first=Christy|website=RogerEbert.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemire also complimented Gillespie for "what would seem to be an impossible high-wire act: He's made a movie that's affectionately mocking—of this theatrical sport, of the idiots who surrounded Harding, of this hideous moment in fashion and pop culture—without actually mocking Harding herself." In ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' [[Peter Travers]] wrote that the film holds "a mirror up to the class-conscious America most of us tend to ignore or dismiss – and makes us see ourselves reflected in it, too. ''I, Tonya'' is funny as hell, but the pain is just as real. You'll laugh till it hurts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-i-tonya-is-the-movie-we-need-right-now-w512407|title='I, Tonya' Review: Tonya Harding Biopic Is the Movie We Need Right Now|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vulture'' praised Robbie's performance, feeling she had found a new "weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/margot-robbie-is-a-revelation-in-i-tonya.html|title=In Praise of Margot Robbie's Performance in I, Tonya|last=Bastién|first=Angelica Jade|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that it was one of the most surprising films of the year - a "multi-layered saga of [[Amateur sports|talent]] and [[Social class in the United States|class resentment]]". He praised Rogers' script as "sympathetic but clear-eyed, foul-mouthed but fair-minded". Burr wrote that the [[Cycle of violence|domestic abuse]] scenes are presented effectively because of the film's style of "[[Irony|ironic]] [[Shock value|as-told-to comedy]] that intentionally curdles when the extent of [violence]...and Harding's grim acceptance...of it become obvious". However, when writing of the scene where Harding voices how she has [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalized]] a [[Victim mentality|victim-like]] identity, Burr believed the filmmakers failed to appreciate the scope of what that really means to her. He considered whether the filmmakers had an obligation not to be among "the many vultures picking at [Tonya's] pop-culture corpse". Burr did not think the filmmakers properly [[Media ethics|addressed the predicament]] of making a film about Harding's [[Narcotizing dysfunction|media over-exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2017/12/20/tonya-bedazzles/t0KFnul5CzqJW8H6jQEMIO/story.html|title='I, Tonya' bedazzles|last=Burr|first=Ty|date=December 20, 2017|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt the film failed to find an original depiction of the [[Working class in the United States|working class]], and "treats Tonya's background, her tastes, her habits, her way of talking, as a joke... The result is a film that's as derisive and dismissive toward Tonya Harding as it shows the world at large to have been".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/i-tonya-reviewed-a-condescending-biopic-of-tonya-harding|title='I, Tonya,' Reviewed: A Condescending Bio-pic of Tonya Harding |last=Brody |first=Richard |date=2017-12-07|work=The New Yorker |access-date=2018-01-23 |issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Guardian'', Jean Hannah Eldestein felt that the film was "played for laughs" at the expense of its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/11/how-i-tonya-betrays-its-tragicomic-ice-staking-protagonist |title=How I, Tonya betrays its tragicomic ice-skating protagonist |last=Edelstein |first=Jean Hannah |date=2017-12-11|website=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allison Janney]] was widely lauded for her performance as [[LaVona Golden]], singled out for praise by critics. [[Christy Lemire]] of ''[[Roger Ebert.com]]'' said: "Janney absolutely tears it up as the profane, chain-smoking LaVona Harding, constantly insulting Tonya and messing with her mind in the name of making her a champion. It's a showy, scenery-chewing performance but it's not one-note; Janney brings an undercurrent of sorrow to the part in revealing LaVona's twisted methodology." Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that : “Janney steals every scene she's in, playing LaVona, a harridan whose nodding goes beyond tough love.” [[Helen O'Hara]] from ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' called Janney's performance flawless and flamboyant, and an unforgettable one. ''[[USA Today]]'' said; “Janney is magnificent as Tonya Harding's villainous and abusive mommy dearest. No curse word goes unused and no scenery is left unchewed by the actress, who takes over whenever she's onscreen, whether dealing with a pesky parakeet or [[breaking the fourth wall]].”

'''James F. Goldstein''' (born January 5, 1940) is an American millionaire "NBA superfan", who attends over one hundred [[NBA]] games each season typically in courtside seats, including approximately 95 percent of home games for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].

He also travels from city to city to catch games, especially during the NBA playoffs (and not necessarily Lakers and Clippers playoff games). He also frequently attends post-game press conferences. His unique and flamboyant clothing makes him fairly easy to spot on television.  His passion for the NBA has been featured in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', and ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]''.

"He has so much invested in our sport," Former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] said. "He probably has the largest investment of any fan in America, so we get a kick out of him. He has got quite a flair, and we love him as a sort of a superfan."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Biography==
The son of Nanette (née Gamse) and Milwaukee department store owner, C. Ellis Goldstein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-01-10/news/0501100370_1_nanette-rice-beloved Baltimore Sun: "Rice, Nanette"] January 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marycumminsrealestatemarycummins.blogspot.com/2016/06/who-is-james-f-goldstein-nba-super-fan.html Mary Cummins Real Estate: "Who is James F Goldstein NBA super fan and owner of Sheats Goldstein Residence in Los Angeles, California?"] June 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein said he began watching NBA games as a 10-year-old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chris Warren, ''Superfan'', American Way Magazine, February 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 15 he was hired to keep game statistics by the Milwaukee Hawks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Once I did that and sat courtside for the games, I was totally hooked", he said. "My entire life has been devoted to professional basketball since then. I have such a passion for the game. I think there's more athleticism displayed in basketball than in any other sport."&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005"&gt;Bob Young, ''Hat's Off to NBA's No. 1 Fan'', Boston Globe, May 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldstein graduated from [[Nicolet High School]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] where he played on the basketball team.  He then attended [[Stanford University]] and has remained in [[California]] ever since.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steele |first=Ben |url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/meet-jim-goldstein-milwaukee-native-is-nbas-no-1-fan-uh5njo1-158384505.html |title=Milwaukee native is NBA's No. 1 fan |website=Jsonline.com |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having attended over 2,000 games, Goldstein befriended several current and former NBA players, including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Sam Cassell]], and [[Dennis Rodman]].

Unlike some other "super fans" however, Goldstein is content to simply observe the games and enjoy them, without yelling at referees or taunting players. He claims to have no favorite team, in spite of his Lakers and Clippers season tickets. He describes himself as a fan of the NBA in general.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Sansevere, ''Wolves have at least 1 L.A. fan'', St. Paul Pioneer-Press, May 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein refuses to disclose how he made his fortune or his net worth, although the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' speculated that Goldstein made [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] in real estate (notably [[Century City]] in Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Gurewitsch, ''On the Path to Illumination'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked, he typically responds, "Let’s just say I had some investments that worked out pretty well." "I try not to think about the cost," he said. "It's worth it to me."&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005" /&gt;

He has never married, nor has had any children. He has stated that he doesn't believe in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsh|first1=Steve|title=Legends of NBA Style: The GQ+A With Superfan Jimmy Goldstein|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nba-fashion-style-jimmy-goldstein-interview|website=GQ|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwin|first1=Bruce|title=Jim Goldstein – Living the American Dream|url=https://newsblaze.com/business/latest-business/jim-goldstein-living-american-dream_32746/|website=NewsBlaze|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residence==
Goldstein's house,  known as [[Sheats Goldstein Residence]], has been featured in ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', DOLCE magazine, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Robb Report]], and ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]''. The house was designed  in 1963 by [[John Lautner]], a student of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Goldstein purchased the property in the 1970s from previous owners who did not keep the house in good condition. Goldstein commissioned Lautner to make changes and improvements to the house. Below the main residence is an installation by light artist [[James Turrell]] known as "Skyspace" or "Sky Box".&lt;ref name="Bob Young 2005"/&gt;

Goldstein worked closely with Lautner and Duncan Nicholson, who took over after Lautner's death in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021005084906/http://www.nicholsonwirts.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson is now chief architect. "I wanted to remake the house exactly as John [Lautner] would have wanted it, and to introduce technology that didn't exist 30 years ago", Goldstein explained. The property next door to his also had a Lautner designed house on it, which Goldstein bought and tore down to build a party house, tennis court and office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiland |first=Elijah |url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2012/07/the_lautner_house_torn_down_to_expand_a_lautner_house.php |title=The Lautner House Torn Down to Expand a Lautner House - Curbed LA |website=La.curbed.com |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  continues to make improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020606040313/http://www.jamesfgoldstein.com/architecture_moderismreborn.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, Goldstein promised that the house eventually will become the property of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chiland |first=Elijah |url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2016/02/sheats-goldstein_house_lacma_history_photos.php |title=A Complete Guide to LACMA's First Piece of Architecture, the Most Spectacular House in Los Angeles - Curbed LA |website=La.curbed.com |date=2016-02-17 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residence has also been featured in a number of movies, including ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'', ''French Exit'', and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">'''Kwik cricket''' (known as [[Nestlé Milo|MILO]] Kanga cricket in Australia, and [[Nestlé Milo|MILO]] Kiwi cricket in New Zealand) is a high-speed version of [[cricket]] aimed mainly at encouraging [[child]]ren to take part in the main [[sport]], with an emphasis on participation and enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.co.uk/play/junior/kwik-cricket|title=England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) - The Official Website of the ECB|website=www.ecb.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the rules are adapted from cricket, but Kwik cricket is played with a plastic bat and ball (for obvious safety and physical reasons), and plastic cones to mark the maximum width of a legally bowled ball.  The rules can be altered so that virtually any number of children can play in the time available, and the game can be made easier or more difficult by changing the physical dimensions of the [[cricket pitch|pitch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubergames.co.uk/kwik-cricket-rules-a34.html|title=Uber Games  - Rules &amp; History :: Kwik Cricket Rules|last=1linedesign.com|first=James Murphy|website=www.ubergames.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (changing the width of the [[wicket]]s, increasing the distance between the wickets, widening or narrowing the [[crease (cricket)|crease]], pulling in or pushing out the [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]], etc.).

For example, continuous KwikcCricket can be played by two groups of 10 or 12, with each batting for a set period of time, the Lord's Game can be played by two groups of four or five, and pairs Kwik cricket works for groups of 8, each playing as a pair and rotating the roles ([[batsman|batsmen]]; [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] and [[wicket-keeper]]; [[leg side]] and [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]] fielders).

Equipment:
*2 bats
*1 plastic cricket ball
*1 wicket keeper helmet
*2 sets of stumps
*20 cones
*1 scoring sheet

In Australia and New Zealand the game is more formal than in the UK, where the rules include a one-handed catch resulting in the dismissal of the entire team, and rather than plastic cones a nearby landmark is used as a theoretical boundary.

Cones are placed next to the batsman's left and right leg (about one metre away), Tennis balls are placed on these cones. In most cases in Australia, if the bowler bowls a no-ball, wide, dead ball, etc., the person batting would hit either of the cones for a "free shot". The fielders cannot move until the batsman hits the ball.

The '''Law Enforcement Torch Run''' (LETR) is a campaign to benefit the [[Special Olympics]]. It began in 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and is the largest grass-roots fundraising movement for the Special Olympics.

LETR is run by police officers, sheriff's deputies, correction officers, support staff, police volunteers and other law enforcement professionals from around the world.
Close to 97,000 police professionals in over 45 countries participate in this worldwide effort to raise money and awareness for Special Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LETR Information Sheet|url=http://www.letr-council.org/resources/Facts-and-Figures/LETR-INFORMATION-SHEET.pdf|access-date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Participants in the LETR help spread the word about the benefits of Special Olympics and how the program helps define the brave participants of these programs as athletes, and not define them by their disabilities. Since its inception in 1981, LETR has raised $619,187,626.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LETR Facts and Figures|url=http://www.letr-council.org/Council/Facts/|website=Law Enforcement Torch Run|access-date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar in many ways to the [[Olympic Flame|Olympic Torch Relay]], the Law Enforcement Torch Run consists of scheduled relay events, usually held in conjunction and coordination with Special Olympics functions (like the Special Olympics Summer and Winter Games). While carrying the flame, officers and athletes are referred to as "Guardians of the Flame".
In the broader sense, the LETR is used to define all of the special events, and fundraising activities that law enforcement conducts to contribute to this campaign. This includes (but is not limited to), tip-a-cop events, [[car wash]]es, [[Polar Plunge]]s, roof sits, [[Motorcycle rally|motorcycle runs]], online fundraising, T-shirt and hat sales, media events, and more.

Every two years, the [[Special Olympics World Games]] are held.  This brings about a special torch run called the Final Leg Run, during which, law enforcement, together with Special Olympic athletes, run the [[Flame of Hope (Special Olympics)|Flame of Hope]] throughout the host country for the games, spreading awareness for Special Olympics. This culminates with the lighting of the cauldron for the Flame of Hope at the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics World Games.

Every year, members of the LETR converge at the International LETR conference to exchange ideas, and network about Special Olympics awareness and fundraising techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">{{about|clothing|other uses of the term|Padding (disambiguation)}}
'''Padding''' is thin cushioned material sometimes added to clothes. Padding may also be referred to as '''batting''' when used as a layer in lining quilts or as a packaging or stuffing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/batting|title=Definition of BATTING|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When padding is used in clothes, it is often done in an attempt to soften impacts on certain zones of the body or enhance appearance by 'improving' a physical feature, often a sexually significant one. In [[fashion]], there is padding for:

* Breasts – sometimes called [[falsies]]
* The male crotch – usually called a [[codpiece]].
* Height – usually in shoes and often called [[elevator shoes]]
* Width of shoulders, called [[shoulder pads]] – in coats and other garments for men, and sometimes for women.

==To alter features==
Some padding is added to emphasize particular physical features that are usually not present. Women, for instance, rarely have prominent shoulders, but for some years shoulder pads have been added to dresses (blouses, etc.). The effect was unnatural for women, but gave them a more masculine outline which was sometimes thought to be of benefit in business situations.

Padding in undergarments is also used by some [[crossdresser]]s. This may include a form of padding in the shape of male [[genitals]] worn in the underwear of a female who is [[Passing (gender)|passing]] as a male, or [[hip and buttock padding]] worn by a male who is passing as a female.

==As protection==

Padding is also added to clothing for [[thermal insulation|insulation]] or cushioning reasons. Thus, many coats and outergarments (especially those for outdoor use in cold climates) are padded with such materials as [[felt]] or [[down feather|down]] or [[feather]]s or artificial insulations. Cushioning padding is included in some sporting goods, especially those intended for use in [[combat sport]]s (e.g., [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], some [[martial art]]s, etc.). Garments intended for actual use in combat were once commonly padded (e.g., by the ancient Greeks under armor, or by the Japanese until the mid-19th century), but have largely been replaced by light armor made of, for instance, [[Kevlar]]. If included in a vest, such armor makes a [[Bulletproof vest|bullet-proof vest]]. Padding is also used by athletes in sports where friction is an issue, most notably in [[cycling shorts]] where it is termed a [[cycling pad]].

The '''required run rate''', or '''asking rate''', in the sport of [[cricket]] is the number of runs per over the [[Batting (cricket)|batting]] side must score in order to win the present match. Expressed differently, it is the total number of runs required of the batting team to win the match, divided by the total number of overs remaining in the match.&lt;ref&gt; Owen Lewis. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/raiseyourgame/sites/preparation/trainingground/pages/owen_lewis_trainingcoach.shtml Runs, wickets, overs... and maths?] BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The required run rate is typically a statistic that is tracked in real-time during a limited-overs match, including [[Twenty20]] and [[One Day International]] matches. It is usually shown in the second innings, when the side batting in that innings is chasing the other's run total from the first innings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/jun/01/england-v-bangladesh-champions-trophy-2017-live England v Bangladesh: ICC Champions Trophy 2017 – as it happened.] The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher required run rates are more difficult to achieve, since batsmen are forced to score more runs within a limited number of deliveries from the bowling side.&lt;ref&gt; Andrew Ramsey. [http://www.cricket.com.au/news/feature/south-africa-run-chase-372-australia-odi-miller-du-plessis-lehmann-run-rates-changing-game/2016-10-07 Durban disaster proves no ODI total is safe.] Cricket Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The required run rate can also be used in [[Test cricket]], usually in the fourth innings of a match, when the batting side is chasing the opposing team's total with a limited number of possible overs left to play, though use of the term is less common in this form of the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/13/cricket.englandcricketseries4 Over-by-over: morning session.] The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, required run rates have often tended to be particularly high as batting sides have grown increasingly accustomed to chasing high run totals, especially in Twenty20 cricket.&lt;ref&gt;ESPNcricinfo. [https://twitter.com/espncricinfo/status/855788809048518656?lang=en In modern day cricket, no required run rate is too high.] ESPNcricinfo on Twitter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{quotation
| The name "Rip Curl" was taken from a vee-bottom surfboard that co-founder Warbrick bought in 1968, upon which he'd written "Rip Curl Hot Dog." The words didn't mean anything, he later admitted. "Except ripping was groovy; surfing the curl was groovy; we wanted to be groovy – so that was it."
| Matt Warshaw, ''Encyclopedia of Surfing''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Surfing | author=Matt Warshaw | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year=2005 | isbn=0-15-603251-1 | page=508 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1969 by Doug Warbrick and Brian Singer in [[Torquay, Victoria]], Australia, and initially produced [[surfboard]]s. In 1970, they decided to begin production of [[wetsuit]]s, with an emphasis on transforming diving technology into a wetsuit suitable for surfing.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Alan Green (co-founder of Quiksliver) was a Rip Curl employee in 1969 and developed the first Quiksilver boardshorts at the Rip Curl Factory in April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline - 1969|url=http://www.quiksilverinc.com/History/Timeline|website=quiksilverinc.com|publisher=Quiksilver, Inc.|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2012, Singer and Warbrick engaged the services of Bank of America Merrill Lynch to sell the brand, but the plan was abandoned in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Regaining their "cool": can the big three surf brands recover?|url=http://theconversation.com/regaining-their-cool-can-the-big-three-surf-brands-recover-18406|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=25 September 2013|author=Andrew Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riverside Stadium''', formerly the '''YMCA Grounds''', is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Drumahoe]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]].  It is the home ground of [[Institute F.C.]] of the [[NIFL Championship]].  The stadium holds 3,110 people with 1,540 seated. 

In 1980, a site at Drumahoe was purchased jointly by the Presbyterian Working Men's Institute (of which Institute was the football team) and the local YMCA. The new football grounds were not opened officially until January 1985, but Institute had been playing at the YMCA Grounds since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stutefc.co.uk/the-bomb/ Institute FC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a stadium began in 1995 when the club established a committee to plan the its development with a view to gaining entry to the [[NIFL Premier Intermediate League|Irish League B Division]], the top level of intermediate football. The ground was enclosed by a new security fence, and new changing rooms, toilets, facilities for disabled fans, rooms for hospitality and a shop, and two new turnstiles were added and admission to the B Division was achieved in 1996. A second phase of development resulted in the erection of a new 300-seater stand and floodlights. This was enough to gain senior status with admission to the Irish League First Division in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stutefc.co.uk/the-podcast/1995-2004/ Institute FC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the club secured £800,000 worth of funding for improvements to the ground. In May 2009, the club installed new floodlights at each corner of the ground, and in November 2010, more ground development began, involving the building of a new 800-seater stand at one of the goal-mouths. This work was completed in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/foyle_and_west/7410062.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Foyle and West | £800K stadium boost for Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe flooding through the North-West of Northern Ireland on the evening of 22 August 2017 devastated [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] when the ground was destroyed by water reaching as high as 7 foot inside changing rooms and with 5 foot of sediment piled on top of what was left of the playing surface (which would later develop [[Japanese Knotweed]]). The perimeter fence was ripped out and nearby trees were uprooted, some of which were washed onto the pitch.

The first Spartakiad took place in 1955, and was subsequently held every five years.&lt;ref name=rozhlas/&gt; The Spartakiad scheduled for 1970 was canceled in the wake of the [[Prague Spring]] and the beginning of [[normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]. Preparations for the Spartakiad scheduled for 1990 were interrupted by the [[Velvet Revolution]], but the event still took place, although on a much smaller scale than the previous ones.

The Spartakiads were attended by large numbers of people; for example, at the 1960 Spartakiad about 750,000 gymnasts from the whole country took part and over 2,000,000 spectators witnessed the event.

Men and women of all ages practiced their exercising routines for the event. Appearance was originally mandatory for students and servicemen of the armed forces and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Olga|last=Szantová|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/sokol-slet-starts-in-prague|title=Sokol slet starts in Prague|work=Czech Radio|date=30 June 2000|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]] years, it became more voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czech-history/spartakiady-mass-events-that-exercised-the-czechoslovak-communist-regime|title=Spartakiady|publisher=Radio Prague|language=English|author=Chris Johnstone|date=27 July 2017|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ten Essentials''' are survival items that [[hiking]] and [[Scouting]] organizations recommend for safe travel in the [[backcountry]].

The Ten Essentials first appeared in print in the third edition of ''[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]]'' (January 1974). Many regional organizations and authors recommend that [[hiking|hikers]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]], and [[climbing|climbers]] rigorously ensure they have the ten essentials with them. However, personal preferences and differences in conditions may dictate otherwise and with experience most adventurers add and subtract from the list depending on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorp.com/hiking-guide/travel-ta-hiking-wilderness-skills-sidwcmdev_058018.html|title=Ten Essentials|work=Great Outdoor Recreation Pages|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lightweight hikers do not always carry all of the items and believe it is an acceptable risk they take in order to travel light and fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jardine |first=Ray |year=2000 |title=Beyond Backpacking: Ray Jardine's Guide to Lightweight Hiking |publisher=AdventureLore Press |page=124 |isbn=9780963235930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
According to the eighth edition of ''[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]]'' book there are ten essentials, which are now referred to as the "classic" essentials. While still valid and widely used they do not reflect modern outdoor sports and all of the new gadgets that now are common.&lt;ref name=edition8&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] |publisher=Mountaineers Books |year=2010 |edition=8th |isbn=9781594851377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Map and Compass (optionally supplemented with a [[GPS]] receiver)
# [[Water]] 
# [[Sunglasses]] and [[sunscreen]]
# Extra clothing
# [[Headlamp (outdoor)|Headlamp]] (or [[flashlight]])
# Prescriptions, over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, and first aid kit
# [[Firelighting|Firestarter]]
# [[Match]]es
# [[Knife]] 
# Extra food

In 2003, the essential list was revised as part of the seventh edition of ''[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]]''&lt;ref name=edition7&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] |publisher=Mountaineers Books |year=2003 |edition=7th |isbn=9780898868272}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep up with modern equipment. The current edition, 8th edition&lt;ref name=edition8/&gt; continues with the new essentials list with no major revisions. The new list takes a "systems" or functional approach.

# '''Navigation'''. Topographic map and assorted maps in waterproof container plus a magnetic compass, optional altimeter or GPS receiver.
# '''Sun protection'''. Sunglasses, sunscreen for lips and skin, hat, clothing for sun protection.
# '''Insulation'''. Hat, gloves, jacket, extra clothing for coldest possible weather during current season.
# '''Illumination'''. Headlamp, flashlight, batteries. LED bulb is preferred to extend battery life.
# '''First-aid supplies''', plus insect repellent.
# '''Fire'''. Butane lighter, matches in waterproof container.
# '''Repair kit and tools'''. Knives, [[multi-tool]], scissors, pliers, screwdriver, trowel/shovel, duct tape, cable ties.
# '''Nutrition'''. Add extra food for one additional day (for emergency). Dry food is preferred to save weight and usually needs water. 
# '''Hydration'''. Add extra 2 liters of water for one additional day (for emergency).
# '''Emergency shelter'''. Tarp, [[bivouac sack]], [[space blanket]], plastic tube tent, jumbo trash bags, insulated sleeping pad.

The textbook recommends supplementing the ''ten essentials'' with:
* [[Portable water purification]] and water bottles
* [[Ice axe]] for glacier or snowfield travel (if necessary)
* Signaling devices, such as a [[whistle]], [[mobile phone]], two-way [[radio]], [[satellite phone]], unbreakable [[Mirror#Signalling|signal mirror]] or [[flare]], laser pointer.

Some experts recommend having duplicates of the Essentials in different sized kits: in pockets, on key rings, in pocket kits, belt pouches, [[fanny pack|belt packs]], day packs, and [[backpack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Six Ways In And Twelve Ways Out, Basic Skills Manual, Equipment Chapter |publisher=USRSOG.org  |url=http://www.usrsog.org/equip.htm |accessdate = 2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other lists==
Other outdoor organizations have variations of the ''Ten Essentials'' pertinent to local conditions. 

Boy Scouts of America's "Scout Basic Essentials" are quite similar (Map and Compass, Sun Protection, Extra Clothing, Flashlight, First-Aid Kit, Matches and Fire-starters, Pocketknife, Trail Food, Water Bottle, and Rain Gear.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boyslife.org/outdoors/outdoorarticles/6976/scout-outdoor-essentials-checklist/|title=Packing Checklists for Camping Trips|date=16 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah's [[Wasatch Mountain Club]] lists extra water in place of food, as Utah is mostly desert terrain, and water is more difficult to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/UTAH.htm|title=Precipitation in Utah|accessdate=2009-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spokane Mountaineers list "thirteen essentials", which supplement the list with emergency shelter such as a [[space blanket]], signaling device, and toilet paper and [[trowel]] (for sanitary disposal of [[feces|human waste]]; the toilet paper also doubles as [[tinder]] for starting a fire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spokanemountaineers.org/public_html/trip_lead_essentials.htm|title=The 13 Essentials of the Spokane Mountaineers|publisher=Spokane Mountaineers|accessdate=2007-08-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928222706/http://spokanemountaineers.org/public_html/trip_lead_essentials.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Ten Essential Groups" is an alternative approach to essential gear selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texas.sierraclub.org/dallas/page.asp?10essentialgroups |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yUf4mhtH |archivedate=2011-05-07 |title=The Ten Essential Groups |publisher=Dallas Sierra Club |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items from each group should be chosen depending on the season, geographic location, and trip duration. In 2011, Columbia Sportswear adopted the "Ten Essential Groups" concept for their iOS app "Take Ten to the Greater Outdoors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/take-ten-to-greater-outdoors/id412088534 |title=Take Ten to the Greater Outdoors |date= |publisher=Columbia Sportswear  |accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Arizona Mountain Rescue Association promotes the 12 Essentials, which includes Signaling Devices and Personal Items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountainrescue.org/education|title=Central Arizona Mountain Rescue Association|last=|first=|date=2018-03-20|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
