      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2895">'''Acid gas''' is a particular typology of [[natural gas]] or any other [[gas]] [[mixture]] containing significant quantities of [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or similar [[acid]]ic gases.

The terms ''acid gas'' and ''[[sour gas]]'' are often incorrectly treated as synonyms. Strictly speaking, a sour gas is any gas that specifically contains hydrogen sulfide in significant amounts; an acid gas is any gas that contains significant amounts of [[acidic]] gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or hydrogen sulfide. Thus, carbon dioxide by itself is an acid gas but not a sour gas.

==Processing and safety==
Before a raw natural gas containing hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide can be used, the raw gas must be treated to reduce impurities to acceptable levels and this is commonly done with an [[amine gas treating]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp NaturalGas.org website page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101053431/http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing_ng.asp |date=2011-01-01 }} ''Processing Natural Gas''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/2006/ngprocess/ngprocess.pdf Energy Information Agency website page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304003407/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/2006/ngprocess/ngprocess.pdf |date=2011-03-04}} ''Natural Gas Processing: The Crucial Link Between Natural Gas Production and Its Transportation to Market''&lt;/ref&gt; The removed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is most often subsequently converted to by-product elemental [[sulfur]] in a [[Claus process]] or alternatively converted to valuable [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[WSA Process]] unit.

Processes within oil refineries or [[natural-gas processing]] plants that remove [[mercaptan]]s and/or hydrogen sulfide are commonly referred to as 'sweetening' processes because they result in products which no longer have the sour, foul odors of mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide.

Hydrogen sulfide is a [[Hydrogen sulfide#Toxicity|toxic]] gas. It also restricts the materials that can be used for [[piping]] and other equipment for handling sour gas, as many metals are sensitive to [[sulfide stress cracking]].

Carbon dioxide at concentrations of 7% to 10.1% cause dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour. Concentrations above 17% are lethal when exposed for more than one minute.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:SpiritTherm02.jpg|right|Alcohol thermometer]]
The '''alcohol thermometer''' or '''spirit thermometer''' is an alternative to the [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] and has similar functions. Unlike the mercury-in-glass thermometer, the contents of an alcohol thermometer are less toxic and will evaporate quickly. The ethanol version is the most widely used due to the low cost and relatively low hazard posed by the liquid in case of breakage.

An [[organic liquid]] is contained in a glass bulb which is connected to a [[capillary]] of the same glass and the end is sealed with an expansion bulb. The space above the liquid is a mixture of nitrogen and the vapor of the liquid. For the working temperature range, the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] or interface between the liquid is within the capillary. With increasing temperature, the volume of liquid expands and the meniscus moves up the capillary. The position of the meniscus shows the temperature against an inscribed scale.

The liquid used can be pure [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], [[kerosene]] or [[isoamyl acetate]], depending on manufacturer and working temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Thermometer Filling Liquids | url = http://www.instrumentationservices.net/downloads/Thermometer_Filling_Liquids.pdf|work = Charnwood Instrumentation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141102152303/http://www.instrumentationservices.net/downloads/Thermometer_Filling_Liquids.pdf| archive-date = 2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these are [[transparency and translucency|transparent]], the liquid is made more visible by the addition of a red or blue [[dye]]. One half of the glass containing the capillary is usually enamelled white or yellow to give a background for reading the scale.

The range of usefulness of the thermometer is set by the [[boiling point]] of the liquid used. In the case of the ethanol-filled thermometer, the upper limit for measurement is 78&amp;nbsp;°C (172.4&amp;nbsp;°F), which makes it useful for measuring daytime, nighttime and body temperatures, although not for anything much hotter than these. 

Ethanol-filled thermometers are used in preference to mercury for [[meteorological]] measurements of minimum temperatures and can be used down to −70&amp;nbsp;°C (-94&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=BSI692&gt;[[British Standards|British Standard]] 692:1990 ''Specification for Meteorological Thermometers''&lt;/ref&gt;  The physical limitation of the ability of a thermometer to measure low temperature is the freezing point of the liquid used. Ethanol freezes at −114.9&amp;nbsp;°C (−174.82&amp;nbsp;°F). If an alcohol thermometer utilizes a combination of ethyl alcohol, toluene, and pentane, its lower temperature range may be extended to measure temperatures down to as low as −200&amp;nbsp;°C (-328&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;http://staff.um.edu.mt/pcam2/Resources/Thermometers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the measurement temperature range c. −200&amp;nbsp;°C to 78&amp;nbsp;°C, is highly dependent upon the type of alcohol used.

==History==

The alcohol thermometer was the earliest efficient, modern-style instrument of temperature measurement. As is the case with many early, important inventions, several people are credited with the invention. These include [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who in 1654 made sealed tubes partly filled with alcohol or urine, with a bulb and stem, depending on the expansion of a liquid, and independent of air pressure.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Benedict (1987) Fundamentals of Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Measurements, 3rd ed, {{ISBN|0-471-89383-8}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources, including the Encyclopædia Britannica, credit German scientist [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] with inventing the alcohol thermometer in 1709.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica  "Science &amp; Technology: Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit" [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200226/Daniel-Gabriel-Fahrenheit]&lt;/ref&gt; Fahrenheit was a skilled [[glassblower]] and his alcohol thermometer was the world's first reliable thermometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/Du-Fi/Fahrenheit-Gabriel.html Encyclopedia of World Biography "Gabriel Fahrenheit"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AGM-88 HARM on FA-18C.jpg|thumb|[[AGM-88 HARM|HARM]] on a US Navy [[F/A-18C]]]]
[[File:ALARM.jpeg|thumb|[[ALARM]] under the wing of a [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]]]]

An '''anti-radiation missile''' ('''ARM''') is a [[missile]] designed to detect and home in on an enemy [[radio emission]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raytheon Company: High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM)|url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/harm/|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these are designed for use against an enemy [[radar]], although jammers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AGM-88 HARM|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/smart/agm-88.htm|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even radios used for communications can also be targeted in this manner.

== Air-to-surface ==

Most ARM designs to date have been intended for use against ground-based radars. Commonly carried by specialist aircraft in the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD) role (known to the [[United States Air Force]] as "[[Wild Weasel]]s"), the primary purpose of this type of missile is to degrade enemy air defenses in the first period of a conflict in order to increase the chances of survival for the following waves of strike aircraft. They can also be used to quickly shut down unexpected [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) sites during an air raid. Often, SEAD escort aircraft also carry [[cluster bomb]]s, which can be used to ensure that, after the ARM disables the SAM system's radar, the command post, missile launchers, and other components or equipment are also destroyed to guarantee that the SAM site stays down.

Early ARMs, such as the [[AGM-45 Shrike]], were not particularly intelligent; they would simply home in on the source of radiation and explode when they got near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-45.html|title=Texas Instruments AGM-45 Shrike|website=www.designation-systems.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAM operators learned to turn their [[radar]] off when an ARM was fired at them, then turn it back on later, greatly reducing the missile's effectiveness. This led to the development of more advanced ARMs such as the [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]] and [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles, which have [[inertial guidance system]]s (INS) built-in. This allows them to remember the radar's direction if it is turned off and continue to fly towards it. ARMs are less likely to hit the radar if the radar is turned off shortly after the missile is launched, as the longer the radar is off (and assuming it never turns back on), the more error is introduced into the missile's course. The [[ALARM]] even has an added loiter mode, with a built in parachute, enabling it to descend slowly until the radar lights up, when the rocket motor will re-ignite. Even a temporary shut down of the enemy's missile guidance radar can be of a great advantage to friendly aircraft during battle.

The [[DRDO Anti-Radiation Missile]] is under development by India.

The [[MAR-1]] is under development by Brazil.

== Surface-to-surface ==

Several [[surface-to-surface missile]]s, like the [[P-700 Granit]], [[P-500 Bazalt]], [[Exocet|MM40 Exocet]], B611MR, and [[Otomat]], include a home-on-jam capability wherein the receiver component of their [[active radar homing]] is used to home in on enemy radar, ECM or communications. This makes these missiles significantly harder to defeat with ECM and distraction countermeasures, and makes the use of [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active]] missiles against them dangerous.

== Surface-to-air ==

Due to experiences with jamming by US-built aircraft in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and during Middle Eastern wars in the late 1960s, the Soviets designed an alternative tracking mode for their [[S-75 Dvina|S-75]] (SA-2) missiles, which allowed them to track a jamming target without needing to actively send out any radar signals. This was achieved by the SAM site's radar receiver locking on to radio noise emissions generated by an aircraft's jamming pod. In cases of heavy jamming, missiles were often launched exclusively in this mode; this passive tracking meant that SAM sites could track targets without needing to emit any radar signals, and so American anti-radiation missiles could not be fired back in retaliation. Recently, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] developed the FT-2000 system to counter [[Airborne early warning and control|AEW]] and [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] targets. This system is based on the HQ-9, which is in turn based on the S-300PMU. These anti-radiation missile systems have been marketed to Pakistan and various other countries.

== Air-to-air ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mar antia radar.jpg|thumb|right|A [[MAR-1]] um missile mounted under the wing of an [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] attack fighter of the [[Brazilian Air Force]].]] --&gt;

More recently, air-to-air ARM designs have begun to appear, notably the Russian [[R-27 (air-to-air missile)|Vympel R-27EP]]. Such missiles have several advantages over other [[missile guidance]] techniques; they do not trigger radar warning receivers (conferring a measure of surprise), and they can have a longer range (since the battery life of the seeker head is the limiting factor to the range of most [[active radar homing]] systems).

In the 1970s, [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aerospace]] had a project called [[Hughes Brazo|BRAZO]] (Spanish for ARM). Based on a [[Raytheon]] [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], it was meant to offer an air-to-air capability against proposed Soviet AWACS types and also some other types with extremely powerful radar sets, such as the MiG-25. The project did not proceed.

The '''Arriflex D-20''' is a film-style [[Digital cinematography|digital motion picture camera]] made by [[Arri]] first introduced in November 2005.  The camera's attributes are its optical viewfinder, modularity, and [[35 mm film|35mm-width]] [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS sensor]]. The camera was discontinued in 2008 and the [[Arriflex D-21]] was introduced.

== Overview ==
The D-20 uses a single CMOS sensor the width of a [[Super 35]] [[film gate]] aperture.  Effectively the D-20, when used with current 35 mm [[PL mount]] motion picture lenses, yields the same [[field of view]] and [[depth of field]] as Super [[35 mm film]] [[movie camera|motion picture cameras]].

The D-20 captures images in two main modes:
*In Data mode the sensor uses 2880x2160 active pixels generating RAW [[Bayer filter|Bayer]]-data at [[Color depth|12 bit]] in a [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]] aspect ratio. The RAW data then needs to be processed outboard to generate a full color image.  A delivery aspect ratio for theatrical release, commonly [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.85:1]], is achieved by cropping from the original image, similar to the cropping necessary when shooting 35 mm film.  In Data mode the sensor size also allows for the use of [[anamorphic]] lenses, producing the 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio from the full sensor height. Captured data is recorded to either flash or hard drives, notably the sTwo data recorder.
*In HD mode the sensor uses 2880x1620 active pixels to generate an image with a  [[Aspect ratio (image)|16:9]] aspect ratio downsampled to 1920x1080 pixels in either YUV 4:2:2  [[Color depth|10 bit]] (via single link HD-SDI) or RGB 4:4:4  [[Color depth|10 bit]] (via dual link HD-SDI). Typically, the D-20 is tethered  to a Sony HDCamSR recorder. Other recording options exist, including the [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]] flash mag which provides untethered recording of up to 15 minutes per "mag" in RGB 4:4:4.

Following recording formats are possible:

Data Mode:
* 2880 x 2160 RAW 12 bit Bayer data @ 23.976p, 24p, 25p
* 2880 x 1620 RAW 12 bit Bayer data @ 29.97p, 30p

HD Mode – HD-SDI (SMPTE 292M):
* 1920 x 1080 4:2:2 YCbCr 10 bit @ 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30 PsF

HD Mode – dual link HD-SDI (SMPTE 372M):
* 1920 x 1080 4:4:4 RGB 10 bit @ 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30 PsF
* 1920 x 1080 4:2:2 YCbCr 10 bit @ 48, 50, 59.94, 60PsF* 

The D-20 has a mechanical shutter, variable from 11.2° to 180° or an electronic shutter that simulates a 270° mechanical shutter at 24frame/s. The camera is capable of running at speeds from 1 to 60frame/s. Numerous components of the camera were borrowed from Arri film camera models (most notably the [[Arriflex 435|435ES]]), assuring compatibility with Arri film camera accessories and support equipment.

Though the D-20 system is capable of variable speeds from 1 to 60 frames per second, in RAW Data mode these are currently limited to 23.976 frame/s, 24 frame/s, 25 frame/s, 29.97 frame/s &amp; 30 frame/s per second.

The sensitivity of the D-20 in video mode is regulated by the application of [[Lookup table|LUTs]] (Look Up Tables) prior to output. With sensitivity settings ranging from ISO 100 to ISO 800 with linear responses, the D-20 also offers log curve options designed to mimic the response of film negative. Unlike some other digital cameras, the D-20 does not offer gain boost, instead relying on the advantages of adding gain in the post production process. The sensitivity of the camera in Data mode is regulated by applying [[Lookup table|LUTs]] in the outboard processing of the image.

==Distinctive characteristics==
Of the currently available high resolution digital motion picture cameras, the [[Dalsa]] [[Dalsa Origin|Origin]], the SI 2K  and the D-20 feature detachable optical viewfinders. 

Some advantages of an optical over purely electronic viewing systems include:
* extremely high viewfinder resolution, with the option to zoom in on the image to check critical focus
* ability to set camera framing without need of a power supply
Some disadvantages an optical viewing introduces to a camera system:
* loss of light and sensitivity, as light has to go to the viewfinder instead of the sensor
* no monitoring of what is recorded on the sensor, only what appears in front of the sensor.

Electronic viewing options can be added to the camera. Typically, an additional monitor is used to both view and evaluate images for the camera.

The D-20 also accepts a traditional film style video assist system, sharing the image available through the optical viewfinder. This can be useful in Steadicam and remote crane applications where visibility outside the sensor capture area is preferable.

Like Arri mechanical cameras, the D-20 is modularly constructed so that both the mechanical and electronic components are upgradable over time, the camera however was discontinued in 2008 and the D-21 was introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">{{distinguish|Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|Back-chaining}}
'''Backward chaining''' (or '''backward reasoning''') is an [[inference]] method described colloquially as working backward from the goal. It is used in [[automated theorem prover]]s, [[inference engine]]s, [[proof assistant]]s, and other [[artificial intelligence]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward|title=The Rise of the Expert Company|year=1988|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-1731-6|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[game theory]], researchers apply it to (simpler) [[subgame]]s to find a solution to the game, in a process called ''[[backward induction]]''. In chess, it is called [[retrograde analysis]], and it is used to generate table bases for [[chess endgame]]s for [[computer chess]].

Backward chaining is implemented in [[logic programming]] by [[SLD resolution]]. Both rules are based on the [[modus ponens]] inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of [[reasoning]] with [[inference rule]]s and [[Logical consequence|logical implications]] – the other is [[forward chaining]]. Backward chaining systems usually employ a [[depth-first search]] strategy, e.g. [[Prolog]].&lt;ref name="CheinMugnier2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel Chein|author2=Marie-Laure Mugnier|title=Graph-based knowledge representation: computational foundations of conceptual graphs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz3y6WK2EMEC&amp;pg=PA297|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84800-285-2|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

Backward chaining starts with a list of [[goal]]s (or a [[hypothesis]]) and works backwards from the [[consequent]] to the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] to see if any [[data]] supports any of these consequents.&lt;ref name="Norwig Definition"/&gt; An [[inference engine]] using backward chaining would search the [[inference]] rules until it finds one with a consequent ('''Then''' clause) that matches a desired goal. If the antecedent ('''If''' clause) of that rule is known to be true, then it is added to the list of goals (for one's goal to be confirmed one must also provide data that confirms this new rule).

For example, suppose a new pet, Fritz, is delivered in an opaque box along with two facts about Fritz:
* Fritz croaks
* Fritz eats flies
The goal is to decide whether Fritz is green, based on a [[rule base]] containing the following four rules:

[[File:Backward Chaining Frog Color Example.png|upright=0.56|thumb|alt=An Example of Backward Chaining.|An Example of Backward Chaining.]]

# '''If''' X croaks and X eats flies – '''Then''' X is a frog
# '''If''' X chirps and X sings – '''Then''' X is a canary
# '''If''' X is a frog – '''Then''' X is green
# '''If''' X is a canary – '''Then''' X is yellow

With backward reasoning, an inference engine can determine whether Fritz is green in four steps.  To start, the query is phrased as a goal assertion that is to be proved: "Fritz is green".

1. Fritz is substituted for X in rule #3 to see if its consequent matches the goal, so rule #3 becomes:
  '''If''' Fritz is a frog – '''Then''' Fritz is green
Since the consequent matches the goal ("Fritz is green"), the rules engine now needs to see if the antecedent ("If Fritz is a frog") can be proved.  The antecedent therefore becomes the new goal:
  Fritz is a frog

2. Again substituting Fritz for X, rule #1 becomes:
  '''If''' Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies – '''Then''' Fritz is a frog
Since the consequent matches the current goal ("Fritz is a frog"), the inference engine now needs to see if the antecedent ("If Fritz croaks and eats flies") can be proved.  The antecedent therefore becomes the new goal:
  Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies

3. Since this goal is a conjunction of two statements, the inference engine breaks it into two sub-goals, both of which must be proved:
  Fritz croaks
  Fritz eats flies

4. To prove both of these sub-goals, the inference engine sees that both of these sub-goals were given as initial facts.  Therefore, the conjunction is true:
  Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies
therefore the antecedent of rule #1 is true and the consequent must be true:
  Fritz is a frog
therefore the antecedent of rule #3 is true and the consequent must be true:
  Fritz is green

This derivation therefore allows the inference engine to prove that Fritz is green.  Rules #2 and #4 were not used.

Note that the goals always match the affirmed versions of the consequents of implications (and not the negated versions as in [[modus tollens]]) and even then, their antecedents are then considered as the new goals (and not the conclusions as in [[affirming the consequent]]), which ultimately must match known facts (usually defined as consequents whose antecedents are always true); thus, the inference rule used is [[modus ponens]].

Because the list of goals determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called [[goal-oriented|goal-driven]], in contrast to [[Data science|data-driven]] [[forward chaining|forward-chaining]] inference. The backward chaining approach is often employed by [[expert systems]].

Programming languages such as [[Prolog]], [[Knowledge Machine]] and [[ECLiPSe]] support backward chaining within their inference engines.&lt;ref name="Programming Languages"/&gt;

The '''banker's lamp''' (or '''Emeralite''') is a style of electric [[Light fixture|table lamp]] characterised by a [[brass]] stand, green glass [[lamp shade]] and pull-chain switch (though modern versions may make use of alternate switch types). Other examples can feature different colors of glass.

==History==

The first patent for a banker's lamp was filed on 11 May 1909 by Harrison D. McFaddin and were produced and sold under the brand name Emeralite ("emerald" and "light"). Emeralite lamp shades were produced by the J. Schreiber &amp; Neffen factory located in the city of [[Rapotín]], [[Moravia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bleier|first1=Bruce|title=The Lamps of H. G. McFaddin &amp; Co.|url=http://www.emeralite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later competitors were sold as "Greenalite", "Verdelite" and "Amronlite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Lynn|title=Revival lighting of the 20s and 30s|journal=Old-House Journal|volume= 24| issue =  2|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvkgE3tKp0gC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Inc.''' (FCDI) is a large scale manufacturer of human cells, created from induced pluripotent stem cells, for use in basic research, drug discovery and regenerative medicine applications.

[[File:Neuron 011910.JPG|thumb|FCDI iCell Neurons with beta-III tubulin (a neuronal marker) stained red and nuclei stained blue with Hoechst]]

== History ==
Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Inc (FCDI) was founded in 2004 by pluripotent stem cell biologist, [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]]. He recognized that the way [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell technology]] could impact human health in the near future was to industrialize the process of manufacturing human cells in large quantities with high quality and consistency.

Prior to acquisition, the company then named Cellular Dynamics International, Inc. tendered an initial public offering in July 2013 under the ticker symbol ICEL. On March 30, 2015, Fujifilm Holdings Corporation announced an agreement to acquire Cellular Dynamics International for $307 million or $16.50/share on a fully diluted basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Fujifilm Holdings to Acquire Cellular Dynamics International, Inc. |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fujifilm-holdings-to-acquire-cellular-dynamics-international-inc-300057456.html |work=PR Newswire |location=New York |date=30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company was subsequently renamed Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Inc. 

Human cells are considered to be a more predictive model and a replacement for other cellular models that serve as proxies, including animal cells, immortalized cell lines, and cadaveric cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff |url=http://www.european-biotechnology-news.com/news/news/2013-04/stem-cells-better-disease-models.html | title=Human cells mimic Alzheimer | work=European Biotechnology News | publisher=BIOCOM AG | location=Germany | date=June 12, 2013 | deadurl=no&lt;!--added to archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FCDI offers several terminally differentiated cell types as catalog products: iCell® Cardiomyocytes, iCell Neurons, iCell Endothelial Cells, and iCell Hepatocytes. CDI’s MyCell® Products portfolio enables customer-provided donor samples to be reprogrammed, gene edited, and differentiated. The company also has several prototype products derived from pluripotent stem cells, including iCell Cardiac Progenitors, iCell Hematopoietic Progenitors, iCell Astrocytes, and iCell Skeletal Myoblasts.

FCDI has two locations. Their corporate headquarters are located in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] and a second facility resides at the [[Buck Institute for Research on Aging|Buck Institute for Aging]] in [[Novato, California]]. In 2013, FCDI was awarded a {{currency|16 million}} contract from the [[California Institute for Regenerative Medicine]] to reprogram and bank iPS cells from 3,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="cirm2013award" /&gt;

{{As of|2013}}, FCDI has more than 800 patents and licensed technologies as part of their technology portfolio.

== Recognition ==
FCDI appeared on ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'''s "Disruptive Companies" list in both 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=50 Disruptive Companies&amp;mdash;2011 | at=Cellular Dynamics International | work=[[MIT Technol.

== Application Areas ==

===Toxicity===
FCDI began to develop drug compound safety applications early in the company’s product development cycle. Several published studies have used FCDI products to investigate mechanisms of toxicity and have leveraged cellular models to identify toxicity earlier in the drug development process. Unexpected toxicity is one of the leading reasons that drugs are pulled from the market or from late stage clinical trials and toxicity issues greatly increase the cost of drug development.&lt;ref name="fda" /&gt;

===Drug Discovery===
FCDI cells enable new strategies for disease modeling and drug discovery work.  Because FCDI’s MyCell Products are created using custom iPS cell reprogramming and differentiation processes, they provide biologically relevant human cells from donors with specific disease-associated genotypes and phenotypes.  The company’s iCell and MyCell cells are readily adapted to screening platforms and demonstrate functionality using widely accepted readout technologies.&lt;ref name="ncbi10" /&gt;  FCDI’s products are used in high throughput screens,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect" /&gt; and have been used as supporting data in Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions to the FDA.&lt;ref name="ncbi5" /&gt;

===Regenerative Medicine===
Reprogramming technology enables new ways to study disease mechanisms and modeling. Researchers can reprogram diseased cells of interest to study how a particular disease affects those cell types and to discover methods of repairing the cells.&lt;ref name="ncbi4" /&gt;  FCDI’s iCell and MyCell products are being used to research the development of regenerative medicine approaches, including: regenerative medicine compound screening, allogeneic and autologous cell therapy, tissue engineering, and transplantation. Specifically in the area of tissue engineering, FCDI’s iCell and MyCell products are being employed across a variety of technologies, such as implantable devices, de-cellularized organ reconstitution and 3D bioprinting.

===Stem Cell Banking===
FCDI is actively engaged in a number of large-scale iPS cell reprogramming and banking projects, with the goal of creating broadly available resources of iPS cells that represent normal human diversity, disease states and adverse drug reactions. In 2013, CIRM awarded FCDI a {{currency|16.0 million}} grant to derive 3 iPS cell lines from each of 3,000 donors that represent a multitude of disease states.&lt;ref name="cirm2013award" /&gt;  This project follows a $6.3 million grant awarded by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] to FCDI and the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] to investigate the mechanisms underlying [[left ventricular hypertrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Medical College of Wisconsin and Cellular Dynamics Awarded NHLBI Grant Using Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells | date=July 5, 2011 | publisher=Cellular Dynamics | via=[[PR Newswire]] | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medical-college-of-wisconsin-and-cellular-dynamics-awarded-nhlbi-grant-using-human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-124999419.html | deadurl=no&lt;!--present in archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genomeweb.com/medical-college-wisconsin-cellular-dynamics-win-63m-nhlbi-grant | title=Medical College of Wisconsin, Cellular Dynamics Win $6.3M NHLBI Grant | accessdate=July 5, 2011 }}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FCDI’s role in this project is to generate iPS cell lines and cardiomyocytes from 250 donors selected from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] study.

== Product Areas ==

===Cardiac===
The company’s first product, iCell Cardiomyocytes, have been used extensively in pharmaceutical research and drug development 
applications.  Other stem cell derived Cardiomyocytes are available commercially from GE Healthcare, Cellectis, Reprocell and others. iCell Cardiomyocytes have been found to display electrical properties similar to those of human cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref name="ncbi4" /&gt;  iCell Cardiomyocytes have also been used for drug safety testing, toxicology testing, drug screening and Investigational New Drug (IND) filings. iCell Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) are part of the FCDI Cardiac portfolio; these cells launched in 2014 for use in heart failure research.

===Neural===
iCell Neurons have been used across several different research areas, including Parkinson’s disease, toxicity, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and virology FCDI expanded their neural product portfolio by launching iCell Astrocytes and iCell Dopaminergic Neurons. Other manufacturers of stem cell derived neurons include ArunA Biomedical and ReproCell.

===Hepatic===
iCell Hepatocytes are used in a variety of ways, including prediction of hepatotoxicity in drug development applications. Adverse and unexpected hepatic side effects are one of the most common reasons for drugs to be removed from the market after launch or in late phase clinical trials&lt;ref name="fda"/&gt;iCell Hepatocytes are used as a tool for better predicting hepatic toxicity earlier in the drug discovery process. Other companies that provide hepatocytes include Cellectis and Life Technologies.

===Vascular and Blood===
At least 5 of the top 10 Leading Causes of Death in the United States have a vascular component related to their disease.&lt;ref name="vital"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hoyert, Donna L. | author2=Xu, Jiaquan | url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf | format=PDF | title=Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2011 | date=October 10, 2012 | work=National Vital Statistics Reports | publisher=[[National Vital Statistics System|NVSS]] | location=United States | volume=61 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] (cells that line the interior of blood vessels and allow nutrients to pass back and forth to the body’s organs and tissues) play an important role in the study of  vascular contributions of many leading causes of death. iCell Endothelial cells were launched as a tool to model vascular biology. Other types of endothelial cells are available from ATCC and Life Technologies. iCell Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells are multipotent progenitor blood cells that can give rise to many different types of blood cells that can then be used for a variety of research purposes, including cell therapy, autoimmune disease, and cancer research.

===Donor Cells===
FCDI offers a family of products called MyCell Products that involve custom reprogramming, genetic engineering and differentiation of a customer’s own cell samples. The technology driving MyCell Products enables customers to study their disease of interest or correct a genetic disease phenotype using genome editing technology. Studies have shown that disease cell reprogramming can result in cells that display the particular disease morphology, providing an opportunity to study the disease as never before.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

The '''Central Utah Project Completion Act''' ('''CUPCA''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cupcao.gov/TheCUP/PL102-575-amended.pdf|title=Central Utah Project Completion Act (P.L. 102-575)|date=October 30, 1992|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted on October 30, 1992, removed responsibility for completing the [[Central Utah Project]], a federal water project, from the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]]. The Central Utah Project Completion Act then distributed responsibility for the project:

* Construction of the remainder of the Central Utah Project became the responsibility of the local water district—the [[Central Utah Water Conservancy District]]
* The Central Utah Project Completion Act established the [[Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission]] to oversee facilities to mitigate for the environmental effects of the Central Utah Project; and
* The Central Utah Project Completion Act placed responsibility for oversight of the project with the Secretary of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].

==Before Central Utah Project Completion Act==

The Central Utah Project was authorized under the Colorado River Storage Project Act (CRSPA) (Public Law 84-485) on April 11, 1956,&lt;ref name="CRSPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/pdfiles/crspuc.pdf|title=Colorado River Storage Project Act (Public Law 485, [70 Stat. 105])|date=April 11, 1956|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a participating project of the [[Colorado River Storage Project]] to help meet Utah’s long-term water needs. Construction progress on the Central Utah Project proceeded slowly because of: the complexity of the project; complex environmental analyses; and inadequate and sporadic Federal funding. The slow progress prompted state and local officials to ask Congress to empower the Central Utah Water Conservancy District to complete the planning and construction of the remaining portion of the CUP, specifically the Bonneville Unit.

==The Act==

Congress responded to local concerns by enacting the Central Utah Project Completion Act in 1992. For the first time in history, Congress designated a local entity (the Central Utah Water Conservancy District) as the planning and construction entity FOR a major Federal water project.

==Key Elements==

•	Water for the Future – The Central Utah Project Completion Act authorizes sufficient Federal funds to complete the Central Utah Project. The construction of CUP facilities provides water for Utah’s future—including the future of the Uinta Basin. The Uinta Basin Replacement Project is a key element of the construction authorized under Central Utah Project Completion Act.

•	Recreation Opportunities – Central Utah Project facilities provide a range of recreational opportunities.

•	Fiscal Responsibility – The Central Utah Project Completion Act created a cost-sharing environment under which local funds augment federal funding in the planning and construction of Central Utah Project features—which engenders additional fiscal responsibility.

•	Environmental Commitments – The Central Utah Project Completion Act created the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission to coordinate and plan mitigation measures to meet [[environmental mitigation]] and conservation measures (including environmental commitments that preceded the Central Utah Project Completion Act). The Central Utah Project Completion Act also includes provisions for maintaining steam flows at prescribed minimum rates for the benefit of aquatic and riparian habitat.

•	Water Conservation – The Central Utah Project Completion Act authorizes substantial funding for the planning and implementation of water conservation measures and projects.

•	Local Development – The Central Utah Project Completion Act provides funding for local water development projects in areas that do not benefit directly from the Central Utah Project.

•	[[Ute Indian Rights Settlement]] – CUPCA encourages the Northern [[Ute Tribe]] to quantify by compact its federal reserved water rights. It also settle long-outstanding claims against the United States arising out of the construction of the CUP by authorizing substantial funds to compensate the Ute Tribe for construction projects not undertaken by the United States. These funds provide for agricultural development, fish and wildlife enhancement, recreation improvement, and economic development.

'''Color depth''' or '''colour depth''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|spelling differences]]), also known as '''[[Bit depth (computer graphics)|bit depth]]''', is either the number of [[bit]]s used to [[User interface|indicate]] the color of a single [[pixel]], in a [[raster graphics|bitmapped image]] or video [[framebuffer]], or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel.&lt;ref name=OverviewHEVCIEEE2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Overview of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard |author=G.J.

The definition of both color precision and gamut is accomplished with a color encoding specification which assigns a digital code value to a location in a [[color space]].

==Indexed color==
{{Main|Indexed color}}
With the relatively low color depth, the stored value is typically a number representing the index into a color map or [[palette (computing)|palette]] (a form of [[vector quantization]]). The colors available in the palette itself may be fixed by the hardware or modifiable by software. Modifiable palettes are sometimes referred to as '''pseudocolor''' palettes.

* [[Binary image|1-bit color]] (2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 colors): [[monochrome]], often black and white, compact [[Macintosh]]es, [[Atari ST]].
* 2-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 colors): [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], gray-scale early [[NeXTstation]], color Macintoshes, Atari ST.
* 3-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 colors): many early home computers with TV displays, including the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[BBC Micro]]
* 4-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 colors): as used by [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and by the least common denominator VGA standard at higher resolution, color Macintoshes, Atari ST, [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]].
* 5-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 32 colors): [[Original Amiga chipset]]
* 6-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 colors): Original Amiga chipset
* [[8-bit color]] (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256 colors): most early color Unix workstations, [[VGA]] at low resolution, [[Super VGA]], color Macintoshes, [[Atari TT]], [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|Amiga AGA chipset]], [[Falcon030]], [[Acorn Archimedes]].
* 12-bit color (2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; = 4096 colors): some [[Silicon Graphics]] systems, Color NeXTstation systems, and [[Amiga]] systems in [[Hold And Modify|HAM]] mode.

Old graphics chips, particularly those used in [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s, often have the ability to use a different palette per [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and [[tile (computer graphics)|tile]]s in order to increase the maximum number of simultaneously displayed colors, while minimizing use of then-expensive memory (&amp; bandwidth). For example, in the [[ZX Spectrum]], the picture is stored in a two-color format, but these two colors can be separately defined for each rectangular block of 8x8 pixels.

The palette itself has a color depth (number of bits per entry). While the best VGA systems only offered an 18-bit (262,144 color) palette from which colors could be chosen, all color Macintosh video hardware offered a 24-bit (16 million color) palette. 24-bit palettes are pretty much universal on any recent hardware or file format using them.

==Direct color==
If pixels contain more than 12 bits, an indexed palette takes more memory than the pixels (for typical screen sizes and palette depths), so such systems tend to directly specify the color directly in the pixel.

===8-bit color===
{{Main|8-bit color}}
A very limited but true direct color system, there are 3 bits (8 possible levels) for each of the R and G components, and the two remaining bits in the byte pixel to the B component (four levels), enabling 256 (8 × 8 × 4) different colors. The normal human eye is less sensitive to the blue component than to the red or green (two thirds of the eye's receptors process the longer wavelengths&lt;ref&gt;Pantone, [http://www.pantone.co.uk/pages/pantone/Pantone.aspx?pg=19357&amp;ca=29 How we see color]&lt;/ref&gt;), so it is assigned one bit less than the others. Used, amongst others, in the [[MSX2]] system series of computers in the early to mid 1990s.

Do not confuse with an indexed color depth of 8bpp (although it can be simulated in such systems by selecting the adequate table).

===High color (15/16-bit)===
{{Main|High color}}
''High color'' supports 15/16-bit for three [[RGB]] colors. In 16-bit direct color, there can be 4 bits (16 possible levels) for each of the R, G, and B components, plus optionally 4 bits for alpha (transparency), enabling 4,096 (16 × 16 × 16) different colors with 16 levels of transparency.  Or in some systems there can be 5 bits per color component and 1 bit of alpha (32,768 colors, just fully transparent or not); or there can be 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green, and 5 bits for blue, for 65,536 colors with no transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term "high color" has recently been used to mean color depths greater than 24 bits.

===18-bit===
Almost all of the least expensive LCDs (such as typical [[TFT LCD#Twisted nematic (TN)|twisted nematic]] types) provide 18-bit color (64 × 64 × 64 = 262,144 combinations) to achieve faster color transition times, and use either [[dither]]ing or [[frame rate control]] to approximate 24-bit-per-pixel true color,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TR's Summer 2012 system guide|url=http://techreport.com/review/23204/tr-summer-2012-system-guide/14|page=14|date=July 2, 2012|first1=Cyril|last1=Kowaliski|first2=Geoff|last2=Gasior|first3=Scott|last3=Wasson|publisher=[[The Tech Report]]|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or throw away 6 bits of color information entirely. More expensive LCDs (typically [[IPS panel|IPS]]) can display 24-bit or greater color depth.

24 bits almost always uses 8 bits of each of R, G, B. As of 2018, 24-bit color depth is used by virtually every computer and phone display and the vast majority of image storage formats. Almost all cases where there are 32 bits per pixel mean that 24 are used for the color, and the remaining 8 are the [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] or unused.

2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; gives 16,777,216 color variations. The human eye can discriminate up to ten million colors&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and since the gamut of a display is smaller than the range of human vision, this means this should cover that range with more detail than can be perceived. However displays do not evenly distribute the colors in human perception space so humans can see the changes between some adjacent colors as [[Colour banding|color banding]]. [[Grayscale|Monochromatic images]] set all three channels to the same value, resulting in only 256 different colors and thus more visible banding. Some software attempts to dither the gray level into the color channels to increase this, although in modern software this is much more used for [[subpixel rendering]] to increase the space resolution on LCD screens where the colors have slightly different positions.

The [[DVD-Video]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] standards support a bit depth of 8-bits per color in [[YCbCr]] with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]].&lt;ref name=AudioholicsHDMIApril2008&gt;{{cite news |title=HDMI Enhanced Black Levels, xvYCC and RGB |author=Clint DeBoer |publisher=[[Audioholics]] |url=http://www.audioholics.com/tweaks/calibrate-your-system/hdmi-black-levels-xvycc-rgb |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelairityDigitalColorCodingPDF&gt;{{cite news |title=Digital Color Coding |publisher=Telairity |url=http://www.telairity.com/assets/downloads/Digital%20Color%20Coding.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; YCbCr can be losslessly converted to RGB.

Macintosh systems refer to 24-bit color as "millions of colors". The term "True color" is sometime used to mean what this article is calling "Direct color".&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; is 1.073 billion. Color depths of 30, 36, and 48 bits per pixel are in use, also referred to as 10, 12, or 16 bits per RGB channel/sample/component. Often an alpha channel of the same size is added, resulting in 40, 48, or 64 bits used for each pixel.

Some earlier systems placed three 10-bit channels in a 32-bit word, with 2 bits unused (or used as a 4-level alpha channel). The [[Cineon#Cineon file format|Cineon file format]] that was popular for motion pictures used this. Some [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] systems had 10 (or more) bit D/A converters for the video signal and could be set up to interpret data stored this way for display. [[BMP file format#Pixel format|BMP files]] define this as one of its formats, and it is called "HiColor" by Microsoft.

Image editing software such as [[Photoshop]] started using 16 bits per channel fairly early. The primary reason this was done was to reduce the quantization on intermediate results (if an operation divided by 4 and then multiplied by 4, it would lose the bottom 2 bits of 8-bit data, but if 16 bits were used it would lose none of the 8-bit data). Digital cameras were able to produce 10 or 12 bits per channel in their raw data, and 16 bits is the smallest addressable unit that was larger than this and would allow raw data to be worked with. Unfortunately these systems did not take advantage of 16 bits for high dynamic range, and some assign almost mystical capabilities to 16 bits that are not actually true.

Video cards with 10 bits per component started coming to market in the late 1990s. An early example was the [[Radius (hardware company)|Radius]] ThunderPower card for the Macintosh, which included extensions for [[QuickDraw]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] plugins to support editing 30-bit images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_August_5/ai_18554540 | title = Radius Ships ThunderPower 30/1920 Graphics Card Capable of Super Resolution 1920 × 1080 and Billions of Colors|date=1996-08-05 | work=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HDMI]] 1.3 specification defines bit depths of 30 bits (1.073 billion colors), 36 bits (68.71 billion colors), and 48 bits (281.5 trillion colors).&lt;ref name="HDMI2006Specs6.7.2"&gt;

The [[DisplayPort]] specification also supports color depths greater than 24&amp;nbsp;bpp in version 1.3 through "[[DisplayPort#Display Stream Compression|VESA Display Stream Compression]], which uses a visually lossless low-latency algorithm based on predictive DPCM and YCoCg-R color space and allows increased resolutions and color depths and reduced power consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2792898/hdmi-displayport-displayport-monitor.html|title=Looking for a HDMI 2.0 displayport to displayport for my monitor - [Solved] - Displays|website=Tom's Hardware|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Dynamic Range and Wide Gamut ===

Some systems started using those bits for numbers outside the 0-1 range rather than for increasing the resolution. Numbers greater than 1 were for colors brighter than the display could show, as in [[high-dynamic-range imaging]] (HDRI). Negative numbers can increase the gamut to cover all possible colors, and for storing the results of filtering operations with negative filter coefficients. The [[Pixar Image Computer]] used 12 bits to store numbers in the range [-1.5,2.5), with 2 bits for the integer portion and 10 for the fraction. The [[Cineon]] imaging system used 10-bit professional video displays with the video hardware adjusted so that a value of 95 was black and 685 was white,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.qvolabs.com/acrobat/8bitvs10bit.pdf | title = 8-bit vs. 10-bit Color Space|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amplified signal tended to reduce the lifetime of the CRT.

=== Linear Color Space and Floating Point ===

More bits also encouraged the storage of light as linear values, where the number directly corresponds to the amount of light emitted. Linear levels makes calculation of light (in the context of computer graphics) much easier. However, linear color results in disproportionately more samples near white and fewer near black, so the quality of 16-bit linear is about equal to 12-bit [[sRGB]].

[[Floating point]] numbers can represent linear light levels spacing the samples semi-logarithmically. Floating point representations  also allow for drastically larger dynamic ranges as well as negative values. Around 1993, computer hardware had progressed to the point where the speed of floating point math began exceeding integer math in most practical situations. Most systems first supported 32-bit per channel [[Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]], which far exceeded the accuracy required for most applications. In 1999, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] released the [[open standard]] [[OpenEXR]] image file format which supports 16-bit-per-channel [[Half-precision floating-point format|half-precision]] floating-point numbers. At values near 1.0, half precision floating point values have only the precision of an 11-bit integer value, leading some graphics professionals to reject half-precision in situations where the extended dynamic range is not needed.

===More than 3 primaries===

Virtually all television displays and computer displays form images by varying the strength of just three [[primary color]]s: red, green, and blue. For example, bright yellow is formed by roughly equal red and green contributions, with no blue contribution.

Additional color primaries can widen the [[gamut|color gamut]] of a display, as you are not limited to the shape of a triangle in the [[CIE 1931 color space]].  Recent technologies such as [[Texas Instruments]]'s ''BrilliantColor'' augment the typical red, green, and blue channels with up to three other primaries: cyan, magenta and yellow.&lt;ref name="digitv info 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.digitaltvdesignline.com/showArticle.jhtml?printableArticle=true&amp;articleId=184425677|title=Wider color gamuts on DLP display systems through BrilliantColor technology|journal=Digital TV DesignLine|first=David|last=Hutchison|date=5 April 2006|accessdate=2007-08-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122247/http://www.digitaltvdesignline.com/showArticle.jhtml?printableArticle=true&amp;articleId=184425677|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Samsung]], among others, use this technology in some TV sets to extend the range of displayable colors.{{CN|date=April 2014}} The [[Sharp Aquos]] line of televisions has introduced [[Quattron]] technology, which augments the usual RGB pixel components with a yellow subpixel. However, formats and media supporting these extended color primaries are extremely uncommon.

For storing and working on images, it is possible to use "imaginary" primary colors that are not physically possible so that the triangle does enclose a much larger gamut, so whether more than three primaries results in a difference to the human eye is not yet proven, since humans are primarily [[trichromacy|trichromats]], though [[tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]] exist.{{CN|date=April 2014}}

A '''deep energy retrofit''' is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses "integrative design" to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf |title=New Evidence on the Green Building Rent and Price Premium |publisher=Henley Business School |date=April 3, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-31 |format=PDF |first1=Franz |last1=Fuerst |first2=Patrick |last2=McAllister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "deep energy retrofit" is often used interchangeably with "deep green retrofit" and "deep retrofit". A deep green retrofit may have less focus on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and may emphasize obtaining certification from a green building rating system, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]. The definition of the term continues to be refined and debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scanla |first=Victoria |url=http://www.energycircle.com/blog/2010/03/11/what-deep-energy-retrofit-experts-nesea-conference-respond |title=What is a Deep Energy Retrofit? Experts at the NESEA Conference Respond &amp;#124; Energy Circle PRO |publisher=Energycircle.com |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep energy v. conventional energy retrofits==
Conventional energy retrofits focus on isolated system upgrades (i.e. lighting and HVAC equipment). These retrofits are generally simple and fast, but they often miss opportunity for saving more energy cost-effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhai|first=John|author2=Nicole LeClaire |author3=Michael Bendewald |title=Deep energy retrofit of commercial buildings: a key pathway toward low-carbon cities|journal=Future Science|date=In Press|year=2011|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep energy retrofits achieve much greater energy efficiency by taking a whole-building approach, addressing many systems at once. It is most economical and convenient to take this approach on buildings with overall poor efficiency performance, with multiple systems nearing the end of useful life, and perhaps other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrofitdepot.org/TimingDeepEnergyRetrofit_More |title=Retrofit Depot |publisher=Retrofit Depot |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency measures==
A deep energy retrofit combines energy efficiency measures such as energy efficient equipment, air sealing, moisture management, controlled ventilation, insulation, and solar control so that dramatic energy savings are achieved alongside optimal building performance.

Durability, good interior air quality and energy efficiency are attained by sound building science practices. In a deep energy retrofit, filling a wall cavity with effective insulation also requires careful consideration of how that wall will dry if moisture does happen to get past its skin. Using very high R-value insulation systems on the exterior of the building enclosure is often one of the hallmarks of a deep energy retrofit. Where exactly the dewpoint will fall in (or out) of those thickened walls—and in what climate zone—becomes crucial. Careful detailing, flashing and air sealing of windows and other building penetrations is also key to a successful deep energy retrofit.

Systems thinking is required for these kinds of retrofits, where highly efficient windows are "tuned" to their orientation, and mechanical systems and [[heat recovery ventilation]] units are sized and integrated with how the walls, roof and basement are being air sealed, moisture-managed and insulated.

==Process==
A Level III [[energy audit]], as defined by [[ASHRAE]], is required in order to complete a commercial building deep energy retrofit. Also known as an [[investment grade audit]], this type of energy audit features analysis of the interactions between efficiency strategies and their life cycle cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sud|first=Ish|author2=John Cowan |author3=Richard Pearson |title=Procedures for Commercial Building Energy Audits|year=2004|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1-931862-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon selection and implementation of measures, the energy savings are verified using the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evo-world.org |title=Home |publisher=Evo-world.org |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Deep energy retrofits make use of energy modeling tools that integrate with an organization's pro forma or other financial decision making mechanisms. [[Smartphone]] technologies have simplified the retrofit process as a number of audit and retrofit tools have appeared over the last 5 years to speed up retrofits and maximize efficiency in the field.

==Ratings==
A building that has undergone a deep energy retrofit is well positioned for a green building rating such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].

==Benefits==
There have been a number of studies done to determine and quantify the benefits afforded to owners, tenants, and various other stakeholders from the successful completion of deep energy retrofits.

'''Common owner related benefits include: '''

'''Common benefits to tenants include: '''

*increased productivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Greg Kats, principal author ; Jon Braman &amp; Michael|title=Greening our built world : costs, benefits, and strategies|year=2010|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-59726-668-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*reduced employee sick days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resourcesmart.vic.gov.au/for_businesses_3661.html |title=500 Collins Street case study |publisher=Resourcesmart.vic.gov.au |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable case studies==
===The Empire State Building===
The [[Empire State Building]] is undergoing a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in 2013. Upon completion, the project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], [[Jones Lang LaSalle]], and NYSERDA will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency - Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable achievement of the project is that instead of replacing the chillers as originally planned, the design team were able to first reduce the building’s required cooling capacity by 1600 tons, allowing for a chiller retrofit instead of replacement which would have been $17.3 million more in capital costs.

===The Indianapolis City-County Building===
The City-County Building recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in September 2011. Upon completion, the project team, consisting of representatives from the Indianapolis Marion County Building Authority, Indianapolis Office of Sustainability, Rocky Mountain Institute, and Performance Services will have achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy savings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6637">'''EUCARIS''' (short for '''European Car and Driving License Information System''') is an information exchange system that provides an infrastructure and software to countries to share, among others, their car-  and driving licence-registration information, helping  fight car theft and registration-fraud. EUCARIS is developed by and for governmental authorities and is able to support all kinds of transport related information exchange based on treaties, directives, bi- and multilateral agreements.

== History ==
In the early nineties five European vehicle and driving licence registration authorities (BE, DE, UK, LU and NL) took the initiative to set up a network for data communication and to give European countries the opportunity to share vehicle and driver registration information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eucaris.net/origin-of-eucaris&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is operational since 1994 and used [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]] as main technology for the exchange. In 2007 this system was replaced by the second generation of EUCARIS (a.k.a. EUCARIS II) which uses open standards (XML/Webservice/SOAP). The current EUCARIS software is built using the Microsoft .NET platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eucaris.net/technology|title=Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporting treaties or agreements ==
EUCARIS currently supports the following treaties, council decisions, and bi- or multilateral agreements:

EUCARIS is a multilateral treaty that provides opportunities to countries to share their car and driving licence registration information, helping to fight car theft and registration fraud.

=== Prüm ===
The [[Prüm Convention|Prüm treaty]], also partly adapted by Council Decision 2008/615/JHA&lt;ref name="council1"&gt;{{EUR-Lex link|eurlextag=CELEX:32008D0615:EN:NOT |linktext=Council Decision 2008/615/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008/616/JHA.&lt;ref name="council2"&gt;{{EUR-Lex link|eurlextag=CELEX:32008D0616:EN:NOT |linktext=Council Decision 2008/616/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty and Council Decisions supports cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime.

=== Bilateral information exchange ===
Exchange of vehicle and its owner/holder date for the enforcement of traffic violations, toll collection, etc.

=== eCall ===
[[eCall]] is a project intended to bring rapid assistance to motorists involved in a collision anywhere in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heero-pilot.eu/view/en/home.html|title=HeERO -|first=|last=www.agence-interactiv.com|website=www.heero-pilot.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member states participating in eCall may use the EUCARIS platform for exchanging messages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heero-pilot.eu/ressource/static/files/heero_newsletter_issue1_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; EUCARIS will support eCall from 2012.

=== RESPER ===
RESPER (Réseau permis de conduire / Drivers License Network) is a network to be established across the [[European Union]] which should be fully operational by 19/1/2013. EUCARIS will be able to connect to the RESPER network giving the Member States a choice whether they want to use EUCARIS to exchange driving licence information via RESPER. EUCARIS will support RESPER from 2012.

=== ERRU ===
ERRU (European Register of Road Transport Undertakings) allows competent authorities to better monitor the compliance of road transport undertakings across the [[European Union]] which should be fully operational by 1/1/2013. EUCARIS will be able to connect to the ERRU network giving the Member States a choice whether they want to use EUCARIS to exchange information via ERRU. EUCARIS will support ERRU from 2012.

== Participating member states ==

'''Ethnomethodology''' is the study of methods people use for understanding and producing the [[social order]] in which they live.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream [[sociology|sociological]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (2002) ''Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism'', Rowman &amp; Littleford, Lanham.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, its early investigations led to the founding of [[conversation analysis]], which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see {{section link||Varieties}}).&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, G. (1995) ''Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work'', in Human Studies, 18: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-85312-949-5}}. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.&lt;ref&gt;Rooke, J. &amp; Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ''ethno'' – ''method'' – ''ology'', for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ''ethno'' refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); ''method'' refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ''ology'' refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the "how" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"&gt;Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by [[Harold Garfinkel]], who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"/&gt; His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room ''as a jury''. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of [[Talcott Parsons]]' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of [[Alfred Schutz]], though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]]; and the traditional sociological concern with the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]ian "problem of order".&lt;ref name="annerawls"&gt;Anne Rawls, "Harold Garfinkel", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt; This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. [[John Heritage]] writes, "In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory."&lt;ref&gt;Heritage, J. (1984). ''Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.'' Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and methods==

{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2012}}

Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.&lt;ref name="doug1991"&gt;Doug Maynard &amp; Steve Clayman, "The Diversity of Ethnomethodology", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.({{ISBN|0-7456-0060-3}}). Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory and a multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to ''Ethnomethodology's Program'' might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garf0742516423"&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]] (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-1642-3}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of "member's methods", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"/&gt; It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London&lt;/ref&gt; References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch ([[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Theory]]), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of ''doing'' ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and the point of these investigations is "to discover the things that persons in particular situations ''do'', the methods ''they'' use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; [[Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist)|Michael Lynch]] has noted that: "Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is ''adequate'' to the particular phenomena under study".&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch1989"&gt;Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. &amp; Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson  &amp; R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: "If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so". That is, "...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: "Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements." "The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empricist.  Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the ''unique adequacy requirement''.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate [[agnosticism]], or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of "deviance", analysis of behavior as rule governed, [[role theory]], institutional (de)formations, theories of [[social stratification]], etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the [[indexical]] and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the [[hermeneutic circle]] as the defining "methodology" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"&gt;Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared [[social order]]. For example, [[driving the wrong way]] down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; [[Durkheim]]'s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: "...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a "misreading" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; [[Indexicality]] : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification [[operationalisation]]. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.&lt;ref name="garf1984"&gt;Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a "segment" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a "working consensus" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, "alternate reading", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, "...translate point to point", but, "...instead, they go together."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: "incommensurable."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use "reflexivity" as a synonym for "[[Introspection|self-reflection]]," the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant "to describe the acausal and non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] determination of meaningful action-in-context."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg60u8574h414t0l/ Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. "Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology". ''Qualitative Sociology''. Springer Netherlands. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Reflexivity (social theory)]].
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. [[Garfinkel]] recovered the concept from the work of [[Karl Mannheim]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mannheim]], "On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the "document of", "as pointing to", as "standing on behalf of", a presupposed underlying pattern.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; These "documents" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"/&gt; This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aron Gurwitsch]], The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227&lt;/ref&gt;
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial ([[:wkit:adumbration|adumbrated]]) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual ''noema'', and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.&lt;ref name="Paul Attewell 1974 pp. 179–210"&gt;Attewell, Paul. (1974). "Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel," ''Theory and Society'' '''1'''(2): 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]], Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967). Page: viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mehan &amp; Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-59060-6}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Leiter, ''A Primer of Ethnomethodology''. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-502628-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, "value states", "sentiments", "goal orientations", "mini-max economic theories of behavior", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific "normative order" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the [[facticity]] (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings

==Links with phenomenology==
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}

Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a "phenomenological sensibility",&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and reliable commentators have acknowledged that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology..." (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology.

The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology.

To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being "appropriated" and intentionally "misread" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; These appropriations and methodical "misread[ings]" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a "phenomenological sensibility" or that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7).

Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his "Field of Consciousness" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological ''urtext''): "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
According to [[George Psathas]], five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# ''The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning''. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal ''Studies in Ethnomethodology''.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt;
# ''The organisation of talk-in-interaction''. More recently known as [[conversation analysis]], [[Harvey Sacks]] established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].
# ''Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings''. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# ''The study of work''. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# ''The [[haecceity]] of work''. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman's work.&lt;ref name="doug1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with conversational analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is "inexorably intertwined" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: "Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversational analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;{{rp|143}}

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and "formal analytic" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; The "danger" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversational analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the ''unique adequacy requirement'' of methods.

The '''Flex-Foot Cheetah''' is a [[prosthetic]] human foot replacement developed by [[Biomedical engineering|biomedical engineer]] [[Van Phillips (inventor)|Van Phillips]], who had lost a leg below the knee at age 21; the deficiencies of existing prostheses led him to invent this new prosthesis.

The Flex-Foot Cheetah and similar models are worn by [[Oscar Pistorius]] and other amputee athletes in the [[Paralympics]] and elsewhere. It is made from [[carbon fibre]], and unlike all previous foot prostheses,{{cn|date=February 2013}} it stores kinetic energy from the wearer's steps as potential energy, like a spring, allowing the wearer to run and jump. It is now (as of September 2012) made by [[Össur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Personal Call to a Prosthetic Invention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/sports/olympics/02cheetah.html?ref=sports|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-07-02|publisher=[[New York Times]] | first=Carol | last=Pogash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon fiber is actually a carbon-fiber-reinforced [[polymer]], and is a strong, light-weight material used in a number of applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally [[epoxy]], but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibers may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades, each of which costs between $15,000 and $18,000.&lt;ref name=blades&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/blade.html?pg=2&amp;topic=blade&amp;topic_set=|author=McHugh, Josh|date=March 2007|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Blade Runner|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90 percent of amputee Paralympics runners use a variation of the original Flex-Foot design, as well as thousands of athletes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/phillips.html | title = Inventor of the Week, January 2007: Van Phillips | publisher = [[Lemelson Foundation|Lemelson]]-[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] program | accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bladerunners" seen at the Paralympics who have lost both feet run in the [[T43 (classification)|T43]] class, but runners with one blade and a natural foot run in the [[T44 (classification)|T44]] class.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

A '''footprint''' or '''land pattern''' is the arrangement of [[Contact pad|pads]] (in [[surface-mount technology]]) or through-holes (in [[through-hole technology]]) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref name="ipc7351"&gt;{{cite book | title=IPC-7351 - Generic Requirements for Surface Mount Design and Land Pattern Standard | publisher=IPC | year=2005 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land pattern on a circuit board matches the arrangement of [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] on a component.

Component manufacturers often produce multiple [[Pin compatibility|pin-compatible]] product variants to allow [[Systems integrator|systems integrators]] to change the exact component in use without changing the footprint on the circuit board. This can provide large cost savings for integrators, especially with dense [[Ball Grid Array|BGA]] components where the footprint pads may be connected to multiple [[Printed circuit board#Lamination|layers]] of the circuit board.

[[Image:Submersed Aquatic Veg Model1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|ArcGIS Server website depicting submersed aquatic vegetation.]]
[[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) has become an integral part of [[aquatic science]] and [[limnology]].  Water by its very nature is dynamic.  Features associated with water are thus ever-changing.  To be able to keep up with these changes, technological advancements have given scientists methods to enhance all aspects of scientific investigation, from satellite tracking of wildlife to computer mapping of habitats.  Agencies like the [[US Geological Survey]], [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] as well as other federal and state agencies are utilizing GIS to aid in their conservation efforts.

GIS is being used in multiple fields of aquatic science from [[limnology]], [[hydrology]], aquatic botany, [[stream ecology]], [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]].  Applications include using satellite imagery to identify, monitor and mitigate habitat loss.  Imagery can also show the condition of inaccessible areas.  Scientists can track movements and develop a strategy to locate locations of concern.  GIS can be used to track invasive species, endangered species, and population changes.

One of the advantages of the system is the availability for the information to be shared and updated at any time through the use of web-based data collection.

== GIS and fish ==
[[Image:Sidescan Sonar USGS pub1.JPG|thumb|right|USGS sidescan radar image over base image from Army Corps of Engineers, indicating sturgeon location and river mile.]]
In the past, GIS was not a practical source of analysis due to the difficulty in obtaining spatial data on habitats or organisms in underwater environments.  With the advancement of [[radio telemetry]], hydroacoustic telemetry and [[side-scan sonar]] biologists have been able to track fish species and create databases that can be incorporated into a GIS program to create a geographical representation.  Using radio and hydroacoustic telemetry, biologists are able to locate fish and acquire relatable data for those sites, this data may include [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] samples, temperature, and [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]].  Side-scan sonar allows biologists to map out a river bottom to gain a representation of possible habitats that are used. These two sets of data can be overlaid to delineate the distribution of fish and their habitats for fish.  This method has been used in the study of the [[pallid sturgeon]].

Over a period of time large amounts of data are collected and can be used to track patterns of migration, spawning locations and preferred habitat.  Before, this data would be mapped and overlaid manually.  Now this data can be entered into a GIS program and be layered, organized and analyzed in a way that was not possible to do in the past.  Layering within a GIS program allows for the scientist to look at multiple species at once to find possible watersheds that are shared by these species, or to specifically choose one species for further examination.
The [[US Geological Survey]] (USGS) in, cooperation with other agencies, were able to use GIS in helping map out habitat areas and movement patterns of [[pallid sturgeon]].  At the Columbia Environmental Research Center their effort relies on a customized ArcPad and [[ArcGIS]], both [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] (Environmental Systems Research Institute) applications, to record sturgeon movements to streamline data collection. A relational database was developed to manage tabular data for each individual sturgeon, including initial capture and reproductive physiology.  Movement maps can be created for individual sturgeon.  These maps  help track the movements of each sturgeon through space and time.  This allowed these researchers to prioritize and schedule field personnel efforts to track, map, and recapture sturgeon.

== GIS and macrophytes ==

[[Image:Submersed Aquatic Veg prediction1.JPG|thumb|right|Surveyed (left) and predicted (right) distributions of submersed aquatic vegetation distribution Upper Mississippi River in 1989.

[[Macrophytes]] are an important part of healthy ecosystems.  They provide habitat, refuge, and food for fish, wildlife, and other organisms.  Though natural occurring species are of great interest so are the invasive species that occur alongside these in our environment.  GIS is being used by agencies and their respective resource managers as a tool to model these important macrophyte species.  Through the use of GIS resource managers can assess the distributions of this important aspect of aquatic environments through a spatial and temporal scale.  The ability to track vegetation change through time and space to make predictions about vegetation change are some of the many possibilities of GIS.  Accurate maps of the aquatic plant distribution within an aquatic ecosystem are an essential part resource management. 

It is possible to predict the possible occurrences of aquatic vegetation.  For example, the USGS has created a model for the American wild celery ([[Vallisneria americana]]) by developing a statistical model that calculates the probability of submersed aquatic vegetation.  They established a web link to an Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcGIS Server website *[https://web.archive.org/web/20080827182330/http://umesc-gisdb01.er.usgs.gov/sav_model_p8 Submersed Aquatic Vegetation Model] to make their model predictions available online.  These predictions for distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation can potentially have an effect on foraging birds by creating avoidance zones by humans.  If it is known where these areas are, birds can be left alone to feed undisturbed.  When there are years where the aquatic vegetation is predicted to be limited in these important wildlife habitats, managers can be alerted.

[[Invasive species]] have become a great conservation concern for resource managers.  GIS allows managers to map out plant locations and abundances.  These maps can then be used to determine the threat of these invasive plants and help the managers decide on management strategies.  Surveys of these species can be conducted and then downloaded into a GIS system.  Coupled with this, native species can be included to determine how these communities respond with each other.  By using known data of preexisting invasive species GIS models could predict future outbreaks by comparing biological factors.  The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Species Program (CAES IAPP) is using GIS to evaluate risk factors.  GIS allows managers to [[georeference]] plant locations and abundance.  This allows for managers to display invasive communities alongside native species for study and management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">A HRG [[gyrocompass]] is a [[compass]] and instrument of [[navigation]]. It is the latest generation of maintenance free instrument.

The HRG gyrocompass is a complete unit, which unlike a conventional compass, has no rotating or other moving parts. It uses [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|Hemispherical Resonant gyroscope]], accelerometers and computers to compute [[True north]]. It has an outstanding reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/project/HRG-by-SAFRAN-The-game-changing-technology|title=HRG by SAFRAN The game-changing technology|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its operational [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) values are improved over a [[Fibre optic gyrocompass|Fiber Optic Gyrocompass]] and also conventional mechanical gyrocompass. 
The HRG gyrocompass is also immune to several environmental conditions.

'''Hans Albrecht Bethe''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhans ˈalbʁɛçt ˈbeːtə|lang}}; July 2, 1906&amp;nbsp;– March 6, 2005) was a [[German-American]] [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[physicist]] who made important contributions to [[astrophysics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[solid-state physics]], and won the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=frs&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbm.2007.0018 |title=Hans Albrecht Bethe. 2 July 1906 -- 6 March 2005: Elected ForMemRS 1957 |date=2007 |last1=Lee |first1=S. |last2=Brown |first2=G. E. |journal=[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] |volume=53 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1092-32 |title=Illuminator of the Stars |date=1992 |last1=Horgan |first1=John |journal=Scientific American |volume=267 |issue=4 |pages=32|bibcode = 1992SciAm.267d..32H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his career, Bethe was a professor at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="Keck1947"&gt;Available at www.JamesKeckCollectedWorks.org [http://www.jameskeckcollectedworks.org] are the class notes taken by one of his students at Cornell from the graduate courses on Nuclear Physics and on Applications of Quantum Mechanics he taught in the spring of 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, he was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] which developed the first [[atomic bomb]]s. There he played a key role in calculating the [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] of the weapons and developing the theory behind the [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion method]] used in both the [[Trinity test]] and the "[[Fat Man]]" weapon [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945]].

After the war, Bethe also played an important role in the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with [[Albert Einstein]] and the [[Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists]] against [[nuclear testing]] and the [[nuclear arms race]]. He helped persuade the [[Kennedy administration|Kennedy]] and [[Nixon administration]]s to sign, respectively, the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] and 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] ([[SALT I]]).

His scientific research never ceased and he was publishing papers well into his nineties, making him one of the few scientists to have published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his career{{spaced ndash}}which, in Bethe's case, spanned nearly seventy years. [[Freeman Dyson]], once one of his students, called him the "supreme problem-solver of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="Wark2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Supreme Problem Solver |journal=Nature |date=11 January 2007 |first=David |pages=149 |last=Wark |volume=445|doi=10.1038/445149a |bibcode=2007Natur.445..149W |issue=7124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

Bethe was born in [[Strasbourg]], which was then part of [[Germany]], on July 2, 1906, the only child of Anna (née Kuhn) and Albrecht Bethe, a ''[[privatdozent]]'' of physiology at the [[University of Strasbourg]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=7}} Although his mother, the daughter of a professor at the University of Strasbourg, was [[Jewish]],{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=8}} he was raised a [[Protestant]] like his father.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=32–34}} Despite having a religious background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Hans Bethe by Charles Weiner at Cornell University|url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4504_2.html|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=November 17, 1967|quote=When asked by Charles Weiner if there was religion in his home, Bethe replied: "No. My father was, I think, slightly religious. I was taught to pray in the evening before going to bed, and I attended the Protestant religious instruction, which was given in the schools in Germany. I was also confirmed, and the instruction which I got in this connection got religion out of my system completely. It was never very strong before, and the confirmation had the consequence that I just didn't believe."}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was not religious in later life, and described himself as an [[atheist]].{{sfn|Brian|2001|p=117}}

[[File:Hans Bethe, aged 12.jpg|thumb|left|Hans Bethe, aged 12, with his parents]]
His father accepted a position as professor and director of the Institute of Physiology at the [[University of Kiel]] in 1912, and the family moved into the director's apartment at the Institute. He was initially schooled privately by a professional teacher as part of a group of eight girls and boys.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=30–31}} The family moved again in 1915 when his father became the head of the new Institute of Physiology at the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=32–34}}

Bethe attended the [[Goethe-Gymnasium, Frankfurt|Goethe-Gymnasium]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. His education was interrupted in 1916, when he contracted [[tuberculosis]], and he was sent to [[Bad Kreuznach]] to recuperate. By 1917, he had recovered sufficiently to attend the local ''[[realschule]]'', and the following year he was sent to the ''[[Odenwaldschule]]'', a private, coeducational [[boarding school]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=36–40}} He attended the ''Goethe-Gymnasium'' again for his final three years of secondary schooling, from 1922 to 1924.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=45}}

Having passed his ''[[abitur]]'', Bethe entered the University of Frankfurt in 1924. He decided to major in [[chemistry]]. The instruction in physics was poor, and while there were distinguished mathematicians in Frankfurt like [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]] and [[Otto Szász]], Bethe disliked their approaches, which presented mathematics without reference to the other sciences.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=11–12}} Bethe found that he was a poor experimentalist who destroyed his lab coat by spilling [[sulfuric acid]] on it, but he found the advanced physics taught by the associate professor, [[Walter Gerlach]], more interesting.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=70–73}}  Gerlach left in 1925, and was replaced by [[Karl Meissner]], who advised Bethe that he should go to a university with a better school of theoretical physics, specifically the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], where he could study under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=13}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=93}}

Bethe entered the University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on as a student on Meissner's recommendation.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=118–119}} Sommerfeld taught an advanced course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because he was such a renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s papers on [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=15–16}}

For his [[PhD]] thesis, Sommerfeld suggested that Bethe examine [[electron diffraction]] in [[crystal]]s. As a starting point, Sommerfeld suggested [[Paul Peter Ewald|Paul Ewald]]'s 1914 paper on [[X-ray diffraction]] in crystals. Bethe later recalled that he became too ambitious, and, in pursuit of greater accuracy, his calculations became unnecessarily complicated.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=20–21}}  When he met [[Wolfgang Pauli]] for the first time, Pauli told him: "After Sommerfeld's tales about you, I had expected much better from you than your thesis."{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=142}} "I guess from Pauli," Bethe later recalled, "that was a compliment."{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=142}}

== Early work ==
After Bethe received his doctorate, [[Erwin Madelung]] offered him an assistantship in Frankfurt, and in September 1928 Bethe moved in with his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=156–157}} Bethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' in [[Stuttgart]]. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper,{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=25–27}} ''Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie'' ("The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans |journal=Annalen der Physik |title=Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie |language=German |volume=397 |issue=3 |date=1930 |pages=325–400 |doi=10.1002/andp.19303970303 |bibcode = 1930AnP...397..325B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from [[Max Born]]'s interpretation of the [[Schrödinger equation]], Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a [[Fourier transform]], which is known today as the [[Bethe formula]]. He submitted this paper for his ''[[habilitation]]'' in 1930.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=25–27}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=181}}{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=7}}

Sommerfeld recommended Bethe for a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Travelling Scholarship in 1929. This provided $150 a month (about ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1929|r=0}},000 in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US|group=upper-alpha}}) to study abroad. In 1930, Bethe chose to do postdoctoral work at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, where he worked under the supervision of [[Ralph Fowler]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=182–183}} At the request of [[Patrick Blackett]], who was working with [[cloud chamber]]s, Bethe created a [[Special relativity|relativistic]] version of the Bethe formula.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=187}} Bethe was also known for his sense of humor, and with [[Guido Beck]] and [[Wolfgang Riezler]], two other postdoctoral [[research fellow]]s, created a hoax paper ''On the Quantum Theory of the Temperature of Absolute Zero'' where he calculated the [[fine structure constant]] from the absolute zero temperature in Celsius units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1007/BF01523870 | title= Zuschriften | date= 1931 | last1= Corlin | first1= Axel | last2= Stein | first2= J. S. | last3= Beck | first3= G. | last4= Bethe | first4= H. | last5= Riezler | first5= W. | journal= Die Naturwissenschaften | volume= 19 | issue= 2 | pages= 37|bibcode = 1931NW.....19...37C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper poked fun at a certain class of papers in theoretical physics of the day, which were purely speculative and based on spurious numerical arguments such as [[Arthur Eddington]]'s attempts to explain the value of the [[fine structure constant]] from fundamental quantities in an earlier paper. They were forced to issue an apology.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=190–192}}

For the second half of his scholarship, Bethe chose to go to [[Enrico Fermi]]'s laboratory in Rome in February 1931. He was greatly impressed by Fermi and regretted that he had not gone to Rome first.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=193}}  Bethe developed the [[Bethe ansatz]], a method for finding the exact solutions for the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of certain one-dimensional quantum many-body models.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=199–202}} He was influenced by Fermi's simplicity and Sommerfeld's rigor in approaching problems, and these qualities influenced his own later research.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=195}}

The Rockefeller Foundation offered an extension of Bethe's fellowship, allowing him to return to Italy in 1932.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=202–208}} In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a ''privatdozent''. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including [[Lloyd P. Smith]] from [[Cornell University]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=32}} Bethe accepted a request from [[Karl Scheel]] to write an article for the ''Handbuch der Physik'' on the [[quantum mechanics]] of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, [[Robert Bacher]] and [[Victor Weisskopf]] noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the ''handbuch'' article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called [[solid state physics]]. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=202–208}} His work on the ''handbuch'' articles occupied most of his time in Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, [[quantum electrodynamics]], describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=211, 220–221}}

In 1932, Bethe accepted an appointment as an assistant professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], where [[Hans Geiger]] was the professor of experimental physics.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=33}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=223–224}} One of the first laws passed by the new [[National Socialist]] government was the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]]. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the University, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=35}}

Bethe left Germany in 1933, moving to England after receiving an offer for a position as lecturer at the [[University of Manchester]] for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to [[William Lawrence Bragg]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=35}} He moved in with his friend [[Rudolf Peierls]] and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, and did not have to eat English food.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=237–240}} Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in [[nuclear physics]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=244}} After [[James Chadwick]] and [[Maurice Goldhaber]] discovered the [[photodisintegration]] of [[deuterium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/134237a0 |title=A 'Nuclear Photo-effect': Disintegration of the Diplon by γ-Rays |date=1934 |last1=Chadwick |first1=J. |last2=Goldhaber |first2=M. |journal=Nature |volume=134 |issue=3381 |pages=237|bibcode = 1934Natur.134..237C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls to come up with a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=9}} Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=244}}

In 1933, the physics department at Cornell was looking for a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with [[Nevill Mott]] at the [[University of Bristol]] for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=262–263}} Before leaving for the United States, he visited the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] in September 1934, where he proposed to [[Hilde Levi]], who accepted. However, the match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who did not want him marrying a Jewish girl, despite being Jewish herself, and Bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in December.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=272–275}} [[Niels Bohr]] and [[James Franck]] were so shocked by Bethe's behavior that he was not invited to the Institute again until after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=279}}

== United States ==
Bethe arrived in the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=136}} Bethe's appointment was part of a deliberate effort on the part of the new head of its physics department, [[Roswell Clifton Gibbs]], to move into nuclear physics.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=296–298}} Gibbs had hired [[Milton S. Livingston|Stanley Livingston]], who had worked with [[Ernest Lawrence]], to build a [[cyclotron]] at Cornell.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=296–298}} To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited [[Robert Bacher]]. Bethe received requests to visit [[Columbia University]] from [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], [[Princeton University]] from [[Edward Condon]], [[University of Rochester]] from [[Lee DuBridge]], [[Purdue University]] from [[Karl Lark-Horovitz]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from [[Francis Wheeler Loomis]], and [[Harvard University]] from [[John Hasbrouck Van Vleck]]. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=305–307}}

Together with Bacher and Livingston, Bethe published a series of three articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bethe | first=H. | last2=Bacher |first2=R |authorlink2=Robert Bacher | title=Nuclear Physics. A: Stationary States of Nuclei | date=1936 | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=8 | pages=82–229 | doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.8.82 | bibcode=1936RvMP....8...82B | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bethe | first=H. | title=Nuclear Physics. B: Nuclear Dynamics, Theoretical | date=1937 | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=9 | pages=69–244 | doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.9.69 | bibcode=1937RvMP....9...69B | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bethe | first=H. |last2=Livingston |first2=M.

In this account, he also continued where others left off, filling in gaps in the older literature.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=11}} Loomis offered Bethe a full professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, but Cornell matched the offer, and the salary of $6,000.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=313}} He wrote to his mother:

{{quote|I am about the leading theoretician in America. That does not mean the best. [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] is certainly better and [[Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward Teller|Teller]] probably just as good. But I do more and talk more and that counts too.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=370}} }}

On March 17, 1938, Bethe attended the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] and [[George Washington University]]'s fourth annual Washington Conference of Theoretical Physics. There were only 34 invited attendees, but they included [[Gregory Breit]], [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[George Gamow]],  [[Donald Menzel]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Bengt Strömgren]], [[Edward Teller]] and [[Merle Tuve]]. Bethe initially declined the invitation to attend, because the conference's topic, [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar energy generation]], did not interest him, but Teller persuaded him to come. At the conference, Strömgren detailed what was known about the temperature, density and chemical composition of the Sun, and challenged the physicists to come up with an explanation. Gamow and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] had proposed in a 1937 paper that the Sun's energy was the result of a [[proton–proton chain reaction]]:{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=345–347}}

But this did not account for the observation of elements heavier than helium. By the end of the conference, Bethe, working in collaboration with [[Charles Critchfield]], had come up with a series of subsequent nuclear reactions that explained how the Sun shines:{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=347}}

That this did not explain the processes in heavier stars was not overlooked. At the time there were doubts about whether the proton–proton cycle described the processes in the Sun, but more recent measurements of the Sun's core temperature and luminosity show that it does.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=45–47}} When he returned to Cornell, Bethe studied the relevant [[nuclear reaction]]s and reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]], leading to his discovery of the [[CNO cycle|carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle (CNO cycle)]]:{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=348–350}}

The two papers, one on the proton–proton cycle, co-authored with Critchfield, and the other on the carbon-oxygen-nitrogen (CNO) cycle, were sent to the ''[[Physical Review]]'' for publication.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=351–352}} After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', Bethe's mother had become afraid to remain in Germany. Taking advantage of her Strasbourg origin, she was able to emigrate to the United States in June 1939 on the French quota, rather than the German one, which was full.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=39}} Bethe's graduate student [[Robert Marshak]] noted that the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] was offering a $500 prize for the best unpublished paper on the topic of solar and stellar energy. So Bethe, in need of $250 to release his mother's furniture,  withdrew the CNO cycle paper and sent it in to the New York Academy of Sciences. It won the prize, and Bethe gave Marshak $50 finder's fee and used $250 to release his mother's furniture. The paper was subsequently published in the ''Physical Review'' in March. It was a breakthrough in the understanding of the stars, and would win Bethe the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1967.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Schweber|2012|pp=351–352}} In 2002, at age 96, Bethe sent a handwritten note to [[John N. Bahcall]] congratulating him on the use of solar neutrino observations to show that the CNO cycle accounts for about 7% of the Sun's energy; the neutrino observations had started with [[Raymond Davis Jr.]], whose experiment was based on Bahcall's calculations and encouragement, and led to Davis's receiving a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=149}}

Bethe married Rose Ewald, the daughter of [[Paul Peter Ewald|Paul Ewald]], on September 13, 1939, in a simple civil ceremony.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=54–55}} They had two children, Henry and Monica.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; (Henry was a [[contract bridge]] expert and former husband of [[Kitty Munson Cooper]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Truscott|Truscott, Alan]].

February 24, 1988. Retrieved April 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in March 1941.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=382}} Writing to Sommerfeld in 1947, Bethe confided that "I am much more at home in America than I ever was in Germany. As if I was born in Germany only by mistake, and only came to my true homeland at 28."{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=143}}

[[File:Hans Bethe ID badge.png|right|thumb|Bethe's [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Laboratory]] ID badge]]
When the Second World War began, Bethe wanted to contribute to the war effort,{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=61}} but was unable to work on classified projects until he became a citizen. Following the advice of the [[Caltech]] [[aerodynamicist]] [[Theodore von Kármán]], Bethe collaborated with his friend Teller on a theory of shock waves which are generated by the passage of a projectile through a gas. Bethe considered it one of their most influential papers. He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the Army, making it inaccessible to Bethe, who was not an American citizen at the time.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|pp=13–14}}

After receiving security clearance in December 1941, Bethe joined the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where he invented the [[Bethe-hole directional coupler]], which is used in [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]s such as those used in [[radar]] sets.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=13}} In Chicago in June 1942, and then at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in July,  he participated in a series of meetings at the invitation of Robert Oppenheimer, which discussed the first designs for the [[atomic bomb]]. They went over the preliminary calculations by [[Robert Serber]], [[Stan Frankel]], and others, and discussed the possibilities of using [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]]. Teller then raised the prospect of a thermonuclear device, [[Teller's "Super" bomb]]. At one point Teller asked if the nitrogen in the atmosphere could be set alight. It fell to Bethe and [[Emil Konopinski]] to perform the calculations to prove that this could not occur.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42–47}} "The fission bomb had to be done," he later recalled, "because the Germans were presumably doing it."&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

When Oppenheimer was put in charge of forming a secret weapons design laboratory, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], he appointed Bethe director of the T (Theoretical) Division, the laboratory's smallest but most prestigious division. This move irked the equally qualified but more difficult to manage Teller and [[Felix Bloch]], who had coveted the job.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=92–83}}{{sfn|Szasz|1992|pp=19–20}} A series of disagreements between Bethe and Teller between February and June 1944 over the relative priority of Super research led to Teller's group being removed from T Division and placed directly under Oppenheimer. In September it became part of Fermi's new F Division.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=204, 246}}

Bethe's work at Los Alamos included calculating the [[critical mass]] and efficiency of [[uranium-235]] and the multiplication of [[nuclear fission]] in an exploding atomic bomb. Along with [[Richard Feynman]], he developed a formula for calculating the bomb's explosive yield.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=179–184}} After August 1944, when the laboratory was reorganized and reoriented to solve the problem of the [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium]] bomb, Bethe spent much of his time studying the hydrodynamic aspects of implosion, a job which he continued into 1944.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=129}} In 1945, he worked on the [[neutron]] initiator, and later on radiation propagation from an exploding atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=308–310}} The [[Trinity nuclear test]] validated the accuracy of T Division's results.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=344–345}} When it was detonated in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Bethe's immediate concern was for its efficient operation, and not its moral implications. He is reported to have commented: "I am not a philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=March 8, 2005 |doi=10.1038/news050307-7 |title=Hans Bethe – Nuclear physicist dies at 98 |first=Mark |last=Peplow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen bomb ==
After the war, Bethe argued that a crash project for the [[hydrogen bomb]] should not be attempted, though after President [[Harry Truman]] announced the beginning of such a project, and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], Bethe signed up and played a key role in the weapon's development. Though he would see the project through to its end, Bethe hoped that it would be impossible to create the hydrogen bomb.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=92–96}} He would later remark in 1968 on the apparent contradiction in his stance, having first opposed the development of the weapon and later helping to create it:

{{quote|Just a few months before, the Korean war had broken out, and for the first time I saw direct confrontation with the [[communist]]s. It was too disturbing. The [[cold war]] looked as if it were about to get hot. I knew then I had to reverse my earlier position. If I did not work on the bomb, somebody else would — and I had thought if I were around Los Alamos I might still be a force for disarmament. So I agreed to join in developing the [[H-bomb]]. It seemed quite logical. But sometimes I wish I were a more consistent [[idealist]].{{sfn|Schweber|2000|p=166}} }}

As for his own role in the project, and its relation to the  [[History of the Teller–Ulam design#Ulam's and Teller's contributions|dispute over who was responsible for the design]], Bethe later said that:

{{quote|After the H-bomb was made, reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the [[midwife]].{{sfn|Schweber|2000|p=166}} }}

In 1954, Bethe testified on behalf of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] during the [[Oppenheimer security hearing]]. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which was seen as a key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful [[Teller–Ulam design]] were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince [[Edward Teller]] against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony played a major role in the revocation of Oppenheimer's [[security clearance]]. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the [[Manhattan Project]], and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|pp=97–99}}

== Later work ==

=== Lamb shift ===
[[File:Bethe hans.jpg|thumb|Hans Bethe lecturing at [[Dalhousie University]], 1978.]]
After the war ended, Bethe returned to Cornell. In June 1947, he participated in the [[Shelter Island Conference]]. Sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and held at the Ram's Head Inn on [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Shelter Island, New York]], the conference on the "Foundations of Quantum Mechanics" was the first major physics conference held since the war. It was a chance for American physicists to come together, pick up where they had left off before the war, and establish the direction of post-war research.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=157–158}}{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2009|p=15}}

A major talking point at the conference was the discovery by [[Willis Lamb]] and his graduate student [[Robert Retherford]] shortly before the conference began that one of the two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory; this became known as the [[Lamb shift]]. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of [[quantum fluctuation]]s of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. [[Hans Kramers]] proposed [[renormalization]] as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=H. Bethe| year=1947| title=The Electromagnetic Shift of Energy Levels| journal=[[Physical Review]]| volume=72 | pages=339–341| doi=10.1103/PhysRev.72.339 |bibcode = 1947PhRv...72..339B | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=157–158}}

Bethe managed to work it out on the train from New York to [[Schenectady]]. He arrived at a value of 1040&amp;nbsp;MHz, extremely close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the ''Physical Review'' in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=158–159}}
One of Bethe's most famous papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 [[Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alpher |first1=R. A. |authorlink1=Ralph Asher Alpher |first2=H. |last2=Bethe |authorlink2=Hans Bethe |first3=G. |last3=Gamow |authorlink3=George Gamow |date=1 April 1948 |url=http://www.snolab.ca/public/JournalClub/michael1.pdf |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |title=The Origin of Chemical Elements |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=803–804 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.803 |bibcode=1948PhRv...73..803A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HxCbSd5r?url=http://www.snolab.ca/public/JournalClub/michael1.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Gamow]] added Bethe's name (in absentia) without consulting him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against [[Ralph Alpher]]'s wishes. This was apparently a reflection of Gamow's sense of humor, wanting to have a paper title that would sound like the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. As one of the ''Physical Review''{{'}}s reviewers, Bethe saw the manuscript and struck out the words "in absentia".{{sfn|Bernstein|1980|p=46}}


=== Astrophysics ===
Bethe believed that the [[atomic nucleus]] was like a [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|quantum liquid drop]]. He investigated the [[nuclear matter]] problem by considering the work done by [[Keith Brueckner]] on [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Working with [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], he produced a solution for the case where there was an infinite hard-core potential. Then, working with Baird Brandow and Albert Petschek, he came up with an approximation that converted the [[scattering theory|scattering]] equation into an easily  solved [[differential equation]]. This then led him to the Bethe-Faddeev equation, a generalisation of [[Ludvig Faddeev]]'s approach to three-body scattering. He then used these techniques to examine the [[neutron stars]], which have densities similar to those of nuclei.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=165–171}}

Bethe continued to do research on [[supernovae]], neutron stars, [[black holes]], and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with [[Gerald E. Brown]] of [[Stony Brook University]]. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar [[gravitational collapse]], and the way in which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Gerald%20E%2E%20Brown&amp;year=2001 |title=Hans A. Bethe Prize winners |publisher=American Physical Society |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=176–180}}

At age 85, Bethe wrote an important article about the [[solar neutrino problem]], in which he helped establish the conversion mechanism for [[electron neutrino]]s into [[muon neutrino]]s  proposed by [[Stanislav Mikheyev]], [[Alexei Yuryevich Smirnov|Alexei Smirnov]] and [[Lincoln Wolfenstein]] to explain a vexing discrepancy between theory and experiment. Bethe argued that physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] was required to understand the solar neutrino problem, because it assumed that neutrinos have no mass, and therefore cannot metamorphosize into each other; whereas the MSW effect required this to occur. Bethe hoped that corroborating evidence would be found by the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) in [[Ontario, Canada]], by his 90th birthday, but he did not get the call from SNO until June 2001, when he was nearly 95.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|pp=151–153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.N. |last=Bahcall |authorlink=John N.

In 1996, [[Kip Thorne]] approached Bethe and Brown about [[LIGO]], the  Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, designed to detect the gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes. Since Bethe and Brown were good at calculating things that could not be seen, could they look at the mergers? The 90-year-old Bethe quickly became enthused, and soon began the required calculations. The result was a 1998 paper on the "Evolution of Binary Compact Objects Which Merge", which Brown regarded as the best that the two produced together.{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=182}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Astrophysical Journal |issue=2 |volume=506 |pages=780–789 |date=1998 |doi=10.1086/306265 |arxiv = astro-ph/9802084 |bibcode = 1998ApJ...506..780B |title=Evolution of Binary Compact Objects That Merge |last1=Bethe |first1=Hans A. |last2=Brown |first2=G.

== Political stances ==
[[File:Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005).jpg|thumb|Bethe being interviewed by journalists]]
In 1968, Bethe, along with IBM physicist [[Richard Garwin]], published an article criticising in detail the anti-[[ICBM]] defense system proposed by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Garwin | first=R.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Bethe campaigned for the peaceful use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Bethe was part of a committee of experts that analysed the incident. They concluded that the reactor suffered from a fundamentally faulty design and human error also had significantly contributed to the accident. "My colleagues and I established," he explained "that the Chernobyl disaster tells us about the deficiencies of the Soviet political and administrative system rather than about problems with nuclear power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/readings/chernobyl.html |first=Richard |last=Rhodes |authorlink=Richard Rhodes |title=Chernobyl |publisher=PBS |accessdate=July 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life Bethe remained a strong advocate for electricity from nuclear energy, which he described in 1977 as "a necessity, not merely an option."{{sfn|Brown|Lee|2006|p=266}}

In the 1980s he and other physicists opposed the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] missile system conceived by the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration.{{sfn|Bethe|1991|pp=113–131}} In 1995, at the age of 88, Bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to "cease and desist" from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_bethe-hans.htm |title=Hans Albrecht Bethe |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he joined 47 other [[Nobel laureate]]s in signing a letter endorsing [[John Kerry]] for President of the United States as someone who would "restore science to its appropriate place in government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/kerry/kerrynobel062104.html |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |title=48 Nobel Winning Scientists Endorse Kerry-June 21, 2004 |accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent investors include: Mark Benioff, SV Angel, FirstMark, Khosla Ventures, and GV (formerly Google Ventures).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Helium's 'Atom' Radio module, which forms the core hardware component of its networking capability, contains a [[dual-band]], [[IEEE 802.15.4|802.15.4]] modem, an [[Atmel]] ATECC508A [[Security token|security key]] component.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/02/helium_internet_of_things_platform/|title=Helium has a go at Internet of Things thing – using ultra-low power tech|last=|first=|date=2015-11-02|website=[[The Register]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new offering was positioned as a way for developers to streamline the ability to prototype, deploy and scale a long-range wireless network that connects thousands of end devices, and gives companies a simple way to deliver data from device to the cloud and application layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/helium-tackles-the-connectivity-problem-in-iot-300490443.html|title=Helium Tackles the Connectivity Problem in IoT|last=Helium|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous use of Helium.com==
Helium.com was founded in 2006 as a Yahoo! Answers-style website created from user generated content paid on a revenue sharing model. Over time the site evolved from short answers to stand-alone articles, and began to offer writers the opportunity to earn from selling articles as well as passive income. The sale of articles to businesses and publishers is now its primary business, and the revenue share arm has closed to new members, effective May 21, 2014. The sites which display revenue share articles will be closed down on December 15, 2014.

The site was acquired by Helium Systems and is defunct now.

===History===
Beginning life as HeliumKnowledge.com, Helium.com was launched in October 2006. Its original format was similar to [[Yahoo! Answers]], with contributors answering questions with short, informative answers. Over time, the length of articles increased and they became stand-alone articles instead of answers to questions.

Helium originally pitched itself as an alternative to [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchenginejournal.com/heliumcom-about-yahoo-answers-wikipedia-all-rolled-into-one/3890/ Search Engine Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;   For writers, Helium's marketing focused on the opportunity to earn [[passive income]] in perpetuity.  Then Helium began to enter partnerships with publishers, enabling writers to compete to sell articles to those publishers.

[[R.R. Donnelley]] purchased Helium.com in 2011 to expand its online presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | title = R.R.

'''Juris Zarins (Zariņš)''' (born 1945, in Germany) is an American-Latvian archaeologist and professor at [[Missouri State University]], who specializes in the [[Middle East]].

Zarins is ethnically Latvian, but was born in Germany at the end of the [[Second World War]].  His parents emigrated to the United States soon after he was born.  He graduated from high school in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1963 and earned a B.A. in anthropology from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1967.  He served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam before completing his Ph.D. in Ancient Near Eastern Languages and Archaeology at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1974.  He then served as archaeological adviser to the Department of Antiquities of the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] before coming to Missouri State in 1978.

He discussed Ubar in a 1996 NOVA interview saying "There's a lot of confusion about that word. If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy's second century map of the area. It says in big letters "Iobaritae" And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/  Interview with Dr J. Zarins, Nova Online, Sept. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, following further research and excavation, a paper partly authored by him offered a different view of the meaning of the name "Ubar":&lt;ref&gt;Blom, R., Crippen, R., Elachi, C., Clapp, N., Hedges, G., Zarins, J., "Southern Arabian Desert Trade Routes, Frankincense, Myrrh, and the Ubar Legend" in Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that "Ubar" was more likely to have been a region—the "Land of the Iobaritae" identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawton|first1=John|title=Oman: Frankincense|journal=Aramco World|date=May–June 1983|volume=34|issue=3|pages=26–27|url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-frankincense.htm|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods.

Zarins has published many articles on a number of topics concerning the archaeology of the Near East, which include the [[domestication of the horse]], early pastoral nomadism, and the obsidian, indigo, and frankincense trades.  He received an Excellence in Research Award from Missouri State in 1988.  He has proposed that the Semitic languages arose as a result of a circum Arabian nomadic pastoral complex, which developed in the period of the desiccation of climates at the end of the pre-pottery phase in the Ancient Near East.

Zarins argued that the [[Garden of Eden]] was situated at the head of the Persian Gulf, where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run into the sea, from his research on this area using information from many different sources, including [[LANDSAT]] images from space. In this theory, the Bible's [[Gihon|Gihon River]] would correspond with the [[Karun River]] in Iran, and the [[Pishon|Pishon River]] would correspond to the [[Wadi al-Rummah|Wadi Batin river system]] that once drained the now dry, but once quite fertile central part of the Arabian Peninsula. His suggestion about the Pishon River is supported by James A. Sauer (1945–1999) formerly of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research|American Center of Oriental Research]]&lt;ref&gt;James A. Sauer, "The River Runs Dry," Biblical Archaeology Review, Vol. 22, No. 4, July/August 1996, pp. 52–54, 57, 64&lt;/ref&gt; although strongly criticized by the archaeological community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''''Leersia hexandra''''' is a species of [[grass]] known by the common names '''southern cutgrass''', '''clubhead cutgrass''', and '''swamp rice grass'''.&lt;ref name=pier&gt;[http://www.hear.org/pier/species/leersia_hexandra.htm ''Leersia hexandra''.] Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER).&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[pantropical]] distribution.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[introduced species]] in many regions, sometimes becoming [[invasive species|invasive]], and it is an [[weed|agricultural weed]] of various crops,&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; especially [[rice]].&lt;ref name=cabi&gt;CABI. (2013). [http://www.cabi.org/isc/?compid=5&amp;dsid=30391&amp;loadmodule=datasheet&amp;page=481&amp;site=144 ''Leersia hexandra''.] In: Invasive Species Compendium. Wallingford, UK: CAB International.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also cultivated as a [[forage]] for [[livestock]].&lt;ref name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/AGPC/doc/Gbase/data/pf000269.htm ''Leersia hexandra''.] FAO.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This species is a perennial grass growing from [[rhizome]]s and [[stolon]]s. The hollow stems are decumbent and creeping and root easily where their nodes contact the substrate. They produce erect shoots that can exceed one meter tall.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt;&lt;ref name=china&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200025647 ''Leersia hexandra''.] Flora of China.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[aquatic plant|aquatic]] or semi-aquatic grass, and the erect stem parts may float in water.&lt;ref name=gm&gt;Pyrah, G. L. [http://herbarium.usu.edu/webmanual/info2.asp?name=Leersia_hexandra+&amp;type=treatment ''Leersia hexandra''.] Grass Manual. Flora of North America.&lt;/ref&gt; These stems can grow densely in aquatic habitat and become matted, forming what are often referred to as "carpets".&lt;ref name=pier/&gt;&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/flora/fwta8882 ''Leersia hexandra''.] In: ''Flora of West Tropical Africa'' vol. 3, part 2. 1972. JSTOR Global Plants.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaf sheath has a fleshy base covered in white hairs and the [[ligule]] can be stiff and dry,&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; becoming "papery".&lt;ref name=fl&gt;[http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/node/225 ''Leersia hexandra''.] Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. University of Florida IFAS.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves have sharp-pointed blades up to 30 centimeters long which are flat or rolled, the edges sometimes rolling at night or when the blade dries.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; The blades are sometimes hairless,&lt;ref name=gm/&gt; but are usually coated in very rough hairs, making them so rough to the touch that they are "unpleasant to handle".&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; They also have very sharp edges,&lt;ref name=fl/&gt; and the midrib has backward-facing, spiny hairs that give it a cutting edge. The "retrorsely spinulose midrib of the leaf can inflict most painful lacerations".&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

The [[panicle]] is narrow or spreading and erect or nodding, and up to about 12 centimeters long. The branches are almost fully lined with overlapping spikelets each up to half a centimeter long.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; The spikelets may be greenish or purplish in color,&lt;ref name=china/&gt; or sometimes tinged with orange or brick red.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; They are surrounded by white or purplish [[bract]]s that have characteristic comb-like hairs along their greenish nerves.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; The flower has six [[stamen]]s.&lt;ref name=china/&gt; After the spikelets fall, the panicle branches have a zig-zag shape.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; Fertile seed is rarely produced and the grass commonly [[vegetative reproduction|reproduces vegetatively]] by sprouting from the rhizome or the nodes on the stem.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; Large stands of the grass are often clones.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

This grass looks very similar to rice and other species of the genus ''[[Oryza]]''. It is a member of the rice tribe [[Oryzeae]] and sometimes grows in [[paddy field|rice paddies]].&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

==Ecology==
This plant grows in shallow [[fresh water|freshwater]] habitat and on wet and moist land. It can be found in [[marsh]]es, [[swamp]]s, ponds, [[irrigation]] ditches, flooded rice fields, and on other moist agricultural land and [[floodplain]]s. It is mostly [[tropics|tropical]], but it can grow in some [[temperate climate]]s.&lt;ref name=pier/&gt; It can persist for a time in drier conditions during [[drought]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

The grass provides food and shelter for animals. Many [[water bird]]s feed on it.&lt;ref name=fl/&gt; In [[Tanzania]] it is a [[dominance (ecology)|dominant]] plant in the swamps where the [[shoebill]] (''Balaeniceps rex'') and [[wattled crane]] (''Bugeranus carunculatus'') build their nests.&lt;ref&gt;John, J. R., et al. (2012). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.12023/full Observations on nesting of shoebill ''Balaeniceps rex'' and wattled crane ''Bugeranus carunculatus'' in Malagarasi wetlands, western Tanzania.] ''African Journal of Ecology'' 51(1), 184-87.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Llanos]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] it is the second most important food of the resident herds of [[capybara]] (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris''), composing up to 29% of their diet.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

It is one of the two host plants of the [[brown planthopper]] (''Nilaparvata lugens''), the other being cultivated rice. While it has been observed on many other plant species, it can only complete its life cycle on cutgrass or rice. There are two strains of the planthopper, one that only lays eggs on rice and one that favors cutgrass; the rice strain does not effectively reproduce on cutgrass and vice versa, even when [[sympatry|sympatric]]. While they can be crossed in laboratory tests, the two strains do not interbreed in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Sezer, M. and R. K. Butlin. (1998). [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1413/2399.full.pdf The genetic basis of oviposition preference differences between sympatric host races of the brown planthopper (''Nilaparvata lugens'').] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences'' 265(1413), 2399-2405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a weed==
[[File:Leersia hexandra spikelets.jpg|thumb|right|Spikelets]]
The grass is a weed of several crops, including [[Camellia sinensis|tea]], [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]], [[maize]], and [[sugarcane]], but especially rice. It is a relative of the rice plant and it thrives in paddy fields. Its vegetation "carpets" clog irrigation waterways, causing flooding and erosion. It hosts many rice [[pest (organism)|pests]], including the brown planthopper, the [[Nilaparvata bakeri|green planthopper]] (''Nilaparvata bakeri''), the [[Nephotettix malayanus|green rice leafhopper]] (''Nephotettix malayanus''), the [[Orseolia oryzae|rice gall midge]] (''Orseolia oryzae''), and the moth ''[[Helcystogramma arotraeum]]''.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; It hosts the [[Ditylenchus angustus|rice stem nematode]], which causes [[ufra disease]] of rice.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; It is susceptibe to many [[plant virus]]es that infect rice plants, such as [[rice grassy stunt virus]], [[rice transitory yellowing virus]], and [[Rice tungro bacilliform virus|rice tungro virus]].&lt;ref&gt;Abo, M. E. and A. A. Sy. (1997). [https://ag.udel.edu/enwc/research/delphacid/species/documents/aboandsy1997ricevirusdiseases.pdf Rice virus diseases: epidemiology and management strategies.] ''Journal of Sustainable Agriculture'' 11(2-3), 113-34.&lt;/ref&gt; It is susceptible to [[fungus|fungi]] such as pathogenic ''[[Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae|Xanthomonas oryzae]]'', which causes [[blight|leaf blight]] of rice, and ''[[Cochliobolus miyabeanus]]'', which causes brown spot.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

==Uses==
Despite its sharp leaf edges, the grass is palatable to [[cattle]] and it is maintained as a [[pasture]] grass on swampy land and cut for [[hay]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

This species is a [[hyperaccumulator]] of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], with the ability to take up large amounts of [[chromium]], [[copper]], and [[nickel]] from water and soil.&lt;ref name=you&gt;You, S., et al. (2013).

'''Low-level design''' (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step [[refinement (computing)|refinement]] process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms. Overall, the data organization may be defined during requirement analysis and then refined during data design work. Post-build, each component is specified in detail.&lt;ref name="Pressman2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger S. |last=Pressman|title=Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bL7QZHtWvaUC}}|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-07-301933-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LLD phase is the stage where the actual software components are designed.

During the detailed phase the logical and functional design is done and the design of application structure is developed during the high-level design phase.

A design is the order of a system that connects individual components. Often, it can interact with other systems. Design is important to achieve high reliability, low cost, and good maintain-ability.&lt;ref name="BellMorrey1997"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Doug |last1=Bell|first2=Ian |last2=Morrey|first3=John R. |last3=Pugh|title=The Essence of Program Design|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=893K9g5JNn8C}}|year=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-367806-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
We can distinguish two types of program design phases:

* Architectural or [[high-level design]]
* Detailed or low-level design

[[Flowchart|Structured flow charts]] and [[HIPO model|HIPO]] diagrams typify the class of [[software design tools]] and these provide a high-level overview of a program. The advantages of such a design tool is that it yields a design specification that is understandable to nonprogrammers and it provides a good pictorial display of the module dependencies.

A disadvantage is that it may be difficult for software developers to go from graphic-oriented representation of software design to implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to provide little insight into the algorithmic structure describing procedural steps to facilitate the early stages of software development (generally using [[Program Design Language|PDL]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Program Design Languages (PDLs): Brian A. Nejmeh, Herbert E. Dunsmore&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The goal of LLD or a low-level design document (LLDD) is to give the internal logical design of the actual program code. Low-level design is created based on the high-level design. LLD describes the class diagrams with the methods and relations between classes and program specs. It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document.

A good low-level design document makes the program easy to develop when proper analysis is utilized to create a low-level design document. The code can then be developed directly from the low-level design document with minimal debugging and testing.
Other advantages include lower cost and easier maintenance.

== Sample ==
You can find an example of HLD here: [http://www.agiledata.org/essays/agileDataModeling.html#Figure1 Sample HLD], after iterations that was initially developed as LLD:[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/agileDataModeling.html#Iteration6 Sample LLD].

The '''modified Harvard architecture''' is a variation of the [[Harvard architecture|Harvard computer architecture]] that allows the contents of the instruction memory to be accessed as if it were data. Most modern computers that are documented as Harvard architecture are, in fact, modified Harvard architecture.

== Harvard architecture ==
{{main article|Harvard architecture}}
The original Harvard architecture computer, the [[Harvard Mark I]], employed entirely separate memory systems to store instructions and data. The [[CPU]] fetched the next instruction and loaded or stored data simultaneously and independently. This is in contrast to a [[von Neumann architecture]] computer, in which both instructions and data are stored in the same memory system and (without the complexity of a [[CPU cache]]) must be accessed in turn. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. With [[microcontroller]]s (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. [[flash memory]]) and data (typically [[Read-write memory|read/write memory]]) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different [[address space]]s. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a von Neumann machine); it is also necessary to know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.

== Von Neumann architecture ==
{{main article | Von Neumann architecture }}
A computer with a von Neumann architecture has the advantage over ''pure'' Harvard machines in that code can also be accessed and treated the same as data, and vice versa. This allows, for example, data to be read from [[disk storage]] into memory and then executed as code, or self-optimizing software systems using technologies such as [[just-in-time compilation]] to write machine code into their own memory and then later execute it. Another example is [[self-modifying code]], which allows a program to modify itself. A disadvantage of these methods are issues with [[executable space protection]], which increase the risks from [[malware]] and software defects. In addition, in these systems it is notoriously difficult to document code flow, and also can make debugging much more difficult.

== Modified Harvard architecture ==
Accordingly, some pure Harvard machines are specialty products. Most modern computers instead implement a ''modified'' Harvard architecture. Those modifications are various ways to loosen the strict separation between code and data, while still supporting the higher performance concurrent data and instruction access of the Harvard architecture.

===Split-cache (or almost-von-Neumann) architecture===
The most common modification builds a [[memory hierarchy]] with a [[CPU cache]] separating instructions and data. This unifies all except small portions of the data and instruction address spaces, providing the von Neumann model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ithare.com/modified-harvard-architecture-clarifying-confusion/ Modified Harvard Architecture: Clarifying Confusion]&lt;/ref&gt; Most programmers never need to be aware of the fact that the processor core implements a (modified) Harvard architecture, although they benefit from its speed advantages. Only programmers who write instructions into data memory need to be aware of issues such as [[cache coherency]].

=== Instruction-memory-as-data architecture ===
Another change preserves the "separate address space" nature of a Harvard machine, but provides special machine operations to access the contents of the instruction memory as data. Because data is not directly executable as instructions, such machines are not always viewed as "modified" Harvard architecture:
* Read access: initial data values can be copied from the instruction memory into the data memory when the program starts. Or, if the data is not to be modified (it might be a constant value, such as [[pi]], or a [[String (computer science)|text string]]), it can be accessed by the running program directly from instruction memory without taking up space in data memory (which is often at a premium).
* Write access: a capability for reprogramming is generally required; few computers are purely [[Read-only memory|ROM]]-based. For example, a [[microcontroller]] usually has operations to write to the [[flash memory]] used to hold its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmel.com/images/doc1644.pdf|title=AVR109: Self Programming|type=Application note|date=June 2004|publisher=Atmel|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capability may be used for purposes including software updates.   [[EEPROM]]/PROM replacement is an alternative method.

=== Data-memory-as-instruction architecture ===
A few Harvard architecture processors, such as the MAXQ, can execute instructions fetched from any memory segment &amp;ndash; unlike the original Harvard processor, which can only execute instructions fetched from the program memory segment.
Such processors, like other Harvard architecture processors &amp;ndash; and unlike pure von Neumann architecture &amp;ndash; can read an instruction and read a data value simultaneously, if they're in separate memory segments, since the processor has (at least) two separate memory segments with independent data buses.
The most obvious programmer-visible difference between this kind of modified Harvard architecture and a pure von Neumann architecture is that &amp;ndash; when executing an instruction from one memory segment &amp;ndash; the same memory segment cannot be simultaneously accessed as data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/MAXQUG MAXQ Family User's Guide]. Sections 1.2 "Harvard Memory Architecture" and 2.5 "Pseudo-Von Neumann Memory Access".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konark Goel ''et al.'' [https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-12/txt00149.txt About MAXQ GCC port].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons ==
Three characteristics may be used to distinguish modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard and von Neumann machines:
; Instruction and data memories occupy different address spaces
For pure Harvard machines, there is an address "zero" in instruction space that refers to an instruction storage location and a separate address "zero" in data space that refers to a distinct data storage location. By contrast, von Neumann and split-cache modified Harvard machines store both instructions and data in a single address space, so address "zero" refers to only one location and whether the binary pattern in that location is interpreted as an instruction or data is defined by how the program is written. However, just like pure Harvard machines, instruction-memory-as-data modified Harvard machines have separate address spaces, so have separate addresses "zero" for instruction and data space, therefore this does not distinguish this type of modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard machines.
; Instruction and data memories have separate hardware pathways to the central processing unit (CPU)
This is the point of pure or modified Harvard machines, and why they co-exist with the more flexible and general von Neumann architecture: separate memory pathways to the CPU allow instructions to be fetched and data to be accessed at the same time, improving throughput. The pure Harvard machines have separate pathways with separate address spaces. Split-cache modified Harvard machines have such separate access paths for CPU caches or other tightly coupled memories, but a unified address space covers the rest of the [[memory hierarchy]]. A von Neumann processor has only that unified address space. From a programmer's point of view, a modified Harvard processor in which instruction and data memories share an address space is usually treated as a von Neumann machine until cache coherency becomes an issue, as with [[self-modifying code]] and program loading. This can be confusing, but such issues are usually visible only to [[System programming|systems programmers]] and [[System integration|integrators]].{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} Other modified Harvard machines are like pure Harvard machines in this regard.
; Instruction and data memories may be accessed in different ways
The original Harvard machine, the [[Harvard Mark I|Mark I]], stored instructions on a [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]] and data in electro-mechanical counters. This, however, was entirely due to the limitations of technology available at the time. Today a Harvard machine such as the [[PIC microcontroller]] might use 12-bit wide [[flash memory]] for instructions, and 8-bit wide [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] for data. In contrast, a von Neumann microcontroller such as an [[ARM7TDMI]], or a modified Harvard [[ARM9]] core, necessarily provides uniform access to flash memory and SRAM (as 8 bit bytes, in those cases).

== Modern uses of the modified Harvard architecture ==
Outside of applications where a cacheless [[digital signal processors|DSP]] or [[microcontroller]] is required, most modern processors have a [[CPU cache]] which partitions instruction and data.

There are also processors which are Harvard machines by the most rigorous definition (that program and data memory occupy different address spaces), and are only ''modified'' in the weak sense that there are operations to read and/or write program memory as data. For example, LPM (Load Program Memory) and SPM (Store Program Memory) instructions in the [[Atmel AVR]] implement such a modification. Similar solutions are found in other microcontrollers such as the [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] and [[Z8 Encore!|Z8Encore!]], many families of digital signal processors such as the [[Texas Instruments TMS320|TI C55x cores]], and more. Because instruction execution is still restricted to the program address space, these processors are very unlike von Neumann machines.

Having separate address spaces creates certain difficulties in programming with high-level languages that do not directly support the notion that tables of read-only data might be in a different address space from normal writable data (and thus need to be read using different instructions). The [[C programming language]] can support multiple address spaces either through non-standard extensions{{efn|The maintainers of the standard C library for the GCC port to the Atmel AVR microcontroller, which has separate address spaces for code and data, state in ''[http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/pgmspace.html Data in Program Space]'' that separate address spaces imply a Harvard architecture. They go on to explain that the C language only has one pointer address space, and thus was not designed for Harvard architecture machines. They then describe the non-standard extensions adopted by GCC for the AVR and the AVR C library to allow access to data stored in instruction (program) memory. They even explain why the const keyword cannot be pressed into service to distinguish data objects to be placed in instruction memory.}} or through the now standardized [[Embedded C|extensions to support embedded processors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8671">'''Optoelectrowetting''' (OEW) is a method of liquid droplet manipulation used in [[microfluidics]] applications. This technique builds on the principle of [[electrowetting]], which has proven useful in liquid actuation due to fast switching response times and low power consumption. Where traditional electrowetting runs into challenges, however, such as in the simultaneous manipulation of multiple droplets, OEW presents a lucrative alternative that is both simpler and cheaper to produce. OEW surfaces are easy to fabricate, since they require no [[lithography]], and have real-time, reconfigurable, large-scale manipulation control, due to its reaction to light intensity.

== Theory ==
The traditional electrowetting mechanism has been receiving increasing interest due to its ability to control tension forces on a liquid droplet.  As surface tension acts as the dominant liquid actuation force in nano-scale applications, electrowetting has been used to modify this tension at the solid-liquid interface through the application of an external voltage. The applied electric field causes a change in the contact angle of the liquid droplet, and in turn changes the surface tensions across the droplet.  Precise manipulation of the electric field allows control of the droplets. The droplet is placed on an insulating substrate located in between an electrode.

[[File:OEW diagram.png|thumb|right|Optoelectrowetting against traditional electrowetting diagram]]

The optoelectrowetting mechanism adds a photoconductor underneath the conventional electrowetting circuit, with an AC power source attached.  Under normal (dark) conditions, the majority of the system's impedance lies in the photoconducting region, and therefore the majority of the voltage drop occurs here. However, when light is shined on the system, [[carrier generation and recombination]] causes the conductivity of the photoconductor spikes and results in a voltage drop across the insulating layer, changing the contact angle as a function of the voltage.  The contact angle between a liquid and electrode can be described as:&lt;ref&gt;Need citation&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos\big(\theta(V_A)\big) = \cos\big(\theta(0)\big) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\epsilon}{d \gamma_{LV}}\right)V_A^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d'', ε, and γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; are applied voltage, thickness of the insulation layer, dielectric constant of the insulation layer, and the interfacial tension constant between liquid and gas.  In AC situations, such as OEW, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced with the ''RMS'' voltage.  It should also be noted that the frequency of the AC power source is adjusted so that the impedance of the photoconductor dominates in the dark state.  The shift in the voltage drop across the insulating layer therefore reduces the contact angle of the droplet as a function of the light intensity.  By shining an optical beam on one edge of a liquid droplet, the reduced contact angle creates a pressure difference throughout the droplet, and pushes the droplet's center of mass towards the illuminated side.  Control of the optical beam results in control of the droplet's movement.

Using 4&amp;nbsp;mW laser beams, OEW has proven to move droplets of deionized water at speeds of 7mm/s.

Traditional electrowetting runs into problems because it requires a two-dimensional array of electrodes for droplet actuation.  The large number of electrodes leads to complexity for both control and packaging of these chips, especially for droplet sizes of smaller scales. While this problem can be solved through integration of electronic decoders, the cost of the chip would significantly increase.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Michael G., Richard B. Fair, and Alexander D. Shenderov.

==Single-sided Continuous Optoelectrowetting (SCOEW)==
Droplet manipulation in electrowetting-based devices are usually accomplished using two parallel plates which sandwiches the droplet and is actuated by digital electrodes. The minimum droplet size that can be manipulated is determined by the size of pixilated electrodes. This mechanism provides a solution to the size limitation of physical pixilated electrodes by utilizing dynamic and reconfigurable optical patterns and enables operations such as continuous transport, splitting, merging, and mixing of droplets. SCOEW is conducted on open, featureless, and photoconductive surfaces. This configuration creates a flexible interface that allows simple integration with other microfluidic components, such as sample reservoirs through simple tubing.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Sung-Yong, Michael A. Teitell, and Eric P. Y. Chiou.

&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Optoelectrowetting using a photocapacitance==
Optoelectrowetting can also be achieved using the [[Photodiode|photocapacitance]] in a [[Electrolyte–insulator–semiconductor sensor|liquid-insulator-semiconductor junction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111207/srep00184/full/srep00184.html S. Arscott, 'Moving liquids with light: Photoelectrowetting on semiconductors', ''Sci. Rep.'' '''1''', 184, (2011). Scientific Reports: Nature Publishing Group.]&lt;/ref&gt; The photo-sensitive electrowetting is achieved via optical modulation of [[charge carrier|carriers]] in the [[space charge]] region at the insulator-semiconductor junction which acts as a [[photodiode]] – similar to a [[charge-coupled device]] based on a [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]].

==Types of applications==

===Clinical diagnostics===
Electrowetting presents a solution to one of the most challenging tasks in [[lab-on-a-chip]] systems in its ability to handle and manipulate complete physiological compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan, Vijay, Vamsee K. Pamula, and Richard B. Fair. "[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2004/lc/b403341h An integrated digital microfluidic lab-on-a-chip for clinical diagnostics on human physiological fluids.]" Lab on a Chip 4.4 (2004): 310. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional microfluidic systems aren't easily adaptable to handle different compounds, requiring reconfiguration that often results in the device being impractical as a whole.  Through OEW, a chip with one power source can be readily used with a variety of substances, with potential for multiplexed detection.

[[File:Talbruecke-Bruenn-4 2005-08-04.jpg|thumb|Formwork (shuttering) for a pile cap]]
A '''pile cap''' is a thick [[concrete]] mat that rests on concrete or timber piles that have been driven into soft or unstable ground to provide a suitable stable foundation. It usually forms part of the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of a building, typically a multi-story building, structure or support base for heavy equipment. The cast [[concrete]] pile cap distributes the load of the building into the [[deep foundation|piles]]. A similar structure to a pile cap is a "raft", which is a concrete foundation floor resting directly onto soft soil which may be liable to [[subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|title=PILE INSTALLATION METHODS|publisher=School of the Built Environment, Napier University, Edinburgh 15 November 2005|accessdate=15 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030505003515/http://www.sbe.napier.ac.uk/projects/piledesign/guide/chapter8.htm|archivedate=5 May 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
{{Empty section|date=July 2015}}

==Construction==
The mat is made of concrete which is an aggregate of small rocks and [[cement]]. This mixture has to be supported by a framework to avoid sagging and fracture while setting. This process is known as [[Form work|shuttering]] and [[reinforcing]]. The materials used are long twisted steel bars between the piles held in shape by thinner tie wires. Once this steel mat is laid, timber is attached around the perimeter to contain the wet concrete mixture. Once poured, (usually as a series of small loads), the concrete is stirred to remove any air pockets that might weaken the structure when set. The concrete undergoes a chemical change as it hardens and this produces a lot of heat. Sometimes, if the mass of concrete is very large, pipes carrying [[refrigerant]] [[coolant]] are used in the mass to assist the setting process to prevent the concrete from cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahapwd.com/training/traininghandbook/4.htm|title=EXECUTION OF WORK|publisher=Public works department - various dates|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15185">The '''Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements''' are a set of conditions sufficient for a computer architecture to support system [[Full virtualization|virtualization]] efficiently. They were introduced by [[Gerald J. Popek]] and [[Robert P. Goldberg]] in their 1974 article "Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Popek | first1 = G. J. | authorlink1 = Gerald J. Popek| last2 = Goldberg | first2 = R. P.| doi = 10.1145/361011.361073| title = Formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 412–421| date=July 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the requirements are derived under simplifying assumptions, they still represent a convenient way of determining whether a computer architecture supports efficient virtualization and provide guidelines for the design of virtualized computer architectures.

== VMM definition ==
System [[virtual machines]] are capable of virtualizing a full set of hardware resources, including a processor (or processors), memory and storage resources and peripheral devices. 
A [[virtual machine monitor]] (VMM, also called [[hypervisor]]) is the piece of software that provides the abstraction of a virtual machine. There are three properties of interest when analyzing the environment created by a VMM:&lt;ref&gt;Rogier Dittner, David Rule, ''The best damn server virtualization book period'', Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59749-217-5}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

; Equivalence / Fidelity : A program running under the VMM should exhibit a behavior essentially identical to that demonstrated when running on an equivalent machine directly.
; Resource control / Safety : The VMM must be in complete control of the virtualized resources.
; Efficiency / Performance: A statistically dominant fraction of machine instructions must be executed without VMM intervention.

In the terminology of Popek and Goldberg, a VMM must present all three properties. In the terminology used in the reference book of Smith and Nair (2005), VMMs are typically assumed to satisfy the equivalence and resource control properties, and those additionally meeting the performance property are called ''efficient VMMs''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

Popek and Goldberg describe the characteristics that the [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) of the physical machine must possess in order to run VMMs which possess the above properties.
Their analysis derives such characteristics using a model of "third generation architectures" (e.g., IBM 360, Honeywell 6000, DEC PDP-10) that is nevertheless general enough to be extended to modern machines. This model includes a processor that operates in either system or user mode, and has access to linear, uniformly addressable memory. It is assumed that a subset of the instruction set is available only when in system mode and that memory is addressed relative to a relocation register. I/O and interrupts are not modelled.

== Virtualization theorems ==
To derive their virtualization theorems, which give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for virtualization, Popek and Goldberg introduce a classification of instructions of an ISA into 3 different groups:

; Privileged instructions : Those that [[Trap (computing)|trap]] if the processor is in [[user mode]] and do not trap if it is in system mode ([[supervisor mode]]). 
; Control sensitive instructions : Those that attempt to change the configuration of resources in the system.
; Behavior sensitive instructions : Those whose behavior or result depends on the configuration of resources (the content of the relocation register or the processor's mode).

The main result of Popek and Goldberg's analysis can then be expressed as follows.

'''Theorem 1'''. For any conventional [[third-generation computer]], an ''effective'' VMM may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.

Intuitively, the theorem states that to build a VMM it is sufficient that all instructions that could affect the correct functioning of the VMM (sensitive instructions) always trap and pass control to the VMM. This guarantees the resource control property. Non-privileged instructions must instead be executed natively (i.e., efficiently). The holding of the equivalence property also follows.

This theorem also provides a simple technique for implementing a VMM, called ''trap-and-emulate virtualization'', more recently called ''classic virtualization'': because all sensitive instructions behave nicely, all the VMM has to do is trap and emulate every one of them.&lt;ref name=asplos23&gt;Adams and Agesen, 2006, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith391/&gt;

A related problem is that of deriving sufficient conditions for recursive virtualization, that is, the conditions under which a VMM that can run on a copy of itself can be built. Popek and Goldberg present the following (sufficient) conditions.

'''Theorem 2'''. A conventional [[third-generation computer]] is recursively virtualizable if:

# it is virtualizable and
# a VMM without any timing dependencies can be constructed for it.

Some architectures, like the non-hardware-assisted [[x86]], do not meet these conditions, so they cannot be virtualized in the classic way. But architectures can still be fully virtualized (in the x86 case meaning at the CPU and MMU level) by using different techniques like binary translation, which replaces the sensitive instructions that do not generate traps,&lt;ref name=asplos23/&gt; which are sometimes called critical instructions. This additional processing however makes the VMM less efficient in theory,&lt;ref name=smith391&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; but hardware traps have non-negligible performance cost as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A well-tuned caching binary translation system may achieve comparable performance, and it does in the case of x86 binary translation relative to first generation x86 hardware assist, which merely made sensitive instructions trappable.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Agesen, p. 1 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively this gives a theorem with different sufficiency conditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Theorem 3'''. A ''hybrid'' VMM may be constructed for any third generation machine in which the set of user sensitive instructions are a subset of the set of privileged instructions:

== Handling critical instructions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2015}}

The conditions for ISA virtualization expressed in Theorem 1 may be relaxed at the expense of the efficiency property.  VMMs for non-virtualizable ISAs (in the Popek and Goldberg's sense) have routinely been built.

The virtualization of such architectures requires correct handling of ''critical instructions'', i.e., sensitive but unprivileged instructions. One approach, known as ''patching'', adopts techniques commonly used in [[dynamic recompilation]]: critical instructions are discovered at run-time and replaced with a trap into the VMM. Various mechanisms, such as the caching of emulation code or [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], have been proposed to make the patching process more efficient. A different approach is that of [[paravirtualization]], which requires guest operating systems to be modified (''ported'') before running in the virtual environment.

== Instruction sets of common architectures ==
This section presents some relevant architectures and how they relate to the virtualization requirements.

=== PDP-10 ===
The [[PDP-10]] architecture has a few instructions which are sensitive (alter or query the processor's mode) but not privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=S. W. Galley | title=PDP-10 Virtual machines | booktitle=Proc. ACM SIGARCH-SIGOPS Workshop on Virtual Computer Systems | year=1969 | pages=30–34 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These instructions save or restore the condition codes containing USER or IOT bits:

* JSR: jump to subroutine
* JSP: jump and save program counter
* PUSHJ: push down and jump
* JRST: jump and restore

=== System/370 ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[System/370]] are privileged: it satisfies the virtualization requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motorola MC68000 ===
The [[Motorola 68000|Motorola MC68000]] has a single unprivileged sensitive instruction:

* MOVE from SR

This instruction is sensitive because it allows access to the entire status register, which includes not only the [[Status register|condition codes]] but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control.  In most later family members, starting with the [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]], the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = M68000 8-/16-32-Bit Microprocessor User's Manual, Ninth Edition | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motorola M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IA-32 (x86) ===&lt;!-----------[[Intel 80386]] links here--------------&gt;
{{Main|X86 virtualization}}

The [[IA-32]] instruction set of the [[Intel P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] processor contains 18 sensitive, unprivileged instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=John Scott Robin and Cynthia E. Irvine | title=Analysis of the Intel Pentium's Ability to Support a Secure Virtual Machine Monitor | booktitle=Proc. 9th USENIX Security Symposium | year=2000 | url=http://www.usenix.org/events/sec2000/robin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be categorized in two groups:

* Sensitive register instructions: read or change sensitive registers or memory locations such as a clock register or interrupt registers:
** SGDT, SIDT, SLDT
** SMSW
** PUSHF, POPF
*Protection system instructions: reference the storage protection system, memory or address relocation system:
** LAR, LSL, VERR, VERW
** POP
** PUSH
** CALL FAR, JMP FAR, INT n, RETF
** STR
** MOV (segment registers)

The introduction of the [[AMD-V]] and [[Intel VT-x]] instruction sets in 2005 allows x86 processors to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

=== IA-64 ===
The effort needed to support virtualization on the [[IA-64]] architecture is described in a 2000 article by Magenheimer and Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Daniel J. Magenheimer and Thomas W. Christian|year=2000|title=vBlades: Optimized Paravirtualization for the Itanium Processor Family|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/vm04/tech/magenheimer.html|booktitle=Proc. 3rd Virtual Machine Research &amp; Technology Symposium|publisher=USENIX|pages=73&amp;ndash;82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SPARC ===
A "hyperprivileged" mode for the [[UltraSPARC]] architecture was specified in ''UltraSPARC Architecture 2005''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = UltraSPARC Architecture 2005: One Architecture.... Multiple Innovative Implementations (DraftD0.9) | date = 2007-05-17 | first = David | last = Weaver | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc. | location = Santa Clara, CA, USA | url = http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/UA2005-current-draft-HP-EXT.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219233505/http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/UA2005-current-draft-HP-EXT.pdf | archivedate = 2009-02-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a ''sun4v'' platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = UltraSPARC Virtual Machine Specification | url = http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/Hypervisor-api-current-draft.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927060811/http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/Hypervisor-api-current-draft.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | date = 2006-01-24 | author = Sun Microsystems, Inc. | location = Santa Clara, CA, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a super-set of the ''sun4u'' platform, but is still compliant to the SPARC v9 Level-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The SPARC Architecture Manual: Version 9 | first = David L. | last = Weaver | author2 = Tom Germond | url = http://www.sparc.com/standards/SPARCV9.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041107035158/http://www.sparc.com/standards/SPARCV9.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2004-11-07 | publisher = SPARC International, Inc. | location = San Jose, CA, USA | isbn = 0-13-825001-4 | year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specification.

=== PowerPC ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[PowerPC]] instruction set are privileged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagetable.com/?p=15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410-s07/lectures/L38_Virtualization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance in practice ==
The efficiency requirement in Popek and Goldberg's definition of a VMM concerns only the execution of non-privileged instructions, which must execute natively. This is what distinguishes a VMM from the more general class of hardware [[Emulator|emulation]] software. Unfortunately, even on an architecture that meets Popek and Goldberg's requirements, the performance of a virtual machine can differ significantly from the actual hardware. Early experiments performed on the System/370 (which meets the formal requirements of Theorem 1) showed that performance of a virtual machine could be as low as 21% of the native machine in some benchmarks. The cost of trapping and emulating privileged instructions in the VMM can be significant. This led the IBM engineers to introduce a number of [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], which roughly doubled the performance of the System/370 virtual machines.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 415-416 and 426&lt;/ref&gt; Assists were added in several stages. In the end, there were over 100 assists on the late models System/370.&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main driving factors for the development of hardware assists for the System/370 was virtual memory itself. When the guest was an operating system that itself implemented virtual memory, even non-privileged instructions could experience longer execution times - a penalty imposed by the requirement to access translation tables not used in native execution (see [[shadow page tables]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Puretic power block''' is a special kind of mechanised [[winch]] used to haul nets on [[fishing vessel]]s. The power block is a large powered aluminium [[pulley]] with a hard rubber-coated [[Sheave (mechanical)|sheave]]. While many men were needed for the back-breaking work of hauling a [[purse seine]] manually, the same work could be done by fewer men with a power block.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;Schmidt PG (1959) "The Puretic power block and its effect on modern purse seining". In [https://archive.org/stream/modernfishingoft034787mbp/modernfishingoft034787mbp_djvu.txt ''Modern Fishing Gear Of The World 1''], pp. 400–414. Editor Hilmar Kristjohsson, [[FAO]], Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puretic power block revolutionized the technology of hauling [[fishing net]]s, particularly purse seine nets. According to the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]], "no single invention has contributed more to the success of purse seine net hauling" than the power block, which was "the linch-pin in the mechanization of purse seining".&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;[[FAO]]: Fishing Equipment: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/equipment/powerblock Power block] Rome. Retrieved 28 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca/publications/fishbytes/1-6-dec.pdf The Power Block] ''FishByes'', December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The power block was invented by a [[Croats|Croatian]] fisherman, [[Mario Puratić]], and patented in 1953. In English, Puratić is usually spelt Puretic, sometimes Puretich.

While he was working as a tuna and sardine fisherman from [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]], California, Puratić started thinking about the difficulty of hauling seine nets. The original power block he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped roller coated with hard rubber. It was suspended from a [[davit]], and powered from the warp end of the winch by a looping rope. In 1954, the power block was trialled by American purse seiners in the Pacific. They have evolved since then, and nowadays power blocks are powered by [[hydraulic pump]]s. Their speed, torque and direction can be remotely controlled from the bridge during operations. As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardarson"&gt;Bardarson, HR (1971) "Deck Equipment for Purse Seining". In ''Modern Fishing Gear Of The World 3'',  pp. 283–287, Editor Hilmar Kristjohsson, [[FAO]], Rome. [https://archive.org/download/modernfishinggea034697mbp/modernfishinggea034697mbp.pdf Download PDF (56MB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important innovations of the same period were the development of [[synthetic fibre|synthetic]] fishing nets and [[sonar]] detection devices. The combination of the automated power block hauling synthetic nets with sonar sensing revolutionised the industry.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

The use of power blocks was found to have further advantages. It is possible to fish in rougher weather with the power block, because the steady force exerted by the net stabilizes the vessel. When deployments are made which miss the schooling fish, the net can be rapidly retrieved and redeployed on the same school. The power block also makes it easy to get nets aboard in emergencies, such as a sudden shift in tides or winds, or shark attacks on the catch and net.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

On the other hand, the increase in the effectiveness of purse seine fishing led to herring schools choosing to school deeper in the water. Nets that could operate in deeper water needed to be bigger and heavier. That in turn meant bigger vessels, which pushed the smaller herring vessels out of business.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Seine fishing industries rapidly recognized the value of the power block, and by 1960, most northern seine vessels were using the power block. Nowadays power blocks come with dozens of configurations and sizes. They are installed on over twenty thousand [[fishing vessel]]s across the major purse seining [[Fishery|fisheries]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;MARCO, the Puretic power block, and Purse Seining.

{{Antennas|systems}}

'''Radio masts and towers''' are, typically, tall structures designed to support [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s (also known as aerials) for [[telecommunication]]s and [[broadcasting]], including [[television]]. There are two main types: guyed and self-supporting structures. They are among the tallest man-made structures.

Masts are often named after the broadcasting organizations that originally built them or currently use them. 

In the case of a [[mast radiator]] or radiating tower, the whole mast or tower is itself the transmitting antenna.

==Mast or tower?==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of tallest structures in the world]] --&gt;
[[File:Tower base.jpg|thumb|A radio mast base showing how virtually all lateral support is provided by the guy-wires]]
The terms "mast" and "tower" are often used interchangeably. However, in structural engineering terms, a tower is a self-supporting or [[cantilever]]ed structure, while a [[Guyed mast|mast]] is held up by stays or [[Guy-wire|guys]]. Broadcast engineers in the UK use the same terminology. A mast is a ground-based or rooftop structure that supports antennas at a height where they can satisfactorily send or receive radio waves. Typical masts are of steel lattice or tubular steel construction. Masts themselves play no part in the transmission of mobile telecommunications.
Masts (to use the civil engineering terminology) tend to be cheaper to build but require an extended area surrounding them to accommodate the guy wires. Towers are more commonly used in cities where land is in short supply.

There are a few borderline designs that are partly free-standing and partly guyed, called [[additionally guyed tower]]s. For example:
* The [[Gerbrandy tower]] consists of a self-supporting tower with a guyed mast on top.
* The few remaining [[Blaw-Knox tower]]s do the opposite: they have a guyed lower section surmounted by a freestanding part.
*[[Zendstation Smilde]], a tall tower with a guyed mast on top (guys go to ground)
*[[Torre de Collserola]], a guyed tower with a guyed mast on top (tower portion is not free-standing)

==History==
{{seealso|History of broadcasting}}
Experimental radio broadcasting began in 1905, and commercial radio broke through in the 1920s.

Until August 8, 1991, the [[Warsaw radio mast]] was the world's tallest supported structure on land; its collapse left the [[KVLY/KTHI-TV mast]] as the tallest. There are over 50 radio structures in the United States that are 600 m (1968.5 ft) or taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=62710343|title=Diagrams - SkyscraperPage.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[File:KBRC antenna tower guy wires.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Typical 200 foot (61 m) triangular guyed lattice mast of an AM radio station in [[Mount Vernon, Washington]], USA]]

===Steel lattice===
The steel lattice is the most widespread form of construction. It provides great strength, low weight and wind resistance, and economy in the use of materials.  Lattices of triangular cross-section are most common, and square lattices are also widely used.   [[Guyed mast]]s are often used; the supporting [[guy line]]s carry lateral forces such as wind loads, allowing the mast to be very narrow and simply constructed. 

When built as a tower, the structure may be parallel-sided or taper over part or all of its height. When constructed of several sections which taper exponentially with height, in the manner of the [[Eiffel Tower]], the tower is said to be an Eiffelized one. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace]] tower in [[London]] is an example.
[[File:Russian_TV_tower_(Penza).JPG|thumb|220px|Russian TV tower, [[Penza]]]]

===Tubular steel===
[[Guyed mast]]s are sometimes also constructed out of steel tubes. This construction type has the advantage that cables and other components can be protected from weather inside the tube  and consequently the structure may look cleaner.
These masts are mainly used for FM-/TV-broadcasting, but sometimes also as mast radiator. The big mast of [[Mühlacker radio transmitter|Mühlacker transmitting station]] is a good example of this. 
A disadvantage of this mast type is that it is much more affected by winds than masts with open bodies. Several tubular guyed masts have  collapsed. In the UK,  the [[Emley Moor]] and [[Waltham transmitting station|Waltham]] TV stations masts collapsed in the 1960s. In Germany the [[Sender Bielstein|Bielstein transmitter]] collapsed in 1985.
Tubular masts were not built in all countries. In Germany, France, UK, Czech, Slovakia, Japan and the former Soviet Union, many tubular guyed masts were built, while there are nearly none in Poland or North America.

In several cities in Russia and Ukraine several tubular guyed masts with crossbars running from the mast structure to the guys were built in the 1960s. All these masts, which are designed as [[30107 KM]], are exclusively used for FM and TV transmission and, except for the [[TV Tower Vinnytsia|mast in Vinnytsia]], are between 150 and 200 metres tall.
The crossbars of these masts are equipped with a gangway that holds smaller antennas, though their main purpose is oscillation damping.

[[File:Fernsehturm stuttgart.jpg|thumb|[[Fernsehturm Stuttgart|TV Tower]] in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany): the first reinforced-concrete TV tower]]

===Reinforced concrete===
Reinforced concrete towers are relatively expensive to build but provide a high degree of mechanical rigidity in strong winds. This can be important when antennas with narrow beamwidths are used, such as those used for microwave point-to-point links, and when the structure is to be occupied by people.

In the 1950s, AT&amp;T built numerous [http://long-lines.net/tech-equip/radio/concrete_towers.html concrete towers], more resembling silos than towers, for its first [http://long-lines.net/places-routes/1st_transcon_mw/index.html transcontinental microwave route.] Many are still in use today.

In [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] most towers constructed for point-to-point microwave links are built of [[reinforced concrete]], while in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] most are [[lattice tower]]s.

Concrete towers can form prestigious landmarks, such as the [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]]. In addition to accommodating technical staff, these buildings may have public areas such as observation decks or restaurants.

The [[Fernsehturm Stuttgart|Stuttgart TV tower]] was the first tower in the world to be built in reinforced concrete. It was designed in 1956 by the local civil engineer [[Fritz Leonhardt]].

===Fiberglass and other composite materials===
[[Fiberglass]] poles are occasionally used for low-power non-directional beacons or medium-wave broadcast transmitters. Carbon fibre monopoles and towers have traditionally been too expensive but recent developments in the way the carbon fibre tow is spun have resulted in solutions that offer strengths similar or exceeding steel for a fraction of the weight - now allowing monopole and towers to be built in locations that were too expensive or difficult to access with the heavy lifting equipment that is needed for steel structure.

===Wood===
There are fewer wooden towers now than in the past. Many were built in the UK during [[World War II]] because of a shortage of steel. In Germany before World War II wooden towers were used at nearly all medium-wave transmission sites, but all of these towers have since been demolished, except for the [[Gliwice Radio Tower]].

[[Ferryside television relay station]] is an example of a TV relay transmitter using a wooden pole.

==Other types of antenna supports and structures==
===Poles===
Shorter masts may consist of a self-supporting or guyed wooden pole, similar to a telegraph pole. Sometimes self-supporting tubular [[galvanized steel]] poles are used: these may be termed monopoles.

===Buildings===
In some cases, it is possible to install transmitting antennas on the roofs of tall buildings. In [[North America]], for instance, there are transmitting antennas on the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Willis Tower]], [[4 Times Square]], and [[One World Trade Center]]. The North Tower [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center| (1WTC)]] of the original [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] also had a 360-foot (110m) telecommunications antenna atop its roof, constructed in 1978-1979, and began transmission in 1980. When the buildings collapsed, several local TV and radio stations were knocked off the air until backup transmitters could be put into service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvantenna.com/news/worldtradecenter.html|title=Some New York City TV and Radio Stations Off The Air After World Trade Center Collapse|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231122327/http://www.tvantenna.com/news/worldtradecenter.html|archivedate=2006-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such facilities also exist in [[Europe]], particularly for portable radio services and low-power [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio stations. In [[London]], the [[BBC]] erected in 1936 a mast for broadcasting early television on one of the towers of a Victorian building, the [[Alexandra Palace]]. It is still in use.

===Disguised cell-sites===
[[File:Finishing cross view.JPG|thumb|right|Completed in December 2009 at Epiphany Lutheran Church in Lake Worth, Florida, this 100' tall cross conceals equipment for [[T-Mobile]]]]
Many people view bare [[Cell site|cellphone towers]] as ugly and an intrusion into their neighbourhoods. Even though people increasingly depend upon cellular communications, they are opposed to the bare towers spoiling otherwise scenic views. Many companies offer to 'hide' cellphone towers in, or as, trees, church towers, flag poles, water tanks and other features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.uncc.edu/research/clean_room/engr1202/celltowers.html CARC - UNC-Charlotte - Class 1000 Clean Room Facilities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180144/http://www.ece.uncc.edu/research/clean_room/engr1202/celltowers.html |date=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many providers that offer these services as part of the normal tower installation and maintenance service. These are generally called "stealth towers" or "stealth installations", or simply [[concealed cell sites]].

The level of detail and realism achieved by disguised cellphone towers is remarkably high; for example, such towers disguised as trees are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing, even for local wildlife (who additionally benefit from the artificial flora).&lt;ref&gt;[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/faketree.htm Cell Phone Trees&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such towers can be placed unobtrusively in [[national parks]] and other such protected places, such as towers disguised as [[cactus|cacti]] in [[Coronado National Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlaine.com/personal/Tucson/SabinoCanyon/Sabino.htm|title=Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when disguised, however, such towers can create controversy; a tower doubling as a flagpole attracted controversy in 2004 in relation to the [[U.S. Presidential Election, 2004|U.S. Presidential campaign of that year]], and highlighted the sentiment that such disguises serve more to allow the installation of such towers in subterfuge away from public scrutiny rather than to serve towards the beautification of the landscape.{{Or|Radio masts and towers|date=October 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightwatcher.com/culturejam/stealth_towers.html |title=Stealth towers |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disguised cell sites sometimes can be introduced into environments that require a low-impact visual outcome, by being made to look like trees, chimneys or other common structures.

===Mast radiators===
{{Main|Mast radiator}}
A mast radiator is a radio tower or mast in which the whole structure works as an antenna. It is used frequently as a transmitting antenna for [[long wave|long]] or [[medium wave]] broadcasting.

Structurally, the only difference is that a mast radiator may be supported on an insulator at its base. In the case of a tower, there will be one insulator supporting each leg.

===Telescopic, pump-up and tiltover towers===
{{main|Cell on wheels}}
A special form of the radio tower is the ''telescopic mast''. These can be erected very quickly. Telescopic masts are used predominantly in setting up temporary radio links for reporting on major news events, and for temporary communications in emergencies. They are also used in tactical military networks. They can save money by needing to withstand high winds only when raised, and as such are widely used in [[amateur radio]].

Telescopic masts consist of two or more concentric sections and come in two principal types:
*Pump-up masts are often used on vehicles, and are raised to their full height pneumatically or hydraulically. They are usually only strong enough to support fairly small antennas.
*Telescopic lattice masts are raised by means of a winch, which may be powered by hand or an electric motor. These tend to cater for greater heights and loads than the pump-up type. When retracted, the whole assembly can sometimes be lowered to a horizontal position by means of a second tiltover winch. This enables antennas to be fitted and adjusted at ground level before winching the mast up.

===Balloons and kites===
A tethered [[balloon]] or a [[kite flying|kite]] can serve as a temporary support. It can carry an antenna or a wire (for VLF, LW or MW) up to an appropriate height. Such an arrangement is used occasionally by military agencies or radio amateurs. The American broadcasters [[TV Martí]] broadcast a television program to [[Cuba]] by means of such a balloon.

===Drones===
There has recently (2013) been interest in using [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (drones) for telecom purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/business/news/articles/20130424telecom-equipped-drones-could-revolutionize-wireless-market.html|title=Telecom-equipped drones could revolutionize wireless market|work=azcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what advantages a drone would have over a balloon, however one major disadvantage is their limited duration when compared to a balloon.

===Other special structures===

For two [[very low frequency|VLF]] transmitters wire antennas spun across deep valleys are used. The wires are supported by small masts or towers or rock anchors. See [[List of spans#Antenna spans across valleys|List of spans: Antenna spans across valleys]]. The same technique was also used at [[Criggion radio station]].

For ELF transmitters [[ground dipole]] antennas are used. Such structures require no tall masts. They consist of two electrodes buried deep in the ground at least a few dozen kilometres apart. From the transmitter building to the electrodes, overhead feeder lines run. These lines look like power lines of the 10 kV level, and are installed on similar pylons.

==Design features==
===Economic and aesthetic considerations===
[[File:AmateurRadioAntenna.JPG|thumb|150px|A [[radio amateur]]'s [[do it yourself]] steel-lattice tower]]

*The cost of a mast or tower is roughly proportional to the square of its height.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*A guyed mast is cheaper to build than a self-supporting tower of equal height.
*A guyed mast needs additional land to accommodate the guys, and is thus best suited to rural locations where land is relatively cheap. An unguyed tower will fit into a much smaller plot.
*A steel lattice tower is cheaper to build than a concrete tower of equal height.
*Two small towers may be less intrusive, visually, than one big one, especially if they look identical.
*Towers look less ugly if they and the antennas mounted on them appear symmetrical.
*Concrete towers can be built with aesthetic design - and they are, especially in Continental Europe. They are sometimes built in prominent places and include observation decks or restaurants.

===Masts for HF/shortwave antennas===
For transmissions in the [[shortwave]] range, there is little to be gained by raising the antenna more than a few [[wavelength]]s above ground level. Shortwave transmitters rarely use masts taller than about 100 metres.

===Access for riggers===
Because masts, towers and the antennas mounted on them require maintenance, access to the whole of the structure is necessary. Small structures are typically accessed with a [[ladder]]. Larger structures, which tend to require more frequent maintenance, may have stairs and sometimes a lift, also called a service elevator.

===Aircraft warning features===
Tall structures in excess of certain legislated heights are often equipped with [[aircraft warning lights|aircraft warning lamps]], usually red, to warn pilots of the structure's existence. In the past, ruggedized and under-run filament lamps were used to maximize the bulb life. Alternatively, neon lamps were used. Nowadays such lamps tend to use [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] arrays.

Height requirements vary across states and countries, and may include additional rules such as requiring a white flashing strobe in the daytime and pulsating red fixtures at night. Structures over a certain height may also be required to be painted with [[aircraft warning paint|contrasting color schemes]] such as white and orange or white and red to make them more visible against the sky.

==== Light pollution and nuisance lighting ====
In some countries where [[light pollution]] is a concern, tower heights may be restricted so as to reduce or eliminate the need for aircraft warning lights. For example, in the United States the [[1996 Telecommunications Act]] allows local jurisdictions to set maximum heights for towers, such as limiting tower height to below 200 feet and therefore not requiring aircraft illumination under U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules. The limit is more commonly set to 190 or 180 feet to allow for masts extending above the tower.

===Wind-induced oscillations===
One problem with radio masts is the danger of wind-induced oscillations. This is particularly a concern with steel tube construction. One can reduce this by building cylindrical shock-mounts into the construction. One finds such shock-mounts, which look like cylinders thicker than the mast, for example, at the radio masts of [[VLF transmitter DHO38|DHO38]] in [[Saterland]]. There are also constructions, which consist of a free-standing tower (usually from [[reinforced concrete]]), onto which a guyed radio mast is installed. The best known such construction is the [[Gerbrandy Tower]] in [[Lopik]] (the [[Netherlands]]). Further towers of this building method can be found near [[Zendstation Smilde|Smilde]] (the Netherlands) and [[Fernsehturm Waldenburg|Fernsehturm]], [[Waldenburg, Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]).

===Hazard to birds===
{{Main|Towerkill}}
Radio, television and cell towers have been documented to pose a hazard to birds.  Reports have been issued documenting known bird fatalities and calling for research to find ways to minimize the hazard that communications towers can pose to birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/library/reports/ABC_towerkillweb.pdf | title = Communication Towers: A Deadly Hazard to Birds | accessdate = 2010-09-29 | last = Shire | first = Gavin G. |author2=Karen Brown |author3=Gerald Winegrad  | date = June 2000 | format = PDF | work = American Bird Conservancy | publisher = Earthjustice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/CurrentBirdIssues/Hazards/towers/towers.htm | title = Avian Collisions at Communication Towers - Sources of Information | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = June 1, 2009 | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been instances of rare birds nesting in cell towers and thereby preventing repair work due to legislation intended to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nesting falcon hits Vodafone customers in Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-22144488|publisher=BBC News|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Birds fire back: Vulture cousins menace UK city's mobiles|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/17/falcon/|publisher=The Register|last=Ray|first=Bill|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British English]], a '''radiogram''' is a piece of furniture that combined a [[Receiver (radio)|radio]] and [[Phonograph|record player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/radiogram|title=Radiogram definition |last=Collins Essential English Dictionary 2nd Edition|date=2006|work=Collins Essential English Dictionary 2nd Edition|publisher= HarperCollins Publishers|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''radiogram'' is a portmanteau of ''[[Radio receiver|radio]]'' and ''[[phonograph|gramophone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/radiogram|title=Radiogram definition|date=2009|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding term in [[American English]] is [[Entertainment center|'''console''']].

Radiograms reached their peak of popularity in the post-war era, supported by a rapidly growing interest in [[Gramophone record|records]]. Originally they were made of [[Wood finishing|polished wood]] to blend with the furniture of the 1930s, with many styled by the leading designers of the day. An expensive instrument of entertainment for the house, fitted with a larger loudspeaker than the domestic [[radio]], the radiogram soon began to develop features such as the record autochanger, which would accept six or seven records and play them one after another. Certain recordings could be ordered as a box set which would combine the recorded piece in order, to suit an autochanger set-up. In the 1940s and 1950s, sales of the radiogram, coupled with the then-new [[FM broadcasting|F.M. waveband]], and the advent of the 45 rpm [[Single (music)|single]] and the [[LP record]], meant that many manufacturers considered the radiogram to be more important than the fledgling [[television]] set sales. Later models took on the modern lines, piano gloss finish and plastic and gilt trim of the 1960s. [[music centre|Stereogram]] versions became available to take advantage of [[stereo]] records.

As valve radio development ended in the late 1960s and transistors began to take over, radiograms started to become obsolete.  By the late 1970s, they had been replaced by more compact equipment, such as the [[hi-fi]] and the [[music centre]].{{Cn|date=April 2016}}

Since radiograms were manufactured in such huge numbers they are not as rare or valuable as TV sets or table radios from the same period. An exception to this are models from certain manufacturers which have become collectable such as [[Hacker Radio Ltd.]], [[Dynatron Radio Ltd|Dynatron]], [[Blaupunkt]], [[Braun (company)|Braun]], and [[SABA (electronics manufacturer)|SABA]].

Due to national security concerns, the '''use of geographic information in China is restricted''' to entities that obtain a special authorization from the administrative department for surveying and mapping under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveying and Mapping Law of the People’s Republic of China|url=http://en.nasg.gov.cn/article/Lawsandregulations/201312/20131200005471.shtml|publisher=National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences of the restriction include fines for unauthorized surveys, lack of [[geotagging]] information on many cameras when the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip detects a location within China, incorrect alignment of street maps with satellite maps in various applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rabaza Bergua, Carlos S.|author2=López-de-Larrínzar-Galdámez, Juan|author3=Salvador Suárez, Iván|author4=Usón Montesinos, Miguel|author5=Muro Medrano, Pedro R.|title=Restricciones al trabajo con información geográfica online en China|url=http://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/JIIDE13/miercoles/15_restriscciones_IG_MapasEnChina_presentacion.pdf|website=IV Jornadas Ibéricas de Infraestructuras de Datos Espaciales|publisher=JIIDE 2013|location=Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Campus Tecnológico Fábrica de Armas, Toledo|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeming unlawfulness of [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] mapping efforts such as [[OpenStreetMap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.nasg.gov.cn/article/Lawsandregulations/201312/20131200005471.shtml|title=Surveying and Mapping Law of the People’s Republic of China— National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation|last=|first=|date=|website=en.nasg.gov.cn|access-date=2018-02-27|quote=Articles 7, 26, 40 and 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
According to articles 7, 26, 40 and 42 of the ''Surveying and Mapping Law of the People's Republic of China'', private surveying and mapping activities have been illegal in mainland China since 2002. The law prohibits

Between 2006 and 2011, the authorities pursued nearly 40 illegal cases of mapping and surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hvistendahl|first1=M.|title=Foreigners Run Afoul of China's Tightening Secrecy Rules|journal=Science|date=24 January 2013|volume=339|issue=6118|pages=384–385|doi=10.1126/science.339.6118.384|pmid=23349263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media has reported on other cases of unlawful surveys:

As a consequence, major digital camera manufacturers including Panasonic, Leica, FujiFilm, Nikon and Samsung restrict location information within China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|authorlink1=Cory Doctorow|title=Why your camera's GPS won't work in China (maybe)|url=http://ogleearth.com/2012/05/why-do-panasonic-leica-fujifilm-samsung-and-nikon-censor-their-gps-cameras/|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|archiveurl=http://boingboing.net/2012/05/24/why-your-cameras-gps-wont.html|archivedate=24 May 2015|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coordinate systems ==
{{geodesy}}
[[File:PRcoords_Cheatsheet.pdf|220px|thumb|right|JavaScript implementation of coordinate "processing" methods used in China]]
{{Quotation|Technical spatial processing must be applied to electronic navigational maps prior to publication, sales, redistribution, and usage.|GB 20263―2006 "[[s:zh:GB 20263-2006 导航电子地图安全处理技术基本要求|Basic security processes for electronic navigational maps]]"|4.1}}
Chinese regulations mandate that approved map service providers in China use a specific coordinate system, called GCJ-02. [[Baidu Maps]] uses yet another coordinate system - BD-09,&lt;ref name="bd-09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coordinate conversion|url=http://developer.baidu.com/map/jsdemo.htm#a5_1|publisher=[[Baidu Maps]]|accessdate=7 April 2015|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baidu-map-api-coordinate-conversion"/&gt; which seems to be based on GCJ-02.&lt;ref name="caijun"/&gt;

=== GCJ-02 ===

'''GCJ-02''' (colloquially '''Mars Coordinates''') is a [[geodetic datum]] formulated by the Chinese [[State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping]] ({{zh|s=国测局|p=guó-cè-jú}}), and based on [[WGS-84]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quickstart|url=https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/use|website=[[Google Maps]] for [[AngularJS]]|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an obfuscation algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.it168.com/article_1778861.html|title=手机地理轨迹取证步骤大解密|publisher=IT168}}&lt;/ref&gt; which adds apparently random offsets to both the latitude and longitude, with the alleged goal of improving national security.&lt;ref name="caijun" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.site-digger.com/html/articles/20140115/72.html|title=国内常见的电子地图坐标介绍|publisher=鲲鹏Web数据抓取}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marker with GCJ-02 coordinates will be displayed at the correct location on a GCJ-02 map. However, the offsets can result in a 100 - 700 meter error from the actual location if a WGS-84 marker (such as a GPS location) is placed on a GCJ-02 map, or vice versa. The Google.com street map is offset by 50–500 meters from its satellite imagery,&lt;ref name=motherboard /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google.com hybrid map of The Bund|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Bund/@31.2417003,121.49003,1096m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x35b270578b874861:0x4d56fbed10d1af64|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Google.cn map is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google.cn map of The Bund|url=http://www.google.cn/maps/@31.2397367,121.4946247,1097m/data=!3m1!1e3|publisher=[[Google China]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yahoo! Maps]] also displays the street map without major errors when compared to the satellite imagery.&lt;ref name="yahoo-map"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo! Map of The Bund|url=https://maps.yahoo.com/place/?lat=31.24175591400924&amp;lon=121.49212718009949&amp;q=shanghai&amp;bb=31.24629644%2C121.48394644%2C31.23721516%2C121.50030792&amp;addr=shanghai|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MapQuest overlays OpenStreetMap data perfectly as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MapQuest map of The Bund|url=http://mapq.st/1C9QlaP|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the secrecy surrounding the GCJ-02 obfuscation, several open-source projects exist that provide conversions between GCJ-02 and WGS-84, for languages including C#,&lt;ref name=leak&gt;{{cite web|title=EvilTransform.cs|url=https://on4wp7.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/21455#EvilTransform.cs|date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; C, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP,&lt;ref name=evil-gh&gt;{{cite web|author1=[https://www.linkedin.com/in/googollee Lee, Googol]|title=Transform coordinates between Earth (WGS-84) and Mars in China (GCJ-02)|url=https://github.com/googollee/eviltransform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China GPS offset problem|url=http://blog.snapdragon.cc/2013/07/17/china-gps-offset-problem/|website=SnapDragon Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; R,&lt;ref name=caijun /&gt; and Ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MarsGeo|url=https://www.omniref.com/ruby/gems/mars_geo/0.0.1|publisher=Omniref|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416161655/https://www.omniref.com/ruby/gems/mars_geo/0.0.1|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EvilTransform Ruby gem|url=https://rubygems.org/gems/evil_transform/versions/0.0.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to be based on leaked code for the WGS to GCJ part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FENG|first1=Zili|title=ChinaMapDeviation|url=https://github.com/maxime/ChinaMapDeviation/issues/1#issuecomment-89987212|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407111031/https://github.com/maxime/ChinaMapDeviation/issues/1|archivedate=7 April 2015|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions to the conversion involve interpolating coordinates based on [[regression analysis|regression]] from a data set of Google China and satellite imagery coordinates.&lt;ref name=guilbot-reg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guilbot|first1=Maxime|title=ChinaMapDeviation|url=https://github.com/maxime/ChinaMapDeviation|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt by Wu Yongzheng using FFT analysis gave a result much like the leaked code.&lt;ref name="wu-regression"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wu|first1=Yongzheng|title=The Deviation of China Map as a Regression Problem|url=https://wuyongzheng.github.io/china-map-deviation/paper.html|website=GitHub Pages|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the leaked code,&lt;ref name=leak/&gt; GCJ-02 uses parameters from the [[SK-42 reference system]]. The parameters were used to calculate lengths of one degree of [[Latitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_latitude|latitude]] and [[Longitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_longitude|longitude]], so that offsets in meters previously calculated can be converted to degrees for the WGS-84 input coordinates.

=== BD-09 ===
{{Main article|Baidu Maps#Coordinate system}}
'''BD-09''' is a geographic coordinate system used by [[Baidu Maps]], adding further obfuscation to the already cryptic GCJ-02 "to better protect users' privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.baidu.com/map/question.htm#qa0023 |title=Baidu LBS Open Platform FAQ |publisher=Baidu Developer |date= |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baidu-map-api-coordinate-conversion"&gt;{{cite web|title=坐标转换API|trans-title=Coordinate Conversion API|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170328095201/http://developer.baidu.com/map/changeposition.htm|archive-date=2017-03-28|url=http://developer.baidu.com/map/changeposition.htm|website=developer.baidu.com/map|publisher=Baidu|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baidu provides an API call to convert from Google or GPS (WGS-84) coordinates into Baidu coordinates.&lt;ref name="bd-09" /&gt; Similar to GCJ-02, there are no APIs to convert in the other direction, but open source implementations in R&lt;ref name="caijun"&gt;{{cite web|title=A package for geocoding, reverse geocoding and coordinate transformations between WGS-84, GCJ-02 and BD-09 coordinate systems|url=https://github.com/caijun/geoChina|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various other languages&lt;ref name=evil-gh/&gt; exist.

=== Reverse transformation ===

GCJ-02 appears to use multiple high-frequency noises of the form &lt;math&gt;20n \sin{}(180 k \times lat_{rad})&lt;/math&gt;, effectively generating a transcendental equation and thus eliminating analytical solutions. However, the open-source "reverse" transformations make use of the properties of GCJ-02 that the transformed coordinates are not too far from WGS-84 and are mostly monotonic related to corresponding WGS-84 coordinates:&lt;ref name=fengzee /&gt;&lt;ref name=caijun /&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=py&gt;
from typing import Callable
# Represent coordinates with complex numbers for simplicity
coords = complex
# Coords-to-coords function
C2C = Callable[[coords], coords]

def rev_transform_rough(bad: coords, worsen: C2C) -&gt; coords:

    eps = 1e-6
    wgs = rev_transform_rough(bad, worsen)

    while abs(improvement) &gt; eps:
        improvement = worsen(wgs) - bad
        wgs = wgs - improvement
    return wgs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The rough method is reported to give some 1~2 meter accuracy for wgs2gcj,&lt;ref name=evil-gh/&gt; while the exact ([[fixed point iteration]]) method is able to get "centimeter accuracy" in two calls to the forward function.{{NoteTag|1=i.e. &lt;code&gt;wgs -= worsen(wgs) - bad&lt;/code&gt; done twice, with &lt;code&gt;wgs&lt;/code&gt; initialized as &lt;code&gt;bad&lt;/code&gt; so that the first iteration is equivalent to a rough pass.}}&lt;ref name="gh_86ae326"&gt;{{cite web|author1=bewantbe|title=make gcj2wgs_exact() much faster, by using fixed…|url=https://github.com/bewantbe/eviltransform/commit/86ae326|website=GitHub|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fengzee&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=中国地图偏移算法|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/9a53e4edd5bbfd0a795673c6.html|archiveurl=https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e7c6f67555099180ce1ae8da4ba2c513|archivedate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the two properties ensure some basic functionality of the coordinate system, it's unlikely that the methods will change with new coordinate systems. The [[#BD-09|BD]]-to-GCJ code works in a manner much like the rough method, except that it removes the explicitly-applied constant shift of ~20 seconds of arc on both coordinates first and works in polar coordinates like the forward function does.&lt;ref name=caijun /&gt; 

The establishment of working conversion methods both ways largely obsoletes datasets for deviations mentioned below.&lt;ref name="Corr"/&gt;

== The China GPS shift problem ==
[[Image:Google.com Maps in China coordinate system misalignment.png|thumb|right|Google Maps displays satellite imagery using the WGS-84 coordinate system, and street maps using the GCJ-02 datum]]
The '''China GPS shift (or offset) problem''' is a class of issues stemming from the difference between the [[#GCJ-02|GCJ-02]] and [[WGS-84]] [[geodetic datum|datum]]s. [[Global Positioning System]] coordinates are expressed using the WGS-84 standard and when plotted on street maps of China that follow the GCJ-02 coordinates, they appear off by a large (often over 500 meters) and variable amount. Authorized providers of location-based services and digital maps (such as [[AutoNavi]] or [[NavInfo]]) must purchase a "shift correction" algorithm that enables plotting GPS locations correctly on the map.&lt;ref name="Corr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feng|first1=Zili|title=The government charges Chinese companies for the "shift correction" feature|url=https://github.com/maxime/ChinaMapDeviation/issues/1#issuecomment-90462107|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite imagery and user-contributed street map data sets, such as those from [[OpenStreetMap]] also display correctly because they have been collected using GPS devices (albeit technically illegally - see [[#Legislation|Legislation]]).

Some map providers, such as [[Here (company)|Here]], choose to also offset their satellite imagery layer to match the GCJ-02 street map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Monument to the People's Heroes|authorlink1=Monument to the People's Heroes (Shanghai)|title=Nokia Here street map and satellite map both use GCJ-02 coordinates|url=https://www.here.com/?map=31.24427,121.48695,18|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has worked with Chinese [[location-based service|LBS]] provider [[AutoNavi]] since 2006 to source its maps in China.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Mark|title=Apple Shares Google China Map Partner in Win for AutoNavi: Tech|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-07-05/apple-shares-google-china-map-partner-in-win-for-autonavi|publisher=Bloomberg|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
google.''cn''/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Monument to the People's Heroes|authorlink1=Monument to the People's Heroes (Shanghai)|title=Google China street map uses GCJ-02 coordinates|url=http://google.cn/maps/@31.2423,121.4914,20z|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satellite imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Monument to the People's Heroes|authorlink1=Monument to the People's Heroes (Shanghai)|title=Google China satellite imagery uses GCJ-02 coordinates|url=http://google.cn/maps/@31.24228,121.49142,137m/data=!3m1!1e3|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the WGS-84 positions reported by a browser are depicted at the wrong positions. On the contrary, google.''com''/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but doesn't shift the satellite imagery layer, which continues to use WGS-84 coordinates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Monument to the People's Heroes|authorlink1=Monument to the People's Heroes (Shanghai)|title=Google.com satellite imagery uses WGS-84 coordinates|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@31.2423,121.4914,267m/data=!3m1!1e3|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the benefit that WGS-84 positions can still be overlaid correctly on the satellite image (but not the street map). Google Earth also uses WGS-84 to display the satellite imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could you please correct the offset in China due to GCJ-02 coordinate?|url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/earth/4PPOyz5YA8g|website=Google Earth|publisher=Google Product Forums|date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaying GPS tracks on [[Google Maps|Google.com Maps]] and any street maps sourced from Google.com via its API, will lead to a similar display offset problem, because GPS tracks use WGS-84, and Google.com maps use GCJ-02. The issue has been reported numerous times on the Google Product Forums since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFSET MAPPING ISSUE IN CHINA|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/maps/zVmRao1Im3w/bvk-n_jgPvQJ|website=Google Product Forums|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 3rd party applications emerging to fix it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABCMaps application to fix the China GPS offset|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/maps/4betfwupNjE/IEUe3x5oPpAJ|date=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data sets with offsets for large lists of Chinese cities existed for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pasden|first1=John|title=A More Complete iOS Solution to the China GPS Offset Problem|url=http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2013/07/16/a-more-complete-ios-solution-to-the-china-gps-offset-problem|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was observed as early as 2008, and the causes were unclear, with (misguided) speculation that imported GPS chips were tampered with code that caused incorrect reporting of coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Jian Shuo|title=All Maps in China are Transformed|url=http://home.wangjianshuo.com/archives/20081109_all_maps_in_china_are_transformed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116215242/http://home.wangjianshuo.com/archives/20081109_all_maps_in_china_are_transformed.htm|archivedate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong and Macau ===
Under [[One Country Two Systems]], legislation in mainland China does not apply in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] [[Special administrative regions of China|SARs]] and there are no similar restrictions in the SARs. Therefore, the GPS shift problem does not apply. However, at the border between the SARs and mainland China, the data shown by online maps are broken&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.hk/maps/@22.5274336,114.0849645,14z |title=Google Maps near Hong Kong-Shenzhen border |publisher=Google Maps |date= |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the shifted data and correct data overlap. This poses problems to users travelling across the border, especially visitors not aware of the issue.

'''Reverse architecture''' is a process of deducing the underlying architecture and design of a system by observing its behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| title=Experience with a reverse architecture approach to increase understanding | work=Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM '99) | date=1999 | publisher=[[IEEE]] | doi=10.1109/ICSM.1999.792596 | first1=A. | last1=von Mayrhauser | first2=J. | last2=Wang | first3=Q. | last3=Li }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the field of [[reverse engineering]].

Practicing reverse architecture is used to decipher the logistics of building. There are a variety of techniques available, the most notable being [[architecture driven modelling]].{{what|date=January 2018}}{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A '''shave brush''' or '''shaving brush''' is a small brush with a handle parallel to the bristles used to apply [[shaving soap]] or [[shaving cream]] to the face when shaving. Shave brushes are often decorative; antique handles are often made from materials such as [[ivory]] or even [[gold]], though the bristle load may be composed of any number of natural or synthetic materials.  The shave brush is used most often today by "[[Shaving#"Traditional" wet shaving|wet shavers]]" in tandem with a double-edged [[safety razor]] or a [[straight razor]].  However, this is not always the case, as shavers of all varieties may employ the tool.

== History ==
[[File:Shaving brush selection in a baber store in London.jpg|thumb|Shaving brushes in a barber supply shop in London.]]
The modern shaving brush may be traced to [[France]] during the 1750s.  The French call a shaving brush ''blaireau'' or "badger."&lt;ref name="shavingbrush.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is it called badger hair?|url=http://shavingbrush.com/why-is-it-called-badger-hair.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality of these brushes differed greatly, as materials used to fashion the handles varied from the common to the exotic.  It was not uncommon for handles to be made of ivory, gold, [[silver]], [[tortoiseshell]], [[crystal]], or [[porcelain]].  The more expensive brushes used badger hair, with cheaper ones using [[boar]]'s or horse's hair.  In the 1800s when the folding-handle straight razor design made it practical for men to shave themselves rather than visit a barber, a shave brush became a status symbol, and an expensive or eccentric brush was a way of asserting one's personality or even affluence.  The recent rapid rise in the popularity of "wet shaving" has raised demand for high quality and custom shaving brushes. 

== Shave brush handles ==

Modern shave brushes are similar in appearance, composition and function to their centuries-old predecessors. Although a variety of different materials are still used to fashion shave brush handles, synthetic handles of [[nylon]], [[polyurethane|urethane]] or [[plastic]] are the most common even by the most expensive shave brush manufacturers.  Benefits of synthetic handles include a lesser chance of breakage and resistance to damage by moisture. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} A limited number of consumers {{Citation Needed|date=October 2015}} prefer natural materials such as [[wood]] or exotic materials such as tortoiseshell.  A shave brush's handle, regardless of its material composition, rarely affects the overall performance of the brush.

== Bristle Knot ==
[[File:Rasierpinsel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soft soap is worked into a foam by vigorously working the soap with a wet brush and then applied to the face or other area to be shaved.]]
A shave brush's price is usually determined more by its bristle load than any other factor except for brushes with very exotic handles. The most expensive brushes often use exotic materials in the handle. The bristles are fixed together into a knot that is installed into the handle. The best quality brushes are hand knotted. Badger and boar brushes are the most commonly found animals used for shaving brush fibers. Badger species include the [[Eurasian badger]] and the [[hog badger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wetshavingproducts.com/badger-hair-grades-a-primer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007134725/http://wetshavingproducts.com/badger-hair-grades-a-primer/ |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Badger brushes are often referred to as two band, or three band. Perhaps all badger hair fibers have three bands, but those used in the brushes conceal the lighter bottom band. Nonetheless, both types of bristle make desirable shaving brushes. Lower-quality brushes are often machine made and the bristles may be trimmed, resulting in sharp, prickly tips.

[[Synthetic fiber|Synthetic]] shave brushes, most often made using nylon bristles, are available in a range of prices and gradations in quality. Comparable to traditional shaving brushes, synthetic fiber brushes can quickly create a rich lather using relatively little shaving soap or cream. The synthetic fibers dry faster than natural hair and are less sensitive to everyday use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sliqhaq.se/pages.php/page/shavingbrush/language/en/currency/EUR&lt;/ref&gt;

Boar's hair brushes are relatively inexpensive, but can be of very high quality. A well-made boar brush will break in with use; the bristles begin to split at their tips, resulting in a brush that is very soft but has considerable backbone. Unlike badger hair and synthetic fibers, boar bristles absorb water, so the brush should be soaked before use.

Badger hair brushes come in a variety of grades, but there is not an industry standard that specifically defines grades of badger hair. Generally speaking, though, there are basic classifications that many manufacturers use to describe the quality of hair used in their brushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.shaving101.com  | title = Understanding Hair Grades of Badger Brushes | publisher = Shaving 101 | accessdate = 2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common gradations of badger hair are "pure" badger, "best" badger, and "super" or "silvertip" badger.  While some companies insist on using other gradations (for example, [[Vulfix]]'s high-end brushes distinguish between "super" and "silvertip"), these three are commonly accepted among wet shavers{{who|date=October 2011}} and are most often used to describe the quality of a shave brush.

===Pure badger===

'''Pure badger''' are badger hair brushes that use the most common hair from the underbelly of a [[badger]], the hair which covers around 60% of a badger's body.  This hair varies greatly in softness, pliability and color.  Pure badger hair is usually dark in color, but fluctuates from a light tan to a near-black or silvery sheen.  The hair is coarser than 'best' or 'silvertip' hair due to its larger shaft.  Brushes made exclusively with pure badger hair cost significantly less than finer badger hair.  Most often, pure badger brush hairs are trimmed to shape, resulting in somewhat stiff, rough ends.

===Best badger===
'''Best badger''' are brushes made with the finer and more pliable hairs from 20 - 25% of the badger's body.  It is longer in length and lighter in color than 'pure' badger hair.  A 'best' badger brush is more densely filled with hair than the 'pure' badger brush and will produce a correspondingly greater lather.  However, some wet shavers argue that the variance between the quality of a 'pure' and a 'best' badger brush is negligible.  Best badger and better quality brush hairs are often fit so that the ends do not have to be cut to shape.

=== Super badger===
[[File:Super-badger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Super badger &lt;ref&gt;Image of the [https://www.flickr.com/photos/54858377@N02/5082984842/ super badger]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''super badger''' brush is more expensive than either 'best' or 'pure'. While some call this hair 'silvertip', it is often highly graded 'pure' hair bleached on the ends to resemble silvertip.

Though it is composed of 'pure' badger hairs, 'super' is graded and sorted to such a degree that its performance is superior to that of 'best'.  The brush is not prickly.

One way to determine if a brush bears a 'super' or 'silvertip' badger hair load is to look at the color of the bristle tips.  A true 'silvertip' brush has tips that are an off-white. A 'super' brush on the other hand has bristle tips that are a more sterile, slightly greyed white; moreover, the light color of the tips does not extend as far down the shaft of the hair.

===Silvertip badger===
[[File:Silverip-badger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A silvertip badger hair brush&lt;ref&gt;Image of a [http://www.virtualvillage.com/silvertip-badger-hair-shaving-brush-with-black-handle-001010-006.html Silvertip Badger Hair Shaving Brush]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Silvertip badger''' is the most expensive and rare type of badger hair. The tips on this hair appear white naturally, without bleaching.  A "flared" bristle load results in the 'silvertip' brush's fluffy appearance and lends the brush its ability to hold a large amount of water.  Due to its water retention capacity, a 'silvertip' brush can create well-formed shaving lather quickly and easily.

Some manufacturers such as Plisson, Simpsons and [[R. A. Rooney &amp; Sons|Rooney]] sell shaving brushes in a grade beyond silvertip.  While the names these companies give this 'extra silvertip' vary, the properties remain fairly consistent between manufacturers as compared to the 'ordinary silvertip' brush. These brushes differ in appearance (the tip is whiter and extends further down the shaft; additionally, the hair under the tip is pure black as opposed to dark grey in color) and feel (the extra silvertip feels slightly firmer and less "prickly" on the face when lathering).

== Sources of brush hair ==

Because badgers are a protected species in North America&lt;ref&gt;[ American badgers are fairly common in appropriate habitats and are not generally considered threatened. In some areas they are uncommon or rare. In Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and British Columbia they are protected from hunting by law. (Kurta, 1995; Long, 1999; Sullivan, 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; and most of Europe, virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in various grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiply to the point of becoming a crop nuisance{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and sell the hair to processors. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] stopped using badger hair in its [[The Art of Shaving|Art of Shaving]] products following a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] investigation of several badger-hair farms and brush-making factories in Shijiazhuang, China, and video that showed a worker beating a badger with a chair leg before slaughtering it for its fur.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Galligan, "P&amp;G stops using badger hair in Art of Shaving brushes after PETA sounds alarm over industry abuses in China," [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/peta-persuades-pg-to-stop-using-animal-hair-in-brushes.html CNBC], 19 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boar bristles are available cheaply from many sources. Brushes made in China or India with boar bristle are supplied wholesale, while even the cheapest wholesale Badger brush costs at least $10; even the cost difference between badger brushes with resin handles vs. expensive horn handles shows that, except with exotic materials such as sterling silver, special woods, ivory, bone or custom materials, badger hair is the costliest element of a brush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.primandprep.com/interview-andreas-muller-ceo-of-muhle/|title=Interview with CEO of MÜHLE (Shaving Brush Manufacturer)|date=2018-09-26|work=PrimandPrep|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for boar-hair brushes to have part of the bristles dyed to resemble badger hair.

Brushes with nylon-only bristles are available.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Horse hair brushes are coming back, after a hiatus of nearly 100 years following an anthrax scare around [[World War I]]. Material for horse hair shaving brushes is cut from the horse's mane or tail, and the animal is not harmed.&lt;ref&gt;http://sharpologist.com/2012/08/horse-hair-shaving-brushes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of using a shaving brush ==
[[File:Shaving-Set.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A shaving set with a razor and brush on a stand.]]
A fibrous bristle load holds significant amounts of water which mix with the soap lifted from a [[Shaving mug#Shaving mugs and scuttles|shaving mug or scuttle]]. The more water a brush holds, the moister and richer a lather will be. Thicker and more emollient lather translates to less razor skipping and dragging.

Bringing a shave brush across one's skin produces a mild [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]]. Because a shave brush is most often used with a shave [[soap]], this effect often replaces the pre-shave routine of washing and applying lotion to the face.

A shave brush also lifts facial hair before a shave, requiring less pressure from the razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Short Message Peer-to-Peer''' ('''SMPP''') in the telecommunications industry is an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communication interface for the transfer of [[short message service|short message]] data between [[External Short Messaging Entity|External Short Messaging Entities]] (ESMEs), Routing Entities (REs) and [[Short Message service center|Message Centres]].&lt;ref name="smpp50"&gt;[http://docs.nimta.com/smppv50.pdf Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol Specification v5.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMPP is often used to allow third parties (e.g. [[value-added service provider]]s like news organizations) to submit messages, often in bulk, but it may be used for SMS peering as well. SMPP is able to carry [[Short Message Service|short messages]] including [[Enhanced Messaging Service|EMS]], [[voicemail]] notifications, [[Cell Broadcast]]s, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] messages including [[Wireless Application Protocol#WAP Push|WAP Push]] messages (used to deliver [[Multimedia Message Service|MMS]] notifications), [[Unstructured Supplementary Service Data|USSD]] messages and others. Because of its versatility and support for non-[[GSM]] SMS protocols, like [[UMTS]], [[IS-95]] (CDMA), [[CDMA2000]], [[IS-136|ANSI-136]] (TDMA) and [[iDEN]], SMPP is the most commonly used protocol for short message exchange outside [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]] networks.

==History==

SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) was originally designed by [[Aldiscon]], a small [[Ireland|Irish]] company that was later acquired by [[Logica]] (since 2016, after a number of changes [[Mavenir]]).  The protocol was originally created by a developer, Ian J Chambers, to test functionality of the [[short message service center|SMSC]] without using SS7 test equipment to submit messages. In 1999, Logica formally handed over SMPP to the SMPP Developers Forum, later renamed as The SMS Forum and now disbanded. The SMPP protocol specifications are still available through the website which also carries a notice stating that it will be taken down at the end of 2007. As part of the original handover terms, SMPP ownership has now returned to Mavenir due to the disbanding of the SMS forum.

To date SMPP development is suspended and SMS forum is disbanded. From SMS forum website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;July 31, 2007 - The SMS Forum, a non-profit organization with a mission to develop, foster and promote SMS (short message service) to the benefit of the global wireless industry will disband by July 27, 2007&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A press release, attached to the news, also warns that site will be suspended soon. In spite of this the site is still mostly functioning and specifications can still be downloaded (as of 31 January 2012).

The site has ceased operation according to Cormac Long, former technical moderator and webmaster for the SMS Forum. Please contact Mavenir for the SMPP specification. The files may also be available from other websites, including [https://smscarrier.com/documentation/ SMSCarrier - Documentation for SMPP APIs].

==Operation==

Contrary to its name, the SMPP uses the [[client-server model]] of operation. The [[short message service center|Short Message Service Center (SMSC)]] usually acts as a server, awaiting connections from ESMEs. When SMPP is used for SMS peering, the sending MC usually acts as a client.

The protocol is based on pairs of request/response PDUs ([[protocol data unit]]s, or packets) exchanged over [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] layer 4 ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session or [[X.25]] SVC3) connections. The [[well-known port]] assigned by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] for SMPP when operating over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] is 2775, but multiple arbitrary port numbers are often used in messaging environments.

Before exchanging any messages, a bind command must be sent and acknowledged. The bind command determines in which direction will be possible to send messages; bind_transmitter only allows client to submit messages to the server, bind_receiver means that the client will only receive the messages, and bind_transceiver (introduced in SMPP 3.4) allows message transfer in both directions. In the bind command the ESME identifies itself using system_id, system_type and password; the address_range field designed to contain ESME address is usually left empty. The bind command contains interface_version parameter to specify which version of SMPP protocol will be used.

Message exchange may be synchronous, where each peer waits for a response for each PDU being sent, or asynchronous, where multiple requests can be issued without waiting and acknowledged in a skew order by the other peer; the number of unacknowledged requests is called a ''window''; for the best performance both communicating sides must be configured with the same window size.

===Versions===

The SMPP standard has evolved during the time. The most commonly used versions of SMPP are:

* SMPP 3.3 the oldest used version (despite its limitations, it is still widely used); supports [[GSM]] only. All messages sent, generates immediate response.
* SMPP 3.4 adds [[Type-length-value|Tag-Length-Value]] (TLV) parameters, support of non-GSM SMS technologies and the [[transceiver]] support (single connections that can send and receive messages). The exchange of SMPP request and response PDUs between an ESME Transmitter and SMSC may occur synchronously or asynchronously.
* SMPP 5.0 is the latest version of SMPP; adds support for cell broadcasting

The applicable version is passed in the interface_version parameter of a bind command.

==PDU format (after version 3.4)==

The SMPP PDUs are [[Binary protocol|binary encoded]] for efficiency. They start with a header which may be followed by a body:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|- 
| style="background: black; color: white; font-weight: bold" colspan="5" | SMPP PDU
|-
| colspan="4" | PDU Header (mandatory)
| PDU Body (Optional)
|-
| Command &lt;br&gt; length || Command &lt;br&gt; Id || Command &lt;br&gt; Status || Sequence &lt;br&gt; Number || PDU Body
|- 
| 4 octets
|  colspan="4" | Length = (Command Length value - 4) octets
|}

===PDU header===

Each PDU starts with a header. The header consists of 4 fields, each of length of 4 octets:

;command_length: Is the overall length of the PDU in octets (including command_length field itself); must be ≥ 16 as each PDU must contain the 16 octet header
;command_id: Identifies the SMPP operation (or command)
;command_status: Always has a value of 0 in requests; in responses it carries information about the result of the operation
;sequence_number: Is used to correlate requests and responses within an SMPP session; allows asynchronous communication (using a [[Sliding window protocol|sliding window]] method)

All numeric fields in SMPP use the [[big endian]] order, which means that the first octet is the Most Significant Byte (MSB).

==Example==
This is an example of the binary encoding of a 60-octet ''submit_sm'' PDU. The data is shown in Hex [[Octet (computing)|octet]] values as a single dump and followed by a header and body break-down of that PDU.

This is best compared with the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the SMPP specification in order to understand how the encoding matches the field by field definition.

The value break-downs are shown with decimal in parentheses and Hex values after that. Where you see one or several hex octets appended, this is because the given field size uses 1 or more octets encoding.

Again, reading the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the spec will make all this clearer.

===PDU header===
 'command_length', (60) ... 00 00 00 3C
 'command_id', (4) ... 00 00 00 04
 'command_status', (0) ... 00 00 00 00
 'sequence_number', (5) ... 00 00 00 05

===PDU body===
 'service_type', () ... 00
 'source_addr_ton', (2) ... 02
 'source_addr_[[Numbering plan|npi]]', (8) ... 08
 'source_addr', (555) ... 35 35 35 00
 'dest_addr_ton', (1) ... 01
 'dest_addr_[[Numbering plan|npi]]', (1) ... 01
 'dest_addr', (555555555) ... 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 00
 'esm_class', (0) ... 00
 'protocol_id', (0) ... 00
 'priority_flag', (0) ... 00
 'schedule_delivery_time', (0) ... 00
 'validity_period', (0) ... 00
 'registered_delivery', (0) ... 00
 'replace_if_present_flag', (0) ... 00
 'data_coding', (3) ... 03
 'sm_default_msg_id', (0) ... 00
 'sm_length', (15) ... 0F
 'short_message', (Hello Wikipedia) ... 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69 61

Note that the text in the short_message field must match the data_coding. When the data_coding is 8 (UCS2), the text must be in UCS-2BE (or its extension, [[UTF-16|UTF-16BE]]). When the data_coding indicates a 7-bit encoding, each septet is stored in a separate octet in the short_message field (with the most significant bit set to 0). SMPP 3.3 data_coding exactly copied TP-DCS values of [[Data Coding Scheme|GSM 03.38]], which make it suitable only for GSM 7-bit default alphabet, UCS2 or binary messages; SMPP 3.4 introduced a new list of data_coding values:

The meaning of the data_coding=4 or 8 is the same as in SMPP 3.3. Other values in the range 1-15 are reserved in SMPP 3.3. Unfortunately, unlike SMPP 3.3, where data_coding=0 was unambiguously GSM 7-bit default alphabet, for SMPP 3.4 and higher the GSM 7-bit default alphabet is missing in this list, and data_coding=0 may differ for various [[Short message service center]]s—it may be [[ISO-8859-1]], [[ASCII]], GSM 7-bit default alphabet, [[UTF-8]] or even configurable per ESME. When using data_coding=0, both sides (ESME and SMSC) must be sure they consider it the same encoding. Otherwise it is better not to use data_coding=0. It may be tricky to use GSM 7-bit default alphabet, some [[Short message service center]]s requires data_coding=0, others e.g. data_coding=241.

== Quirks ==

Despite its wide acceptance, the SMPP has a number of problematic features:

* No data_coding for GSM 7-bit default alphabet
* Not standardized meaning of data_coding=0
* Unclear support for Shift-JIS encoding
* Incompatibility of submit_sm_resp between SMPP versions
* Using of SMPP 3.3 SMSC Delivery Receipts, especially the Message Id format in them

=== No data_coding for GSM 7-bit default alphabet ===

Although data_coding values in SMPP 3.3 are based on the [[GSM 03.38]], since SMPP 3.4 there is no data_coding value for GSM 7-bit alphabet ([[GSM 03.38]]).  However, it is common for DCS=0 to indicate the GSM 7-bit alphabet, particularly for SMPP connections to SMSCs on GSM mobile networks.

=== Not standardized meaning of data_coding=0 ===

According to SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 the data_coding=0 means ″SMSC Default Alphabet″. Which encoding it really is, depends on the type of the SMSC and its configuration.

=== Unclear support for Shift-JIS encoding ===

One of the encodings in CDMA standard C.R1001 is [[Shift-JIS]] used for Japanese. SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 specifies three encodings for Japanese (JIS, ISO-2022-JP and Extended Kanji JIS), but none of them is identical with CDMA MSG_ENCODING 00101. It seems that the Pictogram encoding (data_coding=9) is used to carry the messages in Shift-JIS in SMPP.

=== Incompatibility of submit_sm_resp between SMPP versions ===

When a submit_sm fails, the SMSC returns a submit_sm_resp with non-zero value of command_status and ″empty″ message_id.

* SMPP 3.3 explicitly states about the message_id field ″If absent this field must contain a single NULL byte″. The length of the PDU is at least 17 octets.
* SMPP 3.4 contains an unfortunate note in the SUBMIT_SM_RESP section ″The submit_sm_resp PDU Body is not returned if the command_status field contains a non-zero value.″ Then the length of the PDU is 16 octets.
* SMPP 5.0 just specifies that message_id is a mandatory parameter of the type C-Octet string of the submit_sm_resp message. According to the section 3.1.1 NULL Settings, ″A NULL string ″″ is encoded as 0x00″. The length of the PDU is at least 17 octets.

For the best compatibility, any SMPP implementation should accept both variants of negative submit_sm_resp regardless of the version of SMPP standard used for the communication.

Comment from Cormac Long 
(I worked on three versions of SMPP specification in Aldiscon/Logica and designed the ESME solution for Openmind Networks)
The original intention of error scenarios was that no body would be returned in the PDU response. This was the standard behavior exhibited on all Aldiscon/Logica SMSC and also in most of the other vendors. When SMPP 3.4 was being taken on by the WAP forum, several clarifications were requested on whether a body should be included with NACKed response and measures were taken to clarify this in several places in the specification including the submit_sm section and also in the bind_transceiver section. What should have been done was to add the clarification that we eventually added in V5.0.. that bodies are not supposed to be included in error responses. Some vendors have been very silly in their implementations including bodies on rejected bind_transmitter responses but not on bind_transceiver responses etc. The recommendation I would make to vendors.. as suggested above.. accept both variants. But its also wise to allow yourself issue NACKed submit_sm_resp and deliver_sm_resp PDUs with and without an empty body. In the case of these two PDUs, that empty body will look like a single NULL octet at the end of the stream. The reason you may need this ability to include what I call dummy bodies with NACKed requests is that the other side of the equation may be unable or unwilling to change their implementation to tolerate the missing body.

=== Message ID in SMPP 3.3 SMSC Delivery Receipts ===

The only way how to pass delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 is to put information in a text form to the short_message field; however, the format of the text is described in Appendix B of SMPP 3.4, although SMPP 3.4 may (and should) use receipted_message_id and message_state for the purpose. While SMPP 3.3 states that Message ID is a C-Octet String (Hex) of up to 8 characters (plus terminating '\0'), the SMPP 3.4 states that the id field in the Delivery Receipt Format is a C-Octet String (Decimal) of up to 10 characters. This splits SMPP implementations to 2 groups:

* Implementations using the decimal representation of an integer Message Id in the id field of the Delivery Receipt body and the hexadecimal representation of an integer Message Id in message_id and receipted_message_id fields
* Implementations using the same hexadecimal number (or even the same arbitrary string) both in message_id parameter and in the id field of the Delivery Receipt body, which strictly speaking, violates the SMPP standard

== Extensibility, compatibility and interoperability ==

Since introduction of [[Type-length-value|Tag-Length-Value]] (TLV) parameters in version 3.4, the SMPP may be regarded an [[Extensibility|extensible]] protocol. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of compatibility and [[interoperability]] any implementation should apply the Internet [[robustness principle]]: ″Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept″. It should use a minimal set of features which are necessary to accomplish a task. And if the goal is communication and not quibbling, each implementation should overcome minor nonconformities with standard:

* Respond with a generic_nack with command_status=3 to any unrecognised SMPP command, but do not stop the communication.
* Ignore any unrecognised, unexpected or unsupported TLV parameters.
* The borders of PDUs are always given by the PDUs' command_length field. Any message field must not exceed the end of PDU. If a field is not properly finished, it should be treated as truncated at the end of PDU, and it should not affect further PDUs.

Information applicable to one version of SMPP can often be found in another version of SMPP; e.g. the only way how to pass delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 is to put information in a text form to the short_message field; however, the format of the text is described in Appendix B of SMPP 3.4, although SMPP 3.4 may (and should) use receipted_message_id and message_state for the purpose.

== Security ==
The SMPP protocol is designed on a clear-text binary protocol which needs to be considered if using for potentially sensitive information such as one-time passwords via SMS. There are, however, implementations of SMPP over secure SSL/TLS if required.

A '''survival kit''' is a package of basic tools and supplies prepared in advance as an aid to [[survival skills|survival]] in an emergency. Civil and [[military aircraft]], [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, and [[spacecraft]] are equipped with survival kits.

Survival kits, in a variety of sizes, contain supplies and tools to provide a survivor with basic shelter against the elements, help him or her to keep warm, meet basic health and first aid needs, provide food and water, signal to rescuers, and assist in finding the way back to help. Supplies in a survival kit normally contain a knife (often a [[Swiss army knife]] or a [[multi-tool]]), matches, [[tinder]], [[first aid kit]], bandana, fish hooks, sewing kit, and a [[flashlight]].

Civilians such as forestry workers, surveyors, or bush pilots, who work in remote locations or in regions with extreme climate conditions may also be equipped with survival kits. Disaster supplies are also kept on hand by those who live in areas prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters. For the average citizen to practice disaster preparedness, some towns will have [[survival store]]s to keep survival supplies in stock.

The American Red Cross recommends an emergency preparedness kit that is easy to carry and use in the event of an emergency or disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.53fabf6cc033f17a2b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=537b218c37752210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;currPage=e507d7aada352210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD |title=Be Red Cross Ready - Get a kit.

== General contents ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The general contents of an emergency survival kit depend on the location. Basic components in a survival kit address the needs of first aid, food, water, shelter, navigation, and signalling.

=== Shelter and warmth ===
A variety of materials are recommended for emergency shelters, and vary between geographic regions. Options often included in survival kits may consist of:

* Reflective "aluminized" (Mylar coated) [[space blanket]] or survival blanket to retain body heat (and signal)
* Lightweight [[poncho]] for protection against wind and rain (and for collecting rain)
* "Tube tent" or [[bivvy bag]]
* [[Tarpaulin|Tarp]] with grommets or tie-tapes (best if nylon or polyester)
* Large plastic [[trash bag]] as poncho, expedient shelter roof, or rain collector
* [[Ferrocerium]] rod (AKA "Metal match", "Hot Spark", "Firesteel", "Magnesium fire starter") and [[fire striker]] for fire-starting, [[Fire piston]] or [[Solar Spark Lighter]]
* [[Match#Special-purpose matches|Waterproof match]]es or [[lighter]]
* [[Cotton ball]]s or pads smeared with [[petroleum jelly]] for fire starting (can be carried in 35&amp;nbsp;mm film container, zip lock baggie or heat-sealed inside large diameter plastic straw)
* [[Catalytic heater]] and bottled gas fuel
* Emergency sleeping bag great for shelter and warmth

=== Health and first aid ===

[[First aid kits]] will often include a combination of the following:

* [[Bandage]]s such as sterile combine dressing and [[gauze]] pads
* Adhesive tape, and gauze tape or disinfectant pads
* A 30-day supply of personal prescription medication
* [[Antibiotic]] cream/[[Rubbing alcohol]]
* Burn cream
* [[Aspirin]]
* [[Sunscreen]] (where appropriate, above 30 {{Abbr|SPF|Sun Protection Factor}})
* 100% UV protective sunglasses ("UV 400") (protects eyes from harmful UV radiation. Polarized glasses are not necessarily UV protective, but aid with glare only)
* Surgical suture (for sewing up major wounds)

=== Food and water ===
Most survival kits involve sustenance for short periods of time, to be used and replenished before contents spoil.

* Water in sealed containers for dry areas, or [[Portable water purification|water purification tablets]] or household bleach in areas where water is available but may be contaminated. For emergency water purification see: [[Water purification#Other water purification techniques|water purification techniques]]
* [[Canteen (bottle)|Canteen]] full of water, and a filter if needed
* Heavy duty aluminum foil to create a distillation tube to remove salt from salt water during boiling/condensation. Must have another receptacle to collect condensation.
* [[Canned food]], Meals Ready-to-Eat ([[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]]), high-energy foods such as chocolate or emergency food bars, or dry food items such as dried fruits, cereals, nuts or roasted [[Gram (disambiguation)#Agriculture and horticulture|grams]]
* Fishing line and gear (fish hooks, lures, and split shot leads)
* Snare wire
* [[Gillnetting]] (for emergency fishing)
* Spear tip (for spearing fish and other small animals)

=== Signaling, navigation and reference ===
[[File:Signal mirror 2x3 plastic USMC.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine signalling an aircraft with a [[Mirror#Signalling|signal mirror]].]]
Since the primary goal of a survival kit for lost or injured persons is rescue, this part of the kit may be considered the most essential. Key elements for rescue include:

* [[Distress radiobeacon]]
* [[Whistle]]
* [[Mirror#Signalling|Signal mirror]]
* High power [[LED light]] (able to have batteries replaced, and carry an extra battery), white lens, with signaling capabilities. Strobe versions are available for some lights. Use lithium cells only, due to superior shelf life.
* Flare: three fires in a triangle is the international [[distress signal]]
* [[Laser pointer]] (or green laser) with lithium batteries, for superior signaling range. Laser pointers have resulted in at least one rescue: during the night in August 2010 two men and a boy were rescued from marshland after their red laser pen was spotted by rescue teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=415061&amp;SubjectId=12 |title=UK Marine and Coastguard Agency |publisher=Nds.coi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229133933/http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=415061&amp;SubjectId=12 |archivedate=2011-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Surveyor's tape - [[orange (color)|orange]] or [[chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]] for marking location for rescuers
* Pen/pencil and paper for leaving notes to rescuers about direction of travel
* Compass. Analog watch can also be used to determine orientation when the sun is visible - ''See [[Direction Finding Watch|direction finding using a watch]]''
* [[Trail maps]]/[[Nautical chart|charts]] (if location is known in advance)
* [[Survival manual]] for technique reference
* Glow stick

=== Multipurpose tools or materials ===
Survival kit tools emphasize portability and versatility. Tools recommended for many types of survival kit include:
[[File:Bow Saw (PSF).jpg|thumb|Bow saws about {{convert|24|in|cm}} in length are lightweight and fast-cutting.]]
[[File:Portable stove.jpg|thumb|right|A small Snow Peak portable stove running on MSR gas and the stove's carrying case]]
* Fixed-blade [[knife]], or [[multitool]] such as a [[Swiss Army knife]].
* Can opener such as the [[P-38 can opener|P-38]] or the P-51
* Heavy-duty needle and thread for repairing clothing and equipment
* Red or orange plastic bag(s) or trash bags
* Sturdy cord or "550" [[parachute cord]] for setting up a [[tarpaulin]] and snaring small animals
* [[Hatchet]] with sheath for cold conditions, or [[machete]] for tropical conditions (shelter and fire)
* Camp stove or some type of gas burner and fuel such as bottled propane or [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG)
* Candles for light, signaling, fire-starting
* Metal [[billycan]] or "water bottle" for water storage, boiling, purification, cooking
* Compact saw such as [[Japanese saw|Japanese]] style [[backsaw]] with coarse teeth (folding models available). Bow saws can quickly cut larger diameter limbs and small to medium thick trees, and Folding saws can be small enough to fit into a kit, but big enough to cut small to medium diameter limbs, and possibly smaller trees.
*[[Solar charger]]
* Helmet
* Bandanna or scarf
* Bullet proof armor (such as soft body armor for pistol calibers).  This can be used for protection in urban settings.  Bullet proof armor may be placed in a carrier and worn on the body, or may be inserted into a bag or backpack.

== Lifeboat survival kits ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Lifeboat survival kits are stowed in inflatable or rigid lifeboats or [[lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]]s; the contents of these kits are mandated by coast guard or maritime regulations. These kits provide basic survival tools and supplies to enable passengers to survive until they are rescued. In addition to relying on lifeboat survival kits, many mariners will assemble a "ditch bag" or "abandon ship bag" containing additional survival supplies. Lifeboat survival kit items typically include:

; Safety equipment:
* [[Personal flotation device|Life jackets]]
* [[First aid kit]]
* [[Fire extinguisher]]
* [[Bucket]]

; Communications and navigation:
* [[Compass]]
* Distress beacons or ([[EPIRB]]s) to alert the [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|Cospas-Sarsat rescue consortium]], an international satellite-based search and rescue distress alert agency and identify the registered beacon owner's specific information from their registration file
* Red [[flare]], rocket parachute flare, and/or smoke signal flare
* [[Laser pointer]] for signaling aircraft (red is color of distress, but green color is higher power and will be seen farther), with lithium cells, in double waterproof plastic pouch (pointers of high power are a theoretical hazard to eyes of low-flying pilots at night)
* [[corner reflector|Radar reflector]] (to help rescuers locate the raft)
* Lighter
* [[Lantern]] and fuel, the fuel doubles as firestarter
* Radio [[transceiver]], standard VHF marine when operating near inland shore, 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz AM VHF guard channel capable aircraft band transceiver to contact rescuers and high overflying commercial and military aircraft visible by contrails, an optional amateur radio if a licensed radio amateur, (see [[Ham Radio]]) or an [[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]]/Weather/[[Shortwave radio receiver]] to receive precise time for celestial navigation as well as weather information
* [[GPS navigation device]]

; Food and water
* A [[knife]], [[multi-tool]], and/or [[Swiss army knife]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doomsdaynews.com/doomsday-prepping/ |title=Doomsday Prepping |publisher=www.doomsdaynews.com |date=September 23, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102024705/http://www.doomsdaynews.com/doomsday-prepping/ |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fishing kit
* [[Rainwater]] collection equipment
* Seawater [[desalination]] kit
* Water (typically 3 liters/person/day)
* [[Emergency rations|Emergency high-calorie rations/food]] (not as important as water). Chocolate has a superior calorie/weight ratio
* [[Hatchet]]

; Other tools and boating items
* Waterproof flashlight
* Heaving line
* [[Ladder]]
* Bailer
* [[Bilge pump]]
* Boat hook
* [[Sea anchor]] (also called a "sea drogue")

== Military kits ==

Survival kits for military aviators are often modified according to the environment of operations:

* In desert areas, survival kits may have more water and sunscreen, and have additional items such as shade hats, a compass, a whistle, medical equipment, tinder, matches, and sun glasses.

The US Army uses several basic survival kits, mainly for aviators, some of which are stored in carrying bags. Aviators in planes with ejection seats have survival kits in a vest and the seat pan, the survival vest worn by US helicopter crews also contains some basic survival items.

== Spacecraft kits ==
[[Astronaut]]s are provided with survival kits due to the difficulty of predicting where a [[spacecraft]] will land on its [[reentry|return to earth]], especially in the case of an equipment failure. In early US space flights, the kit was optimised for survival at sea; the one provided for [[John Glenn]] on the first American space flight in [[Friendship 7]] contained "a life raft, pocket knife, [[heliograph|signaling mirror]], [[shark repellent]], [[Desalination|seawater desalting]] tablets, sunscreen, soap, first aid kit, and other items".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/survival-kit-friendship-7-ma-6 |title=Survival Kit, Friendship 7 (MA-6) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=airandspace.si.edu |publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum |access-date=10 December |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220113452/https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/survival-kit-friendship-7-ma-6 |archivedate=2016-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A survival kit was provided for the [[Apollo program]] which was "...designed to provide a 48-hour postlanding (water or land) survival capability for three crewmen between 40 degrees North and South latitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo11_Press-Kit_restored.pdf |title=Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Mission Press Kit |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.hq.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |access-date=10 December 2016 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116023445/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo11_Press-Kit_restored.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2016 |df= }} (p. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; It contained "a survival radio, a survival light assembly, desalter kits, a [[machete]], sunglasses, water cans, sun lotion, a blanket, a pocket knife, netting and foam pads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/rucksack-1-survival-kit-apollo-15 |title=Rucksack #1, Survival Kit, Apollo 15 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=airandspace.si.edu |publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum |access-date=10 December |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825204238/https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/rucksack-1-survival-kit-apollo-15 |archivedate=2017-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kits provided for Soviet and Russian Cosmonauts are optimised for survival in the temperate and sub-arctic mountains, forests and grasslands in the east of the country. [[Soyuz spacecraft]] kits include "food rations, water bottles, warm clothing, rope for making a shelter using the capsule’s parachute, fish hooks and miscellaneous other survival gear". The [[TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol]], was provided to defend against predators such as wolves or bears. It was able to fire conventional bullets, [[shotgun]] cartridges and flares; the [[folding stock]] could be used as a shovel and it also had a fold-out machete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23131359/#.WEvlw9KLSUk |title=Russia has the corner on guns in space |last=Oberg |first=James |date=12 February 2012 |website=www.nbcnews.com |publisher=NBC News |access-date=10 December 2016 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107154352/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23131359#.WEvlw9KLSUk |archivedate=7 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mini survival kits ==

"[[Mini survival kits]]" or "[[Altoids]] tin" survival kits are small kits that contain a few basic survival tools. These kits often include a small compass, waterproof matches, minimum fishing tackle, large plastic bag, small candle, jigsaw blade, craft knife or scalpel blade, and/or a safety pin/s. Pre-packaged survival kits may also include instructions in survival techniques, including fire-starting or first aid methods. In addition, parachute cord can be wrapped around the tin. The parachute cord can be used for setting up an emergency shelter or snaring small animals. They are designed to fit within a container roughly the size of a mint tin.
[[File:Fire Making Survival Kit.jpg|thumb|Fire making kit contained in tin]]
Other small kits are wearable and built into [[everyday carry]] survival bracelets or belts. Most often these are [[paracord]] bracelets with tools woven inside. Several tools such as firestarter, buckles, whistles and compass are on the exterior of the gear and smaller tools are woven inside the jewelry or belt and only accessible by taking the bracelet apart.

Lightweight survival kits are generally seen as a backup means of survival; however, these can kits can be extensive, and have come to include tools that are generally found in larger kits as survival technology advances.  Some examples of these tools are high power flashlights, rapid use saws, signal devices such as mini signal mirrors, and water purification methods.

== Vehicle kits ==

Another level in some preparedness plans are Vehicle Kits. In some cases, supplies and equipment may be loaded into vehicle such as a van or truck with bicycle racks and an extra “reserve” gas tank. Some survivalists also carry a small (e.g., 250 cc) off-road-capable motorcycle in the van or truck.

Food supplies in a bug-out vehicle include hundreds of pounds of wheat, rice, and beans, and enough honey, powdered milk, canned goods, bottled fruit, vitamins, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, salt, pepper, spices, and oil for several months. In addition, the kits often contain high-calorie energy bars, a cooking kit, utensils, liquid soap, and towels. The water supplies may include bottled water, filtering kit, bottles, collapsible water containers, and chlorine bleach for water purification. Food preparation and washing equipment may include items such as a grain grinder, a bread mixer, a strainer, a manual can opener, a steam canner with canning jars and O-rings, cutlery, knives, an electric 12-volt cooler icebox, kerosene lamps and heaters, kerosene or propane stoves, extra fuel, a clothes wringer, a foot-operated treadle sewing machine, and an electric hot plate (which would require an inverter to operate off a car battery).

The medical supplies may include a blood pressure gauge, stethoscope, scissors, tweezers, forceps, disposable scalpels, two thermometers (oral and rectal), inflatable splints, bandages, sutures, adhesive tape, gauze, burn ointment, antibiotic ointment, aspirin, rubbing alcohol, ipecac syrup, sterile water, cotton rags, soap, and cotton swabs.

The transportation items may include bicycles with off-road tires and suspension, emergency tools and spare auto parts (e.g., fuses, fan belts, light bulbs, head light, tire pump, etc.), and an inflatable raft with paddles.

In addition, the kits may contain typical individual "survival kit" items, such as nylon tarps, extra clothes and coats, blankets, sleeping bags, matches or other fire starting equipment, a compass and maps, flashlights, toilet paper, soap, a pocket knife and bowie knife, a fishing kit, a portable camping stove, a [[power inverter]], backpack, paper and pencil, a signaling mirror, whistle, cable saw, bleach, insect repellent, magnifying glass, rope and nylon cord, pulleys, and a pistol and ammunition.

The communications equipment may include a multi-band receiver/scanner, a citizens band (CB) radio, portable "walkie-talkies" with rechargeable batteries, and a portable battery-powered television. The power supplies may include a diesel or gasoline generator with a one-month fuel supply, an auto battery and charger, extension cord, flashlights, rechargeable batteries (with recharger), an electric multi meter, and a test light. Defense items include a revolver, semi-automatic pistol, rifle, shotgun, ammunition, mace or pepper spray, and a large knife such as a [[KA-BAR]] or a bowie knife.

Tools may include cutting tools such as saws, axes and hatchets; mechanical advantage aids such as a pry bar or wrecking bar, ropes, pulleys, or a '[[come-a-long]]" hand-operated winch; construction tools such as pliers, chisels, a hammer, screwdrivers, a hand-operated twist drill, vise grip pliers, glue, nails, nuts, bolts, and screws; mechanical repair tools such as an arc welder, an oxy-acetylene torch, a propane torch with a spark lighter, a solder iron and flux, wrench set, a nut driver, a tap and die set, a socket set, and a [[fire extinguisher]]. As well, some survivalists bring barterable items such as fishing line, liquid soap, insect repellent, light bulbs, can openers, extra fuels, motor oil, and ammunition.

== Natural disasters ==

The US government's Homeland Security website provides a list of in-home emergency kit items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ready.gov/kit Basic Disaster Supplies Kit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801005927/https://www.ready.gov/kit |date=2016-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list focuses on the basics of survival: fresh water, food, clean air and materials to maintain body warmth. These basic survival items comprised into a kit are known as a [[Bug-out bag]]. The recommended basic emergency kit items include:

== Bug-out bags ==
{{main|Bug-out bag}}

The term "survival kit" may also refer to the larger, portable survival kits prepared by [[Survivalism|survivalists]], called "bug-out bags" (BOBs), "Personal Emergency Relocation Kits" (PERKs) or "get out of Dodge" (GOOD) kits, which are packed into backpacks, or even duffel bags. These kits are designed specifically to be more easily carried by the individual in case alternate forms of transportation are unavailable or impossible to use.

These bags contain supplies such as food, water purification equipment, clothing, medical equipment, communications gear, and tools.

It follows newly re-instated [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). The season's storyline picks up directly after last season's [[My Struggle II|finale]] and the search for Mulder and Scully's son [[Baby William|William]] is the main story arc of the season.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

==Plot overview==
[[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) wakes up in the hospital after having a seizure, now realizing the events of "[[My Struggle II]]" were a vision and haven't actually happened yet. Mulder initially presumes Scully’s ramblings are a product of her illness but leaves the hospital to investigate. Agent [[Jeffrey Spender]] later appears at Scully’s bedside, revealing that someone is looking for [[Baby William|William]]. He first balks at telling her the location of her son, revealing only the name of the family that adopted him - [[William (The X-Files)|Van De Kamp]]. Mulder tails a henchman who he believes will take him to The Smoking Man, but he arrives somewhere else with mysterious conspirators; Mr. Y (A.C. Peterson) and Erika Price ([[Barbara Hershey]]). They try to negotiate with Mulder into turning over his son but Mulder refuses. [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) tries to meet with Scully, but can't find her. As he goes to his car, he is met inside by The Smoking Man and Reyes. Meanwhile, Scully tries to leave the hospital but her seizures return causing her to crash her car. She is rescued by Agent Einstein and Agent Miller, and is readmitted to the hospital. Both agents leave the room. An assassin sent by Mr. Y and Erika enters and tries to suffocate Scully, but Mulder steps in and saves her by slicing the assassin's neck. As Skinner comes in, Mulder confronts him since he smells like smoke. In a flashback to when Skinner was in the car with the Smoking Man, the latter reveals (in a further flashback to 17 years, "[[En Ami]]") that ''he'', not Mulder, artificially impregnated Scully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=My Struggle III | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 11  | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scully opens her eyes in the dark, laying on her side on a bed in a mysterious house. She explores the mysterious house and ends up in an endless pattern of the same room. Mulder theorizes that the experience is a type of sleep paralysis. She goes back to her memories of her sleep paralysis, where she grabs a snow globe with a model of the boat in it. Mulder and Scully get to the dock, meeting with Detective Costa ([[Louis Ferreira]]). Later, Scully’s attention is drawn to a man that observes them intently from one of the portable walkways. Costa informs them that the victims asked if they found Ghouli. When Scully turns to check if the mystery guy is there, he’s gone. Both agents investigate the two teenagers about the slashing. Both of them go on about the experience and their boyfriend, Jackson Van De Kamp. The agents arrive at the Van De Kamp household, the same house Scully saw in her dream. Two gunshots are heard with a third coming from upstairs. Scully goes up and finds the bleeding corpse of Jackson Van De Kamp. As they leave the room and the door clicks closed, the zipper opens slowly. Jackson sits up and escapes the room. Mulder meets with Skinner at the Chimera, telling him to drop the investigation. Mulder confirms that Jackson's DNA matches Scully's. At the hospital, Jackson explains to Brianna that he’s been hiding because there are people after him. He reveals that Ghouli doesn't exist and it's just something he "made up". Jackson escapes the hospital after the death of the DOD members. The next day, Scully spots a rural gas station that has a windmill just outside. Scully meets with Peter Wong with Wong mentioning that he wishes he could know her better. The agents ask to see the recording tapes. In the recording, Scully is having a conversation with William. She smiles as Mulder holds her while they see their son, alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=Ghouli | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] (director); [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 11  | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the season, they search for William. In the third episode of the "[[Plus One (The X-Files)|Plus One]]", Scully and Mulder are intimate again. In the season 11 finale, "[[My Struggle IV]]", she reveals to Mulder that she is pregnant with his child. Also in the finale, the Smoking Man shoots William, who has made himself look like Mulder.

===Filming===
Filming began in August 2017 in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/david-duchovny-x-files-return-to-vancouver-as-shooting-for-11th-season-begins |title=David Duchovny, X-Files return to Vancouver as shooting for 11th season begins |work=Vancouver Sun |first=Harrison |last=Mooney |date=August 3, 2017 |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After controversy sparked regarding the lack of female writers or directors on the series, it was announced in August 2017 that Carol Banker, a script supervisor on the original series who also directed an episode of ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' and [[Holly Dale]] were added as directors.&lt;ref name="s11update"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reviews===
The eleventh season has received generally positive reviews from critics and currently has a [[Metacritic]] score of 67 out of 100 based on 18 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-x-files/season-11|title=The X-Files - Season 11 Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=[[CBS Interactive|CBS Interactive Inc.]]|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the season has an approval rating of 78% with an average rating of 6.99 out of 10 based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Though it may not make many new believers, ''The X-Files'' return to business as usual is a refreshing upgrade from the show's underwhelming previous outing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_x_files/s11|title=The X-Files: Season 11|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the first five episodes available for review, Liz Shannon Miller of [[IndieWire]] gave the season a positive review with a "B+" grade. While Miller wrote that the season premiere "is not good", she was much more positive of the following four standalone episodes, writing that "there are some intriguing mysteries, some eerie moments, solid action" and praised Darin Morgan's comedy installment, calling it "fantastic". Overall, she concluded, "Season 11 so far isn't flawless, but it's a lively, character-focused affair that feels far more unified than we'd ever anticipated, a massive improvement over Season 10 that gives us genuine hope for the second half. For the first time in a while, we're truly excited to see more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/x-files-season-11-review-1201908214/ |title=‘The X-Files’ Season 11 Review: Mulder and Scully Return, and The Results Are Genuinely Exciting |website=IndieWire |first=Liz Shannon |last=Miller |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] of ''[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansions and blogs|Vulture]]'' stated that compared to the [[The X-Files (season 10)|previous season]], "This new batch of episodes is considerably stronger. Even the ones that don't really do much but spin their wheels do so with feeling, and when the show is great — as it is, yet again, in Darin Morgan's episode — it's downright sublime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|authorlink1=Matt Zoller Seitz|title=The X-Files Is Sublime in Season 11|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/the-x-files-season-11-review.html|website=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansions and blogs|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media LLC]]|accessdate=January 4, 2018|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In building [[construction]], '''topping out''' (sometimes referred to as '''topping off''') is a [[Builders' rites|builders' rite]] traditionally held when the last beam (or its equivalent) is placed atop a structure during its construction. Nowadays, the ceremony is often parlayed into a [[media event]] for public relations purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/21/realestate/the-hoary-tradition-of-topping-out.html The Hoary Tradition of Topping Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109184143/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/21/realestate/the-hoary-tradition-of-topping-out.html |date=2017-01-09 }}. ''The New York Times'', 21 October 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has since come to mean more generally finishing the structure of the building, whether there is a ceremony or not.

==History==
The practice of "topping out" a new building can be traced to the ancient [[Scandinavia]]n religious rite of placing a tree atop a new building to appease the tree-dwelling spirits displaced in its construction.&lt;ref name=cusswnews&gt;{{cite web|title=CUSSW: News:: History of the 'Topping Out' Ceremony|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ssw/news/apr03/history.html|publisher=Columbia University School of Social Work|accessdate=6 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611090101/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ssw/news/apr03/history.html |archivedate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long an important component of [[Timber framing|timber frame]] building,&lt;ref&gt;[http://holderbros.blogspot.com/2008/11/topping-off-frame.html Topping Off the Frame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203331/http://holderbros.blogspot.com/2008/11/topping-off-frame.html |date=2016-03-03 }}, 26 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it migrated initially to England and Northern Europe, thence to the Americas.

A tree or leafy branch is placed on the topmost wood or iron beam, often with flags and streamers tied to it.  A toast is usually drunk and sometimes workers are treated to a meal.  In masonry construction the rite celebrates the bedding of the last block or brick.

In some cases a topping out event is held at an intermediate point, such as when the roof is dried-in, which means the roof can provide at least semi-permanent protection from the elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.miraverse.com/?p=984 Drying In, Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109082939/http://blog.miraverse.com/?p=984 |date=2009-11-09 }}, 6 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice remains common in the [[United Kingdom]] and assorted [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as Australia,&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/12/19/why_do_construction_workers_top_building_sites_with_undecorated_christmas.html|title=What Is a Tree Doing on Top of That Construction Site?|author=|date=19 December 2013|publisher=|via=Slate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916053121/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/12/19/why_do_construction_workers_top_building_sites_with_undecorated_christmas.html|archivedate=16 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Business/2013-05-16/article-3249598/Builders-top-off-new-downtown-office-tower/1|title=The Telegram|author=|date=|website=www.thetelegram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Iceland]], [[Chile]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], the [[Baltic States]], and the [[United States]], where the last beam of a [[skyscraper]] is painted white and signed by all the workers involved.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt; In New Zealand, completion of the roof to a water-proof state is celebrated through a "roof shout", where workers are treated to cake and beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/67897103/building-a-house-where-does-a-roof-shout-come-from|title=Putting the cherry on top|website=Stuff|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of "''pannenbier''" (literally "(roof) tile beer" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is popular in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], where a national, regional or city flag is hung once the highest point of a building is reached. It stays in place until the building's owner provides free beer to the workers, after which it is lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermonttimberworks.com/blog/whats-a-tree-doing-up-there/|title=Topping Out - A Timber Frame Tradition|author=|date=|website=www.vermonttimberworks.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805181609/http://www.vermonttimberworks.com/blog/whats-a-tree-doing-up-there/|archivedate=2017-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered greedy if it remains flown for more than a few days.

'''TransXChange''' is a UK national XML based data standard for the interchange of bus route and timetable information between bus operators, the [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]], [[local authorities]] and [[passenger transport executive]]s, and others involved in the provision of passenger information.

The format is a [[UK]] national de facto standard sponsored by the UK [[Department of Transport]]. The standard is part of a family of coherent transport related [[XML]] standards that follow UK [[GovTalk]] guidelines and are based on the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] [[Transmodel]] conceptual model.

Although TransXChange is currently used mainly to exchange bus timetables, it may also be used for schedules for rail and other modes.

==History==
TransXChange is intended as a successor to the widely used [[ATCO-CIF]] format for bus timetables and was developed as a modernised representation of ATCO-CIF content, using an XML representation based on the [[Transmodel]] Reference model for Public Transport.

* Version 1.0 versions of TransXchange were developed in 2000-2001 and used in pilot projects.
* Version 2.0 of the TransXChange standard s released in April 2005. 2.1 was a major rewrite to meet additional requirements and harmonsie with eGOV standards. It introduced a modular structure of packages inpartiuclar to use the UK [[NaPTAN]] and [[National Public Transport Gazetteer]] or '''NPTG''' standard to define the names and location of stops.
* Version 2.1 was released in February 2006 [http://www.transxchange.org.uk/schemaDoc2_0.htm] and is now supported by most UK suppliers of Public Transport Scheduling software.  Version 2.1 has now been adopted as the baseline standard for [[Electronic Bus Service Registration]] conducted by the UK [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] (VOSA), and as the general standard to which all related developments are expected to comply. 2.1 was accompanied by an enhanced TransXChange Publisher tool which can plot a bus route on a map.
* In 2007 an open source tool known as TransXChange2GoogleTransit [http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/] to output a TransXChange schedule in [[General Transit Feed Specification]] (GTFS), the format used by [[Google Maps#Google Transit|Google Transit]], was released.
* Version 2.2 with minor modifications is being planned and is likely to appear in 2008.
* Version 2.4 was released in 2012
* Version 2.5 was released in 2013

TransXChange is supported by all main UK suppliers of bus timetable systems and has also been used to exchange data for metro and other modes.

==Scope==
TransXChange provides a rich model based representation of a bus timetable that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. TransXChange documents can be used to exchange the following information:

*'''Bus schedules''' including stops, routes, departures times/frequencies, operational notes, and maps. Routes may have complex topologies such as circular routes, cloverleaf and lollipops, and complex workings such as short working and express patterns. Connections with other services can also be described;
*'''The days on which the services run''', including availability on public holidays and other exceptions;
*'''Term times''' and '''holidays''' of Schools, Local Educational Authorities and other organisations serviced by a bus service;
*Details of the '''Statutory Registration of the Servic''e''' with a Traffic Area Office, including any Short Notice Registration details;
*Information about the '''Bus Operators''' providing the service;
*Additional '''operational information''', including '''fare stages''', '''positioning runs''', '''garages'', '''layovers''', '''duty crews''', useful for [[Automatic Vehicle Location]] or '''AVL'''  and on-board ticketing systems.

===TransXChange Schemas===
TransXChange comprises:
* Two XML schemas: There are two almost identical schemas, with  differences only as to the constraints on mandatory elements:
# A '''Registration''' schema, intended for [[Electronic Bus Service Registration]], in which registration details are mandatory.
# A '''General Purpose''' Schema for which registration details are optional.
* A user guide, describing the TransXChange model including UML diagrams and descriptions of all the elements and attributes.
* A set of example documents illustrating the use of TransXChange features.
* A TransXChange Publisher tool.
* A Web site http://www.transxchange.org.uk with FAQs downloads, etc.

Each version of TransXChange is versioned in line with UK [[GovTalk]] guidelines.

== TransXChange Publisher ==
TransXChange is accompanied by a free tool,the TransXChange Publisher, which renders a TransXChange document into a human readable format, matrix and route map. PDF and html formats are supported.

==Future development==

'''Wirsol''' (own spelling ''WIRSOL'') is a brand of project developer and energy service company Wircon GmbH.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Wircon GmbH was founded in December 2013. Its key activities are the provision of sustainable energy projects, primarily on the German market. The focus of the Wircon Group lies in the fields of large wind and photovoltaic projects; small roof-top photovoltaic systems for private customers; large-scale roof-top photovoltaic systems primarily for commercial customers and sustainable operation of renewable energy plants using these technologies. The company states that it has some 11 000 customers (as of February 2017).

The former Wirsol group was an international project corporation for the planning, construction and financing of renewable energy power plants, in particular solar power plants. The company’s headquarters were located in Germany. Further company offices were located in Spain, Italy, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, Canada, the United States, Brazil, Japan, China, Malaysia and Maldives.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; On a global level, Wirsol was responsible for the installation of over 7 000 solar systems with a total output of 450 MWp. In autumn 2013 insolvency proceedings were initiated for the Wirsol corporate group, with Wircon GmbH taking over some divisions in March 2014.

==Company history==

* During Q1 - 2017 WIRCON GmbH acquired and funded 198MW

== Company history prior to the Wirsol group’s insolvency ==
The company was founded in Waghäusel (District of Karlsruhe in Germany), where its headquarters were also located, on 1 February 2003 by Markus Wirth, Hans Wirth and Stefan Riel as the “Die Hausrenovierer GmbH”. Having increasingly specialized in photovoltaics, in January 2004 the company was renamed “Wirth Solar GmbH”. Due to an imminent legal dispute with Würth Solar GmbH in 2007 the owners decided to change the name again, to “Wirsol Deutschland GmbH”, which became a subsidiary holding of the newly founded “Wirsol Solar AG” holding. In 2010 the Board of Directors was expanded by the founders, with Bernd Kästner becoming the chief financial officer. Nikolaus Krane, previously a member of the Conergy board, assumed responsibility for international finance products, large-scale projects and communications.

To promote business relations in Asia Wirsol set up Wirsol Solar Technology Beijing Ltd., a company site in China and, in June 2012, a site for Southeast Asian activities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

In October 2013 the Wirsol group initiated preliminary insolvency proceedings. The application was approved by Karlsruhe District Court on 24 October 2013 and a preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed, while the company’s management continued to focus on restructuring the business within the scope of insolvency plan proceedings. Wirsol Solar AG, Wirsol Deutschland GmbH and Wirsol Solar System GmbH fell under this planned insolvency.

Due to its financial difficulties the Wirsol group planned to wind up its “Wind power” division, founded in November 2012, and eight of the company’s employees were given paid leave as of 4 November 2013.

In December 2013 Wirsol E-Mobility GmbH filed for insolvency on the grounds of impending insolvency. This application was approved by Karlsruhe District Court and a preliminary insolvency administrator was appointed. The measures affected three employees.

In March 2014 some parts of Wirsol GmbH’s German operations were taken over by Wircon GmbH. The new owner continued the Wirsol brand and offered employment to 80 of Wirsol’s 300 employees. WIRCON is owned by Dietmar Hopp.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Portfolio ==

=== Germany ===

[[File:Wirsol Solartestpark Bruhrain.png|thumb|right|Wirsol solar test park Bruhrain]]In 2007 the company opened the Bruhrain solar test park in close proximity to its headquarters. At that time, a total surface area of 12 hectares made it the largest solar park&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; in the state of Baden-Württemberg. With almost 31 000 modules installed, the plant generates an output up to 2.258 MWp.

In April 2010 the company installed a photovoltaic system at the Hockenheimring German Formula One race track with a rated output of 848.88 kWp. A total of 4 716 solar modules were installed along 405 metres of the track.&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;

One of the largest projects finalized by Wirsol in the financial year 2011 was located in Mixdorf in Brandenburg, where the company built a system with a peak performance of 24.1 MWp on the 81-hectare site of a former Russian fuel depot.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

Likewise, in 2012 Wirsol’s high-output Luckau solar park, constructed on a conversion site in Brandenburg and with a performance of almost 21 MWp, was connected to the grid. The solar power plant is located at the former military airport in Alteno.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;

At the end of July 2013, the company completed construction of what was, at that time, Europe’s largest crystalline roof-top solar system. The photovoltaic system, located at freight forwarding company Pfenning Logistics’ 11-hectare distribution centre in Heddesheim, northern Baden, has a peak output of 8.1 MWp.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

The total output of Wirsol’s projects in 2015 was in excess of 150 megawatts.

In 2016 Wirsol commenced its first tenants’ electricity projects in Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, working in partnership with municipal housing associations and utility companies.

Wirsol has been participating in work on the intelligent grid in Baden-Württemberg since February 2017. The company is involved in the C/sells platform, the “showcase for intelligent energy – digital agenda for the energy revolution” (SINTEG), a funding programme initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Economics.

In August 2017 Wirsol realized two new large roof-top systems for long-established world market leader SEW -EURODRIVE. A total of four plants at two locations now generate total output in excess of two megawatts.

Wirsol’s Straubenhardt wind park, comprising 11 wind turbines generating a total output of approx. 33 megawatts, was connected to the grid in March 2018. The park is capable of supplying some 22 000 households with green electricity.

=== International ===

In 2012 Wirsol founded the “Wirsol RE Maldives” joint venture with Renewable Energy Maldives (REM) to install solar power stations on the Maldives.&lt;sup&gt;[8][9]&lt;/sup&gt; Further international projects are located in Spain (Bovera, Barcelona, Cáceres), England (Cornwall), Italy (Mola di Bari), Belgium (Wilrijk) and the US state of Colorado (Fort Collins).&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 2013 the company announced that work to build a 22-MWp solar park on the Japanese island of Honshu had begun and gave the starting signal for the Monte Plata solar park in the Dominican Republic.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The latter park has, in the meantime, been sold to Soventix.&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt; Construction of the park in Japan was scheduled to begin in 2014.&lt;sup&gt;[out of date]&lt;/sup&gt;

With the Solarpark Lerchenborg (61 MWp), built in 2015, the company built what was, at the time, Scandinavia’s largest solar park.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt; 
January 2017 saw the announcement of the start-up of the largest solar park in the Netherlands, considered to be a flagship project &lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; and with overall output of 30 MWp.

Also in 2015, Wirsol installed Switzerland’s sixth largest supermarket roof-top system. The system’s total output is approx. 1.94 MWp.

In February 2017 Wirsol Energy Ltd refinanced 10 solar parks with overall output of 61 MWp and financing of 46 million pounds.

Wirsol entered the Australian market in March 2017, investing a total of 380 million Australian dollars and founding a subsidiary headquartered in Sydney. The company’s first projects were three solar parks – “Whitsunday” and “Hamilton” in Queensland and “Gannawarra” in Victoria – generating a total of 198 MWp.

April 2017 saw the company announce the connection of 19 solar parks to the grid. These sites, all located in England and Northern Ireland, generate outputs ranging from 20.5 MWp to 2.5 MWp, thus supplying a total of 105.5 MWp electricity. They were financed with loans amounting to approx. GBP 88 million.

Wirsol’s office in Sydney, Australia was inaugurated in May 2017.

In May 2017 the company also sold part of its solar park portfolio in the United Kingdom to investor Rockfire Capital. The portfolio comprises 19 solar parks, of which two are located in Northern Ireland. The 19 solar energy sites, each with outputs ranging from 2.5 MWp to 20.5 MWp, generate a total output of some 105 MWp. Taken in total, the portfolio produces enough energy to generate almost 100 gigawatt hours of electricity each year.

Wirsol became Australia’s largest solar park project developer in November 2017, achieving a market share of just under 12 percent. In addition to this, the company accounted for 19.5 percent of all projects being realized throughout Australia at that time.

December 2017 saw Wirsol Energy Ltd acquire two non-government subsidized solar power plants in the United Kingdom – Outwood Solar Park, Essex with 7 MWp output and Trowse-Newton Solar Park, Norfolk with output of 9 MWp.

Following a bidding procedure for a government tender in Australia, in March 2018 Wirsol Energy und Edify Energy were awarded the contract for a large-scale storage facility. A 25MW / 50MWh Tesla lithium-ion battery storage facility - the Gannawarra Energy Storage System – will be integrated into the 50MW Gannawarra Solar Farm.

==Sponsoring==
Wirsol Solar AG became an official sponsor of soccer club TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in the 2011/2012 Bundesliga season, giving its name to the club’s stadium, the Wirsol Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim. This sponsorship of the arena has been continued by Wircon GmbH with its Wirsol brand since the 2014/2015 season.

{{distinguish|Yolk}}
[[File:09.Chugo.jpg|thumb|[[#Withers yoke|Withers yoke]]]]
A '''yoke''' is a wooden [[Beam (structure)|beam]] normally used between a pair of [[oxen]] or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load when working in pairs, as oxen usually do; some yokes are fitted to individual animals. There are several types of yoke, used in different cultures, and for different types of oxen.  A pair of oxen may be called a ''yoke of oxen'', and yoke is also a verb, as in "to ''yoke'' a pair of oxen". Other animals that may be yoked include [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, [[donkey]]s, and [[water buffalo]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary pipe|Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yugóm|*yugóm}}
The word "yoke" is believed to derive from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *yugóm (yoke), from verb *yeug- (join, unite). This root has descendants in almost all known [[Indo-European languages]] including [[German language|German]] ''Joch'', [[Latin]] ''iugum'', [[Ancient Greek]] ζυγόν (zygon), [[Persian language|Persian]] یوغ (yuğ), [[Sanskrit]] युग (yugá), [[Hittite language|Hittite]] 𒄿𒌑𒃷 (iúkan), [[Old Church Slavonic]] иго (igo), [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''jungas'', [[Old Irish]] ''cuing'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] լուծ (luç), etc. (all meaning "yoke"). The verb to ''subjugate'' derives from the Latin form.

==Neck or bow yoke==
[[File:Bullock yokes.jpg|thumb|left|Bow yokes on a bullock team]]
A  ''bow yoke'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ}} is a shaped wooden crosspiece bound to the necks of a pair of [[oxen]] (or occasionally to horses). It is held on the animals' necks by an [[oxbow]], from which it gets its name.  The oxbow is usually U-shaped and also transmits force from the animals' shoulders. A swivel between the animals, beneath the centre of the yoke, attaches to the pole of a vehicle or to chains ([[trace (tack)|trace]]s) used to drag a load.

Bow yokes are traditional in [[Europe]], and in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[Africa]].
{{Clear}}

==Head yoke==
[[File:Zugochsen.jpg|thumb|Oxen in Germany wearing head yokes]]
A ''head yoke'' fits onto the head of the oxen. It usually fits behind the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, and has carved-out sections into which the horns fit; it may be a single beam attached to both oxen, or each ox may have a separate short beam (see picture).  The yoke is then strapped to the horns of the oxen with yoke straps.   Some types fit instead onto the front of the head, again strapped to the horns, and ox pads are then used for cushioning the forehead of the ox.  A tug pole is held to the bottom of the yoke using yoke irons and chains. The tug pole can either be a short pole with a chain attached for hauling, or a long pole with a hook on the end that has no chain at all. Sometimes the pole is attached to a wagon and the oxen are simply backed over this pole, the pole is then raised between them and a backing bolt is dropped into the chains on the yoke irons in order to haul the wagon.

Head yokes are widely used in southern Europe,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} much of [[South America]] and in [[Canada]].

==Withers yoke==
[[File:Burma07.jpg|thumb|left|Withers yokes in use in [[Burma]]]]
A ''withers yoke'' is a yoke that fits just in front of the [[withers]], or the shoulder blades, of the oxen.  The yoke is held in position by straps, either alone or with a pair of wooden staves on either side of the ox's withers; the pull is however from the yoke itself, not from the staves.  Withers yokes particularly suit [[zebu]] cattle, which have high humps on their withers.

Withers yokes are widely used in [[Africa]] and [[India]], where zebu cattle are common.
{{Clear}}

==Comparison==
Although all three yoke types are effective, each has its advantages and disadvantages.  As mentioned above, withers yokes suit zebu cattle, and head yokes can of course only be used for animals with suitable horns.  Head yokes need to be re-shaped frequently to fit the animals' horns as they grow; unlike other types, a single-beam head yoke fixes the heads of the oxen apart, helping them to stand quietly without fighting. A single-beam head yoke may offer better braking ability on downhill grades and appears to be preferred in rugged mountainous areas such as Switzerland, Spain and parts of Italy.&lt;ref name=roos2 /&gt; Bow yokes need to be the correct size for the animal, and new ones are often made as the animal grows, but they need no adjustment in use. Whichever type is used, various lengths of yoke may be required for different agricultural implements or to adjust to different crop-row spacings.&lt;ref name=zfu /&gt;

==Single yoke==
[[File:Child and ox ploughing, Laos (1).jpg|thumb|250px|A child ploughing the land with a single-yoked [[water buffalo]] in [[Don Det]], [[Si Phan Don]], [[Laos]]]]
A yoke may be used with a single animal. Oxen are normally worked in pairs, but [[water buffalo]] in Asian countries are commonly used singly, with the aid of a bow-shaped withers yoke.&lt;ref name=conroy /&gt; Use of single bow or withers yokes on oxen is documented from North America, China, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Switzerland, and several designs of single head or forehead yoke are recorded in Germany.&lt;ref name=roos /&gt;

==Symbolism==
The yoke has connotations of subservience and toiling; in some ancient cultures it was traditional to force a vanquished enemy to pass [[Passum sub iugum|beneath a symbolic yoke of spears or swords]]. The yoke may be a metaphor for something oppressive or burdensome, such as [[feudalism]], [[imperialism]], [[corvée]], [[tribute]], or [[conscription]], as in the expressions the "[[Norman Yoke]]" (in England), the "[[Tatar Yoke]]" (in Russia), or the "[[Under the Yoke|Turkish Yoke]]" (in the Balkans).

The metaphor can also refer to the state of being linked or chained together by contract or marriage, similar to a pair of oxen.&lt;ref name=OAD /&gt; This sense is also the source of the word [[yoga]], as linking with the divine.

The yoke is frequently used metaphorically in the [[Bible]], first in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] regarding [[Esau]].&lt;ref name=gen/&gt; 

In the 20th century, the yoke and arrows became a political symbol of the [[Falange]] political movement in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Parkins. ''Fashioning the body politic: dress, gender, citizenship''. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2002. Pp. 178&lt;/ref&gt;
