Founded in 1887, the '''American Institute of Certified Public Accountants''' ('''AICPA''') is the national professional organization of [[Certified Public Accountants]] (CPAs) in the [[United States]], with more than 418,000 members in 143 countries in business and industry, public practice, government, education, student affiliates and international associates.&lt;ref name="About the AICPA"&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/About/Pages/About.aspx About the AICPA]&lt;/ref&gt; It sets ethical standards for the profession and U.S. auditing standards for audits of private companies, non-profit organizations, federal, state and local governments. It also develops and grades the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|Uniform CPA Examination]]. The AICPA maintains offices in [[New York City]]; [[Washington, DC]]; [[Durham, NC]]; and [[Ewing, NJ]].&lt;ref name="About the AICPA"/&gt; The AICPA celebrated the 125th anniversary of its founding in 2012.

The AICPA's founding defined accountancy as a profession characterized by educational requirements, professional standards, a code of professional ethics, and alignment with the public interest.

==History==

The AICPA and its predecessors date back to 1887, when the ''American Association of Public Accountants'' (AAPA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendlowitz|first=Edward|title=Carousel of Progress|journal=Journal of Accountancy|date=June 2012|volume=213|issue=6|page=16|publisher=American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|issn=0021-8448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Thomas|title=The American Association of Public Accountants|journal=The American Historians|volume=14|issue=2|pages=116–124|url=http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/aah/id/8001/rec/13|date=22 October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the American Association of Public Accountants was succeeded by the ''Institute of Public Accountants'', at which time there was a membership of 1,150. The name was changed to the ''American Institute of Accountants'' in 1917 and remained so until 1957, when it changed to its current name of the ''American Institute of Certified Public Accountants''. The American Society of Certified Public Accountants was formed in 1921 and acted as a federation of state societies. The Society was merged into the Institute in 1936 and, at that time, the Institute agreed to restrict its future members to CPAs.

In January 2012, the AICPA entered into a joint venture with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), a partnership that produced the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation. 
In 2014, the AICPA and the CIMA co-created the [http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs)]. These principles, the result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, aim to guide best practices in the discipline of management accounting.

In June 2016, members of both the AICPA and CIMA approved evolving the joint venture through the creation of a new international association. [http://www.aicpaglobal.com/ The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants] launched in 2017, bringing together the expertise and capabilities of the AICPA and CIMA to strengthen the entire accounting profession – both public and management accounting – through stronger advocacy, enhanced member resources and a broader platform to reach the next generation. The AICPA and CIMA membership bodies remain and provide all existing benefits to members.

===History of committees===
The use of committees began even before the AAPA was formed in 1887. At the first meeting of what would become the AAPA on December 22, 1886, those present authorized the appointment of a committee to draft rules and regulations. Beyond this first preliminary committee the first Bylaws of the AAPA in 1897 established three committees: Finance and Audit Committee; Committee on Elections, Qualifications and Examinations; and the Committee on Bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1035362.4138/1.PDF Constitution and by-laws with amendments January 19th, 1897]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of committees grew continually over the years. In the 1940s, there were 34 committees. By 1960, there were 89. By 1970, the number had grown to 109.

In 1999, the nearly 120 existing committees underwent a re-organization with approximately half of the standing committees being replaced with a volunteer group model that placed an increased emphasis on the use of task forces. The increased use of task forces allowed for more targeted efforts with the task forces being given a specific assignment then disbanding upon completion of that assignment. Also in 1999, the first tracking and management of task forces began. Currently, 1,700 volunteers fill more than 2000 seats, each helping to fulfill the AICPA's mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volunteers.aicpa.org/ Volunteer Central]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The AICPA's mission is to "Power the success of global business, CPAs, CGMAs and specialty credentials by providing the most relevant knowledge, resources and advocacy, and protecting the evolving public interest." To fulfill its mission, the AICPA works with state CPA organizations and gives priority to those areas where public reliance on CPA skills is most significant.

==Professional standards setting==

The AICPA sets ''generally accepted'' professional and technical standards for CPAs in multiple areas. Until the 1970s, the AICPA held a virtual monopoly in this field. In the 1970s, however, it transferred its responsibility for setting [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) to the newly formed [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB). Following this, it retained its standards setting function in areas such as [[Statement on Auditing Standards (USA)|financial statement auditing]], professional ethics, attest services, CPA firm quality control, CPA tax practice, business valuation, and financial planning practice. Before passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] law, AICPA standards in these areas were considered "generally accepted" for all CPA practitioners.

In the early 2000s, federal public policy makers concluded that where independent financial statement audits of public companies regulated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] are concerned, that the AICPA's standards setting and related enforcement roles should be transferred to a government empowered body with more enforcement authority than a non-governmental professional association, such as the AICPA could provide. As a result, the Sarbanes-Oxley law created the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) which has jurisdiction over virtually every area of CPA practice in relation to public companies. However, the AICPA retains its considerable standards setting, ethics enforcement and firm practice quality monitoring roles for the majority of practicing CPAs, who serve privately held business and individuals.

==Credentials and designations==

The AICPA offers credentialing programs in certain subject areas for its members. The credentials are similar to state board certifications for attorneys, which also recognize subject matter-specific expertise.  The AICPA offers the Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) credential, the Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) credential, the Certified in Financial Forensics (CFF) credential, the Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP) credential, and the Certified in Entity and Intangible Valuations (CEIV) credential.

The AICPA, along with CIMA, issues the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation, which is designed to elevate management accounting and further emphasize its importance for business worldwide. United by global quality standards for ethics and performance, CGMA designees maintain distinct credibility and positioning among worldwide business designations and have access to resources and learning opportunities that further elevate their expertise, skills, ethical standards, and dedication.

==Public interest campaigns==
The AICPA also runs extensive public interest programs, most notably the multiple award-winning campaign [http://www.feedthepig.org/ Feed the Pig] and the award-winning site [http://www.360financialliteracy.org/ 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy]. Feed the Pig, a national public service campaign sponsored by the AICPA and the [[Ad Council]], encourages Americans aged 25 to 34 to take control of their personal finances by providing free savings tips and resources. 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy is a national volunteer effort of the nation's CPAs to help Americans understand their personal finances and develop money management skills. It focuses on financial education as a lifelong endeavor, from children learning about the value of money to adults reaching a secure retirement.

==Government relations program==
The AICPA has a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] office and a [[political action committee]]. On behalf of its members, the AICPA monitors and advocates on legislative and other matters that affect the accounting profession. Working with state CPA societies and other professional organizations, the AICPA provides information to and educates federal, state and local policymakers regarding key issues. Whether serving as an information resource or offering recommendations, the AICPA represents the profession while protecting the public interest.

The AICPA's Political Action Committee is a contributor to [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressional representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senators]] from both parties who sit on various legislative committees of relevance to CPAs.

==External roles==
The AICPA is a leading member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] and the [[Global Accounting Alliance]].

The AICPA is an affiliate of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Code of professional conduct==
Members of the AICPA must attest annually to meeting the requirements for their membership types, complying with the AICPA's bylaws and upholding the AICPA's Code of Profession Conduct. Members are subject to audit and, if found to be non-compliant, may be expelled from the AICPA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">'''Canterbury Hall''' was an edifice located at 663 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in the 19th century. It was used for entertainment and political meetings. It was a three-story building where bawdy ''concerts'' took place. The building had a front of 40 feet and a depth of 125 feet.

Often called [[Mozart]] Hall, it was also a gathering place of anti-[[Tammany Hall]] political forces in [[New York City]]. [[Fernando Wood]], New York Mayor and Congressman, founded the organization. The edifice burned entirely in the early morning hours of March 24, 1861.&lt;ref name=burned/&gt;

Proceedings at the venue were frowned upon by newspaper writers such as one from ''[[The New York Times]]''. He commented about Canterbury Hall advertisements promoting ''the prettiest waiter girls in town''. Along with a rival theater, the Melodeon, the establishment was "a nightly disgrace to Broadway and its adjacent streets". In November 1860 the proprietors of the business, Fox &amp; Curran, were compelled to pay a license fee of $500 to keep the venue open. A ''New York Times'' editorialist expressed the opinion that this was a first measure in ridding the city of such ''nuisances'', which he predicted the [[New York State Legislature]] would soon entirely eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;''Amusements'', ''The New York Times'', November 16, 1860, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The property on which Canterbury Hall stood was formerly owned by a Reverend Wiley. His estate encompassed additional buildings on Broadway and was insured for $15,000. The fire which consumed the structure began among stage scenery and was discovered by watchmen. The owners of Canterbury Hall suffered an estimated loss of $10,000. A [[fire marshal]] began an investigation into the cause of the fire which was considered to be of incendiary origin.&lt;ref name=burned&gt;"Canterbury Hall Burned Down", ''The New York Times'', March 25, 1861, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charles Koch Institute''' is a [[libertarian]]-oriented [[public policy]] research, programming, grant-making, and [[fellow|fellowship]]-funding organization based in [[Virginia]]. Named after [[Charles Koch]], its founder and primary financier, it pursues conservative economic policies and a non-interventionist foreign policy that has been characterized as anti-[[neoconservative]] or [[Defensive realism|defensive realist]].

==History==
The Charles Koch Institute was established in 2011 and is housed in a building which it shares with the [[Charles Koch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Koch network rivals the GOP|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/koch-brothers-network-gop-david-charles-217124|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[Politico]]|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Koch Institute – Company Profile|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/1325787D:US-charles-koch-institute|website=bloomberg.com|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Koch, the institute is the beneficiary of a majority of his personal political donations, or those separate from what originates from [[Koch Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Daniel|title=Exclusive Interview: Charles Koch On How To Save America|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/09/29/exclusive-interview-charles-koch-on-saving-america/#44bf786357b2|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The institute is governed by a board of directors composed of Charles Koch, [[Chase Koch]], [[Elizabeth Koch (publisher)|Elizabeth Koch]], and [[Richard Fink]]. Its president is [[Brian Hooks (nonprofit executive)|Brian Hooks]].&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;

==Programs==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CKI PAnel343.png|thumb|left|In 2016 the Charles Koch Institute hosted a panel discussion on anti-[[SLAPP]] legislation.]] --&gt;

===Domestic policy===
According to the institute, it funds "research that furthers an understanding of how cronyism and [[corporate welfare]] affect individual and societal well-being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Welfare|url=https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/issues/cronyism-corporate-welfare/|website=charleskochinstitute.org|publisher=Charles Koch Institute|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the organization partnered with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to study the implications of newly enacted [[asset forfeiture]] legislation in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forfeiture reform aligns likes of billionaire Charles Koch, ACLU|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2015-10-15/forfeiture-reform-aligns-likes-billionaire-charles-koch-aclu#|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[Topeka Capital-Journal]]|date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute has also developed a Prison Entrepreneurship Program that sponsors business classes and a business plan competition for U.S. prison inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bush|first1=Bridget|title=Reform could cut prison population|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/07/05/bush-council-could-thin-prison-population/86701876/|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[Courier-Journal]]|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
The institute finances research, forums, and speaking tours regarding U.S. [[foreign policy]], describing its worldview as one that "emphasizes the need to defend our territorial integrity from aggression, promote free trade, peacefully engage with the world, and serve as an exemplar of liberal values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Policy|url=https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/issues/foreign-policy/|website=charleskochinstitute.org|publisher=Charles Koch Institute|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[The Intercept]] described the institute's foreign policy agenda as emblematic of "how foreign policy no longer neatly aligns with party politics", observing one event the organization hosted that appeared more like "a left-wing anti-war rally than a gathering hosted by a longtime right-wing institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jilani|first1=Zaid|title=Neocon-Bashers Headline Koch Event as Political Realignment on Foreign Policy Continues|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/05/18/neocon-bashers-headline-koch-event-as-political-realignment-on-foreign-policy-continues/|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it hosted a conference headlined by [[Chas Freeman]], [[Stephen Walt]], and [[John Mearsheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lake|first1=Eli|title=Koch Brothers Give a Megaphone to the Anti-Israel Fringe|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-17/koch-brothers-give-a-megaphone-to-the-anti-israel-fringe|accessdate=23 July 2016|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education===
According to the organization, it underwrites several professional education programs, including the "Koch Associate Program", a fellowship which funds the placement of selected applicants into management positions at partner organizations, which include the [[Acton Institute]], the Regulatory Studies Center at [[George Washington University]], the [[James Madison Institute]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner Organizations|url=https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/professional-education/partner-organizations/|website=charleskochinstitute.org|publisher=Charles Koch Institute|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hines began her acting career by doing improvisational comedy at [[The Groundlings]] Theater. Among the people she studied with was [[Lisa Kudrow]].&lt;ref name="Hines2"/&gt; She also learned to write comedy sketches, which served her well when working on HBO's ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' as Larry David's fictional wife, Cheryl. The show is written using the [[Improvisational_theatre#In_film_and_television|retroscripting]] technique, in which the plot outlines are generally and loosely drawn, and the individual actors improvise to create the dialogue.

"When the show first came out, people from Tallahassee thought, 'Well, maybe Cheryl got married'", she recalls of the show's initial reception. "Sometimes, I do feel like I live two lives."&lt;ref name="Heeb Magazine, Issue #15, Features"&gt;[http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/119 Heeb Magazine, Issue #15, Features] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024348/http://www.heebmagazine.com/articles/view/119 |date=April 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines received an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' in 2003 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385644/awards Awards for Cheryl Hines]&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about being cast on the show, Hines has said that "Until ''Curb'', I’d done small roles, really small roles. They wanted to cast an unknown actress. It worked in my favor that I hadn’t done anything. It changed my life."&lt;ref name="Heeb Magazine, Issue #15, Featuresmorecurb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2012/03/more-curb-your-enthusiasm-cheryl-hines-bets-against-it.html|title=The TV Guy - Hal Boedeker's Blog - Orlando Sentinel|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074800/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2012/03/more-curb-your-enthusiasm-cheryl-hines-bets-against-it.html|archivedate=15 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hines starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[In the Motherhood]]''. It was loosely an adaptation to the web series. She played Jane. The series was short-lived lasting 5 out of 7 episodes due to low ratings.

During the 2009-2010 season of ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'', she guest-starred as Kitty Walker McCallister's campaign manager, Buffy. It was announced in July 2010 that Hines would be joining the cast of the new [[Nickelodeon]] films based on their series ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up Timmy Turner!'' and ''A Fairly Odd Christmas''.

View|Yahoo! Screen]].

On January 29, 2014, Hines received the 2,516th star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rossman|first=Sean|title=Tallahassee actress Cheryl Hines to get star on Hollywood Walk of Fame|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/article/20140128/NEWS/140128004/?nclick_check=1|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=Tallahassee.com|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and charities==
Hines married Paul Young, founder of the management firm Principato-Young, on December 30, 2002. Their daughter Catherine Rose Young was born on March 8, 2004. On July 20, 2010, Hines and Young filed for divorce after nearly eight years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Cheryl-Hines-Divorce-1022129.aspx|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm's Cheryl Hines Getting Divorced|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a nephew was born with [[cerebral palsy]], Hines contacted [[United Cerebral Palsy]] for answers and resources. Over time, she became involved with UCP and has used her celebrity status to help elevate its visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cheryl Hines - Interview|journal=[[ABILITY Magazine]]|date=Feb–Mar 2008|issue=Cheryl Hines Issue|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Cheryl_hines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines serves on the Board of Trustees of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100619214656/https://ucp.org/ucp_generaldoc.cfm/1/3/6633/6633-6633/6693 United Cerebral Palsy].  Hines and her family won $25,000 for UCP on the July 12, 2015 episode of ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''.

In December 2011, Hines began dating activist [[Robert F.

==Overview==
{{more|consumer debt}}
Debt generally refers to [[money]] owed by one party, the [[debtor]], to a second party, the [[creditor]]. It is generally subject to repayments of [[Principal (finance)|principal]] and [[interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp|title=Debt Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interest]] is the fee charged by the [[creditor]] to the [[debtor]], generally calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year known as an [[interest rate]] and generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly. Debt can be [[Secured loan|secured]] with [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] or [[Unsecured debt|unsecured]]. 

Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of [[home loans]], [[credit card debt]] and [[car finance|car loans]]. [[Household debt]] is the consumer debt of the adults in the household plus the [[mortgage]], if applicable. In many countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, [[student loan|student loans]] can be a significant portion of debt but are usually regulated differently than other debt.&lt;ref name=Studentloands&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rowan|first1=Rachel|title=Student Loans Around the Globe|url=https://www.tuition.io/blog/2013/06/student-loans-around-the-globe/|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Tuition.io - Student Loan|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall debt can reach the point where a [[debtor]] is in danger of [[bankruptcy]], [[insolvency]], or other fiscal emergency.&lt;ref name="VittMacBean2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lois A. Vitt|author2=E. Craig MacBean|author3=Jürg K. Siegenthaler|author4=Institute for Socio-Financial Studies|title=Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lc3zy80-h_AC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 November 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32834-3|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Options available to overburdened debtors include [[credit counseling]] and [[personal bankruptcy]]. 

Other consumer options include:
*[[debt settlement]], where an individual's debt is negotiated to a lesser interest rate or principal with the creditors to lessen the overall burden;
*[[debt relief]], where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven; and 
*debt consolidation, where the individual is able to acquit the current debts by taking out a new [[loan]]. 
Sometimes the solution includes some of each of these tactics.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Coping with Debt|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0150-coping-debt|website=FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION|publisher=US Government|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Process===
The bulk of the consumer debt, especially that with a high interest, is repaid by a new loan. Most debt consolidation loans are offered from [[Financial institution|lending institutions]] and secured as a [[second mortgage]] or [[home equity line of credit]].&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; These require the individual to put up a home as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] and the loan to be less than the [[equity (finance)|equity]] available. 

The overall lower interest rate is an advantage of the debt consolidation loan offers consumers. Lenders have fixed costs to process payments and repayment can spread out over a larger period. However, such consolidation loans have costs: fees, interest, and "points" where one point equals to one percent of the amount borrowed. In some countries, these loans may provide certain tax advantages.&lt;ref name=Foxtaxbreaks&gt;{{cite news|last1=Detweiller|first1=Gerri|title=Congress Extends Tax Break for Troubled Homeowners, But Headaches Aren’t Over|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2014/12/18/congress-extends-tax-break-for-troubled-homeowners-but-headaches-arent-over/|accessdate=21 December 2014|work=Fox Business News|date=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are secured, a lender can attempt to seize property if the borrower goes into [[default (finance)|default]]. 

Personal loans comprise another form of debt consolidation loan. Individuals can issue debtors a [[personal loan]] that satisfies the outstanding debt and creates a new one on their own terms. These loans, often unsecured, are based on the personal relationship rather than collateral.

==Student loan consolidation==
In the United States, federal [[student loan]]s are consolidated somewhat differently from in the UK, as federal student loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

===United States===
In a [[federal student loan consolidation]], existing loans are purchased by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].  Upon consolidation, a fixed interest rate is set based on the then-current interest rate. Reconsolidating does not change that rate. If the student combines loans of different types and rates into one new consolidation loan, a weighted average calculation will establish the appropriate rate based on the then-current interest rates of the different loans being consolidated together.&lt;ref name="Lucas2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Lucas|title=Costs and Policy Options for Federal Student Loan Programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug0Dn3NoZxcC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=August 2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-3158-7|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal student loan consolidation is often referred to as refinancing, which is incorrect because the loan rates are not changed, merely locked in. Unlike private sector debt consolidation, student loan consolidation does not incur any fees for the borrower; private companies make money on student loan consolidation by reaping subsidies from the federal government.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK [[student loan]] entitlements are guaranteed, and are recovered using a means-tested system from the student's future income. Student loans in the UK can not be included in [[bankruptcy]], but do not affect a person's credit rating because the repayments are deducted from salary at source by employers, similar to [[Income Tax]] and [[National Insurance]] contributions. Many students, however, struggle with commercial debt well after their courses have finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creditaction.org.uk/assets/PDF/statistics/2011/august-2011.pdf|title=Debt Facts and Figures - Compiled August 2011|date=August 2011|publisher=creditaction.org.uk|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia’s student loan system once had 35 years to pay back loans, but it’s currently 15. Those seriously delinquent on student loans face arrest at the border. &lt;ref name=Studentloands /&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, an increasing number of student loans are in arrears. This has caused the Asian nation to take harsher steps when it comes to lending determinations. In an effort to prevent future defaults, Japan has begun associating loan approvals to academic performance.&lt;ref name=Studentloands /&gt;

'''Diamond clarity''' is the quality of [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]] that relates to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called ''inclusions'', and surface defects, called ''blemishes''. Clarity is one of the '''four Cs''' of diamond grading, the others being [[Carat (unit)|carat]], [[diamond color|color]], and [[diamond cut|cut]].

[[Inclusion (mineral)|Inclusions]] are solids, liquids, or gases that were trapped in a mineral as it formed. They may be crystals of a foreign material or even another diamond crystal, or may have produced structural imperfections, such as tiny cracks that make a diamond appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under ten times magnification.

Most inclusions present in gem-quality diamonds do not affect the diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not visible to the naked eyes. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.

Diamonds with higher clarity grades are more valued, with the exceedingly rare "Flawless" graded diamond fetching the highest price. Minor inclusions or blemishes are useful, as they can be used as unique identifying marks analogous to [[fingerprint]]s. In addition, as [[synthetic diamond]] technology improves and distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds becomes more difficult, inclusions or blemishes can be used as proof of natural origin.

==Inclusions and blemishes==
{{main|Diamond flaws}}
There are several types of inclusions and blemishes, which affect a diamond's clarity to varying degrees. Features resulting from [[diamond enhancement]] procedures, such as laser lines, are also considered inclusions or blemishes.

===Inclusions===
*Clouds
*Feathers
*Included crystals or minerals
*Knots
*Cavities
*Cleavage
*Bearding
*Internal graining
*Pinpoint
*Laser lines
*Twinning Wisp
*Grain center
*Laser drill hole
*Knot
*Needle
The diamond industry uses the term "internal characteristics" instead of "inclusions". For natural diamonds, the "internal characteristics" in the diamond are growth crystals that give the diamond its character and unique fingerprint. When diamonds are graded, they are magnified at 10x power.

===Blemishes===
*Polish lines
*Grain boundaries
*Naturals
*Scratches
*Nicks
*Pits
*Chips
*Breaks
*Dark spots
*Light spots
*Abrasions

====History====
In 1952, [[Richard T. Liddicoat]], along with [[Marquis Person]], Joe Phillips, [[Robert Crowningshield]] and [[Bert Krashes]] began to work on a new diamond grading system which they called the "diamond grading and evaluation appraisal".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; In 1953, they released their new system which assessed three aspects of diamonds; make, color and clarity.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; They took terminology used in the industry at the time and refined the definitions to produce a clarity scale by which diamonds could be consistently graded.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The system at that time contained nine grades: Flawless, VVS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, VVS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, VS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, VS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SI&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, SI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The 'I' of the I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; grades originally stood for "Imperfect".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

During the 1970s, two changes were made to the system. Firstly, the ''Internally Flawless'' grade was added, as GIA noticed that many diamonds were being aggressively cut to remove any surface blemishes, and thereby reducing the cutting quality ("make") of the diamonds.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The ''Internally Flawless'' grade gave diamond manufacturers a choice to leave blemishes on the surface of the stone, and achieve a grade higher than VVS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The second change made to the grading system was the introduction of the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; grade. This change was made in response to a growing number of diamonds of very low clarity being cut.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The last change to the clarity grading system took place in the 1990s when the term "imperfect" was changed to "included".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The GIA diamond grading scale is divided into six categories and eleven grades.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity&gt;"Diamonds and Diamond Grading" course material - Book 11, Grading Clarity, Gemological Institute of America, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The clarity categories and grades are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naturski|first1=Sebastian|title=Diamond Clarity|url=http://yourdiamondteacher.com/diamond-4cs/clarity/|website=Your Diamond Teacher|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Flawless''''' category (FL) diamonds have no inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904001054/https://www.gia.edu/library/4286/6278/faq_detail_page.cfm |url=http://www.gia.edu/library/4286/6278/faq_detail_page.cfm |archivedate= September 4, 2006|title=What is the GIA Clarity Scale for diamonds? |work= GIA Library  |accessdate= December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Internally Flawless''''' category (IF) diamonds have no inclusions visible under 10x magnification, only small blemishes on the diamond surface.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt;
*'''''Very, Very Slightly Included''''' category (VVS) diamonds have minute inclusions that are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The VVS category is divided into two grades; VVS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VVS2. Pinpoints and needles set the grade at VVS.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;
*'''''Very Slightly Included''''' category (VS) diamonds have minor inclusions that are difficult to somewhat easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The VS category is divided into two grades; VS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VS2. Typically the inclusions in VS diamonds are invisible without magnification; however, infrequently some VS2 inclusions may still be visible. An example would be on a large emerald cut diamond which has a small inclusion under the corner of the table.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;
*'''''Slightly Included''''' category (SI) diamonds have noticeable inclusions that are easy to very easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The SI category is divided into two grades; SI1 denotes a higher clarity grade than SI2. These may or may not be noticeable to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Pagel"/&gt;
*'''''Included''''' category (I) diamonds have obvious inclusions that are clearly visible to a trained grader under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; Included diamonds have inclusions that are usually visible without magnification or have inclusions that threaten the durability of the stone. The I category is divided into three grades; I1 denotes a higher clarity grade than I2, which in turn is higher than I3. Inclusions in I1 diamonds often are seen by the unaided eye. I2 inclusions are easily seen, while I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

=====GIA clarity grading procedure=====
GIA clarity grading is performed under 10x magnification with darkfield illumination. The GIA Laboratory uses as standard equipment binocular stereo microscopes which are able to zoom to higher magnifications. These microscopes are equipped with darkfield illumination, as well as an ultraviolet filtered overhead light. When grading is performed using a 10x handheld loupe, darkfield illumination is more difficult to achieve. The grader must use a light source in such a way that the base of the stone is lit from the side, and the crown of the stone is shielded from the light.

After thoroughly cleaning the diamond, the diamond is picked up using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond for the first time through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.&lt;ref name="GIAManual"/&gt;

If a stereo binocular microscope has been used, a final assessment using a 10x loupe is performed before the final judgment is made on the clarity of the stone. The grader first decides the clarity category of the diamond: none (FL, or IF for a blemish), minute (VVS), minor (VS), noticeable (SI), or obvious (I). The decision is then made on the grade of the diamond.&lt;ref name="GIAManual"&gt;''Diamond Grading: Lab Manual'' Gemological Institute of America, Carlsbad, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gia.edu/lab-reports-services/diamonds/index.html |title=How GIA Grades Diamonds|publisher=Gia.edu |date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319064538/http://www.gia.edu/lab-reports-services/diamonds/index.html|archivedate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading systems by other organizations===
The clarity grading system developed by the GIA has been used throughout the industry as well as by other diamond grading agencies including the [[American Gemological Society]] (AGS), and the [[International Gemological Institute]] (IGI). There are other smaller labs which use the GIA system as well.  These grading agencies base their clarity grades on the characteristics of inclusions visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above under 10x [[magnification]].

The [[World Jewellery Confederation]] developed the ''International Clarity Scale'' for grading diamonds. This clarity scale mirrors the GIA grading scale, except nomenclature varies. The system names these clarity grades; Loupe Clean, Very, very small inclusions (VVS1 and VVS2), Very small inclusions (VS1 and VS2), Small inclusions (SI1 and SI2), Pique (P1, P2, and P3).

Clarity grading by WJC standards is by examination using a 10x [[achromatic lens|achromatic]], [[aplanatic]] loupe in normal light.&lt;ref name="Pagel"/&gt;

The American Gem Society grades clarity on a number scale between 0 and 10. These numbers grades correlate almost exactly with the GIA system, but with some differences. The flawless and internally flawless (0) grades are grouped together with notation defining whether the stone is free from external blemishes, the VVS through SI grades are numbered 1 through 6, and then there are four grades 7 through 10 for the included category.&lt;ref name="TheAGSWay"/&gt;

Clarity grading by AGS standards requires examination using a binocular stereo microscope equipped with adjustable zoom magnification and darkfield illumination.&lt;ref name="TheAGSWay"&gt;''The AGS Way: Diamond Grading Standards'' American Gem Society, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Gemological Laboratory]] (EGL) introduced the SI3 as a clarity grade. While intended as a range to include borderline SI2 / I1 stones, it is now commonly used to mean I1's which are "eye clean", that is, which have inclusions which are not obviously visible to the naked eye.

==Clarity grading considerations==
All grades reflect the appearance to an experienced grader when viewed from above at 10x magnification, though higher magnifications and viewing from other angles are used during the grading process. The grader studies the diamond for internal characteristics and judges them on the basis of five clarity factors: size, number, position, nature, and color or relief. The clarity grade is assessed on the basis of the most noticeable inclusions, the so-called "grade setting inclusions". Less significant inclusions are ignored for the purposes of setting the grade; however, they may still be plotted onto a diamond plot chart.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

Accurate clarity grading as with other grading steps must be done with the diamond "loose", i.e. not set into any mounting. Inclusions are often difficult to see from the crown side of the diamond, and may be concealed by the setting.

===Size===
The first clarity factor which is assessed is a clarity characteristic's size. Larger characteristics are typically more noticeable under magnification, thereby placing the diamond into a lower clarity grade.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Number===
The second clarity factor which is assessed is the number of clarity characteristics. Generally, the more characteristics, the lower the clarity grade. This assessment is made by judging how readily they can be seen, not by the actual number of characteristics.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Position===
The third clarity factor which is assessed is the characteristic's position. When an inclusion is directly under the table of the diamond it is most visible. An inclusion under the table and positioned close to a pavilion facet will reflect multiple times around the stone, giving this type of inclusion the name "reflector". Reflectors are graded as if each reflection were an inclusion (although in plotting the diamond it is only plotted once). For this reason, reflectors have a greater impact on the clarity grade. Inclusions become less visible when they are positioned under the crown facets, or near the girdle of the stone. These inclusions may often be more easily seen from the pavilion side of the diamond than from crown side of the diamond.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

Additionally, the position of large feathers, knots and included crystals positioned where they extend to the girdle or crown of the stone affect the clarity grade. Diamonds worn in jewelry typically will withstand breakage, however inclusions of this nature and in these positions can pose a risk for further extension of the break in the structure of the diamond. Inclusions that are judged to pose at least a moderate risk of breakage to the stone are graded in the ''Included'' category.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Nature===
The fourth clarity factor which is assessed is a characteristic's nature. The characteristic's nature determines whether it is internal (extending into the stone) or external (limited to the surface of the stone). Internal characteristics automatically exclude the diamond from the ''Flawless'', and ''Internally Flawless'' categories. External characteristics exclude the diamond from the ''Flawless'' category.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

An internal characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): bruise, cavity, chip, cleavage, cloud, crystal, feather, grain center, indented natural, internal graining, knot, laser drill hole, needle, pinpoint, or twinning wisp.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

An external characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): abrasion, natural, nick, pit, polish lines, polish mark, scratch, surface graining, or extra facet.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The nature will also determine whether an inclusion poses a risk to the stone. An inclusion that may cause a break in the crystal structure (included crystal, feather, knot, and cleavage) may, depending on its position, pose a moderate level of risk for further breakage.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Color or relief===
The fifth clarity factor which is assessed is the color and relief of clarity characteristics. Characteristics that contrast with the surrounding diamond are said to have "relief". The degree to which this color and relief is noticeable affects the clarity grade of the diamond. Colored inclusions invariably show contrast and are more easily seen. An exception is a black pinpoint inclusion, which is often more difficult to see than a white pinpoint.&lt;ref    name=GIAClarity/&gt;

== Rarity and value ==
Diamonds become increasingly rare when considering higher clarity gradings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Clarity |work= Blue Nile|url=http://www.bluenile.com/diamonds/diamond-clarity|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 20% of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high enough for the diamond to be considered appropriate for use as a gemstone; the other 80% are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20%, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are visible to the naked eye upon close inspection. Those that do not have a visible inclusion when the gem is examined approximately 6 inches from the naked eye are known as "eye-clean",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zultanite – A Relatively New, Extremely Rare Gemstone Popular in Jewelry Design|url=http://4csblog.gia.edu/2011/zultanite-a-relatively-new-extremely-rare-gemstone-popular-in-jewelry-design-2|work=GIA.org|publisher=GIA|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although visible inclusions can sometimes be hidden under the setting in a piece of jewelry. The most expensive gem diamonds fall within the VS and SI grades with FL, IF, and even VVS stones commanding significant premiums. FL and IF stones are sometimes referred to as "museum quality" or "investment grade" to denote their rarity{{according to whom|date=November 2012}} although the term "investment grade" is misleading as diamonds have historically been [[liquidity|illiquid]] and questionable stores of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|title=Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/|work=The Atlantic, Feb 1982|publisher=Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many diamond purchases are infrequent (e.g. engagement rings), there is a level of concern{{clarify|date=August 2017}} by [[end consumer]]s having to pay large premiums for clarity grade differences that are important to the certificate or diamond industry, but not to the buying public, who generally cannot discern the difference with the naked eye.

== Clarity enhancement ==
{{main|Diamond enhancement}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

Laser "drilling" involves using a laser to burn a hole to a colored inclusion, followed by acid washing to remove the coloring agent. The clarity grade is the grade after the treatment. The treatment is considered permanent.

Clarity can also be "enhanced" by filling the fracture much like a car windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called "[[Diamond enhancement#Fracture filling|fracture filled]] diamonds". Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, in part because the treatment is not as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a [[blowtorch]] used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.

GIA, as a matter of policy, does not grade clarity-enhanced diamonds but it will grade laser-drilled diamonds since it considers the enhancement to be permanent in nature. If a GIA report has the words "clarity enhanced" or "fracture filled", it is surely a counterfeit report.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Ebenezer "Eben" Allen''' (15 November 1868 – 20 May 1931) was an Australian businessman and politician who was a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1911 to 1917, representing the [[Electoral district of West Perth|seat of West Perth]].

Allen was born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], to Mary Selina (née Cant) and Joseph Allen. He attended Glenelg Grammar School (run by [[F. I. Caterer]]), and after leaving school worked for various Adelaide firms. Allen married Effie Marian Conigrave in 1895 (with whom he later had two children), and in 1899 moved to Western Australia to work for her father, [[J. Fairfax Conigrave]]. He eventually went into business on his own, as an auctioneer, real estate agent, and shipping agent. He became secretary of the [[Perth Chamber of Commerce]], and was also a director of a local [[building society]]. Allen served on the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] from 1904 to 1912 and again from 1915 to 1918. He first ran for parliament at the 1908 [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] elections, but lost to [[Arthur Jenkins (Australian politician)|Arthur Jenkins]] in [[Metropolitan Province]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/32491D035B28BD35482577E50028A4FC?OpenDocument Ebenezer Allen] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 4 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Western Australian state election, 1911|1911 state election]], Allen was elected to parliament running for the newly formed [[Western Australian Liberal Party (1911–1917)|Liberal Party]]. He replaced the retiring member in West Perth, [[Thomas Draper]]. Allen was re-elected at the [[Western Australian state election, 1914|1914 election]], but at the [[Western Australian state election, 1917|1917 election]] was opposed by Draper, who had decided he wished to resume his parliamentary career. Both he and Draper stood for the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]], which had been created earlier in the year, but Draper was more popular, winning back his former seat with 53.3 percent of the [[First preferences|first-preference vote]]. Allen recontested West Perth at the [[Western Australian state election, 1921|1921 election]], but polled only the third-highest number of votes. Draper lost his seat regardless, with the winning candidate, [[Edith Cowan]], becoming the first female member of parliament in Australia.&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=David|authorlink=David Black (historian)|last2=Prescott|first2=Valerie|title=Election statistics : Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, 1890-1996|year=1997|publisher=Western Australian Parliamentary History Project and Western Australian Electoral Commission|location=Perth, [W.A.]|isbn=0730984095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen died in Perth in May 1931, aged 62. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the head on the [[Perth Esplanade]], having had business troubles and been in poor physical health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/83921804 "VALUED CITIZEN PASSES"], ''[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]]'', 20 May 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/32524742 "MR.

'''Genomic counseling''' is the process by which a person gets informed about his or her [[genome]]. In contrast to [[genetic counseling]], which focuses on [[Mendelian]] diseases and typically involves person-to-person communication with a genetic counselor or other medical genetics expert, genomic counseling is not limited to currently clinically relevant information.  It is often based on genomic information that is of interest for the informed person, such as increased risk for common complex disease that has actionable components (for example [[diabetes]] or [[obesity]]), genetically determined non-disease related traits (for example [[baldness]]), or recreational forms of information and [[genetic genealogy]] data. An individuals response to certain medications/drugs based on their pharmacogenomic profile may be provided. 

The need for genomic counseling is currently driven by [[personal genomics]] companies, including [[23andMe]], Helix, and [[Pathway Genomics]]. Given the wealth and complexity of  information obtained by personal genomics tests, genomic counseling can require expertise from a wide range of experts, including physicians, geneticists, molecular biologists, evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, statisticians, or bioinformaticians. Access of consumers to complete personal genomes through cheap [[full genome sequencing]] is likely to exacerbate this problem in the near future.&lt;ref name=pmid19212365&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2009.86 |pmid=19212365 |title=Genome sequencing: The third generation |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=768–9 |year=2009 |last1=Check Hayden |first1=Erika }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently not enough genetic counselors and clinical geneticists to help patients interpret whole-genome sequencing results regarding health-relevant information, and research shows that primary-care physicians lack the knowledge and expertise to help patients understand even single-gene test results.&lt;ref name=pmid20065954&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrg2735 |pmid=20065954 |title=Personalized genomic information: Preparing for the future of genetic medicine |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=161–5 |year=2010 |last1=Guttmacher |first1=Alan E |last2=McGuire |first2=Amy L |last3=Ponder |first3=Bruce |last4=Stefánsson |first4=Kári }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17230201&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrg2007 |pmid=17230201 |title=Educating health-care professionals about genetics and genomics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=151–7 |year=2007 |last1=Guttmacher |first1=Alan E |last2=Porteous |first2=Mary E |last3=McInerney |first3=Joseph D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk assessments ==

Typically, a family history is taken to more fully allow interpretation and incorporation of genomic data. Such an assessment is used to "identify and quantify" risk for inherited hereditary diseases. Whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing [[Whole exome sequencing|[WES]]] "may not provide full coverage of critical genes" and performing a risk assessment "allows the genetic team to generate a differential diagnosis and order more sensitive genetic testing if necessary".&lt;ref name=pmid24498615&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/mgg3.45 |pmid=24498615 |pmc=3865587 |title=From genetic counseling to "genomic counseling" |journal=Molecular Genetics &amp; Genomic Medicine |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=189–93 |year=2013 |last1=Ormond |first1=Kelly E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and informed consent ==

"Whole genomes have gone from becoming that discovery technique to being present in the clinic on a regular basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Genetic Counselors in a Genome World|date=2014-01-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTg5IvC0no0|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic counseling sessions may include briefings on "general genetic principles, modes of inheritance, family/individual specific risk assessment, an in-depth discussion of the diagnosis and natural history, potential testing options, and case management for the condition occurring… or for which they are at risk". The delivery of such information should be aimed to the patient's level of comprehension and take into account his or her culture and other personal context.&lt;ref name=pmid24498615/&gt;

== Interpretation of genetic tests ==
Challenges in genetic counseling exists in both the decision and discussion of which incidental findings will be assessed and returned to patients. Patients may not be familiar with the condition and may be unable to make an informed opinion regarding the next steps in treatment. Genetic counselors and geneticists "already sit on interpretation panels for determining what warrants disclosure". This role will become "increasingly relevant for all genetic counselors" in order to ensure that all in the profession are "proficient in variant interpretation and understand the laboratory and bioinformatics processes" of such tests.&lt;ref name=pmid24498615/&gt;

== Genomic counselors ==
Qualifications for who can practice genomic counseling and what the practice will entail is up for debate as genetic counseling begins to incorporate genome counseling. A few changes that may see changes include the roles of risk assessments, education, and informed consent.

== Virtual genomic counseling ==
Telegenetics is "videoconferencing for clinical genetics services" and is becoming an "increasingly utilized method of delivering genetic counseling to rural areas".&lt;ref name=pmid20406122&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/tmj.2009.0108 |pmid=20406122 |title=The Virtual Consultation: Practitioners' Experiences of Genetic Counseling by Videoconferencing in Australia |journal=Telemedicine and e-Health |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=350–7 |year=2010 |last1=Zilliacus |first1=Elvira |last2=Meiser |first2=Bettina |last3=Lobb |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Dudding |first4=Tracey E |last5=Barlow-Stewart |first5=Kristine |last6=Tucker |first6=Katherine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) frequently utilizes telegenetics regardless of the client's "geographical location or ability to attend face-to-face sessions".&lt;ref name=pmid23093333&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10897-012-9548-0 |pmid=23093333 |pmc=3597267 |title=Counseling Customers: Emerging Roles for Genetic Counselors in the Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Market |journal=Journal of Genetic Counseling |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=277–88 |year=2012 |last1=Harris |first1=Anna |last2=Kelly |first2=Susan E |last3=Wyatt |first3=Sally }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been very limited study of patients receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. A randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. Primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. Of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. In contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. A total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. We found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. Genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. Our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. Disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. In conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. These results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.&lt;ref name=pmid28345121&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10897-017-0073-z |pmid=28345121 |pmc=5617760 |title=Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Genomic Counseling for Patients Receiving Personalized and Actionable Complex Disease Reports |journal=Journal of Genetic Counseling |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=980–998 |year=2017 |last1=Sweet |first1=Kevin |last2=Sturm |first2=Amy C |last3=Schmidlen |first3=Tara |last4=McElroy |first4=Joseph |last5=Scheinfeldt |first5=Laura |last6=Manickam |first6=Kandamurugu |last7=Gordon |first7=Erynn S |last8=Hovick |first8=Shelly |last9=Scott Roberts |first9=J |last10=Toland |first10=Amanda Ewart |last11=Christman |first11=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensure as barrier ===
Licensure poses a conflict for the provision of virtual genomic counseling. Medical practitioners are typically licensed to practice in the state in which they reside. In order to practice across state borders, the practitioner must apply for licensure in that state as well. Obtaining multiple licenses is costly and time consuming for practitioners who often don't want to deal with the hoops required to become duly licensed. Providers that do offer telemedicine or telegenetics services to out-of-state clients face "civil and criminal sanctions for practicing medicine without a license". Due to the limitation that licensure poses, clients who require the service of medical geneticists but live in a state with no licensed practitioners are required to travel to nearby states or go without the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nccrcg.org/NCCRCG/Resources/Telegenetics_Resources/NCCRCG/Resources/Telegenetics_Resource.aspx?hkey=3cdf5983-439d-49fd-9be7-1919ed05b815|title=Impediments and Solutions to Telegenetics Practice: Meeting Report|last=|first=|date=|website=National Coordinating Center for the Regional Genetic Services Collaboratives|publisher=American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying history, geography and pedagogic he received his PhD in 1981 from the Department of History at [[University of Hamburg]] and in 1992 his Habilitation from the Department of Economics at the Free University of Berlin. Since then he has taught at several universities in Germany, Norway and the United States in both, departments of economics and of history. 
Schröter’s main project is to find out more about Europe’s specific economic profile and character during the last two centuries. Consequently he explored on the relation between state and the economy, economic cooperation (cartels, cooperatives, cooperation between capital and labour, etc.), European multinational enterprise, technological innovation, (dis-) advantages of European small developed states, institutions and innovation, the “European enterprise”, and on the transfer of economic behaviour and values (Americanization).
Among others Schröter served as the President of [[European Business History Association]]&lt;ref name="ebha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebha.org|title= http://www.ebha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on several advisory and editorial boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">In the [[United Kingdom]], only an authorised or licensed '''Insolvency Practitioner''' (usually abbreviated to '''IP''') may be appointed in relation to formal [[insolvency]] procedures.

Quite often IPs have an [[accountant|accountancy]] background.  A few active practitioners are [[lawyer]]s, but it is not necessary to be qualified as either, as since 1986 there has been a direct entry route to the profession.

==Insolvency is a regulated profession==

In the UK, only a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (referred to as IP) can be appointed in relation to formal insolvency procedures for individuals and businesses. Insolvency Practitioners are licensed to advise on, and undertake appointments in, all formal insolvency procedures. In the UK Insolvency Practitioners are subject to oversight and inspection by their recognised professional body.
Insolvency is a regulated profession under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolv ency Act 1986 1986 CHAPTER 45|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110709051253/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/insolvencyprofessionandlegislation/legislation/uk/insolvencyact.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 July 2011|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Le g al) Limited|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and anyone who wishes to practise as an IP needs to pass the [[JIEB exams]]; a set of three examination papers set by the Joint Insolvency Examination Board (JIEB). The exams are held once a year, usually in November, and each last 3.5 hours. Once the exams have been passed, it is necessary to meet the authorising body's insolvency experience requirements. Licences are issued by the following recognised professional bodies:&lt;ref name=r3&gt;{{cite web|title=The future of regulation insolvency practitioner|url=http://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/policy/policy_papers/insolvency_industry/The_future_of_insolvency_practitioner_regulation.pdf|publisher=Association of Business Recovery  Professionals|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]]
*[[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]]
*[[Law Society of Scotland]]
*[[The Solicitors Regulation Authority]]

As a "competent authority" under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], the [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] (BERR) - and, for Northern Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment - also authorises IPs.  The [[Insolvency Service]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insolvency.gov.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429115235/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/ |date=2009-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an executive agency of BERR, oversees insolvency regulation in Great Britain and each authorising body is represented on the Joint Insolvency Committee, which aims to develop and maintain insolvency standards and best practice guidance, largely by means of Statements of Insolvency Practice (SIPs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insolvency-practitioners.org.uk/uploads/Technical/JIC%20Annual%20Report%202006.pdf Joint Insolvency Committee Annual Report 2006]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910124411/http://www.insolvency-practitioners.org.uk/uploads/Technical/JIC%20Annual%20Report%202006.pdf |date=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently around 1,735 Licensed Insolvency Practitioners in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt; not all of whom take appointments – various lawyers hold licences but rarely use them to take appointments, preferring to advise other practitioners.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Trade body==

The Association of Business Recovery Professionals, is the leading professional association for insolvency, business recovery and turnaround specialists in the UK. Known by its brand name ‘R3’, it promotes best practice for professionals working with financially troubled individuals and businesses.

==Procedures requiring an Insolvency Practitioner==

*[[Administration order|Administrations]]
*[[Administrative receivership|Administrative Receiverships]]
*[[Bankruptcy]]

'''Jacques Fred Petrus''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒak fʁɛd pɛtrys}}; February 22, 1948 – June 8, 1987) was a French-Italian businessman and a pioneer of [[post-disco]] music.

==Early years==
Born in [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[French West Indies]], Petrus worked as a diesel-engine mechanic on a cargo ship aged only 15 before his early interest for [[R&amp;B]] and soul music brought him to [[Paris]] where he worked as a [[DJ]] at different clubs, including the jet-set nightclub Club Saint-Hilaire.

In the early 70s, he moved to [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and continued his career as a DJ for several famous local clubs like "Good Mood". After a crucial meeting in Bologna with music student Mauro Malavasi, who became his working partner and main songwriter and producer, they formed a disco production company called Goody Music Productions (GMP), invested in a recording studio in [[Bologna]] and created the Goody Music record label.

In 1978 the two released their first studio project called [[Macho (band)|Macho]] which was followed by more or less commercially successful disco productions like Revanche and [[Peter Jacques band]]. But it wasn't until 1980, when their latest creation called [[Change (band)|Change]] was revealed, that Petrus and Malavasi established their own signature sound and reached their goal of world wide success. In 1979 Fred Petrus gathered his international music activities under the company name Little Macho Music.

==Change - Petrus' biggest success==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2017}}
When [[Change (band)|Change]] hit the market in 1980 with their debut album ''The Glow of Love'' Petrus and Malavasi didn't realise the magnitude of the success that was to come. Petrus used two other Italian musicians besides Malavasi on this album, bassist Davide Romani and guitarist Paolo Gianolio. Romani – who not only wrote the number-one hits "A Lover's Holiday" and "The Glow of Love" (with vocals by [[Luther Vandross]] (who was hired by Petrus to perform together with [[Jocelyn Brown]]) – but also arranged and conducted the entire set in conjunction with Gianolio. Besides "A Lover's Holiday", which reached the number-one spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play for nine weeks, the album also received seven Grammy-Award nominations.

Although similar to the famous disco band [[Chic (band)|Chic]], which was a source of inspiration for Romani, Change had their own slick and sophisticated blend of [[eurodisco]] and American Chic'esque R&amp;B-flavored disco. From 1980 to 1983, when Chic's fame was waning, Change managed to climb higher on the charts each year. Although Jacques Fred Petrus released many other tracks with several other artists, none achieved the same fame and success as Change.

==Other projects until 1986==
Early Petrus projects included Macho (1978), Elvin Shaad (1978), Peter Jacques Band (1979), Revanche (1979), Rudy (an album bringing the Italian Goody Music collaborator Rudy Trevisi to the front), Midnight Gang (1979), A.N.T.I. Rock (1980) (the Italian version of Ottawan's disco hit D.I.S.C.O.), The Jumpers (1980), Gianni Riso (1980) and Caprice (1980).

After the tremendous hype with Change Petrus and Malavasi launched several new projects like The Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens band ([[B. B. &amp; Q. band]]) in 1981, High Fashion (1982) (including the Romani/Malavasi penned hit "Feelin' lucky lately" which reached the No 32 spot on Billboards R&amp;B chart), Silence (a pop album released in 1982) and Zinc (1982). Petrus and his troupe of Italian studio musicians and writers also co-wrote and produced parts of The Ritchie Family's 1982 album "I'll do my Best". The title track became a club hit, and was penned by Malavasi. Of all these new projects the [[B. B. &amp; Q. band]] was by far the most successful concept. Their self-titled 1981 debut album included "On the Beat" (by Malavasi/Slade), a highly catchy and hypnotic dance floor filler with a powerful intro that rocketed to the No 8 spot on the Billboard black singles charts.

During the second part of the 80's Petrus achieved success with album releases of B.B.&amp;Q. Band (1985), Peter Jacques Band (1985) and Change (1985). Less successful projects in 1984 and 1985 (often single releases) included Silence 2 feat. Gordon Grody (1984), Macho III (1984), Kevin Johnson (1984), Zinc feat. Sherwin (1984), M Like Moon (1984), Midnight Gang (1984), Tato (1985), Nobel (1985) and Persuader (1985). Due to severe troubles with the US taxman, Petrus was forced to shut down the Little Macho Music company. In 1985 he started up a new production company and record label called Renaissance International. Vedette International was the name of his new publishing company.

==Death==
In 1986 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the US federal government accused Jacques Fred Petrus of tax evasion.  Petrus put his music industry activities on hold and fled to Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. 

Petrus was murdered in the Spring of 1987 in Guadeloupe under mysterious circumstances. He was only 39 years old. The official version from the French police reported that Petrus had been shot at home in the heights of Saint-Felix by a Swiss gunman who had clashed with him earlier that night at the Petrus-owned club L'Elysée Matignon in Le Gosier.

'''Juan Sánchez-Navarro y Peón''' (April 24, 1913 &amp;ndash; February 12, 2006) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[businessman]], [[lawyer]], [[philosopher]], [[philanthropist]], [[journalist]]  and [[professor]]. For more than 40 years, he served as Executive Vice President of Grupo Modelo. In addition, he led various national business organizations and was a main co-founder of Mexico's [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party PAN]]. Though he himself not a [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] affiliate, he believed in the essential importance of democracy by means of a bi-partisan system that could serve as a contrast to then [[Mexico]]'s ruling political party [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] (thus his involvement [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] in its inception). Sanchez-Navarro would years later be known as the moral conscience and the single most important ideological figure in [[Mexico]]'s booming business community. 

Juan Sánchez-Navarro was born in [[Centro (Mexico City)|downtown]] [[Mexico City]], descendant of the influential [[Sánchez-Navarro family]]. He studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] in the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] eventually becoming a professor there for more than 50 years. At some point he was also a [[teaching assistant]] to philosopher [[Antonio Caso]].

In 1938, Sánchez-Navarro became a manager at [[Cervecería Central]] which then belonged to [[Cervecería Cuauhtémoc]]. In 1939 he co-founded the National Action Party (PAN) with [[Manuel Gómez Morín]] and [[Efraín González Luna]]. In 1942 he was offered a job at then small competitor [[Cervecería Modelo]] (now makers of Corona, Pacifico, Victoria amongst others) by the company's founder Pablo Diez, after what was a fair but staunch negotiation with Don Pablo over beer concession rights at a [[bullfighting]] arena. He accepted the new job and eventually would become director and vicepresident of the board of Grupo Modelo as well as a controlling shareholder, from 1960 forward. Following the death of Don Pablo, Sanchez-Navarro became the leading face of the company.
Sánchez-Navarro would be active and preside in the many employers' organizations he helped establish in Mexico.
These include [[CANACINTRA]], [[CONCANACO]], [[CONCAMIN]], [[CCE (Mexico)|CCE]], [[CEESP]], [[CEMAI]] among others. He was a notable supporter of [[Vicente Fox]]' [[Mexican general election, 2000|Presidential campaign]] in 2000. 

He died in Mexico City at the age of 92, where he was buried in the [[French cemetery]].

'''June Bingham Birge''' (June 20, 1919 – August 21, 2007) was an author, playwright, and member of the [[Lehman family]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/new-york/lehmans-to-celebrate-rich-family-history/48101/ New York Sun: "Lehmans To Celebrate Rich Family History" By GARY SHAPIRO] February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born as '''June Rossbach''' in [[White Plains, New York]]. She was the daughter of Mabel Limburg and Max J.H. Rossbach. She was the grand niece of New York Governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]], for whom the [[Lehman College]] is named. Her maternal grandmother was Clara Lehman Limburg, and her great-grandfather was [[Mayer Lehman]], one of the founders of the [[Lehman Brothers]] firm.&lt;ref name=LehmanCollegeJune&gt;[http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/enews/2007_08_27/feat_birge.html Lehman College: "June Bingham Birge, 1919 - 2007"] August 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JuneBirgeWedding&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/style/june-bingham-marries-robert-b-birge.html New York Times: "June Bingham Marries Robert B. Birge"] March 29, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a bachelor's degree in English from [[Barnard College]] in 1940.
Birge wrote several non-fiction books, including ''Courage to Change: An Introduction to the Life and Thought of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]'' (Scribner, 1961); ''[[U Thant]]: The Search for Peace'' (Knopf, 1966); and, with Norman Tamarkin, ''The Pursuit of Health'' (Walker, 1985). Her plays included a musical, ''Asylum: The Strange Case of Mary Lincoln'', and a play about the women around Franklin D. Roosevelt, ''Triangles''.

==Personal life and death==
In 1939, she married [[Jonathan Brewster Bingham]], who served in Congress from 1965 to 1983 as a Democrat representing [[The Bronx]]; he died in 1986. They had four children: Sherrell Bingham Downes; Timothy Woodbridge Bingham; Claudia Bingham Meyers; and June Mitchell (Micki) Esselstyn (d. 1999).&lt;ref name=GainsvilleObit&gt;[http://www.esselstyn.com/mickinews/tosuntwo.html Gainesville Sun: "Local reverend dies of cancer" By GARY KIRKLAND] October 28, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, she married Robert Bowen Birge.&lt;ref name=NYTObitBingham /&gt;

{{Corporate law|other}}

A {{nihongo|'''''kabushiki gaisha'''''|{{wt|ja|株式会社}}||{{IPA-ja|kabɯɕi̥ki ɡaꜜiɕa|pron}}; lit. "share company"|lead=yes}} or '''''kabushiki kaisha''''', commonly abbreviated '''KK''', is a type of {{nihongo4|company|会社|kaisha}} defined under the [[Law of Japan|Companies Act of Japan]].  The term is often translated as "stock company", "[[joint-stock company]]" or "stock corporation".

==Usage in language==
In English, ''kabushiki kaisha'' is usually used, but the original Japanese pronunciation is ''kabushiki gaisha'' because of [[rendaku]].

A kabushiki kaisha must include "株式会社" in its name (Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Companies Act). In a company name, "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" can be used as a prefix (e.g. {{lang|ja|株式会社電通}} ''[[Dentsu|Kabushiki gaisha Dentsū]]'', which is called "''mae-kabu''") or as a suffix (e.g. {{lang|ja|トヨタ自動車株式会社}} ''[[Toyota|Toyota Jidōsha Kabushiki gaisha]]'', which is called "''ato-kabu''").

Many Japanese companies translate the phrase "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" in their name as "Co., Ltd." but others use the more Americanized translations "Corporation" or "Incorporated." Texts in England often refer to ''kabushiki gaisha'' as "[[joint-stock company|joint stock companies]]." While that is close to a literal translation of the term, the two are not the same. The Japanese government once endorsed "business corporation" as an official translation&lt;ref name=Asahi1&gt;"{{lang|ja|法令用語「日英対訳辞書」まとまる　政府検討委}}", ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', March 18, 2006. ([http://kiyotani.at.webry.info/200603/article_26.html summary])&lt;/ref&gt; but now uses more literal translation "stock company."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legal-astray.jp/sbdic_lt/en/?q=%B3%F4%BC%B0%B2%F1%BC%D2 Standard Bilingual Dictionary of Legal Terminology]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese often abbreviate "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" in a company name on signage (including the sides of their vehicles) to {{lang|ja|株}} in parentheses, as, for example, "{{lang|ja|ABC(株)}}." The full, formal name would then be "{{lang|ja|ABC株式会社}}". {{lang|ja|株式会社}} is also combined into one Unicode character at code point U+337F (㍿).

==History==
The first ''kabushiki gaisha'' was the [[Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank|First National Bank of Japan]], incorporated in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=230dSQYIhocC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=The+first+kabushiki+gaisha+was+the+First+National+Bank+of+Japan,+incorporated+in+1873&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eb88aumTDd&amp;sig=BABeH3X0STix_MoTKqgtRBFLqIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20first%20kabushiki%20gaisha%20was%20the%20First%20National%20Bank%20of%20Japan,%20incorporated%20in%201873&amp;f=false|title=Japan Company Laws and Regulations Handbook|last=Usa|first=Usa Ibp|date=2010|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433070051|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules regarding ''kabushiki gaisha'' were set out in the [[Six Codes|Commercial Code of Japan]]. During the [[Occupied Japan|Allied Occupation of Japan]] following [[World War II]], the occupation authorities introduced revisions to the Commercial Code based on the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1933, giving ''kabushiki gaisha'' many traits of American corporations.&lt;ref name=ramseyer1&gt;Ramseyer, Mark, and Minoru Nakazato, ''Japanese Law: An Economic Approach'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Japanese and U.S. corporate law diverged, and K.K. assumed many characteristics not found in U.S. corporations. For instance, a K.K. could not buy back its own [[stock]] (a restriction which still stands), issue stock for a price of less than ¥50,000 per share (effective 1982), or operate with paid-in capital of less than ¥10 million (effective 1991-2005).&lt;ref name=ramseyer2&gt;Ramseyer, ''op. cit.'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, the [[Diet of Japan]] passed a new {{nihongo|Companies Act|会社法|kaisha-hō}}, which took effect on May 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.waseda.jp/hiken/en/jalaw_inf/topics/005masai.html | title=Review of 2005 Companies Act: Recent discussions | author=Professor Shosaku Masai | publisher=Waseda University Institute of Comparative Law | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law greatly affected the formation and function of K.K.'s and other Japanese business organizations, bringing them closer to their contemporary counterparts in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Formation==
A ''kabushiki gaisha'' may be started with capital as low as ¥1, making the total cost of a K.K. incorporation approximately ¥240,000 (about US$2,500) in taxes and [[Notary public|notarization]] fees. Under the old Commercial Code, a K.K. required starting capital of ¥10 million (about US$105,000); a lower capital requirement was later instituted, but corporations with under ¥3 million in assets were barred from issuing [[dividend]]s, and companies were required to increase their capital to ¥10 million within five years of formation.&lt;ref name=Terrie&gt;Terrie Lloyd, "[http://www.daijob.com/dj4/en/column/terrie/column.jsp?id=321 One Yen Companies – Part Two]," Work in Japan.com.   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510034652/http://www.daijob.com/dj4/en/column/terrie/column.jsp?id=321 |date=May 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main steps in incorporation are the following:
# Preparation and notarization of [[articles of incorporation]]
# Receipt of [[Financial capital|capital]], either directly or through an offering

The incorporation of a K.K. is carried out by one or more {{nihongo|[[incorporator]]s|発起人|hokkinin|sometimes referred to as "promoters"}}. Although seven incorporators were required as recently as the 1980s, a K.K. now only needs one incorporator, which may be an individual or a corporation. If there are multiple incorporators, they must sign a [[partnership]] agreement before incorporating the company.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

# The value or minimum amount of assets received in exchange for the initial issuance of shares
# The name and address of the incorporator(s)

The purpose statement requires some specialized knowledge, as Japan follows an [[ultra vires]] doctrine and does not allow a K.K. to act beyond its purposes. [[Judicial scrivener|Judicial]] or [[administrative scrivener]]s are often hired to draft the purposes of a new company.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Additionally, the articles of incorporation must contain the following if applicable:
# Any non-cash assets contributed as capital to the company, the name of the contributor and the number of shares issued for such assets
# Any assets promised to be purchased after the incorporation of the company and the name of the provider
# Any compensation to be paid to the incorporator(s)
# Non-routine incorporation expenses that will be borne by the company

Other matters may also be included, such as limits on the number of directors and auditors. The Corporation Code allows a K.K. to be formed as a {{nihongo|"stock company that is not a public company"|公開会社でない株式会社|kōkai gaisha denai kabushiki gaisha}}, or a (so-called) {{nihongo|"close company"|非公開会社|hi-kōkai gaisha}}, in which case the company (e.g. its board of directors or a shareholders' meeting, as defined in the articles of incorporation) must approve any transfer of shares between shareholders; this designation must be made in the articles of incorporation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The articles must be sealed by the incorporator(s) and notarized by a [[notary public]], then filed with the Legal Affairs Bureau in the jurisdiction where the company will have its head office.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Receipt of capital===
In a direct incorporation, each incorporator receives a specified amount of stock as designated in the articles of incorporation. Each incorporator must then promptly pay its share of the starting capital of the company, and if no directors have been designated in the articles of incorporation, meet to determine the initial directors and other officers.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The other method is an "incorporation by offering," in which each incorporator becomes the [[underwriter]] of a specified number of shares (at least one each), and the other shares are offered to other investors. As in a direct incorporation, the incorporators must then hold an organizational meeting to appoint the initial directors and other officers. Any person wishing to receive shares must submit an application to the incorporator, and then make payment for his or her shares by a date specified by the incorporator(s).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Capital must be received in a [[commercial bank]] account designated by the incorporator(s), and the bank must provide certification that payment has been made. Once the capital has been received and certified, the incorporation may be registered at the Legal Affairs Bureau.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Structure==
{{further|Corporate title#Japan and South Korea}}

===Board of directors===
Under present law, a K.K. must have a {{nihongo|board of directors|取締役会|torishimariyaku kai}} consisting of at least three individuals. Directors have a statutory term of office of two years, and auditors have a term of four years.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Small companies can exist with only one or two directors, with no statutory term of office, and {{nihongo|without a board of directors|取締役会非設置会社|torishimariyaku kai hisetchigaisha}}. In such companies, decisions are made via shareholder meeting and the decision-making power of the directors is relatively limited. As soon as a third director is designated such companies must form a board.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

At least one director is designated as a {{nihongo|[[Representative Director (Japan)|Representative Director]]|代表取締役|daihyō torishimariyaku}}, holds the corporate seal and is empowered to represent the company in transactions. The Representative Director must "report" to the board of directors every three months; the exact meaning of this statutory provision is unclear, but some legal scholars interpret it to mean that the board must meet every three months. In 2015, the requirement that at least one director and one Representative Director must be a resident of Japan was changed. It is not required to have a resident Representative Director although it can be convenient to do so..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=How to Set Up Business in Japan | url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section1/page2.html | publisher=[[Japan External Trade Organization]] | accessdate=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors are mandatories ([[agency (law)|agents]]) of the shareholders, and the Representative Director is a mandatory of the board. Any action outside of these mandates is considered a breach of mandatory duty.&lt;ref name=Yamazaki&gt;''Yamazaki Bakery K.K. v. Iijima'', 1015 Hanrei Jiho 27 (Tokyo Dist. Ct., March 26, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditing and reporting===
Every K.K. with multiple directors must have at least one {{nihongo|statutory auditor|監査役|kansayaku}}. Statutory auditors report to the shareholders, and are empowered to demand financial and operational reports from the directors.

K.K.s with capital of over ¥500m, liabilities of over ¥2bn and/or publicly traded securities are required to have three statutory auditors, and must also have an annual audit performed by an outside [[certified public accountant|CPA]]. Public K.K.s must also file securities law reports with the Ministry of Finance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Under the new Company Law, public and other non-close K.K.s may either have a statutory auditor, or a {{nihongo|[[nominating committee]]|指名委員会|shimei iinkai}}, {{nihongo|[[auditing committee]]|監査委員会|kansa iinkai}} and {{nihongo|[[compensation committee]]|報酬委員会|hōshū iinkai}} structure similar to that of American public corporations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Close K.K.s may also have a single person serving as director and statutory auditor, regardless of capital or liabilities.

A statutory auditor may be any person who is not an employee or director of the company. In practice, the position is often filled by a very senior employee close to retirement, or by an outside attorney or accountant.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Officers===
Japanese law does not designate any corporate officer positions. Most Japanese-owned kabushiki gaisha do not have "officers" ''per se'', but are directly managed by the directors, one of whom generally has the title of {{nihongo|president|社長|shachō}}. The Japanese equivalent of a corporate [[vice president]] is a {{nihongo|department chief|部長|buchō}}. Traditionally, under the [[lifetime employment]] system, directors and department chiefs begin their careers as line employees of the company and work their way up the management hierarchy over time. This is not the case in most foreign-owned companies in Japan, and some native companies{{Which|date=January 2015}} have also abandoned this system in recent years in favor of encouraging more lateral movement in management.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Corporate officers often have the legal title of [[shihainin]], which makes them authorized representatives of the corporation at a particular place of business, in addition to a common-use title.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Other legal issues==

===Taxation===
Kabushiki gaisha are subject to [[double taxation]] of profits and dividends, as are corporations in most countries. In contrast to many other countries, however, Japan also levies double taxes on close corporations ([[yugen gaisha]] and [[gōdō gaisha]]). This makes taxation a minor issue when deciding how to structure a business in Japan. As all publicly traded companies follow the K.K. structure, smaller businesses often choose to incorporate as a K.K. simply to appear more prestigious.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In addition to income taxes, K.K.s must also pay registration taxes to the national government, and may be subject to local taxes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Derivative litigation===
Generally, the power to bring actions against the directors on the corporation's behalf is granted to the statutory auditor.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Historically, [[derivative suit]]s by shareholders were rare in Japan. Shareholders have been permitted to sue on the corporation's behalf since the postwar Americanization of the Commercial Code; however, this power was severely limited by the nature of court costs in Japan. Because the cost to file a civil action is proportional to the amount of damages being claimed, shareholders rarely had motivation to sue on the company's behalf.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1993, the Commercial Code was amended to reduce the filing fee for all shareholder derivative suits to ¥8,200 per claim. This led to a rise in the number of derivative suits heard by Japanese courts, from 31 pending cases in 1992 to 286 in 1999, and to a number of very high-profile shareholder actions, such as those against [[Daiwa Bank]] and [[Nomura Securities]]&lt;ref name=West&gt;West, Mark D.

In 1974 and 1976, she appeared in Disney's ''Whiz Kid Capers'' series (''The Whiz Kid and the Mystery at Riverton'' and ''The Whiz Kid and the Carnival Caper''), two television movies which aired as part of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' anthology series.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|1668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her sister Kyle appeared as the daughters of [[James Brolin]] in the thriller film ''[[The Car]]'' (1977).

He was Jewish, and having been sent to [[Auschwitz]] in 1942, served as the [[concentration camp]]'s ''tatowierer'' ([[tattooist]]) until the camp was liberated near the end of [[World War II]]. He did not speak publicly about his wartime experiences until after the death of his wife in 2003 due to fears of being perceived as a Nazi collaborator.&lt;ref name="Obit G"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Heather|title=Obituary: Lale Sokolov|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/10/obituaries.mainsection|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prasad|first1=Ritu|title=The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-42568390|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 January 2018|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in Korompa, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now Krompachy&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;, [[Slovakia]]), on 28 October 1916&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;. In April 1942, Sokolov was part of the transport of Jewish prisoners to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; Upon arrival, he was tattooed with the number 32407.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; He was set to work constructing housing blocks for the expanding camp but soon became ill with [[typhoid]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Having recovered, he became the assistant to Pepan, the then ''tetovierer'' ([[tattooist]]) of the camp.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Pepan "disappeared" roughly four weeks later and Sokolov took over as the ''tetovierer''.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; As such, he joined the [[Politische Abteilung]] and had an [[SS]] officer assigned to monitor him.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; His job meant he was "a step further away from death than the other prisoners", and he received a number of benefits such as a single room, extra rations, and free time when his work had been completed.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; 

Lale met Gisela "Gita" Furman in July 1942 while tattooing an all-female group of new arrivals:&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; he tattooed Gita with the number 34902.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He had used his relatively privileged position to keep her alive by sending her extra food and messages through his personal guard, and having her "moved to a better work station".&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He was also involved in trading [[contraband]] (including jewellery) that given to him by fellow prisoners with locals in return for food and provisions.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Two days before the liberation of Auschwitz by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] (on 27 January 1945), Sokolov was moved to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; He escaped that concentration camp, and returned to his native place, then part of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Knowing only Gita Fuhrmannova's name, he went to [[Bratislava]], the main entry point for returning survivors, to search for her.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; After weeks of searching, she stepped out into the street in front of his horse.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The couple married in 1945, and he changed his surname from [[Eisenberg (surname)|Eisenberg]] to the more Russian-sounding [[Sokolov (surname)|Sokolov]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He then opened a factory in [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; During this time, he was involved in collecting money in support of the creation of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; This activity and the nationalisation of industry by the country's communist government, resulted in him being imprisoned and having his business seized.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He was soon released and the couple emigrated to Australia in 1948.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;

In Australia, Sokolov and his wife settled in [[Melbourne]] and opened up a clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt; Their only child, Gary, was born in 1961.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Though his wife visited Europe a number of times, Sokolov never returned.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Following Gita's death in 2003, he finally felt able to speak about his war-time experience having feared that he would be perceived as a [[Kapo (concentration camp)|collaborator]].&lt;ref name="Obit G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He would be interviewed by Heather Morris over the next three years, and she would write a book about his life which was published in 2018.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He died in 2006, and is survived by his son.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

One of the founders of Thailand's [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] at the end of [[World War II]], he served as Deputy Foreign Minister as well as Minister of Science, Technology, and Energy.&lt;ref name=minister&gt;"New Thai Minister of Science, Technology, and Energy appointed", ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', 29 August 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Muslim]] of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]&lt;ref&gt;Dubey (1990), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; ancestry, he was a senior member of the Central Islamic Committee of Thailand. The Nana area on [[Sukhumvit Road]] derives its name from him.

Nana became Deputy Foreign Minister in 1975 under Prime Minister [[Seni Pramoj]], losing his office in the military [[coup]] that followed the October 1976 massacre of leftist protesters at [[Thammasat University]].

He served as an [[diplomatic rank|honorary consul-general]] for [[Iraq]] in Thailand until 1981. In December 1982, a powerful bomb exploded in his office building in [[Bangkok's Chinatown]], killing a police bomb disposal expert, injuring 20 other people, and causing a fire that damaged five buildings. Nana was not in the office at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"Thai bomb disposal expert killed in blast", ''[[United Press International]]'',&lt;/ref&gt; His office had formerly been the Iraqi consulate, and a connection to the [[Iran-Iraq War]] was suspected to have been the reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Associated Press]]'', 2 December 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Nana became secretary general of the Democrat Party under party leader Bhichai Rattakul. He also served on the party's executive board repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;"Sixth leader in the party's 57-yr history", ''[[The Nation]]'', 20 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] appointed Nana as Minister for Science and Technology, following the suicide of the previous minister, Damrong Latthapipat, said to have been displeased by the inadequate funding he had received.&lt;ref name=minister/&gt;

Nana was nicknamed the "landlord of Bangkok" and owned a great deal of property along Bangkok's Sukhumvit Road, especially in the area is now known as "Soi Nana" (Sukhumvit Soi 4). The name Nana is also used for the nearby [[Nana BTS station|Skytrain station]], the Nana Hotel and the [[Nana Plaza]] entertainment complex.&lt;ref&gt;//www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/04/02/national/King-gives-soil-for-democrat-founder&amp;039;s-burial-30126150.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A philanthropist, Nana donated land for the headquarters of the Democrat Party, for the [[Princess Mother Memorial Park]], and for a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theprincessmothermemorialpark.org/system_th/readarticle.php?article_id=1 Princess Mother Memorial Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006154214/http://www.theprincessmothermemorialpark.org/system_th/readarticle.php?article_id=1 |date=2007-10-06 }}, accessed 7 August 2007 {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lek Nana died of a heart attack in a Bangkok hospital in 2010 at the age of 85. He was buried at Ban Somdej Mosque in [[Thonburi]], with royal representation from HM King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]].

[[File:6-00 PM Energy Meeting (11-2-77) - NARA - 142151.tif|right|thumb|Memo written by a staff member during [[President Carter|President Carter's]] tenure in the White House.]]
A '''memorandum''' (abbrev.: '''memo'''; from [[Latin]] ''memorandum est'', "It must be remembered (that)...") is a note, [[document]] or other [[communication]] that helps the memory by recording events or observations on a topic such as may be used in a business [[office]]. The plural form of the Latin noun ''memorandum'' so derived is properly ''memoranda'', but if the word is deemed to have become a word of the English language, the plural ''memorandums'', abbreviated to ''memos'', may be used. (See also [[Agenda (meeting)|Agenda]], [[Corrigenda]], [[Addenda]]).

A memorandum can have only a certain number of formats; it may have a format specific to an office or institution. In law specifically, a memorandum is a record of the terms of a transaction or contract, such as a policy memo, [[memorandum of understanding]], [[memorandum of agreement]], or [[memorandum of association]]. Alternative formats include memos, briefing notes, reports, letters, binders, etc. They could be one page long or many. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. If the user is a [[Minister (government)|cabinet minister]] or a senior executive, the format might be rigidly defined and limited to one or two pages. If the user is a colleague, the format is usually much more flexible. At its most basic level, a memorandum can be a handwritten note to one's supervisor. In business, a memo is typically used by firms for internal communication, as opposed to [[Letter (message)|letters]] which are typically for external communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 113. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, we can consider memoranda as an upward communication process through which any complaint, issues, opinion, views and suggestion are put forward to the authorized level.

==Policy briefing note==
A specific type of memorandum is the '''policy briefing note''' (alternatively referred to in various jurisdictions and governing traditions as policy issues paper, policy memoranda, or cabinet submission amongst other terms), a document for transmitting [[policy analysis]] into the political [[decision making]] sphere. Typically, a briefing note may be denoted as either “for information” or “for decision”.

===Origins of term===
The origins of the term “briefing” lie in legal “briefs” and the derivative “military briefings”.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.A. and E.S.C. Weiner (ed.) 1989. Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. OED Online. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
The primary purpose of a briefing note “for decision” is to support decision making –  and also to “help (or sometimes influence) a decision-maker to make a better decision in a particular problem situation than he might otherwise have made without the analysis”.&lt;ref&gt;Quade, E.S. 1975. Analysis for public decisions. New York: [[Elsevier]]. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other purposes that the briefing note can serve include: conveying information; informing decisions, making a request, providing a response to a question, making a suggestion, presenting an informal report, proposing a solution to a problem, or documenting a reference for future use.

===Structure===
As the communication mechanism of the policy analysis process, the briefing note should provide a coherent synopsis of a policy problem, identify different policy options for addressing the problem, articulate opposing perspectives and advocate a recommended option. The typical structure for a briefing note includes a description of the proposed policy; relevant background information; a discussion of key considerations (including implementation concerns, financial considerations, stakeholder impacts, and possible unanticipated consequences), a summary of arguments for and against the policy and a recommended decision. Policy documents that start with a proposal and assemble an argument that position are more accurately referred to as a government [[white paper]]. A government [[green paper]] which raises a policy option and is meant to open a dialogue on the proposal is more similar in tone to a briefing note than is a [[white paper]].

===Quality criteria===
There is no universal standard for a briefing note, but it is generally understood to be a concise, coherent summary of a public policy problem with a clearly articulated logic for following a recommended course of action. ”Next to a political nose, and a logical brain, the most important skill of the good treasury [person] resides in [their] fine drafting hand. The concise, coherent and penetrating note is the final expression of all other talents.”&lt;ref&gt;Heclo, H. and Rahul Vaidya 1974. The Private Government of Public Money. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In many Westminster / Whitehall governance settings, policy analysts are expected to analyze the issue and write the briefing note from a neutral public service perspective. However, the briefing note “for decision” must contain a recommendation, acknowledging that “to say anything of importance in public policy requires value judgments, which must be explained and justified”.&lt;ref&gt;Majone, G. 1989. Evidence, Argument, and Persuasion in the Policy Process. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael "Mike" Perry''' is a former [[Australian rules football]] player who played in the [[Australian Football League|VFL]] between 1965 and 1969 for the [[Richmond Football Club]].

==Football==
Educated at [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], Mike played two seasons for Old Scotch Collegians in the  [[Victorian Amateur Football Association]] (1963 and 1964, 38 games). He won their Best and Fairest Trophy each season, and was selected for the VAFA Representative side in 1964 (at 20 years of age).

Recruited by Richmond in 1965 (he broke his jaw in the round 3 match against St Kilda,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Yx8UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2pYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5352%2C815806 Patterson May get Promotion, ''The Age'', (Wednesday, 5 May 1965), p.24.]&lt;/ref&gt; his second senior match, and did not play another senior match that season), he eventually became a fixture at centre-half-back, and fans got used to seeing his mop of red hair flying above the pack, as well as being delighted by his tenacious clearing dashes.

He was tall, strongly built, and had wonderful judgement; his ball sense was quite remarkable, and he always made rather hard tasks seem much simpler than they were.

By 1967 he was a fixture in the Richmond side at centre-half-back. He was selected in a Victorian State team, and played in Richmond's first premiership team since [[1944 VFL season|1944]] when Richmond beat Geelong 16.18 (114) to 15.15 (105).&lt;ref&gt;[[1967 VFL season#Grand Final Teams|1967 Grand Final Teams]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He played the entire 1968 and 1969 seasons for Richmond's senior side, missing Richmond's [[1969 VFL season#Grand Final Teams|1969 Grand Final winning team]] because of a suspension for striking Footscray's [[Tad Joniec]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/T/Tad_Joniec.html AFL Statistics: Tad Joniec]&lt;/ref&gt; in the last home-and-away match of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wwYRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c5MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1792%2C411838 McFarline, P., "Richmond's Mike Perry out for 4 games", ''The Age'', (Wednesday, 3 September 1969), p.26.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was unable to play any more senior grade VFL due to an injury, he continued to play satisfactorily at a lower level for a number of years:
* 1970: Richmond Reserves.
* 1971: Richmond Reserves, including the 1971 Reserves Premiership (thus, from 1965 to the end of 1971, Mike had played 1 Victorian Representative game, 53 senior games, and 45 reserve games).
* 1972: Dandenong Football Club, 11 games.
* 1976–1977: Portland, captain-coach, 36 games.
* 1978–1979: Power House VAFA Football Club, captain-coach.
* 1980–1984: Old Geelong Grammarians VAFA Football Club, captain-coach.
Including his time with Old Scotch Collegians, and his VAFA and VFL selection, he played altogether 281 games in his career (continuing to play until he was 40).

==Advertising==
Whilst at Richmond, Mike worked for an advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, (1996), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

His most memorable piece of work being the famous slogan he devised to sell ''Captain Morgan Rum'': "Captain Morgan is good for your organ"!

Needless to say, with the newspaper, radio and television coverage, added to a slogan-covered Moomba Procession Float that was overflowing with lustful pirates and nubile wenches, the sales of ''Captain Morgan Rum'' skyrocketed with his campaign.

He went on to conduct a photography business, and became involved in the Richmond Former Players' and Officials' Association.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, (1996), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2351">[[File:Bad Duerrenberg Leuna.jpg|thumb|Leuna industrial complex]]
The '''Middle German Chemical Triangle''' ({{lang-de|Mitteldeutsches Chemiedreieck}} or locally just ''Chemiedreieck'') is the industrial conurbation around the cities and towns of [[Halle (Saale)]], [[Merseburg]] and [[Bitterfeld]] in the North German state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Leipzig]] and [[Schkeuditz]] in the [[Saxony|Free State of Saxony]]. Its name is derived from the dominant [[industries]] of the region – the [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[oil refinery|oil refining]] industries.

It is often referred to as the [[Leuna]]-Buna-[[Bitterfeld]] Chemical Triangle (''Chemiedreieck Leuna-Buna-Bitterfeld'') because these places are the oldest and most important in the region. Buna is not a town, but was the name of the first [[synthetic rubber]] ([[1,3-Butadiene|butadiene]] and [[Sodium|natrium]]) which was produced in the Buna factory at [[Schkopau]]. Today [[Dow Chemical]] produces synthetic rubber in Schkopau which is marketed under the name of BUNA SB.
[[File:Vockerode Plaste und Elaste Leuchtreklame DDR.png|thumb|left|''Plaste und Elaste'' neon sign, 1984]]
At the end of the 1950s the advertising slogan ''Plaste und Elaste aus Schkopau'' ("[[Plastic]] and [[Elastomer]] from Schkopau") was introduced, in order to promote the spectrum of products of the Buna Chemical Works. The slogan was used especially on posters and neon lights. The best known light advert was on a tower on the northern abutment of the Elbe bridge at [[Vockerode]] on the transit route from Berlin to Hof (nowadays part of the [[Bundesautobahn 9|BAB 9]] motorway).

Mobile file management software is typically installed on a corporate [[file server]] like [[Windows 2008]], and on a [[mobile device]] such as  [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, e.g., [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], etc.  Other features include the ability to remotely wipe a lost or stolen device, access, cache and store files on a mobile device and integrate with [[filesystem permissions|file permission solutions]] like those from [[Microsoft]]'s [[Active Directory]].&lt;ref name=GroupLogic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/ |title=iPad File System: Mobile File Management |work=GroupLogic |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809091958/http://www.grouplogic.com/enterprise-file-sharing/ipad-file-system/# |archive-date=2011-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html |title=Apple iPad Corporate Security Gets Boost from GroupLogic |author=Greene, Tim |date=23 May 2011 |work=Network World |publisher=International Data Group (IDG) |access-date=2011-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142923/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/052311-grouplogic-mobilecho.html# |archive-date=2011-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main advantage of modern mobile file management solutions is that they do not need a VPN connection for the mobile devices to connect to the corporate file servers. The connection between the mobile device and the corporate file server is established via a cloud service. This way the corporate [[file server]] doesn't need to open incoming ports which would cause security issues. The files are transferred highly encrypted{{snd}} e.g. according to AES 256-bit industry standard. Only the company server and the mobile device keep the encryption key to be able to encrypt and decrypt the files. So nobody, not even the mobile file management solution provider, can access the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep your documents under your control|url=http://www.file-spirit.com/#FileSpirit_keep_your_documents_under_your_control|work=FileSpirit Website|publisher=espírito GmbH|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party cloud-based companies provide solutions which can be used to manage mobile files but are not controlled by corporate IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |title="Follow-Me Data" Means Secure Seamless Access to Work Wherever and Whenever You Need It! » ocb - Citrix Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2011-05-27 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131129025945/http://community.citrix.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=174000119# |archive-date=2013-11-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobiledevicemanagement.org/mobile-device-management-overview Mobile Device Management Overview | Mobile Device Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.filehold.com/products/mobile-filehold Mobile Document Management Software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that utilize [[Mobile Device Management]] solutions can also secure content on mobile devices, but usually cannot provide [[Direct access (computing)|direct access]] and connection to a corporate file server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ Device Management Forum - Mobile Device Management - Brave New Horizon or Basic Plumbing?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801091503/http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/20754/152/ |date=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

File management is how the computer [[operating system]] keeps [[data]] organized through the use of files and folders, how they are arranged, and how they are listed in a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpbestflow.org/file-management/file-management-overview#what Overview of File Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile file management allows file management to be used on tablet computers. By installing it both on the tablet and the corporate server, users of mobile devices can freely access corporate servers from remote locations.

'''Paul Bulcke''' (born 8 September 1954) is a Belgian businessman who is the chairman and former CEO of [[Nestlé]].

==Early life==
He graduated as a commercial engineer at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] and is an [[alumnus]] of the [[Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School]]. He also attended the program for executive development at the Swiss leading business school [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD) in [[Lausanne]].

==Career==
[[File:Paul Bulcke - Davos 2010.jpg|thumb|Bulcke during the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] 2010]]
In 1979, aged 25, he started working for the Nestlé group and worked in different countries, including Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Portugal, Czech Republic and Germany. Before his appointment as CEO of Nestlé, he was the executive vice president of its Americas divisions.

Bulcke has described Nestlé under his tenure as 'une force tranquille' (English: 'calm strength'). He is known for having a reserved, quiet personal manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7286179/Nestle-chief-executive-Paul-Bulcke-is-not-one-for-a-break-but-he-loves-his-Kit-Kat.html |title=Nestlé chief executive Paul Bulcke is not one for a break, but he loves his Kit Kat |work=Telegraph |date=21 February 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded as CEO by [[Ulf Mark Schneider]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/management-changes|title=Nestle Press Release, Jun 27, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

On August 30, 2012, Bulcke claimed that water is not a human right and should be privatized. He was quoted as saying: "If something isn't given a value, people tend to waste it. Water is our most useful resource, but those using it often don’t even cover the costs of its infrastructure. Fresh water is being massively overused at nature's expense, but it seems only a global crisis will make us realise the importance of the issue. What is environmentally unsustainable today will become socially unsustainable in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestle.com/Media/NewsAndFeatures/World-Water-Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
On 25 May 2012, he received the VMA Award from the [[Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School]] for his "lifelong career, which has been distinguished by sustained integrity, exceptional management capacity and inspiring leadership".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlerickalumni.be/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=669f002f-282b-496d-b811-025f3e4d0b33 Vlerick alumnus Paul Bulcke receives 5th VMA Award, 25 May 2012, Vlerick Alumni] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130115033548/http://www.vlerickalumni.be/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=669f002f-282b-496d-b811-025f3e4d0b33 |date=15 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of The Peter Principle by Pan Books.jpeg|thumbnail|The cover of ''The Peter Principle'' (1970 Pan Books edition)]]

The '''Peter principle''' is a concept in [[management]] developed by [[Laurence J. Peter]], which observes that people in a [[hierarchy]] tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was elucidated in the 1969 book '''''The Peter Principle''''' by Peter and [[Raymond Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Peter-principle.html|title= Peter principle|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Business Dictionary |publisher= |access-date= May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Peter Principle'' was published by [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1969. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations. Hull wrote the text, based on Peter's research.

The Peter principle has been the subject of much later commentary and research.

==Summary==
The Peter principle states that a person who is competent at their job will earn promotion to a more senior position which requires different skills. If the promoted person lacks the skills required for their new role, then they will be incompetent at their new level, and so they will not be promoted again. But if they are competent at their new role, then they will be promoted again, and they will continue to be promoted until they eventually reach a level at which they are incompetent. Being incompetent, they do not qualify to be promoted again, and so remain stuck at that final level for the rest of their career (termed "Final Placement" or "Peter's Plateau"). This outcome is inevitable, given enough time and assuming that there are enough positions in the hierarchy to promote competent employees to.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The "Peter Principle" is therefore expressed as: ''"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."''&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to Peter's Corollary: "In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Hull calls the study of how hierarchies work "hierarchiology."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Peter Principle''==
[[Laurence J. Peter]] had conducted the research that led to the formulation of the Peter principle well before publishing his findings. He worked with [[Raymond Hull]] on a book that elucidated his observations about hierarchies. The principle is named for Peter because although Hull actually wrote the book, it is a summary of Peter's research.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, in his introduction to the book.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Peter Principle'' was published by [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1969.

===Summary===
{{Long plot|section|date=May 2018}}
In chapters 1 and 2, Peter and Hull give various examples of the Peter principle in action. A competent mechanic may make an incompetent foreman; a competent school teacher may make a competent assistant principal, but then go on to be an incompetent principal, and therefore will not be considered for promotion to assistant superintendent; a military officer may be promoted all the way up through the ranks to general and still be competent at that rank, but then make an incompetent field marshal. In each case, the higher position required skills which were not required at the level immediately below. The mechanic only had to know how to fix cars, but as a foreman he needed to be able to manage the other mechanics and deal with customers.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher was competent at educating children, and as assistant principal he was good at dealing with parents and other teachers, but as principal he was poor at maintaining good relations with the school board and the superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; The general was capable at dealing with ordinary soldiers, but as a field marshal he did not know how to liaise with politicians and the field marshals of his country's allies.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude that "this could happen to every employee in every hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 3, Peter and Hull discuss apparent exceptions to this principle and then debunk them. One of these illusory exceptions is when someone who is incompetent is still promoted anyway. This is known as ''"percussive sublimation"'' (i.e. being "kicked upstairs"). But it is only a pseudo-promotion: a move from one unproductive position to another; whereas a true promotion is a move from a position of competence (either to a position of competence or to a position of incompetence). This improves staff morale, as other employees believe that they too can be promoted again.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Another pseudo-promotion is the ''"lateral arabesque"'', when a person is moved out of the way and given a longer job title.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Competence is measured by the employer, not by the customers or anyone else outside the hierarchy. "Competence, like truth, beauty and contact lenses, is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; So people who ''appear'' to outsiders to be incompetent because they follow the rules of the organisation to an extent which actually impedes their effectiveness are still deemed competent by their immediate superior, because ''"internal consistency is valued more highly than efficient service"''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 38 (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt; This is dubbed "Peter's Inversion," because the ''means'' have become more important than the ''ends''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; Those who value the means more than the ends are called "Peter's Inverts."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

While incompetence is merely a barrier to further promotion, ''super-incompetence'' is grounds for dismissal. So is super-competence. The competence of employees at a given level can be represented by a [[bell curve]]: the majority are either competent or incompetent and so can remain employed, but a small number of outliers are either super-incompetent or super-competent, and in both cases "they tend to disrupt the hierarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; They are therefore expelled in order to preserve the hierarchy; a process called ''"hierarchical exfoliation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 39–43&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a super-competent employee is a teacher of children with special needs who was so effective at educating them that after a year they exceeded all expectations at reading and arithmetic, but the teacher was still fired because he had neglected to devote enough time to bead-stringing and finger-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the methods of achieving promotion: "Push" and "Pull." Push means the employee's own efforts, such as working hard and taking self-improvement courses. This is usually not very effective, because of the Seniority Factor: the next level up is often fully occupied, blocking the path to promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; (Murdering one's immediate superiors can be an effective way of overcoming this obstacle, but as this is such a rare phenomenon it does not really affect Peter and Hull's assessment of Push.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;) Pull is far more effective, and refers to accelerated promotion brought about by the efforts of an employee's mentors or patrons. It is better to have as many patrons as possible, because each additional patron produces a multiplying effect on their combined effectiveness, as patrons reinforce their positive opinion of the employee by discussing him with each other ("Hull's Theorem").&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 48–51. "The combined Pull of several Patrons is the sum of their separate Pulls multiplied by the number of Patrons." (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 6 explains why "good followers do not become good leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 7, Peter and Hull describe the effect of the Peter Principle in politics and government. Chapter 8, entitled "Hints and Foreshadowings", discusses the work of earlier writers on the subject of incompetence, such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Alexander Pope]].

Chapter 9 explains that once employees have reached their level of incompetence, they always lack insight into their situation. Most don't realise that they are incompetent, but those who do recognise their own incompetence still never realise that it is because they have been promoted, and so they futilely search for other explanations instead.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter, Peter and Hull go on to explain why aptitude tests don't work and are actually counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, they describe "Summit Competence": when someone reaches the highest level in their organisation and yet is still competent at that level. This is only because there were not enough ranks in the hierarchy, or because they did not have time to reach a level of incompetence. Such people often seek a level of incompetence in another hierarchy. For example, [[Socrates]] was an outstanding teacher but a terrible defence attorney. This is known as "Compulsive Incompetence."&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 10 explains why trying to assist an incompetent employee by promoting another employee to act as his assistant doesn't work. ''"Incompetence plus incompetence equals incompetence."''&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 93 (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 11 and 12 describe the various medical and psychological manifestations of stress which may result when someone reaches his level of incompetence, as well as other symptoms such as certain characteristic habits of speech or behaviour.

Chapter 13 considers whether it is possible for an employee who has reached his level of incompetence to be happy and healthy once he gets there. The answer is no, if he realises his true situation, and yes if he does not. Those who realise that they are incompetent usually think (mistakenly) that this is only because they are not working hard enough, and so they work themselves harder until they burn out or damage their health. So facing the sordid truth is not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have not realised that they are at their level of incompetence remain happy and healthy because they substitute irrelevant duties for the proper duties of their post, and excel at those instead. Peter and Hull describe six different Substitution techniques.

In chapter 14 various ways of avoiding promotion to the final level are described. Attempting to refuse an offered promotion is ill-advised, and is only practicable if the employee is not married and has no-one else to answer to. Generally it is better to avoid being considered for promotion in the first place, by pretending to be incompetent while one is actually still employed at a level of competence. This is "Creative Incompetence," and several examples of successful techniques are given. It works best if the chosen field of incompetence does not actually impair one's work.&lt;ref&gt;Peter &amp; Hull, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The concluding chapter applies Peter's Principle to the entire human species at an evolutionary level, and asks whether humanity can survive in the long run, or will become extinct upon reaching its level of incompetence as technology advances.

==Other research==
Other commenters made observations similar to the Peter principle long before Peter's research. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s 1763 play ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'' features an army sergeant who shuns the opportunity to move up in the ranks, saying "I am a good sergeant; I might easily make a bad captain, and certainly an even worse general. One knows from experience." Similarly, [[Carl von Clausewitz]] (1780–1831) wrote that "there is nothing more common than to hear of men losing their energy on being raised to a higher position, to which they do not feel themselves equal."&lt;ref name=Grudin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grudin |first1= Jonathan |date=January-February 2016 |title= The Rise of Incompetence |url= http://interactions.acm.org/blog/view/the-rise-of-incompetence |journal= Interactions |volume= 23 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi= 10.1145/2854002|access-date=May 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely echoing Peter, Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] (1883–1955) wrote, "All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level, as they have been promoted until turning incompetent."&lt;ref name=Grudin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laopinion.es/opinion/2010/11/07/umbral-incompetencia/312847.html|title=En el umbral de la incompetencia|language=es|work=La Opinión|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Christian|first= Brian|last2= Griffiths|first2=Tom |year= 2016 |title= Algorithms to Live By |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yvaLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Ortega+y+Gasset+peter+principle#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peter%20principle%22&amp;f=false|publisher= Henry Holt and Company|page= 219|isbn= 978-1627790376|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars have engaged in research interpreting the Peter principle and its effects. In 2000, [[Edward Lazear]] explored two possible explanations for the phenomenon. First is the idea that employees work harder to gain a promotion, and then slack off once it is achieved. The other is that it is a statistical process: workers who are promoted have passed a particular benchmark of productivity based on factors that cannot necessarily be replicated in their new role, leading to a Peter principle situation. Lazear concluded that the former explanation only occurs under particular compensation structures, whereas the latter always holds up.&lt;ref name=Lazear&gt;{{cite web|first= Edward P.|last= Lazear|authorlink= Edward Lazear|date=October 12, 2000|title= The Peter Principle: Promotions and Declining Productivity|url= http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/Papers/pdf/00-04.pdf|format= PDF|publisher= [[Hoover Institution]] and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Graduate School of Business]], [[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo used an [[agent-based modelling]] approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true. They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly, or to [[shortlist]] the best and the worst performer in a given group, from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly.&lt;ref name=Pluchino&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Alessandro |last1= Pluchino |first2= Andrea |last2= Rapisarda |first3= Cesare |last3= Garofalo |journal=[[Physica A]] |volume= 389 |title= The Peter Principle Revisited: A Computational Study |issue= 3 |pages= 467–472 |year= 2010 |arxiv= 0907.0455 |bibcode= 2010PhyA..389..467P  |doi= 10.1016/j.physa.2009.09.045}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, they won the 2010 edition of the parody [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in management science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010 |title=The 2010 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |journal=[[Annals of Improbable Research]] |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=10–13|url=http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume16/v16i6/AIR_16-6_screen.pdf |format= PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, professors Alan Benson, Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue analyzed sales workers' performance and promotion practices at 214 American businesses to test the veracity of the Peter principle. They found that these companies tended to promote employees to management position based on their performance in their previous position, rather than based on managerial potential. Consistent with the Peter principle, the researchers found that high performing sales employees were likelier to be promoted, and that they were likelier to perform poorly as managers, leading to considerable costs to the businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Benson|first1=Alan |last2= Li |first2=Danielle|last3=Shue|first3=Kelly |date= February 2018 |title= Promotions and the Peter Principle |url= http://www.nber.org/papers/w24343 |journal= NBER Working Paper |volume=24343 |pages= 1–54|doi= 10.3386/w24343 |access-date= May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peter principle inspired [[Scott Adams]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Dilbert]]'', to develop a similar concept, the [[Dilbert principle]]. The Dilbert principle holds that incompetent employees are promoted to management positions to get them out of the workflow. Adams explained the idea in his 1996 business book ''The Dilbert Principle'', and it has since been analyzed alongside the Peter principle. João Ricardo Faria wrote that the Dilbert principle is "a sub-optimal version of the Peter principle," and leads to even lower profitability than the Peter principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Faria |first=João Ricardo |date= January 2000 |title= An Economic Analysis of the Peter and Dilbert Principles|url= http://www.finance.uts.edu.au/research/wpapers/wp101.pdf|journal= UTS Working Papers|volume=101  |pages= 13–14 |issn=1036-7373|access-date= October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response by organizations==
Companies and organizations shaped their policies to contend with the Peter principle. Lazear stated that some companies expect that productivity will "regress to the mean" following promotion in their hiring and promotion practices.&lt;ref name=Lazear/&gt; Other companies have adopted "[[up or out]]" strategies, such as the [[Cravath System]], in which employees who do not advance are periodically fired. The Cravath System was developed at the law firm [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]], which made a practice of hiring chiefly recent law graduates, promoting internally and firing employees who do not perform at the required level. Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths have suggested the [[additive increase/multiplicative decrease]] algorithm as a solution to the Peter principle less severe than firing employees who fail to advance. They propose a dynamic hierarchy in which employees are regularly either promoted or reassigned to a lower level, so that any worker who is promoted to their point of failure is soon moved to an area where they are productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christian |first=Brian |last2=Griffiths|first2=Tom |year=2016 |title=Algorithms to Live By |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yvaLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Ortega+y+Gasset+peter+principle#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peter%20principle%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Henry Holt and Company|pages=219–220 |isbn=978-1627790376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milan Janković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Милан Јанковић}}, born 23 November 1950 in [[Veliko Gradište]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] now [[Serbia]]), mostly known as '''Philip Zepter''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Филип Цептер / Filip Zepter) is a [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[Serbs|Serbian]] origin. 

He completed primary school in [[Kozarska Dubica]] before graduating from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]. At the age of 29, he went to [[Salzburg]], following his wife [[Madlena Zepter]] (then Madlena Janković) who got a temporary job there and in order to study [[German language|German]], and liked it so much there that he decided to stay.

After he moved to [[Linz]], in 1986 he founded Zepter Handels-GmbH, a multi-level marketing firm for pots and pans, which has over time grown into the [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Zepter International]] which provides “a wide range of products and services, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, and retail sales of consumer products.”&lt;ref&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1505826.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Zepter sued the [[International Crisis Group]], a think tank cofounded by financier [[George Soros]], media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]], lawyer [[David Boies]], money manager [[Paul Tudor Jones]], former [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] chief executive [[David Rockefeller]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[J.P.

[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]

The '''program '''(or '''project''') '''evaluation and review technique''' ('''PERT''') is a statistical tool used in [[project management]], which was designed to analyze and represent the [[task (project management)|tasks]] involved in completing a given [[project]]. 

First developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the [[critical path method]] (CPM).

== Overview ==
Project Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and [[Duration (project management)|durations]] of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.

Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of ''activities'' and ''events'': arrows represent the ''activities'' or work necessary to reach the ''events'' or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

==History==
"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"&gt;Malcolm, D. G., J. H. Roseboom, C. E. Clark, [[Willard Fazar|W. Fazar]]. "Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation," ''OPERATIONS RESEARCH,'' Vol. 7, No. 5, September–October 1959, pp. 646–669&lt;/ref&gt; It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]] which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/or1968.pdf 1968 Winter Olympics official report.] p. 49. Accessed 1 November 2010. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for [[scientific management]], founded by Frederick Taylor ([[Taylorism]]) and later refined by Henry Ford ([[Fordism]]). [[DuPont]]'s [[critical path method]] was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.

[[File:PERT Summary Report Phase 2, 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Summary Report Phase 2'', 1958]]
Initially PERT stood for ''Program Evaluation Research Task,'' but by 1959 was already renamed.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"/&gt; It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled ''Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/735902.pdf Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Phase 2.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100954569 Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 2].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 article in  ''The American Statistician'' the main [[Willard Fazar]], Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:

{{Quote|Through an electronic computer, the PERT technique processes data representing the major, finite accomplishments (events) essential to achieve end-objectives; the inter-dependence of those events; and [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of time and range of time necessary to complete each activity between two successive events. Such time expectations include estimates of "most likely time", "optimistic time", and "pessimistic time" for each activity. The technique is a management control tool that sizes up the outlook for meeting objectives on time; highlights danger signals requiring management decisions; reveals and defines both methodicalness and slack in the flow plan or the network of sequential activities that must be performed to meet objectives; compares current expectations with [[Schedule (project management)|scheduled]] completion dates and computes the probability for meeting scheduled dates; and simulates the effects of options for decision&amp;nbsp;— before decision.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of PERT was developed by an operations research team staffed with representatives from the Operations Research Department of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]; the Evaluation Office of the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Missile Systems Division]]; and the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="SDFJWM 1959"&gt;[[Willard Fazar]] cited in: B. Ralph Stauber, H. M. Douty, Willard Fazar, Richard H. Jordan, William Weinfeld and Allen D. Manvel. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682310 Federal Statistical Activities]." ''The American Statistician'' 13(2): 9-12 (Apr., 1959) , pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:PERT Guide for management use, June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Guide for management use'', June 1963]]
Ten years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American [[librarian]] Maribeth Brennan published a selected [[bibliography]] with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:
{{Quote|PERT originated in 1958 with the... [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] design and construction scheduling. Since that time, it has been used extensively not only by the [[aerospace industry]] but also in many situations where management desires to achieve an objective or complete a task within a scheduled time and cost expenditure; it came into popularity when the algorithm for calculating a maximum value path was conceived. PERT and CPM may be calculated manually or with a computer, but usually they require major computer support for detailed projects. A number of colleges and universities now offer instructional courses in both.&lt;ref name="MB 1968"&gt;Brennan, Maribeth, ''PERT and CPM: a selected bibliography,''  Monticello, Ill., Council of Planning Librarians, 1968. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the subdivision of work units in PERT&lt;ref&gt;Desmond L. Cook (1966), ''Program Evaluation and Review Technique.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another tool was developed: the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. The Work Breakdown Structure provides "a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bright Maynard]] (1967), ''Handbook of Business Administration.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the ''event'', with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* ''PERT event'': a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not "reached" (does not occur) until ''all'' of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* ''predecessor event'': an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* ''successor event'': an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:
* ''PERT activity'': the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* ''PERT sub-activity'': a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

=== Time ===
PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* ''optimistic time'': the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* ''pessimistic time'': the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* ''most likely time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* ''expected time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: '''te''' =  ('''o''' + '''4m''' + '''p''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;TE = \sum_{i=1}^n te_i&lt;/math&gt;
* ''standard deviation of time'' : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;) or a path (σ&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;)
::: '''σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;''' =  ('''p''' - '''o''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{TE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_{te_i}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* ''[[Float (project management)|float]] or [[Float (project management)|slack]]'' is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (''free float'') or the whole project (''total float''). Positive slack would indicate ''ahead of schedule''; negative slack would indicate ''behind schedule''; and zero slack would indicate ''on schedule''.
* ''[[critical path method|critical path]]'': the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* ''critical activity'': An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* ''[[wikt:lead#Verb_2|Lead]] time'': the time by which a ''predecessor event'' must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* ''lag time'': the earliest time by which a ''successor event'' can follow a specific PERT event.
* ''[[Critical path method|fast tracking]]'': performing more critical activities in parallel
* ''[[Critical path method|crashing critical path]]'': Shortening duration of critical activities

==Implementation==

The first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed.  The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one).  Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time.  Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled ''A'' through ''G''.  Some tasks can be done concurrently (''A'' and ''B'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''C'' cannot begin until ''A'' is complete).  Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''o''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''m''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''p'').  The expected time (''te'') is computed using the formula (''o'' + 4''m'' + ''p'') ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a [[Gantt chart]] or a network diagram.

Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]
:[[Image:Pert example gantt chart.png|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[OmniPlan]].

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software.  There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow ([[Arrow Diagramming Method|AOA]]) and activity on node ([[Precedence Diagram Method|AON]]).  Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret.  To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named ''start''.  This &lt;nowiki&gt;"activity"&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a duration of zero (0).  Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (''a'' and ''b'' in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node.  Next, since both ''c'' and ''d'' list ''a'' as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from ''a''.  Activity ''e'' is listed with ''b'' and ''c'' as predecessor activities, so node ''e'' is drawn with arrows coming from both ''b'' and ''c'', signifying that ''e'' cannot begin until both ''b'' and ''c'' have been completed.  Activity ''f'' has ''d'' as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities.  Likewise, an arrow is drawn from ''e'' to ''g''.  Since there are no activities that come after ''f'' or ''g'', it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled ''finish''.

:[[Image:pert example network diagram.gif|frame|none|A network diagram created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red.]]

:[[Image:pert example node legend.GIF|frame|right|A node like this one (from [[Microsoft Visio]]) can be used to display the activity name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack.]]

By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information.  The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The [[float (project management)|slack]]

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given.  The first step is to determine the ES and EF.  The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0).  The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for ''start'' is zero since it is the first activity.  Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero.  This EF is used as the ES for ''a'' and ''b''.
*The ES for ''a'' is zero.  The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four.  This EF is used as the ES for ''c'' and ''d''.
*The ES for ''b'' is zero.  The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for ''c'' is four.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for ''d'' is four.  The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33.  This EF is used as the ES for ''f''.
*The ES for ''e'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''b'' and ''c'').  Since ''b'' has an EF of 5.33 and ''c'' has an EF of 9.17, the ES of ''e'' is 9.17.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34.  This EF is used as the ES for ''g''.
*The ES for ''f'' is 10.33.  The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for ''g'' is 14.34.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for ''finish'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''f'' and ''g'').  Since ''f'' has an EF of 14.83 and ''g'' has an EF of 19.51, the ES of ''finish'' is 19.51.  ''Finish'' is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any [[Theory of Constraints|unforeseen events]], the project should take 19.51 work days to complete.  The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity.  This will eventually show if there are activities that have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF.  The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).

*The LF for ''finish'' is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project.  Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''f'' and ''g''.
*The LF for ''g'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''e''.
*The LF for ''f'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''d''.
*The LF for ''e'' is 14.34 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''b'' and ''c''.
*The LF for ''d'' is 15.01 work days.  The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for ''c'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for ''b'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for ''a'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''c'' has an LS of 4 work days and ''d'' has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for ''a'' is 4 work days.  The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for ''start'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''a'' has an LS of 0 work days and ''b'' has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the [[critical path method|critical path]] and if any activities have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The critical path is the path that takes the '''longest''' to complete.  To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths.  Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project.  Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF ''or'' slack = LS − ES.  Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path ''adf'' is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path ''aceg'' is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path ''beg'' is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is ''aceg'' and the critical time is 19.51 work days.  It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change.  For example, let's say that activities ''d'' and ''f'' take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) times.  The critical path is now ''adf'' and the critical time is 22 work days.  On the other hand, if activity ''c'' can be reduced to one work day, the path time for ''aceg'' is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, ''beg'' (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*''Start'' and ''finish'' are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 − 4 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.17 − 9.17 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.34 − 14.34 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 19.51 − 19.51 = 0
*Activity ''b'' has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity ''d'' has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity ''f'' has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity ''b'' can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project.  Likewise, activity ''d'' '''or''' activity ''f'' can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, ''d'' and ''f'' can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

=== Advantages ===
*  PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly [[Work breakdown structure|WBS]]) elements.
*  PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
*  PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
*  PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easily scalable for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, ''e.g.'', specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===

During project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called ''proactive scheduling''. A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed ''reactive scheduling'', consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

A '''promissory note''', sometimes referred to as a '''note payable''', is a [[legal instrument]] (more particularly, a [[financial instrument]] and a [[debt]] instrument), in which one party (the ''maker'' or ''issuer'') promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of [[money]] to the other (the ''payee''), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms.

==Overview==
The terms of a note usually include the [[:wikt:principal|principal]] amount, the [[interest rate]] if any, the parties, the date, the terms of repayment (which could include interest) and the [[maturity date]].  Sometimes, provisions are included concerning the payee's rights in the event of a [[default (finance)|default]], which may include [[foreclosure]] of the maker's assets. For loans between individuals, writing and signing a promissory note are often instrumental for tax and record keeping. A promissory note alone is typically unsecured.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Use a Promissory Note|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/promissory_note.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term note payable is commonly used in [[accounting]] (as distinguished from [[accounts payable]]) or commonly as just a "note", it is internationally defined by the ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'', but regional variations exist. A [[banknote]] is frequently referred to as a promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. [[Mortgage note]]s are another prominent example.

If the promissory note is unconditional and readily saleable, it is called a [[negotiable instrument]].&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;Whaley DJ. (2012). [http://wsulawreview.org/DWhaley.pdf Mortgage Foreclosures, Promissory Notes, and the Uniform Commercial Code]. ''Western State University Law Review''. [https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=39+W.+St.+U.+L.+Rev.+313&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=b4ff3146a501f1f969b427ea9ebfba75 LexisNexis entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demand promissory notes''' are notes that do not carry a specific maturity date, but are due on demand of the lender. Usually the lender will only give the borrower a few days' notice before the payment is due.

Promissory notes may be used in combination with [[security agreement]]s. For example, a promissory note may be used in combination with a [[mortgage law|mortgage]], in which case it is called a [[mortgage note]].

====Loan contracts====
In common speech, other terms, such as "[[loan]]", "[[loan agreement]]", and "loan contract" may be used interchangeably with "promissory note". The term "loan contract" is often used to describe a contract that is lengthy and detailed.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

A promissory note is very similar to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a promissory note is generally less detailed and less rigid than a loan contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp|title=Promissory Note|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|website=investopedia.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not.

====Difference from IOU====
Promissory notes differ from [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s in that they contain a specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beattie|first=Andrew|title=Promissory Notes: Not Your Average IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/promissory_note.asp|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOUs only acknowledge that a debt exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promissory Note Comparison Guide|url=https://www.legalzoom.com/sites/legalzoom.com/themes/legalzoom/assets/includes/Promissory-Note-Comparison-Guide.pdf|website=LegalZoom|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp|website=Investopedia|publisher=Investopedia, LLC|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiability===
[[Negotiable instrument]]s are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable instruments are subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the application of the [[holder in due course]] rule.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt; The negotiability of [[mortgage note]]s has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and "baggage" associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt;

In the United States, the Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/6-508-0668|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as financial instruments===
Promissory notes are a common financial instrument in many jurisdictions, employed principally for short time financing of companies. Often, the seller or provider of a service is not paid upfront by the buyer (usually, another company), but within a period of time, the length of which has been agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. The reasons for this may vary; historically, many companies used to balance their books and execute payments and debts at the end of each week or tax month; any product bought before that time would be paid only then. Depending on the jurisdiction, this [[Standard of deferred payment|deferred payment period]] can be regulated by law; in countries like [[France]], [[Italy]] or [[Spain]], it usually ranges between 30 and 90 days after the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesclesdelabanque.com/Web/Cdb/Entrepreneurs/Content.nsf/DocumentsByIDWeb/7PUHXY?OpenDocument|title=La lettre de change et la LCR|first=Les clés de la banque-|last=FBF|date=|website=Les clés de la banque Entrepreneurs|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a company engages in many of such transactions, for instance by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, it is possible that the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short-term loan, or using any other such short-term financial arrangements to avoid [[insolvency]]. However, in jurisdictions where promissory notes are commonplace, the company (called the ''payee'' or ''lender'') can ask one of its debtors (called the ''maker'', ''borrower'' or ''payor'') to ''accept'' a promissory note, whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the promissory note (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinkel|first1=Daniel F.|title=Essentials of Practical Real Estate Law|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133421490|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XoJAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lender can then take the promissory note to a financial institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the promissory note for cash; usually, the promissory note is cashed in for the amount established in the promissory note, less a small discount.

Once the promissory note reaches its ''maturity date'', its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount ''promised'' in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the promissory note in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured promissory notes, the lender accepts the promissory note based solely on the maker's ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured promissory note, the lender accepts the promissory note based on the maker's ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/promise.htm|title=SEC.gov - Broken Promises: Promissory Note Fraud|author=|date=|website=www.sec.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as private money===
Thus, promissory notes can work as a form of private money. In the past, particularly during the 19th century, their widespread and unregulated use was a source of great risk for banks and private financiers, who would often face the insolvency of both debtors, or simply be scammed by both.

Historically, promissory notes have acted as a form of privately issued [[currency]]. [[Flying cash]] or ''feiqian'' was a promissory note used during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907). Flying cash was regularly used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals.&lt;ref name="Origins of value"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William N. Goetzmann|author2=K. Geert Rouwenhorst|title=The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations that Created Modern Capital Markets|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517571-4|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese concept of promissory notes was introduced by Marco Polo to Europe.&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Polo|title=The Travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian, in the Thirteenth Century: Being a Description, by that Early Traveller, of Remarkable Places and Things, in the Eastern Parts of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JetQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|accessdate=19 September 2012|year=1818|pages=353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, in 1325 a promissory note was signed in [[Milan]]. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowiak, Marek. ''Dirhams for slaves''. Medieval Seminar, All Souls, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued promissory notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition=1st Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of promissory notes being issued in 1384 between [[Genoa]] and [[Barcelona]], although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d'Entença, a merchant from [[Huesca]] (then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]), amounting a total of 100 florins.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Manuel Sanchis Guarner in ''La Ciutat de València''. Ajuntament de València, València. Cinquena Edició 1989, plana 172. Quote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
{{cita|Onorables senyors, nosaltres havem pres ací en Monsó, C florins de cambi de mossén Manuel d'Entença..., vos plàcia complir e donar aquí en València, per ell al honrat En Bernat de Codinachs, vista la present. Per la lletra que us enviam, vos fem saber aquells havíem ops. Plàtia-us, senyors, aquest cambi aja bon compliment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases, the promissory notes were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. [[Strozzi family|Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi]] issued an early form of promissory note in [[Medina del Campo]] ([[Spain]]), against the city of [[Besançon]] in 1553.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La primera Letra de Cambio|url=http://www.delsolmedina.com/La%20primera%20letra%20de%20cambio.htm|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists notice of promissory notes being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.

===International law===
In 1930, under the League of Nations, a ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'' was drafted and ratified by eighteen  nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/09/9-03/bills-exchange-notes.xml|publisher=UiO|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;clang=_en|website=United Nations Treaty Collection|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=7 June 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 75 of the treaty stated that a promissory note shall contain:
* the term "''promissory note''" inserted in the body of the instrument and expressed in the language employed in drawing up the instrument
* an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money;
* a statement of the time of payment;
* a statement of the place where payment is to be made;
* the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be made;
* a statement of the date and of the place where the promissory note is issued;
* the signature of the person who issues the instrument (maker).

===United States===
[[File:Promissory note - 2nd Bank of US $1000.jpg|thumb|A promissory note issued by the [[Second Bank of the United States]], December 15, 1840, for the amount of $1,000]]
In the [[United States]], a promissory note that meets certain conditions is a [[negotiable instrument]] regulated by article 3 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. Negotiable promissory notes called [[mortgage note]]s are used extensively in combination with [[Mortgage law|mortgages]] in the financing of [[real estate]] transactions. One prominent example is the [[Fannie Mae]] model [[standard form contract]] Multistate Fixed-Rate Note 3200, which is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes|url=https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/notes|publisher=[[FannieMae]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promissory notes, or [[commercial paper]]s, are also issued to provide capital to businesses. However, Promissory Notes act as a source of Finance to the company's creditors.

The various State law enactments of the Uniform Commercial Code define what is and what is not a promissory note, in section 3-104(d):

{{cquote|'''§ 3-104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.'''

'''...'''

'''(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, a writing containing such a disclaimer removes such a writing from the definition of ''negotiable instrument'', instead simply memorializing a [[contract]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">The '''[[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] Honors Scholarship Program''' was a federally funded and state-administered [[Merit-based financial aid|merit-based]] scholarship program in the United States.

== Program History ==
It was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Postsecondary Education]] awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded [[scholarships]] (also known as '''Byrd Honors Scholarships''') to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards [[college]] expenses.

=== Funding ===
The Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html Byrd.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031004216/http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/gtepiduesbyrd.pdf Ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesc.com/content.nsf/SFC/Robert_C_Byrd_Honors_Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application Requirements ==
Each state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements. In any case, all applicants were to be high school graduates who:
* had been accepted for enrollment at institutions of higher education(IHEs) in the United States;
* had demonstrated outstanding academic achievement;
* and who showed promise of continued academic excellence.

==Awards and honors==

In 2014, SHoP was named ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine's "Most Innovative Architecture Firm in the World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferro|first=Shaunacy|title=The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Architecture|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3026688/most-innovative-companies-2014/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-in-architecture|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of its "Most Innovative Companies in the World" for its policy of accepting equity in projects, rather than traditional payment, in exchange for services, as well as for its use of modular construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Andrew|title=Most Innovative Companies 2014, #33 SHoP Architects|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/shop-architects|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SHoP Architects' awards also include the 2009 National Design Award for Architecture Design from the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum-announces-winners-10th-annual-national-design-awards "Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Announces Winners of the 10th Annual National Design Awards"] (press release) [[Smithsonian Institution]] website (April 30, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; the Chicago Athenaeum American Architecture Awards, and awards from the [[American Institute of Architects]]' New York City and New York State chapters.

==Criticism==
[[Justin Davidson]], the architecture critic for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''  magazine, called the firm "ubiquitous" and criticized its plan with the Howard Hughes Corporation for the South Street Seaport, saying its single tower creates "a new barrier between the seaport and the world beyond." He writes that both the developer and the firm need to understand the area's "benign shabbiness" and not "set a new precedent [of] claiming the waterfront for residences."&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Davidson|Davidson, Justin]], "South Street Sell-off," ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine (December 29 2014), p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taskwarrior''' is an open-source, cross platform [[Time management|time]] and [[task management]] tool. It has a [[command-line interface]] rather than a [[graphical user interface]].

Taskwarrior uses concepts and techniques described in ''[[Getting Things Done]]'' by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]], but is paradigm-agnostic in that it does not require users to adhere to any given life-management philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;https://taskwarrior.org/docs/start.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its author, Taskwarrior was created "to address layout and feature issues"&lt;ref&gt;[http://taskwarrior.org/wiki/taskwarrior/About About Taskwarrior], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408100712/http://taskwarrior.org/wiki/taskwarrior/About |date=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Todo.txt applications popularized by [[Gina Trapani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://todotxt.com/ Todo.txt] Future-proof task tracking in a file you control&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Timewarrior,'' the authors offer an accompanying tool to track time spent on projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/news/news.20160620.html&lt;/ref&gt; Configuration allows e. g. to define recurring breaks such as lunch time.&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior/workweek.html&lt;/ref&gt; The documention notes that "Timewarrior focusses on accurately recording time already spent, whereas Taskwarrior looks forward to work that is not yet done."&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior/backdated.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
Taskwarrior's source code is freely available and can be compiled and run on a variety of architectures and operating systems, or installed using binaries obtained with common package management tools: ([[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]], [[Fink]], [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]], [[DNF (software)|dnf]], pkgng, pkg_add, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tasktools.org/gitweb/?p=task.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;h=6f87bea2840e2f2f1948125e37a4e1f3091546a4;hb=2.0.0 Task 2.0.0 NEWS file]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical Workflow==
Taskwarrior comprises three main commands: ''add'', ''list'', and ''done.'' All other functionality – recurrences, tags, priorities, etc. – are optional.

===Adding a task===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task add Pick up keys to the new apartment
Created task 1.
&lt;/source&gt;
===Listing Tasks===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task list
ID Project Pri Due Active Age    Description                      
1                        4 secs Pick up keys to the new apartment
1 task
&lt;/source&gt;

===Marking a task as completed===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task 1 done
Completed 1 'Pick up keys to the new apartment'.
Marked 1 task as done.
&lt;/source&gt;
===Creating a task with due dates, recurrences, and tags===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task add Mow the lawn project:Lawnwork due:tomorrow recur:biweekly +home
Created task 1.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Syncing==
When used in conjunction with Taskserver, can sync tasks into the cloud, and indirectly with other clients/devices.

'''Tomo Razmilovic''' (born 31 May 1942) is a [[Croatia]]n-born businessman, formerly the [[chief executive officer]] of [[Long Island, New York]]-based [[Symbol Technologies]]. He is the suspected mastermind of a massive [[accounting scandal|accounting fraud]] that ultimately cost the company its independence.  Currently, the [[United States Government]] considers him a [[fugitive]], with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.&lt;ref name=usps-poster&gt;{{cite web|title=Wanted Poster of Tomo Razmilovic|url=https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/radDocs/wanted/razmilov.htm|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Split, Croatia]], Razmilovic studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] and management at the Hammond Institute in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=nyt-longisland&gt;{{cite news|last=Tagliaferro|first=Linda|title=Long Island Q&amp;A: Tomo Razmilovic, Moving From Bar Codes to Advances in Communications|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/nyregion/long-island-q-tomo-razmilovic-moving-bar-codes-advances-communications.html?src=pm|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained Swedish [[citizenship]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=ceoannouncement&gt;[http://www.symbol.com/news/pressreleases/pr_finanstock_ceo.html Press release from Symbol] announcing appointment as CEO&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic joined Symbol in 1989 as Senior Vice President of International Operations, becoming head of Worldwide Sales and Service in 1993 and president and [[chief operating officer]] in 1995.  He succeeded founder [[Jerome Swartz]] as CEO in 2000. Previously, he had been president of [[International Computers Limited]], a British computer manufacturer, and president and CEO of Cominvest, a [[Economy of Sweden|Swedish]] computer company.&lt;ref name=ceoannouncement/&gt;  He abruptly retired in 2002 in the midst of a [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] inquiry into its accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/nyregion/li-work-at-symbol-changes-at-top-ahd-hopes-for-revival.html|title=At Symbol, Changes At Top and Hopes for Revival|last=Strugatch|first=Warren|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2002-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2004, an [[arrest warrant]] for Razmilovic was issued by the [[United States District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]]. According to the United States Postal Inspection Service, he is wanted for orchestrating a massive accounting fraud that cost investors more than $200 million. &lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrington|first=Mark|title=Fugitive ex-CEO faces $90M civil penalty |url=http://www.newsday.com/business/fugitive-ex-ceo-faces-90m-civil-penalty-1.3228303|work=Newsday|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was formally indicted on June 3, along with seven other former Symbol executives.  According to investigators, Razmilovic was the mastermind behind a wide-ranging scheme to inflate the company's sales and profits.  It included several types of fraud, such as [[channel stuffing]] (booking sales to wholesalers and distributors as final sales to customers), candy deals (selling products to distributors with no matching customer orders and then buying the products back), use of tango sheets (records of how much revenues had to be inflated to match quarterly targets) and use of cookie jar reserves (declaring nonrecurring expenses that far exceeded likely expenses).  On the same day, Razmilovic and 10 other executives were sued by the SEC for the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/04/business/ex-executives-at-symbol-are-indicted.htm|title=Ex-Executives at Symbol Are Indicted|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2004-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, four executives pleaded guilty, and seven executives settled SEC charges against them.  Several of those who pleaded guilty stated under oath that Razmilovic was the mastermind of the fraud.&lt;ref name=apologydemand/&gt;  After the fraud came to light, it was revealed that Razmilovic had been forced out at Cominvest due to accounting irregularities.&lt;ref name=WaitingOut&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-04/business/0407030278_1_tomo-razmilovic-swedish-charges|title=Ex-Symbol CEO waiting out charges in Sweden|last=Harrington|first=John|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=2004-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Symbol learned of the fraud in the summer of 2002 via an internal investigation, and cooperated with authorities.  In late 2002, it restated almost four years worth of earnings from 1998 to 2001, in the process erasing $234 million in revenue and $325 million in net income.  It also paid $37 million to settle the SEC charges and $138 million to settle numerous shareholder suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/business/technology-day-2-i-learn-the-books-are-cooked.html|title=Technology, Day 2:  I Learn the Books Are Cooked|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18734.htm SEC suit against Symbol]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SECorder&gt;[http://www.secactions.com/sec-obtains-62-6-million-judgement-against-former-ceo/ SEC release announcing penalties against Razmilovic]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company never recovered, and was ultimately forced to merge with [[Motorola]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=AmericanGreed&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2013 |title=[[American Greed|American Greed: The Fugitives]]:  Diamonds Aren't Forever |url= |format= |medium=Television Production |publisher=[[CNBC]] |location=[[United States]] |accessdate= |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic was not heard from again until 2004, when [[WNBC]] in [[New York City]] and [[Newsday]], the main newspaper on [[Long Island]], found him living in a small town in Sweden.&lt;ref name=apologydemand&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Tomo-Razmilovic-Fugitive-Millionaire-Sweden-CEO-Symbol-Technologies-Long-Island-232921331.html|title=Fugitive Long Island CEO Accused of $200 Million Fraud Wants Apology |last=Dienst|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[WNBC]]|date=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaitingOut/&gt;  He had fled there citing claims that he would not be able to get a fair trial in the United States.&lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive/&gt;  In 2008, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine named Razmilovic one of the "World's Most Wanted White-Collar Fugitives".&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vardi|first=Nathan|title=The World's Most Wanted White-Collar Fugutives |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/27/legal-crime-fbi-biz-cz_nv_0827fugitives.html|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=17 February 2012 |author2=Asher Hawkins }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The SEC won a [[default judgement]] against Razmilovic in 2009.  In 2011, federal judge [[Sandra J. Feuerstein]] ordered Razmilovic to [[disgorgement (law)|disgorge]] $41.7 million in illegal profits and pay a $20.8 million civil penalty.  With interest, the penalty could add up to as much as $47 million.  He is also banned from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again.&lt;ref name=newsday-fugitive/&gt;&lt;ref name=SECorder/&gt;  On January 17, 2014, federal prosecutors on Long Island filed a civil suit seeking the forfeiture of $12 million in illegal profits that they believe Razmilovic has hidden in a [[Credit Suisse]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/feds-seek-12m-from-fugitive-li-tech-exec-1.6823709|title=Feds seek $12M from fugitive LI tech exec|last=Riley|first=John|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Razmilovic maintains that he is innocent, and in a 2013 interview with WNBC and [[CNBC]] went as far as to demand an apology from investigators and media covering the story.  He has stated that he has no intention of returning to the United States to face the charges against him.   Sweden will not give up Razmilovic for [[extradition]] because it does not turn over suspected white-collar criminals to a country not located in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=apologydemand/&gt;

The accounting fraud was profiled by CNBC's ''[[American Greed|American Greed: The Fugitives]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref name=AmericanGreed/&gt;

[[File:William Forbes of Callendar by Sir Henry Raeburn, SNPG.JPG|thumb|William Forbes of Callendar by Sir [[Henry Raeburn]] (detail) 1798]]
'''Sir William Forbes of Callendar''' (1756–1823) was a prosperous [[copper]]smith and landowner who lived in [[Callendar House]] in [[Falkirk]], [[Scotland]].

==Biography==
Forbes was a self-made man. The son of an [[Aberdeen]] merchant, he began work as a coppersmith and won a government contract to sheath ships' [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s in copper. With the fortune he made (equivalent to over [[USD|$]]1 billion in today's terms), he purchased the estates of Callendar and [[Linlithgow]] near Falkirk, which had been forfeited by the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Earl of Linlithgow]] after the [[1715 Jacobite rising]]. He bought the estates at auction and is said to have astounded bystanders by producing a banknote for £100,000, specially printed for the occasion, at the age of just 40. At the time he was the greatest landowner in the county, with some of the largest collected lands in [[Scotland]]. He was not popular with local people, but nevertheless his family retained great influence over the area for two centuries.

Wishing to set himself up as a 'landed gentleman', William purchased further vast estates in [[Ayrshire]], Earlstoun, [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] and [[Dumfriesshire]]. He spent ten years making improvements to Callendar House, dividing his time between the house and London. He gave orders for the complete renovation and refurnishing of the entire house, adding a new wing and ripping out old rooms. He added the various turrets and exterior decoration which give the house its chateau-like appearance today. Although William preferred the newest fashion (and purchased the best furniture and household goods from makers in London and [[Edinburgh]]) he did not spend money recklessly, ordering the new servants' wing to be furnished 'in the cheapest way'.

His first wife was Margaret McAdam, daughter of John McAdam of [[Craigengillan]]. She did not keep well and was sent to Madeira for her health's sake. There she died, at the early age of 28, in March 1793. Her gravestone, English marble, sent from London, can be seen in the English Cemetery, Funchal.  Forbes remarried in 1806 Agnes Chalmers, daughter of John Chalmers of Old Machar in Aberdeen. This union produced two sons and three daughters. The Forbes household settled down after William's marriage and he began to spend more time in Callendar House and give his brother David greater control of the business in London.

In 1794, aged 51, he retired to become a full-time landowner, rejecting the idea of employing a factor trained in the needs of estate management and elected to manage the {{convert|8000|acre|km2|adj=on}} estates himself. His first son William, 2nd of Callendar, went on to become [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Stirlingshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirlingshire]].

Forbes' descendants sold Callendar House in the 1960s and are listed in ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]''.

'''Women's Image Network''' (WIN), was founded in 1993 to promote gender parity by [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bert-stern-original-mad-man-432680 filmmaker, Phyllis Stuart]. This company became successful from the ongoing support, advice and assistance provided by seasoned entertainment professionals including [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Arthur Hiller]], just two of the illustrious WIN founding advisory board members.

The charity Women's Image Network produces The Women's Image Awards because to the extent that women's voices remain silent everyone is robbed of their contribution. This growing awards show is now produced during the Hollywood awards season to promote deserving media and drive attention to feature films also contending for Golden Globe and Academy Awards.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title = WIN Symposium and Awards Ceremony Set|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-22/entertainment/ca-15675_1_awards-ceremony|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1993-07-22|access-date = 2015-12-08|issn = 0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selecting only media submitted from film studios and television networks, their jury adjudicates and nominates work which either tells a dimensional female character's story or nominates work that is produced, written or directed by a woman. In this way, these awards celebrate both male and female artists whose film and television work also increases the value of women and girls.

In addition to awarding nominated film and television work, WIN also honors deserving individuals including: [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Senator Barbara Boxer]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Cecilia DeMille Presley]], [[Abigail Disney]], Ambassador [[Swanee Hunt]], [[Suzanne Roberts]], [[Maria Arena Bell]], [[Diane Ladd]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Irena Medavoy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/WIN-Honors-Elizabeth-Taylor-and-Suzanne-Fleisher-Roberts-20101206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ireachcontent.com/news-releases/the-win-awards-2013--film--television-nominees--honorees-rosalind-jarrett-sepulveda-cecilia-demille-presley--ambassador-swanee-hunt-233078341.html&lt;/ref&gt;
