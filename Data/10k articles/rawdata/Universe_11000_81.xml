The '''2013 extreme weather events''' included several all-time [[temperature record]]s in [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The February extent of snow cover in [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]] was above average, while the extent of [[Arctic ice]] in the same month was 4,5% below the 1981–2010 average.&lt;ref name="earthsky"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://earthsky.org/earth/february-2013-was-9th-warmest-february-on-record| title =February 2013 was ninth-warmest February on record|publisher =Earthsky.org| date=Mar 18, 2013|accessdate =13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Hemisphere weather extremes have been linked to the [[Climate change in the Arctic#Sea ice|melting of Arctic sea ice]], which alters [[atmospheric circulation]] in a way that leads to more snow and ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/03/130326-arctic-sea-ice-global-warming-science-environment-spring/| title =Is Shrinking Sea Ice Behind Chilly Spring?|publisher =[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]| accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 11, 233 weather-related deaths were reported in India.&lt;ref name="rw"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://reliefweb.int/report/india/india-extreme-cold-weather-mdrin010-dref-operation| title =India: Extreme cold weather (MDRIN010) - DREF Operation|publisher =[[ReliefWeb]]| date=11 Jan 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, particularly in Russia, the [[Czech Republic]] and the United Kingdom, low temperatures affected wildlife, delaying [[bird breeding]] and disrupting the [[bird migration]]. On January 10 [[Bangladesh]] faced the lowest temperature since country's independence, at {{convert|3.0|°C|°F}} in [[Saidpur, Rangpur Division|Saidpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/80-dead-temperature-hits-record-low-bangladesh| title =80 dead as temperature hits record low in Bangladesh|publisher =[[ReliefWeb]]| date=10 Jan 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Finland and most of Northern European countries got the record high, and even the highest temperatures at Europe during May and June, Western- and Middle Europe faced much cooler weather and even their wettest May and June ever. During summer prolonged [[heat wave]]s in the Northern Hemisphere set new record high temperatures.

On March 24, 2014, the secretary-general of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] Michel Jarraud announced that "many of the extreme events of 2013 were consistent with what we would expect as a result of [[Climate change#Human influences|human-induced climate change]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/24/extreme-weather-events-un-ipcc_n_5020012.html| title ='Extreme Events' Of 2013 Tied To Warming Earth, UN Agency Says |publisher =''[[The Huffington Post]]''|author=John Heilprin|date=24 March 2014| accessdate =30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold spring in the Northern Hemisphere==
In Northern Hemisphere the weather pattern repeatedly directed cold [[Arctic]] air southward, leaving Greenland and northeastern Canada much warmer than average for March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.climatecentral.org/news/from-2012-to-2013-march-blows-hot-then-cold-15807| title =From 2012 to 2013, March Blows Hot, Then Cold |publisher =[[Climate Central]]| date=March 29, 2013 |author=Andrew Freedman|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; High pressure situated over [[Greenland]] acted as a [[Block (meteorology)|block]], forcing the [[jet stream]] into a southerly flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firth|first=Niall|title=How a freak diversion of the jet stream is paralysing the globe with freezing conditions|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1340436/Why-cold-warm-Greenland-Diverted-jet-stream-letting-icy-blast-Arctic.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations over Greenland threatened to break the worldwide record for highest barometric pressure of 1083.3 mb, set on December 31, 1968, in Siberia, the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]’s Ocean Prediction Center forecast a high pressure center of at least 1074 mb over Greenland during March.&lt;ref name="Grow" &gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Grow|title=Record blocking patterns fueling extreme weather: detailed look at why it’s so cold|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/03/21/record-blocking-patterns-fueling-extreme-washington-d-c-march-weather/|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Capital Weather Gang:The Washington Post|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Greenland block was also noticed during the cold weather seen in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ballisty|first=Tim|title=Why So Cold?

===North America===

====Canada====
Due to expected low temperatures overnight on February 16 and 17, an extreme cold weather alert was issued in [[Toronto]]. On February 16 [[Environment Canada]] also issued a weather statement for [[York, Toronto|York]], Durham, [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel]] and Halton areas, warning of intensifying [[Snow flurry|flurries]].

On December 22, a [[December 2013 North American storm complex|severe ice storm]] brought snow and [[freezing rain]] to [[Toronto]], and much of [[Eastern Canada]]. The storm caused widespread power outages and left hundreds of thousands in the dark.

====United States====
{{see also|February 2013 nor'easter}}
The cold wave in the United States was influenced by a [[low-pressure area]] called a "[[Alberta clipper|Clipper]]" which brought an Arctic [[cold front]] that caused rapidly falling temperatures and strong northwest winds with gusts of {{convert|35|-|50|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dlh/?n=coldsnap_Jan2013| title =Summary of Arctic Blast|publisher =[[NOAA]]| date=January 25, 2013|accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Salt Lake City]] January, 2013 with the average temperature of {{convert|19.4|°F|°C}} became the coldest month on record since 1949 and the sixth-coldest January since 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=24023983| title =Record low temperatures make January coldest month since 1949|publisher =[[KSL-TV]]| author=Amy Joi O'Donoghue|date=February 10, 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5 a record 6-inch snow depth was noted in Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]], exceeding the previous 1999 record for that date by 2.2 inches.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/05/us/winter-weather| title = Chicago sets snowfall record as mid-Atlantic braces|publisher =CNN| date=March 6, 2013  |accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day 900 flights were cancelled in O'Hare Airport, while [[Midway Airport]] reportedly cancelled 240 flights. [[U.S. Airways]] reported 350 flight cancellations for March 6.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

In [[Orlando, Florida]], the temperature lowered to {{convert|41|°F|°C}} on March 28, 2 degrees below the record of 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.clickorlando.com/weather/Record-low-temperatures-recorded-again-in-Central-Florida/-/1636950/19501280/-/gl3ha6z/-/index.html| title =Record-low temperatures recorded again in Central Florida|publisher =Click Orlando|date=Mar 28, 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest minimum temperature record of 1971 ({{convert|51|°F|°C}}) was also broken in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], where a temperature of {{convert|48|°F|°C}} was recorded on March 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/weather/chilly-morning-but-warmer-day-ahead-for-palm-beach/nW6Cg/| title =Morning brings record-breaking low temperature, warmer day ahead for Palm Beach County, Treasure Coast|publisher =The Palm Beach Post| author= Alexandra Seltzer|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1–3 May, a late snow storm occurred across the central United States from Arkansas to Minnesota. The storm formed from a deep upper level trough which became a cut-off low, the event was named "Achilles" by the [[Weather Channel]]. The storm broke records for depth of snow and lateness in the season, and was cited as the worst May snow since 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burt|first=Christopher C.|title=The Phenomenal May Snowstorm of May 1-3, 2013|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=153|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=Weather Historian Blog: Wunderground.com|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During mid- to late-May, the tornado outbreaks of [[Tornado outbreak of May 18–21, 2013|May 18–21]] and [[Tornado outbreak of May 26–31, 2013|May 26–31]] resulted in over 100 tornadoes, including [[2013 Moore tornado|an EF5 tornado]] in [[Moore, Oklahoma]], and [[2013 El Reno tornado|an EF3 tornado]] in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]]. The related storms also resulted in record-breaking rains in North Dakota, New York, and Vermont. The tornado that went through [[El Reno, Oklahoma|El Reno]] broke the record for widest tornado ever recorded, at 2.6 miles wide.

The [[October 2013 North American storm complex]] was a blizzard and tornado outbreak that affected the [[Northwest United States|Northwest]], [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], and much of the [[Midwest]].

The incident trapped over 6 dozen people inside of their automobiles and harmed 15 people in suburban Iowa and Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCune |first=Greg |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/05/us-usa-weather-idUSBRE99401120131005 |title=Upper Midwest struck by unusual autumn tornadoes, snowstorm |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wishtv1"&gt;{{cite web |author=EndPlay |url=http://www.wishtv.com/news/national/storm-brings-snow-tornadoes-to-great-plains_75157201 |title=Storm-brings-snow-tornadoes-to-Great-Plains_75157201 |publisher=Wishtv.com |date=1919-10-19 |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012054908/http://www.wishtv.com/news/national/storm-brings-snow-tornadoes-to-great-plains_75157201 |archive-date=2013-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], the second largest city in [[South Dakota]], was engulfed in close to two feet of snow, which exceeds the amount of snow that the city has ever recorded during any whole month of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/october-weather-blizzard-torna/18577091 |title=Blizzard, Tornadoes, Warmth: More Wild Weather on Way for US |publisher=Accuweather.com |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, on October 4, 2013, the city received over 1.5 feet of snow, which exceeded the previous one day record in October by more than six inches.  Over 20 000 people lost electricity in [[Black Hills]], where more than a meter of watered down, dense snow had fallen.  The storm system also included thunderstorms that brought iced precipitation, significant rain and over half a dozen tornadoes to [[Nebraska]] and [[Iowa]].&lt;ref name="wishtv1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news10.com/story/23615568/great-plains-digs-out-of-heavy-snow-storm-debris |title=Great Plains digs out of heavy snow, storm debris - NEWS10 ABC: Albany, New York News, Weather, Sports |publisher=News10.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/photos-wild-central-us-storm-u/18512072 |title=PHOTOS: Central US Storm Unleashes Tornadoes, Feet of Snow |publisher=Accuweather.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 200&amp;nbsp;km of [[Interstate 90]] were shut down from South Dakota to [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg McCune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-05/news/sns-upper-midwest-struck-by-unusual-autumn-tornadoes-snowstorm-20131005_1_tornadoes-upper-midwest-great-plains |title=Upper Midwest struck by unusual autumn tornadoes, snowstorm - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=October 5, 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
During March a cold easterly flow across northern Europe from Russia brought intense snowfalls across the continent as it met moisture filled air masses from Ukraine to Ireland.

====Czech Republic====
Stopped on their annual way to the north by the cold weather, thousands of [[European golden plover]]s occupied the fields of central [[Moravia]] and southeast [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://praguemonitor.com/2013/03/27/migrating-golden-plovers-stuck-moravia-due-cold-weather| title = Migrating golden plovers stuck in Moravia due to cold weather|publisher =Prague Monitor| date=27 March 2013 |accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cold weather also delayed the arrival of [[migratory birds]] that spend the summer in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="pm"/&gt; In [[Příbram]] the temperature on March 24 broke the 1883 record of {{convert|-9.4|°C|°F}}, being 1.8 degrees lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://praguemonitor.com/2013/03/25/cold-weather-breaking-records| title = Cold weather breaking records|publisher =Prague Monitor| date=25 March 2013 |accessdate = 31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In Finland, a cold wave hit on the first days of March 2013. The cold wave had very sunny and dry weather for over a month-long period and brought the lowest temperatures for the 2012-13 winter season.

==Perturbed European late spring and early summer==
After a cold March and early April in Finland and Scandinavia, a late, but very strong and widespread spring caused fast snow melting and [[flood]]ing around Finland. Floods occurred mainly in the Province of [[Northern Ostrobothnia]], where floods hit hardest in [[Pyhäjoki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=MTV3.fi: Pyhäjoen keskustaa uhkaa taas jääpato - ihmisiä evakuoitu|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/2013/04/1740533/pyhajoen-keskustaa-uhkaa-taas-jaapato|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the weather became exceptionally warm.

[[File:Gamajet 8 above manhole.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa Laval Gamajet machine lowered into a manhole for cleaning]]
An '''automated tank cleaning machine''' is a machine used to clean cargo, process, [[underground storage tank]]s and similar equipment such as those found in [[tank truck]]s,  [[railroad car]]s, [[barge]]s, [[oil tanker]]s, food and beverage manufacturing facilities, chemical processing plants, ethanol plants, and [[brewing]] facilities.&lt;ref name="bkm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamajet.com/aboutus.php&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Genericized trademark]]s such as '''Gamajet''' and '''Butterworth machine'''  are often used to refer to automatic tank cleaning machines regardless of their manufacturer.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Impact Demo.jpg|thumb|left|Impact, or mechanical force, demonstration of an Alfa Laval Gamajet tank cleaning device]]Tanks must be cleaned from time to time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank to prevent cross [[contamination]].&lt;ref name="ethanolproducer.com"&gt;http://ethanolproducer.com/articles/10252/tank-cleaning-with-rotary-impingement-technology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hay12"/&gt; Another is to allow the tank to be inspected or for maintenance to be performed within a tank and to prevent product build-up on tank interior walls.&lt;ref name="hay12"&gt;Hayler and Keever, 2003:14-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dairyfoods.com/articles/89829-how-to-clean-greek-yogurt-residue-in-process-tanks?v=preview&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated tank cleaning machines work in a manner similar to an [[irrigation sprinkler]] but are highly-engineered to deliver increased force. Water forced through rotary jet nozzles rotates the device on a dual axis, creating a 360° cleaning pattern. As the water sprays, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.&lt;ref name="hay12"/&gt; Portable cleaning systems are commonly used for many outdoor applications&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamajet.com/products/systems/gobyjet.php&lt;/ref&gt; while fixed or permanent [[Clean-in-Place]] (CIP) systems are used in more sanitary environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodmanufacturing.com/article/2012/07/clean-sweep&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alfa Laval Gamajet 8 is widely used in the [[chemical industry]], [[ethanol]], [[transport]], [[brewing]], [[municipality]], and [[oilfield]]/fuel storage applications. Weighing only 15 lbs., the device maintains 40 lbs. of cleaning force at 25 feet. Typical cleaning cycles are completed in 12 minutes.&lt;ref name="ethanolproducer.com"/&gt;

[[File:CleanSoupKettle1.jpg|thumb|left|Alfa Laval Gamajet device after cleaning ketchup tank]]The Butterworth Type K machine is widely used.&lt;ref name="bkm"/&gt; This model can clean a tank of up to {{convert|10000000|usgal|m3}}.&lt;ref name="bkm"&gt;Butterworth, Inc., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It uses water with a pressure up to {{convert|250|psi|abbr=on}} and a temperature of up to {{convert|250|F|C}}.&lt;ref name="bkm"/&gt; The water jet reaches up to {{convert|115|ft}}.&lt;ref name="bkm"/&gt; Depending on the pressure used, a cleaning cycle can take from about 10 to 50 minutes and the machine uses between {{Convert|15|usgal|L impgal|1}} and {{Convert|350|usgal|L impgal|1}} per minute.&lt;ref name="bkm"/&gt;

On most crude-oil tankers, a special [[crude oil washing system]], or COW system, is part of the cleaning process.&lt;ref name="hay12"/&gt; The COW system circulates hot crude oil through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits.&lt;ref name="hay12"/&gt;

Although machines are often used to wash tanks, a final stage of manual cleaning known as mucking, is usually performed.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt; Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces and the use of [[respirator|airline respirator]]s, [[protective clothing]] and [[safety observer]]s.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;

However, with Gamajet tank cleaning machines, confined space entry is greatly reduced eliminating danger to workers.&lt;ref&gt;Colbentz, Lindsay. "A Clean Sweep." Food Manufacturing. 20 July 2012. Web. http://www.foodmanufacturing.com/articles/2012/07/clean-sweep Retrieved 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Manual tank cleaning is dangerous in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/confinedspaces/standards.html&lt;/ref&gt; While tank barges can be cleaned in port, shipboard tanks are generally cleaned at sea.&lt;ref name="osha"&gt;OSHA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to risks of fire and explosion inside the tanks.&lt;ref name="osha"/&gt;

==History==
The first automated tank cleaning machine was invented by Arthur Butterworth and patented in 1920.&lt;ref name="butabout"&gt;Butterworth, Inc., 2001, About Us.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to limit the amount of time that workers had to spend inside tanks, and partially relieve them of a dangerous and laborious job.&lt;ref name="butabout"/&gt; In 1925, Butterworth established a company to market the machine.&lt;ref name="butabout"/&gt; [[Standard Oil New Jersey]] bought the company in 1930, and it later became a subsidiary of the [[Exxon Corporation]].&lt;ref name="butabout"/&gt;

In 1986, as part of an internal restructuring at Exxon, the Butterworth company was sold to Exxon management.&lt;ref name="butabout"/&gt; Today the company is privately held, and headquartered in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="butabout"/&gt;

In 2012, Gamajet Cleaning Systems, Inc. was purchased by [[Alfa Laval]] to combine two global tank cleaning product lines, Gamajet and Toftejorg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winebusiness.com/suppliernews/?go=getSupplierNewsArticle&amp;dataId=104684&lt;/ref&gt; The tank cleaning segment operates in [[Exton, Pennsylvania]].

'''Polyethylene''' or '''polythene''' film [[biodegrade]]s naturally, albeit over a long period of time.  Methods are available to make it more degradable under certain conditions of [[sunlight]], [[moisture]], [[oxygen]], and [[composting]] and enhancement of biodegradation by reducing the hydrophobic polymer and increasing [[hydrophilic]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosphereplastic.com/services/ |title=Biodegradable Plastic enhancing hydrophilic properties. |publisher=Biosphere Plastic |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If traditional [[polyethylene]] film is [[litter]]ed it can be unsightly, and a hazard to wildlife.   Some people believe that making [[plastic shopping bag]]s biodegradable is one way to try to allow the open litter to degrade.

[[Plastic recycling]] improves usage of resources. Biodegradable films need to be kept away from the usual recycling stream to prevent contaminating the polymers to be recycled.

If disposed of in a sanitary [[landfill]], most traditional plastics do not readily decompose. The sterile conditions of a sealed landfill also deter degradation of biodegradable polymers.

Polyethylene is a [[polymer]] consisting of long chains of the monomer [[ethylene]] ([[IUPAC]] name ethene). The recommended scientific name polyethene is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer.[1] [2] In certain circumstances it is useful to use a structure–based nomenclature. In such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene).[2] The difference is due to the opening up of the monomer's double bond upon polymerisation.

In the polymer industry the name is sometimes shortened to PE in a manner similar to that by which other polymers like [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]] are shortened to PP and PS respectively. In the United Kingdom the polymer is commonly called polythene, although this is not recognised scientifically.

The ethene molecule (known almost universally by its common name ethylene) C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Two CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups connected by a [[double bond]], thus:
       
Polyethylene is created through [[polymerization]] of ethene. It can be produced through [[radical polymerization]], [[anionic addition polymerization]], ion coordination polymerization or cationic addition polymerization. This is because ethene does not have any substituent groups that influence the stability of the propagation head of the polymer. Each of these methods results in a different type of polyethylene.

== Types of biodegradable polythene film ==
{{prose|section|date=December 2016}}

Polythene or polyethylene film will naturally fragment and biodegrade, but it can take many decades to do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosphereplastic.com/microbes-that-degrade-plastic/biodegradable-plastic-and-the-microbes-behind-the-scenes/ |title=Microbes biodegrade aromatic hydrocarbons |publisher=Biosphere Plastic |date= |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two methods to resolve this problem.  One is to modify the carbon chain of polyethylene with an additive to improve its degradability and then its biodegradability; the other is to make a film with similar properties to polyethylene from a biodegradable substance such as starch.  The latter are however much more expensive.

=== Starch based or biobased (hydrodegradable) film ===
This type is made from corn (maize), potatoes or wheat. This form of biodegradable film meets the [[ASTM International|ASTM standard]] (American Standard for Testing Materials) and [[European Norm]] EN13432 for [[composting|compostability]] as it degrades at least 90% within 90 days or less at 140 degrees F. However, actual products made with this type of film may not meet those standards.

==== Examples of polymers made from starch ====
* [[Polycaprolactone]] (PCL)
* [[Polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVA)
* [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA)
The heat, moisture and aeration in an industrial composting plant are required for this type of film to biodegrade, so it will not therefore readily degrade if littered in the environment.

==== Pros &amp; cons of starch based film/bag ====
===== Pros =====
* It is "compostable" under industrial conditions.
* Reduced [[fossil fuel]] content (depending on loading of filler.)

===== Cons =====
* Much too expensive for use everyday
* Source of [[starch]] can be problematic (competition against food use, [[rainforests]] being cleared to grow crops for bioplastics)
* Fossil fuels are burned and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced in the agricultural production process.
* Poorer mechanical strength than additive based example – filling a [[starch]] bag with wet leaves and placing it curbside can result in the bottom falling out when a haulier picks it up.
* Often not strong enough for use in high-speed machines
* Degradation in a sealed landfill takes at least 6 months.
* Emits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in aerobic conditions and methane under anaerobic conditions
* Limited Shelf life. Conditions must be respected for stockage.
* If mixed with other plastics for recycling, the recycling process is compromised.

==== Typical applications ====
Carrier bag, refusal sacks, vegetable bags, food films, agricultural films, mailing films. However, these applications are still very limited compared to those of petroleum based plastic films.

== Additive based ==
Additives can be added to conventional polymers to make them either oxodegradable or more hydrophilic to facilitate microbial attack.

=== Oxodegradable ===
{{main|Oxo Biodegradable}}
These films are made by incorporating an additive within normal polymers to provide an oxidative and then a biological mechanism to degrade them. This typically takes 6 months to 1 year in the environment with adequate exposure to oxygen   Degradation is a two-stage process; first the plastic is converted by reaction with oxygen (light, heat and/or stress accelerates the process but is not essential) to hydrophilic low molecular-weight materials and then these smaller [[oxidized]] molecules are biodegraded, i.e. converted into [[carbon dioxide]], water and [[biomass]] by naturally occurring microorganisms. Commercial competitors and their trade associations allege that the process of biodegradation stops at a certain point, leaving fragments, but they have never established why or at what point. In fact Oxo-biodegradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. A peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation &amp; Stability (2011) at page 919-928. It shows 91% biodegradation in a [[soil]] environment within 24 months, when tested in accordance with ISO 17556.
This is similar to the breakdown of woody plant material where [[lignin]] is  broken down and forms a [[humus]] component improving the [[soil quality]]. 
There is however a lot of controversy about these types of bags. The complete biodegradation is disputed and claimed not to take place. Many countries are now also thinking to ban this type of bags altogether&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ows.be/news/oxo-degradable-plastics-do-they-biodegrade-in-search-of-a-definite-answer/ |title=Oxo-degradable plastics: do they biodegrade?

=== Enhancing hydrophilicity of the polymer ===
These films are inherently biodegradable over a long period of time. Enhancement of the polymer by adding in additives to change the hydrophobic nature of the resin to slightly hydrophilic allows microorganisms to consume the macromolecules of the product, these products often are confused with oxobiodegradable products, but work in a different way. Enhancing of the hydrophilicity of the polymer allows fungus and bacteria to consume the polymer at a faster rate utilizing the carbon inside the polymer chain for energy. These additives attract certain microorganisms found in nature and many tests have been completed on the mixing of synthetic and biobased materials which are inherently biodegradable for enhancing the biodegradability of synthetic polymers that are not as fast to biodegrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd0mppqL4tEC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Pcl/PE+biodegradable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v52hvMgKYB&amp;sig=Z1G4_aM0Poxv1FTtSA7gYr3UrIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QxlIUM71NYP7qAG-24GIAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pcl%2FPE%20biodegradable&amp;f=false |title= Biodegradable Polymers |publisher= By Jasim Ahmed, Brijesh K. Tiwari, Syed H. Imam |date= |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pros &amp; cons of additive based film/bag ====
===== Pros =====
* Much cheaper than starch-based plastics
* Can be made with normal machinery, and can be used in high speed machines, so no need to change suppliers and no loss of jobs
* Materials are well known
* Does not compete against food production
* These films look, act and perform just like their non-degradable counterparts, during their programmed service-life but then break down if discarded.
* They can be recycled with normal plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodeg.org/position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org |title=RECYCLING OF PLASTICS |publisher=Oxobiodegradable Plastics Association |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119200038/http://www.biodeg.org/position-papers/recycling/?domain=biodeg.org |archivedate=19 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They are certified non-toxic, and safe for food-contact
* Some bags degrade at about the same rate as a leaf. In fact, when used as bin liners, bags can start degrading after three or four days of being in the bin.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===== Cons =====
* Degradation depends on access to air
* Not designed to degrade in landfill, but can be safely landfilled. Will degrade if oxygen is present, but will NOT emit methane in landfill
* European or American (EN13432 D6400)Standards on [[compostable]] products are not appropriate, as not designed for composting.  They should be tested according to ASTM D6954 or (as from 1 Jan 1010) UAE norm 5009:2009
* They are not suitable for PET or PVC
* Precise rate of degradation/biodegradation cannot be predicted, but will be faster than nature's wastes such as straw or twigs, and much faster than normal plastic
* Like normal plastics they are made from a by-product of oil or natural gas
* If mixed with other plastics for recycling, the recycling process is compromised.

==== Typical applications ====
Trash Bags, Garbage Bags, Compost Bags, Carrier bag, Agricultural Film, Mulch Film, produce bags, - in fact all forms of short-life plastic film packaging

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
'''Biological naturalism''' is a theory about, among other things, the relationship between [[consciousness]] and [[Human body|body]] (i.e. [[Human brain|brain]]), and hence an approach to the [[mind–body problem]]. It was first proposed by the philosopher [[John Searle]] in 1980 and is defined by two main theses: 1) all [[mental event|mental phenomena]] from [[Pain and nociception|pains]], tickles, and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower-level [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes in the brain; and 2) mental phenomena are higher-level features of the brain.

This [[logical consequence|entails]] that the brain has the right [[causality|causal]] powers to produce [[intentionality]]. However, Searle's biological naturalism does not entail that brains and ''only'' brains can cause consciousness. Searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states, our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness. In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious. The brain is a [[biological machine]], and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it artificially." (Biological Naturalism, 2004)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Searle denies [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], the idea that the mind is a separate kind of substance to the body, as this contradicts our entire understanding of [[physics]], and unlike [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he does not bring [[God]] into the problem. Indeed, Searle denies any kind of dualism, the traditional alternative to monism, claiming the distinction is a mistake. He rejects the idea that because the mind is not objectively viewable, it does not fall under the rubric of physics.

Searle believes that consciousness "is a real part of the [[reality|real world]] and it cannot be [[Eliminative materialism|eliminated]] in favor of, or reduced to, something else"&lt;ref&gt; ''John R. Searle: Thinking about the Real World'' by Dirk Franken, Attila Karakus, and Jan G. Michel [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24715-john-r-searle-thinking-about-the-real-world/]&lt;/ref&gt; whether that something else is a neurological state of the brain or a [[computer program]]. He contends, for example, that the software known as [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] ''knows'' nothing about [[chess]]. He also believes that consciousness is both a cause of events in the body and a response to events in the body.

On the other hand, Searle doesn't treat consciousness as a [[ghost in the machine]]. He treats it, rather, as a state of the brain. The causal interaction of mind and brain can be described thus in naturalistic terms: Events at the micro-level (perhaps at that of individual [[neurons]]) cause consciousness. Changes at the macro-level (the whole brain) constitute consciousness. Micro-changes cause and then are impacted by holistic changes, in much the same way that individual football players cause a team (as a whole) to win games, causing the individuals to gain confidence from the knowledge that they are part of a winning team.

He articulates this distinction by pointing out that the common philosophical term 'reducible' is ambiguous.  Searle contends that consciousness is "causally reducible" to brain processes without being "ontologically reducible".  He hopes that making this distinction will allow him to escape the traditional dilemma between [[reductive materialism]] and substance dualism; he affirms the essentially physical nature of the universe by asserting that consciousness is completely caused by and realized in the brain, but also doesn't deny what he takes to be the obvious facts that humans really are conscious, and that conscious states have an essentially first-person nature.

It can be tempting to see the theory as a kind of [[property dualism]], since, in Searle's view, a person's mental properties are categorically different from his or her micro-physical properties. The latter have "third-person [[ontology]]" whereas the former have "first-person ontology." Micro-structure is accessible objectively by any number of people, as when several brain surgeons inspect a patient's [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. But pain or desire or [[belief]] are accessible subjectively by the person who has the pain or desire or belief, and no one else has that mode of access. However, Searle holds mental properties to be a species of physical property—ones with first-person ontology. So this sets his view apart from a dualism of physical and non-physical properties. His mental properties are putatively physical.

==Criticism==
There have been several criticisms of Searle's idea of biological naturalism.

[[Jerry Fodor]] suggests that Searle gives us no account at all of exactly ''why'' he believes that  a biochemistry like, or similar to, that of the human brain is indispensable for [[intentionality]]. Fodor thinks that it seems much more plausible to suppose that it is the way in which an organism (or any other system for that matter) is connected to its environment that is indispensable in the explanation of intentionality. It is easier to see "how the fact that my thought is causally connected to a tree might bear on its being a thought about a tree. But it's hard to imagine how the fact that (to put it crudely) my thought is made out of hydrocarbons could matter, except on the unlikely hypothesis that only hydrocarbons can be causally connected to trees in the way that brains are." &lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry. (1980) "Searle On What Only Brains Can Do". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;217–219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Haugeland]] takes on the central notion of some set of special "right causal powers" that Searle attributes to the biochemistry of the human brain. He asks us to imagine a concrete situation in which the "right" causal powers are those that our neurons have to reciprocally stimulate one another. In this case, silicon-based alien life forms can be intelligent just in case they have these "right" causal powers; i.e. they possess neurons with synaptics connections that have the power to reciprocally stimulate each other. Then we can take any speaker of the Chinese language and cover his neurons in some sort of wrapper which prevents them from being influenced by neurotransmitters and, hence, from having the right causal powers. At this point, "Searle's demon" (an English speaking nanobot, perhaps) sees what is happening and intervenes: he sees through the covering and determines which neurons would have been stimulated and which not and proceeds to stimulate the appropriate neurons and shut down the others himself. The experimental subject's behavior is unaffected. He continues to speak perfect Chinese as before the operation but now the causal powers of his neurotransmitters have been replaced by someone who does not understand the Chinese language. The point is generalizable: for any causal powers, it will always be possible to hypothetically replace them with some sort of Searlian demon which will carry out the operations mechanically. His conclusion is that Searle's is necessarily a dualistic view of the nature of causal powers, "not intrinsically connected with the actual powers of physical objects." &lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, John. (1980) "Artificial Intelligence". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle himself actually does not rule out the possibility for alternate arrangements of matter bringing forth consciousness other than biological brains. He also disputes that Biological naturalism is dualistic in nature in a brief essay entitled ''"Why I Am Not a Property Dualist"''.

'''Caramel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ə|m|ɛ|l}}, {{IPAc-en|'|k|ɛr|ə|m|ɛ|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|əl}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=3rd|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn= |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|year=2011|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=Boston |isbn= |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a medium to dark-orange [[confectionery]] product made by heating a variety of [[sugar]]s. It can be used as a flavoring in [[pudding]]s and [[dessert]]s, as a filling in [[bonbon]]s, or as a topping for [[ice cream]] and [[custard]].

The process of [[caramelization]] consists of heating sugar slowly to around {{convert|170|C}}. As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and re-form into compounds with a characteristic color and flavor.

A variety of [[Candy|candies]], [[dessert]]s, and confections are made with caramel: [[Brittle (food)|brittles]], [[nougat]]s, [[praline]]s, flan, [[crème brûlée]], [[crème caramel]], and [[caramel apple]]s. Ice creams sometimes are flavored with or contain swirls of caramel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Salted-Caramel-Ice-Cream-354517| title= Salted Caramel Ice Cream| author= CondeNet| work= Epicurious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The English word comes from French ''caramel'', borrowed from Spanish ''caramelo'' (18th century), itself possibly from Portuguese ''caramel''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', 5th edition, 2011, ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely that comes from Late Latin ''calamellus'' 'sugar cane', a diminutive of ''calamus'' 'reed, cane', itself from Greek κάλαμος. Less likely, it comes from a Medieval Latin ''cannamella'', from ''canna'' 'cane' + ''mella'' 'honey'.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1888, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/27703 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some dictionaries connect it to an Arabic ''kora-mokhalla'' 'ball of sweet'.&lt;ref&gt;Littré, ''[[Dictionnaire de la langue française]]'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The arguments are summarized in Paget Toynbee, "Cennamella"--"Caramel"--"Canamell", ''The Academy'', '''34''':864:[https://books.google.com/books?id=pjUZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA338 338], November 24, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caramel sauce==

Caramel sauce is made by mixing caramelized sugar with [[cream]].  Depending on the intended application, additional ingredients such as butter, fruit purees, [[liquor]]s, or [[vanilla]] can be used. Caramel sauce is used in a variety of desserts, though most notably as a topping for ice cream. When it is used for [[crème caramel]] or flan, it is known as clear caramel and only contains caramelized sugar and water. Butterscotch sauce is made with dark brown sugar, butter, and often a splash of [[whiskey]]. Traditionally, [[butterscotch]] is a hard candy more in line with a toffee, with the suffix "scotch" meaning "to score".

==Toffee== &lt;!-- Redirect "Caramels" links here --&gt;
[[File:Caramels.jpg|thumb|right|Milk caramel manufactured as square candies, either for eating or for melting down.]]
[[Toffee]], or in the US "caramel candy", is a soft, dense, chewy candy made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), [[corn syrup|glucose]], butter, and vanilla (or vanilla flavoring). The sugar and glucose are heated separately to reach {{convert|130|C|-1}}; the cream and butter are then added which cools the mixture.  The mixture is then stirred and reheated until it reaches {{convert|120|C|-1}}.  Upon completion of cooking, vanilla or any additional flavorings and salt are added.  Adding the vanilla or flavorings earlier would result in them burning off at the high temperatures.  Adding salt earlier in the process would result in [[Inverted sugar syrup|inverting the sugars]] as they cooked.

Alternatively, all ingredients may be cooked together.  In this procedure, the mixture is not heated above the [[firm ball]] stage ({{convert|120|C|-1|disp=sqbr}}), so that caramelization of the milk occurs. This temperature is not high enough to caramelize sugar and this type of candy is often called '''milk caramel''' or '''cream caramel'''.

==Salted caramel==
Salted caramel is a variety of caramel produced in the same way as regular caramel, but with larger amounts of salt added during preparation. Originally utilised in desserts, the confection has seen wide use elsewhere, including in [[hot chocolate]] and spirits such as [[vodka]]. A study conducted in 2017 by the [[University of Florida]] suggested that the popularity of salted caramel is due to its chemical composition, as all of its main ingredients have effects on the [[reward system]]s of the human brain, resulting in a process described as '[[hedonic escalation]]'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Sarah|title=Why you can't stop eating salted caramel, according to science|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/salted-caramel-not-stop-eating-science-university-florida-hedonic-sugar-fat-a8078296.html|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caramel colouring==
{{main|Caramel colour}}
Caramel colouring, a dark, bitter liquid, is the highly concentrated product of near total caramelization, used commercially as [[food colouring|food and beverage colouring]], ''e.g.'', in [[cola]].

==Chemistry==
{{main|Caramelization}}
Caramelization is the removal of water from a sugar, proceeding to [[isomerization]] and [[polymerization]] of the sugars into various high-molecular-weight compounds. Compounds such as di[[fructose]] [[Acid anhydride|anhydride]] may be created from the [[monosaccharide]]s after water loss. Fragmentation reactions result in low-molecular-weight compounds that may be volatile and may contribute to flavor. Polymerization reactions lead to larger-molecular-weight compounds that contribute to the dark-brown color.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/colour/caramel.htm|title=Caramelization|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern recipes and in commercial production, [[glucose]] (from [[corn syrup]] or [[wheat]]) or [[Inverted sugar syrup|invert sugar]] is added to prevent crystallization, making up 10%–50% of the sugars by mass. "Wet caramels" made by heating sucrose and water instead of sucrose alone produce their own invert sugar due to thermal reaction, but not necessarily enough to prevent crystallization in traditional recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRdocs/x5434e/x5434e0a.htm |title=6.

The '''ancient Chinese [[chariot]]''' was used as an attack and pursuit vehicle on the open fields and plains of Ancient [[China]] from around 1200 BCE. Chariots also allowed military commanders a mobile platform from which to control troops while providing archers and soldiers armed with [[dagger-axe]]s increased mobility.  They reached a peak of importance during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], but were largely superseded by [[cavalry]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].

==History==
Traditional sources attribute the invention of the chariot to the [[Xia dynasty]] minister [[Xi Zhong]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Xu Shen]], ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yupian]]'' Chariot Section (车部)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shiben]]''· Zuo Pian (作篇)&lt;/ref&gt; and say they were used at the Battle of Gan (甘之战) in the 21st century BCE.
However archeological evidence shows that small scale use of the chariot began around 1200 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Patricia Buckley |last1=Ebrey |first2=Anne |last2=Walthall |first3=James B. |last3=Palais |year=2006 |title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=978-0-618-13384-0 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Qin+heirs+Wen|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corroborates the material spread of the invention from the Eurasian Grass-Steppe to the West, by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] (likely the [[Tocharians]]) who similarly have borne horse, agricultural, and honey making technologies through the [[Tarim Basin]] into China. Contemporary [[oracle bone inscription]]s of the character {{lang|zh|車}} depict a chariot-like two wheeled vehicle with a single pole for the attachment of horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaughnessy |first=Edward L. |title=Historical Perspectives on The Introduction of The Chariot Into China |journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume=48 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=189–237 |jstor=2719276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariots continued to serve as command posts for officers during the Qin and Han Dynasties while armored chariots were also used by the [[Han Dynasty]] against the [[Xiongnu]] Confederation in the [[Han–Xiongnu War]], specifically at the [[Battle of Mobei]] in 119 CE.

With changes in the nature of warfare, as well as the increasing availability of larger breeds of [[horse]]s, during the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Dynasties (221 BCE- 220 CE) the chariot was replaced by cavalry and infantry, and the single-pole chariot became less important. At this time the double shaft chariot developed as a transport vehicle which was light and easy to handle. During the Eastern Han (25-220 CE) and later during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220-280 CE), the double shaft chariot was the predominant form. This change is seen in innumerable Han Dynasty stone carvings and in many ceramic tomb models. Over time, as society evolved, the early chariot of the Pre-Qin period gradually disappeared.&lt;ref name="Horse" /&gt;

==Construction==

Ancient Chinese chariots were typically two wheeled vehicles drawn by two or four horses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gernet|first=Jacques|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition 1996|isbn=0-521-49781-7}} p51&lt;/ref&gt; with a single draught pole measuring around 3 m long that was originally straight but later evolved into two curved shafts. At the front end of the pole there was a horizontal draw-bar about one metere long with wooden yokes attached, to which the horses would be harnessed. Wooden wheels with a diameter of between approximately 1.2 - 1.4 m were mounted on a three meter long axle and secured at each end with a bronze hubcap. Wheels of the Shang period usually had 18 spokes, but those of the Zhou period numbered from 18 to 26. Chariot wheels of the Spring and Autumn period (8th-7th century BCE) had between 25 and 28 spokes. The carriage body was around one metre long and 0.8 metres wide with wooden walls and an opening at the back to provide access for soldiers.&lt;ref name="Fierce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20080717/14974238.html|title=Fierce and effective weapons of Ancient China: Chariots and Chariot Warfare (中国古代战争的凶猛利器：古代战车及车战)|language=Chinese|accessdate=October 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024018/http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20080717/14974238.html#|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horse"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Chariot+and+horse+burials+in+ancient+China-a015143740|title=Chariot and horse burials in ancient China|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With the arrival of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE) improvements had been made to the chariot’s design and construction. The angle of the curved draw pole had increased raising the end of the pole. This reduced the amount of effort required by the horse pulling the chariot and increased its speed. The width of the carriage body had also increased to around 1.5 m allowing soldiers greater freedom of movement. Key components such as the pole, hubcap and yoke were reinforced with decorated copper castings, increasing the chariot’s stability and durability. These chariots were variously referred to as “gold chariots” (金车), “attack chariots” (攻车) or “weapons chariots”.( 戎车)&lt;ref name="Fierce" /&gt;

The Chinese war chariot, like the other war chariots of Eurasia, derived its characteristic ability to perform at high speed by a combination of a light design, together with a propulsion system using horses, which were the fastest draft animals available.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 53 (note: although Beckwith is making a general statement about war chariots in general, this also is explicitly tied to the Chinese war chariot elsewhere in the text)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Crew and weaponry==
[[File:Chariot axle, Warring States, Hubei Museum2.jpg|thumb|400px|Scythed Chinese chariot axle]]
Usually a chariot carried three armored warriors with different tasks: one, known as the charioteer (御者) was responsible for driving, a second, the archer (射) (or sometimes multiple archers (多射)) tasked with long range shooting. The ''róngyòu'' (戎右), whose role was short range defence, made up the third member of the crew.&lt;ref name="Fierce" /&gt; Weapons carried on the chariot consisted of close-combat and long range weapons.

The most important close-combat weapon aboard the chariot was the dagger-axe or ''gē'' (戈), a weapon with a roughly three meter shaft. At the end of the double-headed device there was a sharp dagger on one side and an axe head on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://bbs.sssc.cn/viewthread.php?tid=516916 |title=Weapons of the Warring States Period|language=Chinese|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was carried by the ''róngyòu'' and could be either swung or thrust like a spear at the enemy. By the time of the Spring and Autumn Period the ''gē'' had largely been superseded by the [[halberd]] or ''jĭ'' (戟) which had a spear blade at the end of the shaft in addition to the axe head and dagger.

All chariot commanders carried a bronze dagger for protection in the case of the chariot becoming unserviceable or an enemy jumping on board the chariot. Soldiers aboard wore leather or occasionally copper armour and carried a shield or ''dùn'' (盾) made from leather or bronze. The chariot’s archer was armed either a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] (''gōng'' 弓) or [[crossbow]] (''nŭ 弩'') for long distance attacks. Chariot horses also began to wear armor during the Spring and Autumn Period to protect against injury. When the chariot was not engaged in a military campaign it was used as a transport vehicle.

==Operational deployment==
The chariot was a large military vehicle that through its lack of flexibility was not effective as a single combat unit.&lt;ref name="Fierce" /&gt; Usually its commander would be allocated a number of infantrymen or ''tú zù'' (徒卒) to co-operate in battle. During the Western Zhou era, ten infantry were usually allocated to each chariot with five of them riding on the chariot, each of which was called a squadron (''duì'' 隊/队). Five squadrons made up a ''zhèngpiān'' (正偏), four ''zhèngpiān'' formed a division (''shī'' 师) while five divisions were known as an army (''jūn'' 军). In the Spring and Autumn Period the chariot became the main weapon of war. Along with each state's increase in military manpower, their proportion of chariots to overall army numbers also fell with the number of men allocated to each chariot increasing to seventy. This alteration fundamentally changed the fundamentals of warfare.&lt;ref name="Fierce" /&gt;

==Combat and tactical disposition==
In ancient China the chariot was used in a primary role from the time of the Shang Dynasty until the early years of the Han Dynasty (c. 1200–200 BCE) when it was replaced by cavalry and fell back into a secondary support role. For a millennium or more, every chariot borne soldier had used the particular combat tactics that use of the vehicle required.

Chariot based combat usually took place in wide-open spaces. When the two sides were within range they would first exchange arrow or crossbow fire, hoping that through superior numbers they would cause disorder and confusion in the enemy ranks. As the two opponents closed on each other they would stay about four meters apart to avoid the three meter long dagger-axes of their opponents. Only when two chariots came closer than this would an actual fight occur.

Only about three meters wide, with infantry riding on both sides, the chariot was highly inflexible as a fighting machine and difficult to turn around. Coupled with this were restrictions on the use of weapons with opponents seizing the momentary opportunity for victory or trapping their opponent with a pincer movement. These tactics required fighting in tight formation with good military discipline and control.
When the Spring and Autumn period began, more attention was paid to troop formations according to the type of battle. Chariot units were trained to ensure co-ordination with the rest of the army during a military campaign.

During the Western Zhou Era, chariots were deployed on wide open plains abreast of each other in a single line. The accompanying infantry would then be deployed forward of the chariot, a broad formation that denied the enemy the opportunity for pincer attacks. When the two sides clashed, if the chariots remained in strict formation there would be a good opportunity to encircle the enemy. During this period of chariot warfare, the use of orderly team-based combat to some extent determined the difference between victory and defeat, otherwise fighting would have to stop in order to consolidate the formation. In this type operation unified command was important. Senior officers would use drums and flags to command the army's advance and retreat, speed and to make formation adjustments. However such operations were inherently very slow paced and the speed of engagement thus hampered. Furthermore, the infantry had to remain in line which was not conducive to long-distance pursuits of retreating enemies.

A typical example of the importance of disciplined forces occurred during the Zhou overthrow of Shang at the decisive [[Battle of Muye]] in 1046 BCE. As the Zhou army moved forward, the infantry and chariots were commanded to stop and regroup after every six or seven steps to maintain formation. The Shang army, despite its superior numbers, was largely composed of demoralized and forcibly conscripted troops. As a result, the troops failed to stay in formation and were defeated.&lt;ref name="Fierce" /&gt;

As the Spring and Autumn period dawned, chariots remained the key to victory. At the [[Battle of Yanling]] in 575 BCE between the States of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] the disorganised nature of the Chu army's chariots and infantry led to its defeat. Both troop formations and the flexibility of the chariot subsequently underwent major developments with infantry placing a much larger role in combat. Troops were no longer deployed forward of chariots but instead around all four sides thereby increasing the vehicle's flexibility. Formations no longer involved a single line of chariots; instead they were spread out which brought the advantage of depth. In this way the chariot's movement was no longer impeded so it could counter enemy attacks as well as provide a fast pursuit vehicle.

'''Compressive strength''' or '''compression strength''' is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size, as opposed to [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]], which withstands loads tending to elongate. In other words, compressive strength resists [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (being pushed together), whereas tensile strength resists [[Tension (physics)|tension]] (being pulled apart). In the study of [[strength of materials]], tensile strength, compressive strength, and [[shear strength]] can be analyzed independently.

Some materials fracture at their compressive strength limit; others deform irreversibly, so a given amount of deformation may be considered as the limit for compressive load. Compressive strength is a key value for design of structures.

Compressive strength is often measured on a [[universal testing machine]]; these range from very small table-top systems to ones with over 53 [[Newton (unit)|MN]] capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

When a specimen of material is loaded in such a way that it extends it is said to be in ''tension''. On the other hand, if the material [[compression (physical)|compresses]] and shortens it is said to be in ''compression''.

On an atomic level, the molecules or [[atoms]] are forced apart when in tension whereas in compression they are forced together. Since atoms in solids always try to find an equilibrium position, and distance between other atoms, forces arise throughout the entire material which oppose both tension or compression. The phenomena prevailing on an atomic level are therefore similar.

The "strain" is the relative change in length under applied stress; positive strain characterises an object under tension load which tends to lengthen it, and a compressive stress that shortens an object gives negative strain. Tension tends to pull small sideways deflections back into alignment, while compression tends to amplify such deflection into [[buckling]].

Compressive strength is measured on materials, components,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

By definition, the ultimate compressive strength of a material is that value of uniaxial [[compressive stress]] reached when the material fails completely. The compressive strength is usually obtained experimentally by means of a ''compressive test''. The apparatus used for this experiment is the same as that used in a tensile test. However, rather than applying a uniaxial tensile load, a uniaxial compressive load is applied. As can be imagined, the specimen (usually cylindrical) is shortened as well as spread [[wiktionary:lateral|laterally]]. A [[stress–strain curve]] is plotted by the instrument and would look similar to the following:
[[File:engineering stress strain.svg|thumb|left|True Stress-Strain curve for a typical specimen]]

The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve.  In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows [[Hooke's law]].  Hence, for this region, ''&lt;math&gt;\sigma=E\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;'', where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression. In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

This linear region terminates at what is known as the [[yield point]]. Above this point the material behaves [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] and will not return to its original length once the load is removed.

There is a difference between the engineering stress and the true stress. By its basic definition the uniaxial stress is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where,
F = Load applied [N],
A = Area [m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]

As stated, the area of the specimen varies on compression. In reality therefore the area is some function of the applied load i.e. A = f(F). Indeed, stress is defined as the force divided by the area at the start of the experiment. This is known as the engineering stress and is defined by,

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_e = \frac{F}{A_0}&lt;/math&gt;

A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=Original specimen area [m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]

Correspondingly, the engineering [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] would be defined by:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_e = \frac{l-l_0}{l_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
l = current specimen length [m] and l&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = original specimen length [m]

The compressive strength would therefore correspond to the point on the engineering stress strain curve &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_e^*,\sigma_e^*)&lt;/math&gt; defined by

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_e^* = \frac{F^*}{A_0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_e^* = \frac{l^*-l_0}{l_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
F&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = load applied just before crushing and l&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = specimen length just before crushing.

== Deviation of engineering stress from true stress ==
[[File:Barelling.svg|75px|thumb|Barrelling]]

In engineering design practice, professionals mostly rely on the engineering stress. In reality, the ''true stress'' is different from the engineering stress. Hence calculating the compressive strength of a material from the given equations will not yield an accurate result.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} This is because the cross sectional area A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; changes and is some function of load A = φ(F).

The difference in values may therefore be summarized as follows:
* On compression, the specimen will shorten. The material will tend to spread in the lateral direction and hence increase the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] area.
* In a compression test the specimen is clamped at the edges.{{dubious|date=January 2016}} For this reason, a frictional force arises which will oppose the lateral spread. This means that work has to be done to oppose this frictional force hence increasing the energy consumed during the process. This results in a slightly inaccurate value of stress obtained from the experiment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

As a final note, it should be mentioned that the frictional force mentioned in the second point is not constant for the entire cross section of the specimen. It varies from a minimum at the centre, away from the clamps, to a maximum at the edges where it is clamped. Due to this, a phenomenon known as ''barrelling'' occurs where the specimen attains a barrel shape.

== Comparison of compressive and tensile strengths ==
Concrete and ceramics typically have much higher compressive strengths than tensile strengths. Composite materials, such as glass fiber epoxy matrix composite, tend to have higher tensile strengths than compressive strengths. Metals tend to have tensile and compressive strengths that are very similar.

== Compressive Strength of Concrete ==
For designers, compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of [[concrete]]. It is a standard industrial practice that the concrete is classified based on grades. This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or cylinder. Cube or Cylinder samples are usually tested under a compression testing machine to obtain the compressive strength of concrete. The test requisites differ country to country based on the design code. As per Indian codes, compressive strength of concrete is defined as 

''The '''compressive strength of concrete''' is given in terms of the '''characteristic compressive strength''' of 150 mm size cubes tested at 28 days (fck). The '''characteristic strength''' is defined as the '''strength''' of the '''concrete''' below which not more than 5% of the test results are expected to fall.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civildigital.com/compressive-strength-concrete-concrete-cubes/|title=Compressive Strength of Concrete &amp; Concrete Cubes {{!}} What {{!}} How {{!}} CivilDigital {{!}}|date=2016-07-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For design purposes, this compressive strength value is restricted by dividing with a factor of safety, whose value depends on the design philosophy used.

[[File:Zaca3.jpg|thumb|The [[Zaca Fire]] in 2007, one of the largest fires in [[California]]'s history]]

A '''conflagration''' is a large and destructive [[fire]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., "Conflagration"&lt;/ref&gt; that threatens human life, animal life, health, and/or property. It may also be described as a '''blaze''' or simply a (large) '''fire'''. A conflagration can begin accidentally, be naturally caused ([[wildfire]]), or intentionally created ([[arson]]). Arson can be for fraud, murder, sabotage or diversion, or due to a person's [[pyromania]]. A very large fire can produce a [[firestorm]], in which the central column of rising heated air induces strong inward winds, which supply [[oxygen]] to the fire.  Conflagrations can cause [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] including deaths or injuries from [[burn]]s, [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] due to collapse of structures and attempts to escape, and [[smoke inhalation]].

[[Firefighting]] is the practice of attempting to extinguish a conflagration, protect life and property, and minimize damage and injury.  One of the goals of [[fire prevention]] is to avoid conflagrations.  When a conflagration is extinguished, there is often a [[fire investigation]] to determine the cause of the fire.

During a conflagration a significant movement of air and combustion products occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conflagration|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/conflagration.htm|website=tititudorancea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot gaseous products of combustion move upward, causing the influx of more dense cold air to the combustion zone. Sometimes, the influx is so intense that the fire grows into a firestorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California wildfires rage, north and south, killing at least nine and putting tens of thousands at risk |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/deadly-california-wildfires-rage-north-and-south-destroying-paradise-putting-tens-of-thousands-at-risk/2018/11/09/19b0e2e8-e45a-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html?utm_term=.586b20513966&amp;wpisrc=nl_rainbow&amp;wpmm=1 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Inside a building, the intensity of gas exchange depends on the size and location of openings in walls and floors, the ceiling height, and the amount and characteristics of the combustible materials.

===Types===
*'''Industrial conflagrations''' include fires at [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], such as the 2009 [[Cataño oil refinery fire]].
*One or several fire(s) in [[forest]]s or other wilderness areas, i.e. [[Wildfire|wildfire(s)]], may grow up into or unite to a conflagration.
*An '''urban conflagration''' is defined as a "large, destructive fire that spreads beyond natural or artificial barriers; it can be expected to result in large monetary loss and may or may not include fatalities...An urban conflagration moves beyond a block and destroys whole sections of a city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=-lbqlnWXhLEC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=FrbfImvEvP&amp;dq=%22urban%20conflagration%22&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=%22urban%20conflagration%22&amp;f=true|title=Disaster Planning and Control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In some ships, a large uncontained fire may quickly lead to a '''ship conflagration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=2487 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010450/http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=2487 |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The conflagration of a building is known as a [[structure fire]].
*An asteroid more than {{convert|4.3|mi|km}} in diameter colliding with the [[Earth]], spewing out enough [[ejecta]] to cause a global conflagration.

The '''Council for Registered Gas Installers''' ('''CORGI''') operates a voluntary registration scheme for gas installers in the United Kingdom. From 1991 to 2009 registration with CORGI was a legal requirement for gas operatives and businesses throughout the UK, and before April 2010 in Northern Ireland [https://web.archive.org/web/20101122173154/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/about/gas_safety_in_northern_ireland.aspx] and [[Guernsey]] [https://archive.is/20130420060508/http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/about/what_is_the_gas_safe_register.aspx].

CORGI registration requires (beside payment of fees) that gas operatives hold a certificate of competence under the [[Accredited Certification Scheme]] (ACS) demonstrating an appropriate level of competence and experience in particular types of gas work. The ACS replaced a number of different certification schemes in 1998.

CORGI lost its status as official registration body in England, Scotland and Wales on 1 April 2009 and in Northern Ireland and Guernsey [https://archive.is/20130420060508/http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/about/what_is_the_gas_safe_register.aspx] in April 2010, with this role being taken on by the [[Gas Safe Register]], run on behalf of the [[Health and Safety Executive]] by [[Capita Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gas Safe Register|title=Public Safety Top Priority for New Gas Safe Register|date=2009-02-02|url=https://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/PressReleases/PressRelease143.htm}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
CORGI was originally established in 1970 as the ''Confederation for the Registration of Gas Installers'' to operate a voluntary register. This followed a gas [[explosion]] in 1968 which led to the partial collapse of [[Ronan Point]], a tower block in London. 

Notwithstanding [[gas explosion]]s, the greatest danger to the public in using gas is from [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), which is a highly toxic by-product of the [[combustion]] process. Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on avoiding excessive production of CO through adequate [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and correct combustion, and the safe dispersal of the small amounts produced by correct combustion through effective [[flue]] systems. Modern room-sealed gas appliances are much safer in this respect and the number of fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined. Each year in the UK around 30 people are killed as a result of CO poisoning.

==Previous responsibilities==
Registration with CORGI was a legal requirement under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 for any gas installation business and there were around 55,000 CORGI registered businesses in the UK employing nearly 110,000 gas operatives.

CORGI was answerable to the [[Health and Safety Executive]], which is the Government watchdog on all safety issues, including gas. The HSE has the authority to appoint CORGI and/or other agencies to operate the Register of Gas Installers. In 2006 another body (NAPIT) made an application to the HSE to operate a rival registration scheme. This application was turned down by the Health and Safety Executive. It is the CORGI view - a view that is supported by many other organisations too such as the All Party Parliamentary Gas Safety Group - that introducing another gas registration body would cause confusion. However some registered gas installers believe that CORGI's decision to run schemes for plumbing, electrics and ventilation will itself create public confusion, as well as taking away its focus from the prime consideration of gas safety. However, CORGI has been clear that gas safety is at the core of its business and will remain so. CORGI realises that gas installers often do jobs other than just gas and the decision to offer plumbing, electrical and ventilation schemes was made to help installers that are CORGI registered for gas to comply with Building Regulations in areas closely related to gas work.

== Controversy ==
Some gas installers, primarily individual, independent installers through associations such as ARGI (Association of Registered Gas Installers) felt that the organisation was overbearing and an excessive financial burden, and that little was being done to stop unregistered installers operating{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} and that they were not being supported by or listened to by the organisation. There were also concerns that it abused its monopolistic position as the sole awarding body for UK gas installers.  The reality was, that CORGI used the customer and installer data to sell products and services (initially by including a sales booklet along with the Installation certificate sent to the customer), which is contrary to their remit for the care of that data (data protection).

==CORGI Trust==
In 2005, CORGI set up the CORGI Trust, which sees all profits from the commercial side of the business being donated to the Trust. These funds will then be used to help advance gas safety within the UK. Recommendations for the use of these funds has ranged from getting the Government to change the law so that only CORGI registered installers can buy gas appliances, through to doing a national television campaign to increase awareness on the need for customers to only use CORGI registered installers and the dangers of carbon monoxide.

==Gas Safe Register==
[http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/about/overview.aspx Gas Safe Register] is the official gas registration body for the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Guernsey, appointed by the relevant Health and Safety Authority for each area. By law all gas engineers must be on the Gas Safe Register. 
Gas Safe Register replaced CORGI as the gas registration body in Great Britain and Isle of Man on 1 April 2009 and Northern Ireland and Guernsey on 1 April 2010.

Gas Safe Register work to protect the public from unsafe gas work through;

* a dedicated national investigations team tracking down individuals working illegally
* regular inspections of Gas Safe registered engineers
* educating consumers and raising awareness of gas safety
* investigating reports of unsafe gas work


Gas Safe Register is run by Capita Gas Registration and Ancillary Services Limited, a division of Capita Plc.

'''Crimson ''' is a strong, [[red]] color, inclining to [[purple]]. It originally meant the [[color]] of the [[kermes (dye)|kermes dye]] produced from a [[scale insect]], ''[[Kermes vermilio]]'', but the name is now sometimes also used as a generic term for slightly bluish-red colors that are between red and [[rose (color)|rose]].

== History ==

'''Crimson''' (NR4) is produced using the dried bodies of the [[Kermes (genus)|kermes]] insect, which were gathered commercially in Mediterranean countries, where they live on the [[kermes oak]], and sold throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturenet.net/blogs/2009/01/the-prickly-question-of-oak-leaves/ Naturenet article with images and description of ''Kermes vermilio'' and its foodplant]&lt;/ref&gt; Kermes dyes have been found in burial wrappings in Anglo-Scandinavian [[York]]. They fell out of use with the introduction of [[cochineal]], because although the dyes were comparable in quality and color intensity it needed ten to twelve times as much kermes to produce the same effect as cochineal.

'''[[Carmine]]''' is the name given to the dye made from the dried bodies of the female cochineal, although the name '''crimson''' is sometimes applied to these dyes too. Cochineal appears to have been brought to Europe during the conquest of [[Mexico]] by the Spaniard [[Hernán Cortés]], and the name 'carmine' is derived from the French ''carmin''. It was first described by Mathioli in 1549. The pigment is also called ''cochineal'' after the insect from which it is made.

'''[[Alizarin]]''' (PR83) is a pigment that was  first synthesized in  1868 by the German [[chemist]]s [[Carl Gräbe]] and [[Carl Liebermann]] and replaced the natural pigment [[madder lake]]. Alizarin crimson is a dye bonded onto [[alum]] which is then used as a pigment and mixed with [[ochre]], [[sienna]] and [[umber]]. It is not totally colorfast.

== Etymology ==

The word ''crimson'' has been recorded in English since 1400,&lt;ref&gt;The first recorded use of ''crimson'' as a color name in English was in 1400 according to the following book: Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930--McGraw Hill Page 193; Color Sample of Crimson: Page 31 Plate 4 Color Sample K6&lt;/ref&gt; and its earlier forms include ''cremesin'', ''crymysyn'' and ''cramoysin'' (cf. cramoisy, a crimson cloth). These were adapted via [[Old Spanish]] from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''cremesinus'' (also ''kermesinus'' or ''carmesinus''), the dye produced from ''[[Kermes (genus)|Kermes]]'' scale insects, and can be traced back to Arabic ''qermez'' ("red"), also borrowed in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''kırmızı'' and many other languages, e.g. German ''Karmesin'', Italian ''cremisi'', French ''cramoisi'', Portuguese ''carmesim'', etc. (via Latin). The ultimate source may be Sanskrit कृमिज ''kṛmi-jā'' meaning "worm-made".&lt;ref&gt;"American Heritage Dictionary", s.v. ''Kermes''; also [[Friedrich Kluge|Kluge]], "Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache", s.v. ''Karmesin'', et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

A shortened form of ''carmesinus'' also gave the Latin ''carminus'', from which comes [[carmine]].

Other cognates include the Persian ''qermez'' (or ''ghermez'') "red", [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''čruminu'', archaic [[Russian language|Russian]] чермный (''čermnyj''), and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''crven'' "red". Cf. also [[vermilion]].

== Dyes ==
{{Main article|Carmine|Kermes (dye)}}
[[File:Carminic acid structure.png|thumb|right|Carminic acid]]

Carmine [[natural dye|dyes]], which give crimson and related red and purple colors, are based on an [[aluminium]] and [[calcium]] [[salt]] of [[carminic acid]]. '''Carmine lake''' is an aluminium or aluminium-tin [[lake pigment|lake]] of cochineal extract, and '''crimson lake''' is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 [[percent]] [[solution]] of [[alum]] and [[Potassium tartrate|cream of tartar]]. '''Purple lake''' is prepared like carmine lake with the addition of [[calcium oxide|lime]] to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.

Carmine dyes were once widely prized in both the Americas and in Europe. They were used in paints by [[Michelangelo]] and for the crimson fabrics of the [[Hussars]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the [[Red coat (British army)|British Redcoats]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].

Nowadays carmine dyes are used for coloring foodstuffs, medicines and cosmetics. As a [[food additive]] in the European Union, carmine dyes are designated [[Carmine|E120]], and are also called '''cochineal''' and '''Natural Red 4'''. Carmine dyes are also used in some [[oil paint]]s and [[watercolor]]s used by artists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">A '''design basis event''' (DBE) is a postulated event used to establish the acceptable performance requirements of the structures, systems, and components, such that a [[Nuclear power plant]] can withstand the event and not endanger the health or safety of the plant operators or the wider public.  Similar terms are '''design basis accident''' (DBA) and '''maximum credible accident'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/design-basis-accident.html|title=NRC: Glossary -- Design-basis accident|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/d/designbasisaccident.htm|title=Design basis accident|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[European Nuclear Society]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtypes of DBEs are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearglossary.com/abcs/nuclearglossary_D.html#design_basis_accident|title=An Exceptional Nuclear Glossary|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* design-basis [[criticality accident|criticality]]: "A criticality accident that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration."
* design-basis [[earthquake]] (DBE): "That earthquake for which the safety systems are designed to remain functional both during and after the event, thus assuring the ability to shut down and maintain a safe configuration."
* design-basis [[explosion]]: "An explosion that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration."
* design-basis [[fire]]: "A fire that is the most severe design basis accident of this type. In postulating such a fire, failure of automatic and manual fire suppression provisions shall be assumed except for those safety class items or systems that are specifically designed to remain available (structurally or functionally) through the event."
* design-basis [[flood]]: "A flood that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration."
* design-basis [[tornado]] (DBT): "A tornado that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration."

Circumstances like the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were not considered within the design basis of the plant, and so the resulting [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] were described using this terminology as "beyond design basis" or "non-design-basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/beyond-design-basis-accidents.html|title=NRC: Glossary -- Beyond design-basis accidents|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some have claimed that the design basis for tsunami events at Fukushima was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;http://carnegieendowment.org/files/fukushima.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accidents caused by poor design, failure to follow listed safety procedures, or other forms of [[human error]] are not considered to be beyond design basis accidents. The terminology can be unclear, however, because a poorly handled design basis accident can result in conditions beyond what was considered likely, causing a beyond design basis accident. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacre.web.psi.ch/ISAMM2009/oecd-sami2001/Papers/p15-Ungetuem/BDB%20Acc.Management.pdf|title=Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI)|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, some industry experts have criticized the use of design basis terminology. The [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] are examples of design basis accidents becoming non design basis accidents largely due to failures to follow the written operating procedures.

==Beyond-design-basis events== 
Beyond-design-basis events can reduce or eliminate the [[safety factor|margin of safety]] of the structures, systems and components, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure. &lt;ref&gt; Neil E. Todreas, ''Nuclear Systems:Elements of Thermal Design, Volume 2'', CRC Press 1992, {{ISBN|1560320885}};   page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] was caused by a "beyond-design-basis event," the tsunami and associated earthquakes were more powerful than the plant was designed to accommodate.  The plant was withstood the earthquake but the tsunami overflowed the seawall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1388629/Japan-tsunami-destroyed-wall-designed-protect-Fukushima-nuclear-plant.html|title=Genesis of a disaster: Moment tsunami swamps Japan's doomed Fukushima nuclear plant|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the possibility of unforeseen beyond design basis events has been a major concern for plant operators.&lt;ref name=Declanbutler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110421/full/472400a.html |title=Reactors, residents and risk |author=Declan Butler |date=21 April 2011 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44770">'''Engine power''' or '''horsepower''' is the maximum [[power (physics)|power]] that an engine can put out. It can be expressed in [[kilowatt]]s or [[horsepower]]. The power output depends on the size and design of the engine, but also on the speed at which it is running and the [[mechanical load|load]] or [[torque]]. Maximum power is achieved at relatively high speeds and at high load.

===Performance luxury, roadsters and mild sports, (listed as weight to power)===
Increased engine performance is a consideration, but also other features associated with [[luxury vehicle]]s. [[Longitudinal engine]]s are common. Bodies vary from [[hot hatch]]es, [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans (saloons)]], [[coupé]]s, [[Convertible (car)|convertibles]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]]. Mid-range [[Dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] and [[Cruiser (motorcycle)|cruiser]] motorcycles tend to have similar power-to-weight ratios.

'''Ethylene bis stearamide''' (EBS) is an organic compound with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHC(O)C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a waxy white solid and is also found as powder or beads that is widely used as a form [[release agent]].  The compound is derived from the reaction of [[ethylenediamine]] and [[stearic acid]].  It is a white solid of low toxicity that provides a slippery coating for a variety of applications.

==Applications==
EBS is a synthetic wax used as a [[dispersing agent]] or internal/external [[lubricant]] for benefits in plastic applications to facilitate and stabilize the dispersion of solid compounding materials to enhance processability, to decrease [[friction]] and [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] of the [[polymer]] surface, and to contribute color stability and [[polymer degradation]].

It is also used in [[process industries]] as [[release agent]], [[antistatic agent]] and [[antifoaming agent]] for the production of thermoplastics, wiring, and paper.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut Höke "Amines, Aliphatic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used in powder metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Auborn, Joseph; Choo, Joon "Mechanisms of lubrication in powder metallurgy" Advances in Powder Metallurgy &amp; Particulate Materials (1993), Volume 2, Compaction, Sintering and Secondary Operations), 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Granville Tailer Woods''' (April 23, 1856 &amp;ndash; January 30, 1910) was an [[United States|American]] inventor who held more than 50 patents.&lt;ref&gt;“Granville Woods”, ''[http://www.blackinventor.com/pages/granville-woods.html The Black Inventor On-Line Museum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the first American of African ancestry to be a mechanical and electrical engineer after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95060876/1912-05-09/ed-1/seq-2/;words=Woods+T+Granville?date1=1836&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=Granville+T.+Woods&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=13 “Interesting Statistics of the Colored Race”], ''Arizona sentinel and Yuma weekly examiner'' (Yuma, Arizona, USA), Thursday, 9 May 1912, page 2, column 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-taught, he concentrated most of his work on [[train]]s and [[Streetcar|streetcars]].  One of his notable inventions was the Multiplex Telegraph, a device that sent messages between train stations and moving trains. His work assured a safer and better public transportation system for the cities of the United States.
&lt;!--
Everything from this point to the ==References== section needs to be reconciled against the revision history and reference sources to repair extensive vandalism. EVERY SENTENCE IN THE CURRENT CONTENT IS SUSPECT (as of 8 February 2008). Revised, but deleted many statements as I was cleaning as the sole source is very unreliable and is to the point where parts of it are patently false, such as stating Woods studied electrical parts before the 20th century, which is impossible, among many other examples. 2006---&gt;

==Early life==
Granville T. Woods was born to Martha J. Brown and Cyrus Woods. He also had a brother named Lyates.&lt;ref&gt;Abiola Sinclair, "Black Man and the Railroad." (New York) Amsterdam News, February 23, 1991, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was part Native American, and his father was African American.&lt;ref&gt;"Granville T. Woods, Electrician and Mechanical Engineer." Indianapolis (IN) Freeman, February 16, 1856, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Granville attended school in Columbus until age 10, but had to leave due to his family's poverty, which meant he needed to work;&lt;ref&gt;Dwayne A. Cotton, "Granville T. Woods: The Black Thomas Edison." Norfolk (VA) New Journal and Guide, July 17, 1985, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; he served an apprenticeship in a machine shop and learned the trades of machinist and blacksmith. Some sources of his day asserted that he also received two years of college-level training in "electrical and mechanical engineering," but little is known about where he might have studied.&lt;ref&gt;"Granville T. Woods, the First Colored Electrician." New Orleans Weekly Pelican, November 5, 1887, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1872, Woods obtained a job as a fireman on the Danville and Southern Railroad in Missouri, eventually becoming an engineer. In December 1874, he moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], and worked at a rolling mill, the Springfield Iron Works. He studied mechanical and electrical engineering in college from 1876-1878.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons (1887), p108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, he took a job aboard the "Ironsides", and, within two years, became Chief Engineer of the steamer. When he returned to Ohio, he became an engineer with the Dayton and Southwestern Railroad in southwestern Ohio. In 1880, he moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and established his business as an electrical engineer and an inventor. After receiving the patent for the multiplex telegraph, he reorganized his Cincinnati company as the Woods Electric Co, but in 1892 he moved his own research operations to New York City, where he was joined by a brother, Lyates Woods, who also had several inventions of his own.&lt;ref&gt;“Granville T. Woods.biography”, ''[http://www.biography.com/people/granville-t-woods-9536481 bio.true story]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some internet sources claim he was married.  However, the newspapers of his day generally referred to him as a "bachelor." &lt;ref&gt;Abiola Sinclair, "Black Man and the Railroad." (New York) Amsterdam News, February 23, 1991, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The one indication that he had been married at some point was a brief mention in 1891 that said he was being sued for divorce by a woman identified as Ada Woods. &lt;ref&gt; "Duluth, Minn." Saint Paul (MN) Appeal, May 2, 1891, p. 1. &lt;/ref&gt; But while little more was said of his personal life, Granville T. Woods was often described as an articulate and well-spoken man, as well as meticulous and stylish in his choice of clothing, and a man who preferred to dress in black.&lt;ref&gt;"Black Edison." Kansas City (KS) American Citizen, May 9, 1902, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, he would refer to himself as an immigrant from Australia,&lt;ref&gt;"Granville F. Woods." Coffeyville (KS) Afro-American Advocate, April 29, 1892, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; in the belief that he would be given more respect if people thought he was from a foreign country, as opposed to being an African American.  In his day, the black newspapers frequently expressed their pride in his achievements, saying he was "the greatest of Negro inventors",&lt;ref&gt;"Patents to Negroes," Indianapolis (IN) Freeman, October 17, 1908, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even calling him "professor," although there is no evidence he ever received a college degree.

==Inventions==
Woods invented and patented Tunnel Construction for the electric railroad system, and was referred to by some as the "Black Edison."&lt;ref&gt;“ ‘Black Edison’s’ Patents”, ''Boston Sunday Journal'' (Boston, Massachusetts), Sunday, 20 April 1902, p. 2, col. 4; “‘Black Edison’”, ''The American Citizen'' (Kansas City, Kansas), p. 1, col. 1-2; “The ‘Black Edison’”, ''The Evening Press'' (Grand Rapids, Michigan), Saturday, 7 June 1902, p. 10, col. 2; Henry E. Baker, [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83027091/1903-11-14/ed-1/seq-3/ “Inventions of the Negro”], ''The Colored American'' (Washington, D.C.), Saturday, 14 November 1903, p. 3, col. 3, reprinted from ''The New York Evening Post'' (New York City); Daniel Murray, [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84025811/1904-12-30/ed-1/seq-2/ “Color Problem in the United States”], ''The Seattle Republican'' (Seattle, Washington), Friday, 30 December 1904,  p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, Woods patented an apparatus which was a combination of a [[telephone]] and a [[telegraph]]. The device, which he called "telegraphony", would allow a telegraph station to send voice and telegraph messages over a single wire. He sold the rights to this device to the [[American Bell Telephone Company]]. In 1887, he patented the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph which allowed communications between train stations from moving trains, a technology pioneered by [[Lucius Phelps]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Joshua Phelps is the father of [[Earle B. Phelps]] (1876—1953), the American chemist, bacteriologist and sanitation expert whose biography appears in the English Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1884.

[[Thomas Edison]] later filed a claim to the ownership of this patent.&lt;ref&gt;Lucius. J[oshua]. Phelps, “Communicating to and from Moving Vehicles by Electricity”, [http://ip.com/pat/US307984 U.S. Patent No. 307,984], patented 11 November 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, Woods manufactured a system of overhead electric conducting lines for railroads modeled after the system pioneered by [[Charles van Depoele]], a famed inventor who had by then installed his electric railway system in thirteen U.S. cities. In 1889, he filed a patent for an improvement to the steam-boiler furnace.

Granville Woods often had difficulties in enjoying his success as other inventors made claims to his devices. Thomas Edison made one of these claims, stating that he had first created a similar telegraph and that he was entitled to the patent for the device. Woods was twice successful in defending himself, proving that there were no other devices upon which he could have depended or relied upon to make his device. After [[Thomas Edison]]'s second defeat, he decided to offer Granville Woods a position with the Edison Company, but Granville declined.

Woods is sometimes credited with the invention of the electric [[third rail]], however, many third rail systems were in place in both Europe and North America at the time Woods filed for his [[patent]] in 1901. Thomas Edison had been awarded a patent for the third rail almost two decades earlier, in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A[lva]. Edison, “Electric Magnetic Railway”, U.S. Patent No. [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=263132 263,132], patented 22 August 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods is also sometimes credited with the invention of the [[Railway air brake|air brake]] in 1904 for trains, however, [[George Westinghouse]] patented the air brake almost 40 years prior.&lt;ref&gt;George Westinghouse, Jr., “Steam Power Brake”, U.S. Patent No. [http://www.patent-invent.com/air_brake_patent.html 889,929], patented 13 April 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his lifetime Granville Woods would obtain more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake and an egg incubator and for improvements to other inventions such as safety circuits, telegraph, telephone, and phonograph. He died on January 30, 1910 in New York City, having sold a number of his devices to such companies as Westinghouse, General Electric and American Engineering.  Until 1975, his resting place was an unmarked grave, but historian M.A. Harris helped to raise funds, and persuaded several of the corporations that used Woods's inventions to donate towards a headstone.  It was erected at St. Michael's Cemetery in Elmhurst, Queens NY.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Campbell. "Tribute Paid to Black Inventor."  New York Times, April 24, 1975, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baltimore City Community College]] established the Granville T Woods scholarship in memory of the inventor.

The '''Highland Wind Project''' is a large [[wind power]] project in [[O'Brien County, Iowa]]. The 500 MW project was placed online in 2015.

==Project==
The project is part of $1.9 billion in wind power construction announced by [[MidAmerican Energy]] in 2013. The project is the largest in Iowa, as well as the largest single-phase project in the world. Siemens is supplying 218 2.3 MW wind turbines for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MidAmerican begins construction on Iowa’s largest wind project|url=http://www.power-eng.com/articles/2013/12/midamerican-begins-construction-on-iowa-s-largest-wind-project.html|publisher=Power Engineering|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is located at the southern end of [[Buffalo Ridge]].  The proposed [[Rock Island Clean Line]] [[HVDC]] transmission line would originate just north of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/a1/wind-energy-boom-blows-into-northwest-iowa-county/article_90aa0dbf-752a-5384-81b1-82b3662271d4.html|title=Wind energy boom blows into Northwest Iowa county|work=Sioux City Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expansion of the project, formerly known as Highland II was developed by Invenergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O'Brien County's 2nd major wind farm on fast track|url=http://www.chronicletimes.com/story/2164930.html|publisher=Cherokee Chronicle Times|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was purchased by MidAmerican energy and constructed in 2016 as the 250 MW O'Brien Wind Farm. It also lies in O'Brien county, just to the north of the Highland project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwestiowa.com/news/wind-stream/article_1c6d06ca-67f6-11e6-93f2-1751ad4b1268.html O'Brien Wind Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The incident occurred on the oldest railway line in Bulgaria, connecting the country's main riverine port on the [[Danube]] in the city of [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and the main port on the [[Black Sea]] in [[Varna]]. The line was built during Ottoman rule by British private investors in the 1860s. The railway station in Hitrino was also the site of the first railway accident in Bulgaria in 1866.

The train operator [[Bulmarket Rail Cargo]] was founded in 2004 and in the same year acquired a license for railway operations. It operates second-hand Danish ([[DSB Class EA|Class 86]]) and British ([[British Rail Class 87|Class 87]]) electric locomotives like those involved in the incident (lead locomotive nr.86.003 and second locomotive nr.87.025), as its mainline motive rolling stock, as well as [[Diesel locomotive|diesel-hydraulic]] locomotives for shunting duties. Bulmarket DM, the mother corporation of Bulmarket Rail Cargo, has its headquarters and main base of operations, with its own railway yard, Bulmarket Port and fuel storage facilities, in the city of Ruse.

==Investigation==
[[Chief Prosecutor of Bulgaria|Bulgaria's Chief Prosecutor]] opened an investigation into the accident.&lt;ref name=Novinite177865/&gt; The owner of Bulmarket DM, [[Stanko Stankov]], expressed his intention to involve an international team of railway incident experts from [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to execute an independent investigation into the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nova.bg/news/view/2016/12/13/167795/%D1%83%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC-%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%B4%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82/|title=УПРАВИТЕЛЯТ НА "БУЛМАРКЕТ": Искам да стигнем до причините за страшния инцидент|first=Нова|last=телевизия|publisher=Nova.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was rebutted by the [[Attorney General of Bulgaria|Republic of Bulgaria's Attorney General's Office]]; it issued a statement that according to Bulgarian law such an investigation has absolutely no legal basis and justification, because the Attorney General's Office (''Главна Прокуратура'') and its special division for investigation of severe crimes and incidents — the [[National Inquiry Service of Bulgaria|National Inquiry Service]] (''Национална Следствена Служба'') — are the only legal bodies authorized by the country's laws to execute such investigations. On that basis, the police authorities guarding the perimeter denied access to the crash site to technical experts involved by the train operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/bulmarket-vlastite-ne-dopuskat-v-hitrino-chuzhdi-eksperti-po-zhp-katastrofi-news257721.html|title="Булмаркет": Властите не допускат в Хитрино чужди експерти по жп катастрофи|publisher=Mediapool.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents were not allowed into their homes as a state of emergency was declared, but volunteers were allowed to be in Hitrino. Bullmarket DM also had to remove cisterns within 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/177953/State+of+Emergency+Remains+in+Force+in+Bulgaria's+Hitrino|title=State of Emergency Remains in Force in Bulgaria's Hitrino - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the State Agency for National Security (semi-autonomous agency within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior, tasked with counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and high-profile corruption cases) the probable trigger for the incident was a railroad switch that had not been properly secured.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/5952587&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigators from the National Inquiry Service of the Attorney General's Office found that upon derailment at the railroad switch a crash between the fifth and sixth tank wagons led to the towing hook of one of them causing a rupture in the lower frontal part of the gas tank of the other. The discharged gas fumes from the liquid gas reached a bakery located in immediate proximity to the railway station, and its furnaces ignited them, causing the violent explosion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnes.bg/stranata/2016/12/11/skysana-vryzka-mejdu-dve-cisterni-dovela-do-ada-v-hitrino.325181&lt;/ref&gt; According to ammunition experts, the chain of events led to an equivalent of an oversized [[thermobaric weapon]] with blasting energy four to five times greater than the TNT-equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.168chasa.bg/article/5935704&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] visited the scene. He called for people to donate blood as there was a shortage in the local hospitals.&lt;ref name=Telegraph101216/&gt; Local response alleviated the shortages.&lt;ref name=Novinite177865/&gt; Bulgarian Transport Minister [[Ivaylo Moskovski]] also visited the site, along with top rail officials.&lt;ref name=BBC38274342&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38274342 |title=Bulgarian freight train derails and explodes, killing five |accessdate=10 December 2016 |publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national day of mourning was declared for 12 December 2016.&lt;ref name=Reuters101216/&gt;

The [[Bulgarian Government]] announced that a fund of 10 million [[Bulgarian lev|leva]] (€5.1 million) was to be made available following a special Cabinet meeting on 12 December. The money would be distributed in two ways: 5 million leva (€2.55 million) would go to the [[Hitrino Municipality]], and the other 5 million leva (€2.55 million) would go to the [[Labour and Social Policy Ministry of Bulgaria|Labour and Social Policy Ministry]]. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Bulgaria)|Interior Ministry]] stated that people who had lost identity documents, [[passport]]s and [[driving licence]]s in the fire would have them replaced free of charge.&lt;ref name=Sofiaglobe121216&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sofiaglobe.com/2016/12/12/bulgarian-government-grants-10m-leva-to-assist-blast-hit-hitrino-village/ |title=

Tropical convective clouds play an important part in the Earth's [[climate system]]. Convection and release of [[latent heat]] transports energy from the surface into the [[upper atmosphere]]. Clouds have a higher [[albedo]] than the underlying ocean, which causes more incoming [[solar radiation]] to be reflected back to space. Since the tops of [[tropical system]]s are much cooler than the surface of the Earth, the presence of high convective clouds cools the climate system.

The most recognizable cloud system in the tropics is the [[hurricane]]. In addition to the important climatic effects of tropical weather systems, hurricanes possess enough energy to cause massive death and destruction. Therefore, their accurate prediction is of utmost importance.

[[Cloud microphysics]] describe the structure and properties of clouds on the [[microscopic scale]].

==Background==
The [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) was launched in 1997 to provide quantitative estimates of [[rainfall]] over the entire tropics. The satellite uses [[remote sensing]] techniques to convert the radiance recorded at the sensor to rainfall values. The most important variable used to constrain the measurements is the properties of the [[hydrometeor]]s.&lt;ref name=stith2002/&gt; Hurricanes are mixed-phase clouds, meaning that liquid and solid water (ice) are both present in the cloud. Typically, liquid water dominates at altitudes lower than the [[freezing]] level and solid water at altitudes where the temperature is colder than -40&amp;nbsp;°C. Between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and -40&amp;nbsp;°C water can exists in both phases simultaneously. In addition to the phase, the solid water hydrometeors can have different shapes and types that need to be accounted for in the [[radiative transfer]] calculations.

In autumn 1999 the TRMM-Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in [[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] (LBA) field experiment sampled continental and oceanic tropical clouds in [[Brazil]]. The goal of TRMM-LBA was to validate the rainfall in cloud resolving models. There have been several in-situ observations of cloud microphysics in tropical clouds which will be discussed here.

Cloud microphysics are the [[physical process]]es that describe the growth, decay, and fallout of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation particles]]. In terms of models, cloud microphysics occur on a scale smaller than the grid-scale of the model and have to be parameterized.&lt;ref name=fovell2009&gt;Fovell, R.G., K.L. Corbosiero, and H.C. Kuo, 2009: Cloud Microphysics Impact on Hurricane Track as Revealed in Idealized Experiments. ''J. Atmos. Sci''., '''66''', 1764–1778.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane track forecasts have been getting better in recent years. Looking at the example of [[Hurricane Rita]], the forecast of the [[National Hurricane Center]] 36 hours before landfall shifted more than 130 kilometers from the previous forecast, causing an unneeded [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]. There has been research that has shown that the choice of subgrid-scale [[parameterization]] schemes can influence hurricane intensity, track, speed, and precipitation rates. Microphysical assumptions may directly or indirectly modulated storm structure, which result in small changes in the hurricane track which can have societal consequences.&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

===Hydrometeor formation and shapes===
The shape of liquid water drops is generally [[Sphere|spherical]] because of the effects of [[surface tension]]. Depending on the size of the drop the [[friction]] of the air flowing past a falling drop may squish the bottom on the drop so that it is slightly non-spherical. However, solid ice does not generally form into nice spherical shapes. Ice crystals have a preference to form [[hexagon]]al structures by deposition, but can form odd shapes in the presence riming or aggregation into [[graupel]].

The shape of ice particles is mostly dependent on the temperature and [[supersaturation]] where the form. The supersaturation is mostly dependent upon the speed in the [[updraft]] regions. In regions of high updraft, there are more hydrometeors formed. Graupel is found mostly in regions of weak updrafts. Particle size tends to decrease with increasing altitude because at lower altitudes the larger particles collide and aggregate with the smaller particles.&lt;ref name=stith2002/&gt; Because updrafts are important for cloud microphysics, it is also necessary to consider how convection parameterization schemes may influence [[microphysics]].

Small errors in the parameterization of the particle size distribution can have large impacts on the calculation of the [[terminal velocity]]. The composition, size, and number concentration of particles varies dramatically in [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] and convective regions. The particle fall speed derived from observations of [[tropical cyclone]]s varies significantly from those derived from midlatitude systems.&lt;ref name=mcfarquhar2004&gt;McFarquhar, G.M., and R.A. Black, 2004: Observations of Particle Size and Phase in Tropical Cyclones: Implications for Mesoscale Modeling of Microphysical Processes. ''J. Atmos. Sci.'', '''61''', 422–439.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many studies of the feasibility of modifying hurricanes so that they would not be as destructive. Rosenfeld et al. (2007) studied possible modification of [[hurricane Katrina]] (2005). They simulated the ''seeding'' of the hurricane by suppressing all warm rain formation in the outer regions of the hurricane. They report that in their simulation the seeded hurricane initially weakened the surface winds in the region of seeding. The eye of the hurricane eventually contracted and became stronger, but the average of the total wind field was weaker. In this best case scenario, they report that seeding reduced the hurricane-force winds by 25%.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld2007&gt;Rosenfeld, D., A. Khain, B. Lynn, and W.L. Woodley, 2007: Simulation of hurricane response to suppression of warm rain by sub-micron aerosols. ''Atmos. Chem. Phys.'', '''7''', 3411-3424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rango and Hobbs (2005) obtained in situ measurements of tropical convective systems. They found that the liquid water content was below [[adiabatic]] values. This was true even in newly formed updrafts, suggesting that collision-coalescence and/or entrainment mixing are efficient methods for the removal of liquid water. They noted that the effective radius started to decrease at altitudes above 2–4&amp;nbsp;km above [[cloud base]], which they attribute to the warm rain process. Ice processes became important at temperatures between -4&amp;nbsp;°C and -10&amp;nbsp;°C, and they photographed different shapes including needles, frozen drops, and sheaths. In growing clouds, it was noted that the particle size often grew by riming.&lt;ref name=rangno2005&gt;Rangno, A.L., and P.V. Hobbs, 2005: Microstructures and precipitation development in [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] and small [[cumulonimbus cloud]]s over the warm pool of the tropical Pacific Ocean. ''Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc.'', '''131''', 639-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokay et al. (2008) studied the [[raindrop]] size distribution in topical cyclones. They found high concentrations of small and middle sized drops regardless if larger drops were present. The total number of droplets was between 600–1000 m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, the liquid water content was around 1 g m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a rain rate of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;mm per hour. The droplets had a mean mass diameter of ~1.6&amp;nbsp;mm and the maximum diameter recorded was 4.11&amp;nbsp;mm. There results indicate that prior rain rate estimates from tropical cyclones may have been underestimated due to the differences in microphysics between midlatitude and [[tropical storm]]s.&lt;ref name=tokay2008&gt;Tokay, A., P.G. Bashor, E. Habib, and T. Kasparis, 2008: Raindrop Size Distribution Measurements in Tropical Cyclones. ''Mon. Wea. Rev.'', '''136''', 1669–1685.&lt;/ref&gt;

In-situ measurements of the microphysics of tropical clouds in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] show that in regions of stronger updrafts contained smaller [[Supercooling|supercooled]] water droplets or ice particles than weaker updrafts. In stratiform anvil regions, aggregation into graupel was the main growth mechanism. The speed of the updraft determines if warm rain processes, riming, or aggregation are the primary mechanism of growth in updraft regions.&lt;ref name=stith2002&gt;Stith, J.L., J.E. Dye, A. Bansemer, A.J. Heymsfield, C.A. Grainger, W.A. Petersen, and R. Cifelli, 2002: Microphysical Observations of Tropical Clouds. ''J. Appl. Meteor.'', '''41''', 97–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymsfield et al. (2002) also looked at the microphysics of tropical convection, but they limited themselves to the stratiform regions. They observed ice particles of many shapes and sizes. In particular, they noted that rimed particles were found near convective regions, small spheres were found in regions of "transient convection", and at low temperatures cirrus crystals formed. They constructed particle size distributions and noted that they fit particularly well to [[Gamma distribution]]s and slightly less well to [[exponential distribution]]s. They noted that their results were similar to results derived from midlatitude systems.&lt;ref name=heymsfield2002&gt;Heymsfield, A.J., A. Bansemer, P.R. Field, S.L. Durden, J.L. Stith, J.E. Dye, W. Hall, and C.A. Grainger, 2002: Observations and Parameterizations of Particle Size Distributions in Deep Tropical Cirrus and Stratiform Precipitating Clouds: Results from In Situ Observations in TRMM Field Campaigns. ''J. Atmos. Sci.'', '''59,''' 3457–3491.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parameterization===
There are several different cloud microphysics parameterization schemes. Depending on the sophistication of the scheme, the number of ice-phase categories can vary. Many schemes use at least three categories: cloud ice, graupel, and snow. The classification of ice into categories is necessary because different forms of ice will fall at different velocities.

Typically, microphysics schemes will use a mass-weighted average for the fall velocity. McFarquhar and Black (2004) showed that different parameterizing methods results in dramatically different terminal velocities of the hydrometeors.&lt;ref name=mcfarquhar2004/&gt;

==Intensity==
The presence of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] (CCN) influences the number of cloud drops that form in a cloud; the more CCN there are, the more cloud droplets that will form. Changes in the CCN concentration and their associated changes in the cloud drop distribution can redistribute the energy within a hurricane.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld2007/&gt; This was known in the 1960s which lead scientists to think that hurricanes could be modified by the addition of CCN to produce less intense hurricanes. It was proposed that by seeding with [[silver iodide]] outside the [[eyewall]] would freeze the supercooled water, release more latent heat, and increase convection.&lt;ref name=willoughby1985&gt;Willoughby, H., D. Jorgensen, R. Black, and S. Rosenthal, 1985, Project STORMFURY: A Scientific Chronicle 1962–1983. ''Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.'', '''66''', 505–514.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was ultimately unsuccessful because of the lack of supercooled water in the tropical cyclone. A different approach seeds the clouds with a large number of small [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] aerosols. The large number of CCN leads to smaller raindrops, less collision-coalescence, and thus less rainout. This water is convected above the freezing level, leading to warming in the upper atmosphere and greater [[convection]].

There have been several modeling studies on the effects of increased CCN on hurricane intensity. Rosenfeld ''et al.''. (2007) used the Weather Research Model (WRF) to simulate hurricane Katrina, and then turned off the warm rain processes to approximate the effects of adding a large number of CCN.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld2007/&gt; They report that they were successful in simulating key features of Katrina in the control run including the minimum [[central pressure]] and maximum [[wind speed]]s. When the warm rain processes were removed, the cloud water content naturally increased and the rain water content decreased. The warm rain suppression also changes the thermodynamic structure of the hurricane: temperatures are decreased at low levels at the outer edge of the hurricane. Later, the peak winds decreased along with the central pressure.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld2007/&gt;

Zhu and Zhang (2006) used a mesoscale model to simulate the 1998 [[Hurricane Bonnie (1992)|Hurricane Bonnie]]. They report that their control run was reasonably able to simulate the observed hurricane. They then ran a series of sensitivity experiments to examine how changes in the microphysics influence the hurricane.&lt;ref name=zhu2006&gt;Zhu, T., and D.L. Zhang, 2006: Numerical Simulation of Hurricane Bonnie (1998). Part II: Sensitivity to Varying Cloud Microphysical Processes. ''J. Atmos. Sci.'', '''63''', 109–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The various sensitivity runs were focused on the effects of ice processes. They report that the tropical cyclones exhibit a large sensitivity in the intensity and core structures to ice phase processes. As the ice processes are removed, the intensity of the cyclone decreases without the Bergeron process. When graupel processes are removed, the storm weakens but not as much as when all ice processes are removed. And when evaporation is turned off, the storm increases in intensity dramatically. They conclude that melting and evaporation processes are important in amplifying tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name=zhu2006/&gt;

Different cumulus parameterization schemes were derived for different situations. The Betts-Miller scheme (or the derivative Betts-Miller-Janjic) attempts to ensure that the local vertical temperature and moisture structures be realistic. The Betts-Miller(-Janjic) scheme is often used when simulating tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name=davis2002&gt;Davis, C., and L.F. Bosart, 2002: Numerical Simulations of the Genesis of Hurricane Diana (1984). Part II: Sensitivity of Track and Intensity Prediction. ''Mon. Wea. Rev.'', '''130''', 1100–1124.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Bosart (2002) simulated Hurricane Diana (1984) which underwent extratropical transition. They used the Betts-Miller-Janjic cumulus parameterization scheme in two ways: one with the parameters set for midlatitude systems and the other for tropical systems. They not that when the parameterization scheme is set for midlatitude systems the simulation produces a more realistic track and storm intensity. However, the tropical simulation produces a more realistic rainfall field.&lt;ref name=davis2002/&gt;

Pattnaik and Krishnamurtil (2007) simulated [[hurricane Charley]] of 2004 to assess the impact of cloud microphysics on hurricane intensity. They report that their control run was successful in simulating the track, intensity, speed and precipitation.&lt;ref name=pattnaik2007a&gt;Pattnaik, S. and T.N. Krishnamurti1, 2007, Impact of cloud microphysical processes on hurricane intensity, part 1: Control run. ''Meteo. and Atmos. Phys.'', '''97''', 117-126.&lt;/ref&gt; They used the microphysics scheme from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This scheme uses five different classifications of cloud water: liquid cloud water, cloud ice, rain water, snow, and hail/graupel. It also allows for supercooled water. Their study attempts to show how fall speed and intercept parameters can influence the tropical cyclone intensity. The size distribution of precipitation particles is parametrized as:
:::N(D)=N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−λD&lt;/sup&gt;dD
where N is the number of precipitation particles between a given diameter D and D + dD, N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intercept parameter, λ is the slope parameter, and D is the diameter of the particles.&lt;ref name=pattnaik2007b&gt;Pattnaik, S. and T.N. Krishnamurti1, 2007, Impact of cloud microphysical processes on hurricane intensity, part 2: Sensitivity experiments. ''Meteo. and Atmos. Phys.'', '''97''', 127-147.&lt;/ref&gt; They used the same model and microphysics scheme, turning off different microphysical mechanisms to understand which ones are the most important. They note that modifications to the microphysics scheme dramatically impacted the hurricane intensity. The most intense hurricanes were when melting was suppressed, or when no evaporation was allowed. They interpret this as meaning that the energy needed to either melt or evaporate the particles could instead be used to heat the air column, which increased convection leading to a stronger storm. During the weakest simulated storm, the fall speed of the snow and graupel particles was increased. The increased rate of fallout also increased the evaporation, leading to weakened convection. Changes in the intercept parameter showed little change.&lt;ref name=pattnaik2007b/&gt; This implies that the total number of particles does not matter as much as the relative distribution between different sizes of particles.

A series of simulations which principally looked at how cloud microphysics affect hurricane track also revealed that subgrid-scale turbulent mixing parameterization schemes influenced the intensity of a hurricane simulation more than its track.&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

==Track==
[[File:WRF rita spread2.jpg|thumb|right|Results from Fovell and Su (2007)&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''Top''': WRF model simulation of Hurricane Rita tracks.&lt;br/&gt;'''Bottom''': The spread of NHC multi-model ensemble forecast.]]
Though not the main goal, two work of Rosenfeld ''et al.''. (2007) noted that in their simulations that the suppression of warm rain through the addition of large amounts of aerosols will cause the tropical cyclone to divert eastward.&lt;ref name=rosenfeld2007/&gt; Zhu and Zhang (2006) report that the hurricane track was not sensitive to cloud microphysical processes except for very weak storms, which were pushed to the east.&lt;ref name=zhu2006/&gt; In a series of sensitivity studies, Pattnaik and Krishnamurti conclude that microphysical processes have little effect on hurricane track.&lt;ref name=pattnaik2007b/&gt;

Davis and Bosart (2002) considered, among other things, the effects of cumulus parameterization on tropical storm track. They found that changes in potential vorticity at the tropopause can cause changes in the wind field. Specifically, different schemes have different methods of parametrizing the potential vorticity which results in different tracks. They found that the Betts-Miller-Janjic and Grill schemes produced a more westward track than Kain-Fritsch.&lt;ref name=davis2002/&gt; The Kain-Fritsch scheme tended to intensify the storm too rapidly but produced the best track compared with observations. The simulated tracks of more intense storms tends to be farther to the east compared with weaker storms. Davis and Bosart also point out that their results differ from previous sensitivity studies on cumulus parameterizations which found that the Betts-Miller-Janjic scheme tended to have better results. They attribute this difference to the differences in grid spacing between the studies.&lt;ref name=davis2002/&gt;

The first paper published that specifically looked at the impacts of cloud microphysics on hurricane track wa{{Clarify|date=May 2016}} Fovell and Su (2007).&lt;ref name=fovell2007&gt;Fovell, R.G., and H. Su, 2007: Impact of cloud microphysics on hurricane track forecasts. ''Geophys. Res. Lett.'', '''34''', L24810.&lt;/ref&gt; They use simulations of Hurricane Rita (2005) and an idealized hurricane simulation to see how different microphysical parameterization and convection schemes change the hurricane track. They compared the effects of the Kessler (K), Lin et al. (L), and the three class WRF single moment (WFR3) schemes, coupled with the effects of Kain-Fritsch (KF), Grell-Devenyi (GD), and Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ) convective parameterization schemes. The hurricane that most similarly simulated Rita's track was when the WSM3 microphysics scheme was paired with BMJ convection. The worst simulated track was when the K microphysics was paired with KF convection, which produced a weaker storm that tracked well west of the actual storm. The spread from simply changing the microphysics and cumulus convection parameterization schemes produced the same spread in hurricane tracks as the National Hurricane Center ensemble.&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

They also note that the biggest difference between the microphysics parameterizations is that K does not include any ice phases. The differences between the crystalline nature of cloud ice and snow, compared with the spherical nature of raindrops, and the semi-spherical shape of graupel will likely produce different fall velocities when frozen water is included in the parameterizations. They used the most accurate member of the Rita simulations and changed the microphysics so that the fall speed of the ice particles would have the same fall velocity as if they were liquid raindrops with the same mass. They report that this changed the track of the hurricane so that it tracked further to the west, similar to the K scheme.&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

In addition to simulating Hurricane Rita, Fovell and Su (2007) also made the same simulations as before, but on a smaller grid size so that cumulus parameterization was not needed. They found that the hurricane produced by the K scheme was weaker than the rest and had the most westward track. They conclude that the different implicit microphysical assumption in the different schemes can change the hurricane track on forecasting timescales. In general, their results suggest that larger-sized hurricanes will track further westward, which is consistent with "beta drift".&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

When an idealized set of hurricanes was produced with no large-scale flow, with variable Coriolis parameter, they found that the hurricanes still moved in the northeast to north-northeast direction. However, the different microphysical schemes tracked at different directions. Since there was no large-scale flow, they conclude that the differences in the track represent changes in the vortex motion caused by changes in the microphysics. On a constant f-plane experiment, there was no movement of the storms. They note that variations among the NWS consensus model results could be primarily due to how the different models parameterize their cloud microphysics and other subgrid-scale processes.&lt;ref name=fovell2007/&gt;

Recently, Fovell et al. (2009) conducted a modeling study of hurricanes in idealized environments. The model had a constant sea surface temperature, no background wind, but with Earth rotation. They then inserted a vortex with varying microphysics schemes and noted that the tracks diverged. They used the same microphysics schemes as F07, and like F07 the noted that the K storm moved faster and further westward than storm produced with other microphysics schemes.&lt;ref name=fovell2009/&gt; An earlier study by Fiorino and Elsberry (1989) showed that hurricane track and speed can be changed by simply changing the tangential winds in the outer part of the storm because they helped determine the orientation and strength of the beta gyres.&lt;ref name=fiorino1989&gt;Fiorino, M.J., and R.L. Elsberry, 1989: Some aspects of vortex structure related to tropical cyclone motion. ''J. Atmos. Sci.'', '''46''', 975-990.&lt;/ref&gt; The F09 storm with the K microphysics parameterization had the largest eye and the strongest winds at large radii, while the L storm was most intense and WSM3 had the most compact eye.

F09 noted that storm with stronger outer winds tracked more to the northwest than storms with weak winds. They hypothesize that this can be explained with an atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. Assuming an atmosphere that is in hydrostatic balance, the average column virtual temperature contributes the most to the surface pressure. The virtual temperatures of the three F09 storms varied with the Kessler storm having temperatures several degrees warmer than the other storms. The winds are determined by the radial pressure gradients, which are related to the temperature gradients. Therefore, storms that have a large radial variation in virtual temperature will have stronger outer winds.&lt;ref name=fovell2009/&gt; The temperature differences between the models can be explained by the change in radiative heating and cooling. The K microphysics scheme produced particle fall speeds that were slower than the others, thereby increasing the size of its anvil. F09 report that the most important factor that influences the size of the anvil is the terminal velocity, and that the terminal velocity of the particles depends on their geometry, density, and size. Interactions between the anvil and incoming and emitted radiation changes the radial temperature gradient, leading to changes in the track direction.&lt;ref name=fovell2009/&gt;

Fovell et al. conclude that the choice of microphysics schemes can lead to changes in the terminal velocities of the particles in the anvil which could lead to increases or decreases in the size of the anvil. Schemes that produce heavier particles that will fall faster (like K) produce worse results. They conclude by warning that any changes in storm track or speed that are initially caused by microphysics could be amplified by other dynamic factors such as the steering flow or sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref name=fovell2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mls.jpl.nasa.gov/research/hurricanes.php |title=Impact of Microphysics on Hurricane Track and Intensity Forecasts |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=Fovell R., and H Su |accessdate=7 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kondo model''' (sometimes referred to as the '''s-d model''') is a model for a quantum impurity coupled to a large reservoir of noninteracting [[electron]]s. The quantum impurity is represented by a spin-1/2, which is coupled to a continuous band of noninteracting electrons by an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, J. The Kondo model is used as a model for metals containing magnetic impurities, as well as [[quantum dot]] systems.

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{k\sigma} \epsilon_{\mathbf{k}} c^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}c_{\mathbf{k}\sigma} - J \mathbf{S}(0)\cdot \mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt; is a spin-1/2 operator representing the impurity, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}(0) = \sum_{k,k',\sigma,\sigma'} c^{\dagger}_{\mathbf{k}\sigma} \mathbf{\sigma}_{\sigma,\sigma'}c_{\mathbf{k'}\sigma'}&lt;/math&gt; is the local spin-density of the noninteracting band at the impurity site (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; are the Pauli matrices). J &lt; 0, i.e. the exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic.

[[Jun Kondo]] applied third-order [[perturbation theory]] to the Kondo model and showed that the [[resistivity]] of the model diverges logarithmically as the temperature goes to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kondo |first=Jun |date=19 March 1964 |title=Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys |journal=Prog. Theor. Phys. |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1143/PTP.32.37 |bibcode = 1964PThPh..32...37K }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This explained why metal samples containing magnetic impurities have a resistance minimum (see [[Kondo effect]]). The problem of finding a solution to the Kondo model which did not contain this unphysical divergence became known as the Kondo problem.

A number of methods were used to attempt to solve the Kondo problem. Phillip Anderson devised a perturbative renormalization group method, known as Poor Man's Scaling, which involves perturbatively eliminating excitations to the edges of the noninteracting band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=P.W. |date=1 December 1970 |title=A poor man's derivation of scaling laws for the Kondo problem |journal=J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys.|volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=2436–2441 |doi=10.1088/0022-3719/3/12/008 |bibcode = 1970JPhC....3.2436A }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This method indicated that, as temperature is decreased, the effective coupling between the spin and the band, &lt;math&gt;J_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;, increases without limit. As this method is perturbative in J, it becomes invalid when J becomes large, so this method did not truly solve the Kondo problem, although it did hint at the way forward.

The Kondo problem was finally solved when Kenneth Wilson applied the [[numerical renormalization group]] to the Kondo model and showed that the resistivity goes to a constant as temperature goes to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Kenneth |date=1 October 1975 |title=The renormalization group: Critical phenomena and the Kondo problem |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=773–840 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.47.773 |bibcode = 1975RvMP...47..773W }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variants of the Kondo model. For instance, the spin-1/2 can be replaced by a spin-1 or even a greater spin. The two-channel Kondo model is a variant of the Kondo model which has the spin-1/2 coupled to two independent noninteracting bands. One can also consider the ferromagnetic Kondo model (i.e. the standard Kondo model with J &gt; 0).

The Kondo model is intimately related to the [[Anderson impurity model]], as can be shown by [[Schrieffer–Wolff transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrieffer |first=J.R. |date=16 December 1966 |title=Relation between the Anderson and Kondo Hamiltonians |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=149 |issue=2 |pages=491–492 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.149.491 |bibcode = 1966PhRv..149..491S }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Lease Automatic [[Custody transfer|Custody Transfer]] unit''' or '''LACT unit''' measures the net [[volume]] and quality of [[liquid]] [[hydrocarbons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1021">The '''Maryland Power Plant Research Program (PPRP)''' is a government program within the [[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]] and is charged with addressing [[power plant]] licensing issues. PPRP was established under the Power Plant Siting and Research Act of 1971. This legislation provided a model for addressing power plant licensing issues which several other states have adopted.  PPRP is housed within DNR’s headquarters in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Mission and functions==

PPRP functions to ensure that [[Maryland]] meets its electricity demands at reasonable costs while protecting the state's valuable [[natural resources]]. It provides a continuing program for evaluating electric generation issues and recommending responsible, long-term solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12610">The '''Mesoamerican Biological Corridor''' (MBC) is a region that consists of Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and some southern states of Mexico. The area acts as a natural [[land bridge]] from [[South America]] to [[North America]], which is important for species who use the bridge in [[Animal migration|migration]]. Due to the extensive unique habitat types, Mesoamerica contains somewhere between 7 and 10% of the world’s known species.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Deepak|title=Dry season clouds and rainfall in northern Central America: Implications for the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=26 September 2005|volume=54|issue=1–2|pages=150–162|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2005.09.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818106001159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tbpa&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesoamerican Biological Corridor: Mexico to Panama|url=http://www.tbpa.net/docs/62_Meso_American_Biological_Corridor.pdf|website=Global Transboundary Conservation Network|publisher=Global Transboundary Conservation Network|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corridor was originally proposed in the 1990s to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting [[Sustainability|ecological sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones,&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; each with varying availability for human use.

== Background ==
With the increasing conversion of natural tropical ecosystems to agricultural farms and for other human use, comes growing concern over conservation of local species.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Celia|title=Integrating Agricultural Landscapes with Biodiversity Conservation in the Mesoamerican Hotspot|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 Feb 2008|volume=22|issue=1|pages=8–15|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00863.x|pmid=18254848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica is considered one of many biodiversity hotspots where extinction is a significant threat.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Norman|title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities|journal=Nature|date=24 Feb 2000|volume=403|pages=853–858|doi=10.1038/35002501|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6772/pdf/403853a0.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2014|pmid=10706275|issue=6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is the world’s third largest biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref name=Grandia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandia|first1=Liza|title=Between Bolivar and Bureaucracy: The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Conservation &amp; Society|date=26 Jun 2009|volume=5|issue=4|pages=478–503|url=http://conservationandsociety.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4923;year=2007;volume=5;issue=4;spage=478;epage=503;aulast=Grandia|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some efforts have been made to protect organisms in the region, however, many of these protected sites are “small, fragmented, isolated, or poorly protected”&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt;

In the late 1980s, Archie Carr III envisioned a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife native to the region by connecting fragmented patches of habitat, and to create buffer zones to allow different levels of land use near protected areas.&lt;ref name=IEG&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Independent Evaluation Group|title=The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Regional Program Review|date=2011|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/Data/reports/mbc_rpr.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor that eventually came to be, originally called Paseo Pantera (Spanish for Path of the Panther), follows the Atlantic coastline. [[File:CAmerica.gif|thumb|A topographical map of the region encompassing the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, along the Atlantic coast, and Central American mountain ranges, along the Pacific coast.]] The MBC began in the late 1990s, by funding from the World Bank in order to promote wildlife conservation, particularly endemic, threatened, and endangered species, and ways to use the land in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt; It was developed by a team of biologists from the University of Florida and the Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD), and was remapped by CCAD, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for political reason.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; $4 million was invested in the corridor by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1990 to 1995.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; In 1992, all of the countries that are part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor joined the Central American System of Protected Areas (SICAP), which allows each country to “maintain its own ministries of the environment.” &lt;ref name=declerk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeClerck|first1=Fabrice A.J.|last2=Chazdon|first2=Robin|last3=Holl|first3=Karen D.|last4=Milder|first4=Jeffrey C.|last5=Finegan|first5=Bryan|last6=Martinez-Salinas|first6=Alejandra|last7=Imbach|first7=Pablo|last8=Canet|first8=Lindsay|last9=Ramos|first9=Zayra|title=Biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes of Mesoamerica: Past, present and future|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=143|issue=10|pages=2301–2313|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.026|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor project has been successful in providing wildlife habitat; however, regional biota remained threatened due to fragmented areas and “unevenness of the region’s protected area system”&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt;

== Ecosystems ==

The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor incorporates multiple diverse biomes and is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Splitting the corridor in half is the Guatemalan Mountain range, which includes active volcanoes. These environmental forces create four terrestrial biomes and 19 terrestrial ecoregions. The biomes include, tropical dry broadleaf forest, tropical wet broadleaf forests, xeric shrub lands, and tropical coniferous forests.&lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

== Land use ==
According to data from 2003, roughly 57% of the Mesoamerican biological corridor is natural vegetation, with the remaining land being used mostly for cattle and crop production. The main crops produced in the MBC include sugar cane, corn, coffee, and beans. With agricultural production being such a large part of all the nations economies, there is much emphasis on adopting sustainable agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones, each with varying availability for human use. Core Zones are protected areas whose purpose is to promote and sustain biodiversity in the areas in order to maintain ecosystem services to the local people. Buffer Zones include the areas surrounding the protected Core Zones, which are made up mostly of wild land. Pathways between zones are labeled as Corridor (or Connectivity) Zones; these zones link water and land passages, allowing movement of plants and animals throughout the corridor. Finally Multi-use Zones, separate wild and protected land from land used for forestry, agriculture, and areas of direct human impacts.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Kenton Miller, Elsa Chang, Nels|title=Defining common ground for the Mesoamerican biological corridor|date=2001|publisher=World Resources Institute|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-156973-473-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Around 10.7% of Mesoamerica is currently under some category of protection for biodiversity conservation.”  &lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

== Conservation efforts ==
The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is a program that “integrates protection areas into a single, functional conservation area”.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; Their goal is to promote “regional scale connectivity of protected areas with sustainable development and improvement of human livelihoods.”&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; The purpose of the corridor is to emphasize the conservation movement as being a social and group effort. One issue with conservation efforts arise from the discontinuity of government and politics across the corridor; areas are often fragmented and up to 40% of protected areas go unenforced because it crosses nations barriers.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; The rapid increase in human population growth negatively affects conservation. Although this growth has been paired with rapid urbanization, the majority of the MBC population still resides in rural areas and “depends directly on biological resources for subsistence.”&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; This dependency has led to exploitation that is difficult to quantify and regulate by the nations’ governments and conservation groups.
 
As of 2010, SICAP (Central American System of Protected Areas) encompasses 669 protected areas that total 124,250 square kilometers.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; Yet, conservation efforts are hindered and negatively impacted by the fragmentation of land parcels and cross-national political differences and tension. Most of the protected areas are roughly 18,400 hectares, while only 18 areas exceeded 1,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; Presently, most conservation efforts are in promoting [[sustainable development]] and mitigating the damage done to the area by [[deforestation]]. Deforestation in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor peaked between the 1970s and the 1990s. Planting native trees is the main method of restoring ecosystems after deforestation.

== Benefits ==
Due to the corridor having been recently developed there has not been any studies that specifically address the benefits. Future studies should be completed to examine the differences in animal populations prior to the corridor and after implementation.

== Controversy ==

When the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor was in the planning process there was a lack of formal functions proposed.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; The stakeholders did not have a clear idea of what the exact functions of the MBC were, which led to anger and an increase in the time taken to implement the corridor. The MBC was originally conceived as a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife by connecting fragments of habitats and forming buffer zones to limit human land use.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; However, many of the interested stakeholders wanted to include common livelihood problems such as pollution, water and sanitation, pesticides contamination, firewood acquisition, zoonotic and infectious disease.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt; It was finally decided that the main goals of the corridor would be to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting ecological sustainability.&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; Indigenous people were barely involved in these decisions and the zone boundaries were made without their input. This lack of input led to distrust and tension between the locals and corridor implementers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finley-Brook|first1=Mary|title=Green Neoliberal Space: The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Journal of Latin American Geography|date=2007|volume=6|issue=1|pages=101–124|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_latin_american_geography/v006/6.1finley-brook.html|accessdate=11 October 2014|doi=10.1353/lag.2007.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to promote ecological sustainability, payment for various environmental services are given to  landowners in order to motivate reforestation on their land. A major issue with these programs is that most small landholders do not have titles to the land. These small landholders were given plots to cultivate when they worked on larger farms or many were displaced migrants who settled in unclaimed lands. Since they have no legal documentation of land ownership they can’t apply for many of the correct land use incentives, thus little consideration of long-term effects on the land is given.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; Another issue is that the programs don’t differentiate between small-scale and large-scale landowners. In an effort to reduce Carbon emissions the MBC offers incentives for carbon sinks. Large-scale landowners have taken advantage of these systems by planting African Oil Palms on their lands. These plants provide them with more [[carbon credit]]s whereas a small landowner who is maintaining forest will receive little to no carbon credits&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt;

A '''metallomesogen''' is a metal complex that exhibit [[liquid crystal]]line behavior.  Thus, they adopt ordered structures in the molten phase, e.g. [[smectic]] and [[nematic]] [[Phase transition|phase]]s.  The dominant interactions responsible for their phase behavior are the nonbonding contacts between organic substituents.  Two early classes of such materials are based on substituted [[ferrocene]]s and [[dithiolene complex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Donnio, B., Bruce, D. W., "Metallomesogens", Struct. Bonding (Berlin) 1999, 95, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micarta''' is a brand name for [[Composite material|composite]]s of [[linen]], [[canvas]], [[paper]], [[fiberglass]], [[carbon fiber]] or other fabric in a [[thermosetting plastic]]. It was originally used in electrical and decorative applications. Micarta was developed by [[George Westinghouse]] at least as early as 1910 using [[phenolic resin]]s invented by [[Leo Baekeland]]. These resins were used to impregnate paper and cotton fabric which were cured under pressure and high temperature to produce laminates. In later years this manufacturing method included the use of fiberglass fabric and other resin types were also used. Today Micarta high pressure industrial laminates are produced with a wide variety of resins and fibers.  The term has been used generically for most resin impregnated fibre compounds. Common uses of modern high pressure laminates are as electrical insulators, printed circuit board substrates, and knife handles.

The Micarta trademark is a registered trademark of Industrial Laminates / Norplex, Inc. (dba *[http://www.norplex-micarta.com/ Norplex-Micarta]).

==Manufacturing process==
[[File:Micarta knife handle.jpg|right|thumb|Micarta knife handle]]
Micarta industrial laminates are normally [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|phenolic]], [[epoxy]], [[silicone]], or [[melamine resin]] based thermoset materials reinforced with fiberglass, [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[cotton]] cloth, paper, carbon fiber or other substrates. Micarta industrial laminate sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of [[Pre-preg|prepreg]]. These layers of laminations are usually of cellulose paper, cotton fabrics, synthetic yarn fabrics, glass fabrics, or unwoven fabrics. When heat and pressure are applied to the layers, a chemical reaction ([[polymerization]]) transforms the layers into a high-pressure thermosetting industrial laminated plastic.

Micarta industrial laminates are manufactured in dozens of commercial grades.

==Applications==
[[Image:CNG Storage Cylinders and Micarta -2.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Compressed natural gas]] storage cylinder in the process of being installed in saddle supports using micarta insulation as an electrical insulator.]]
The largest use for Micarta industrial laminates is a high strength electrical insulation in power generating and distribution equipment. Laminates are also used in heavy equipment, aerospace (such as propeller blades&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/196934/test-propellers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;), automotive, office equipment, tabletops, countertops, electronic, electrical insulation between pressure vessels or piping and their supports, decorative applications, including knife handles, BBQ and kitchen tool handles, and handgun grips, guitar fingerboards, nuts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Nuts,_saddles/String_nuts/Micarta_Nuts.html&lt;/ref&gt; and bridges, pool cues, and safety gear such as hard hats.  Between 1935 and 1945, Westinghouse's Power-Aire desk fans used blades made of Micarta.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Micarta 259-2 was used as the ablation heat shield material in early ICBM warheads.&lt;ref&gt;Heppenheimer, "Facing the Heat Barrier", NASA, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Micarta's industrial laminate division and name was purchased by Norplex in 2003, merging two of the largest industrial laminate manufactures in the United States. Norplex still manufactures Micarta and produces over 100 different versions of Micarta offered in sheet, tube, and rod forms. *[http://www.norplex-micarta.com/ Norplex-Micarta Industrial Composites]

'''North Luangwa National Park''' is a [[national park]] in [[Zambia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_goldberg?currentPage=all "Did American conservationists in Africa go too far?"] in ''The New Yorker'', 5 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the northernmost of the three in the [[valley]] of the [[Luangwa River]].  Founded as a [[game reserve]] in 1938, it became a [[national park]] in 1972 and now covers 4,636&amp;nbsp;km².

Like the [[South Luangwa National Park|South Park]], its eastern boundary is the [[Luangwa River]], while it rises to cover a stretch of the [[Muchinga Escarpment]] to the west.  The [[Mwaleshi River]] flows east–west through the centre of the park, the area to its south being a strict [[wilderness]] zone.

Wildlife is widely found, including [[Cookson's wildebeest]], [[Crawshay's zebra]] and many [[antelope]]s and [[bird]]s.  [[Elephant]] numbers have recovered from [[poaching]] in the 1970s and 80s.  The struggle against poaching in the park was described by [[Delia Owens|Delia]] and [[Mark Owens]] in their book ''[[The Eye of the Elephant]]''.

For many years its wildlife suffered greatly from [[poaching]], but recent years have seen poaching almost entirely stopped.  It has generally suffered from a lack of investment and interest compared to the much more popular [[South Luangwa National Park]], although its flora and fauna are very similar to its southern counterpart.  In 2003, [[black rhinoceros]]es were re-introduced to the park.

Since 2005, the protected area is considered a [[Panthera leo melanochaita|Lion]] Conservation Unit together with [[South Luangwa National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;IUCN Cat Specialist Group (2006). Conservation Strategy for the Lion ''Panthera leo'' in Eastern and Southern Africa. IUCN, Pretoria, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6173">'''Northern Marmara and Değirmenköy (Silivri) Depleted Gas Reservoir''' ({{lang-tr|Kuzey Marmara ve Değirmenköy Sahaları Yeraltı Doğalgaz Depolama Tesisleri}}) are underground [[natural gas storage]]s inside depleted gas fields in [[Istanbul Province]], northwestern Turkey. Combined, it is the country's first underground natural gas storage facility.

One of the storage facilities is situated inside a depleted gas field undersea in northern Marmara Sea and the other is in neighboring Değirmenköy, a town in [[Silivri]] district of Istanbul Province. Both sites were suitable due to their proximity to [[Istanbul]] and to the gas pipeline of [[BOTAŞ]].&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; 

==Northern Marmara Gas Field==
[[File:SilivriOffshorePlatform.jpg|thumb|Silivri offshore platform.]]
Northern Marmara Gas Field was discovered in 1988 in an area {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Silivri and {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} far off the coast at a depth of {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To determine the size of the natural gas reserve, which is the first undersea natural gas reserve in Turkey, three offshore boreholes in 1995 and two more were drilled in 1996. Natural gas production started in September 1997 at the five gas wells. Gas was pumped from an [[offshore platform]] by a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long undersea pipeline to the plant at the coast for [[natural-gas processing|processing]]. Between 2003 and 2004, six [[directional drilling|directional wells]] were drilled, which had vertical depths of {{convert|1200|-|1250|m|ft|abbr=on}} and horizontal deviation of {{convert|2287|-|2947|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Değirmenköy Natural Gas Field==
Değirmenköy Natural Gas Field is located {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Silivri. The field was discovered in 1994, and the production started in 1995 from nine wells, seven of which were directional. Gas processing facility was built by a consortium of German [[Lurgi AG]] and Turkish Fernas Construction Ltd.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Depleted gas reservoirs==
The storage facilities of Northern Marmara and Değirmenköy were projected by the [[Türkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortaklığı|Turkish Petroleum Corporation]] (TPAO) in 1996. The depleted gas reservoirs went into service in July 2007. The Northern Marmara Reservoir is connected to the main processing plant of BOTAŞ by a {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long pipeline and the Değirmenköy Reservoir by a {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long pipeline.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

The storage capacity of the Northern Marmara Reservoir is {{convert|1600000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} and of the Değirmenköy Reservoir is {{convert|300000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}. While the maximum daily gas injection capacity is {{convert|11800000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}, the maximum withdrawal capacity per day is {{convert|15000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Currently, the Northern Marmara and Değirmenköy (Silivri) Depleted Gas Reservoir is the only underground natural gas storage facility in Turkey. It is operated by the TPAO.&lt;ref name="d1"/&gt;

==Capacity expansion==
The entire natural gas storage project is planned in three phases. The second phase involves the capacity expansion for the Değirmenköy facility, and the third phase for the Northern Marmara facility.&lt;ref name="tpao"/&gt; The second phase expansion project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2020, provides increasing of the daily injection capacity up to {{convert|29000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} and the maximum daily withdrawal capacity to {{convert|50000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="d1"/&gt; It is planned that the total storage capacity will be {{convert|4290000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}, the daily injection capacity {{convert|40000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} and the daily withdrawal capacity {{convert|75000000|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} after completion of the third phase.&lt;ref name="d1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">[[File:2013-10-15 10.56.49 HDR4.jpg|thumb|PTC rubber, a material for which the resistivity grows exponentially with increasing temperature up to a temperature where it ceases to conduct electricity. Above this temperature the material is an electrical insulator.]]
'''PTC rubber'''&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6,734,250&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[silicone rubber]] which conducts electricity with a [[resistivity]] that increases exponentially with increasing temperature for all temperatures up to a temperature where the [[resistivity]] grows to infinity. Above this temperature the PTC rubber is an [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]]. PTC rubber is made from  [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) loaded with [[carbon]] [[nanoparticle]]s. PTC stands for [[Positive temperature coefficient]].

==Properties==
If the [[electric field]] strength inside the material is large enough (typically larger than 30 V/mm), the carbon nanoparticles trigger a [[quantum mechanical]] [[tunneling effect]] current to flow through the material. The contribution from a large number of small tunneling effect currents can add up to macroscopic currents in the range of [[ampere]]s.
The quantum mechanical tunneling effect inside the material is highly temperature dependent. The current decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. This means that the resistivity of the material grows exponentially with increasing temperature. At a specific temperature the quantum mechanical tunneling effect current ceases. At temperatures higher than this the PTC rubber is an electrical insulator and no electrical current can flow through it. This temperature can be adjusted between 32 and 176 F (0 and 80 C) during the production of the PTC rubber. Hence, PTC rubber is a PTC material with very strong PTC characteristics. In fact, PTC rubber has the strongest PTC effect of all known materials, and over a wide temperature range. It has PTC properties for all temperatures.

==Applications==
The PTC rubber can be rolled into thin sheets and laminated with [[copper]]. The copper is in turn connected to a voltage to provide the electrical field inside the material necessary to trigger the [[tunneling effect]]. The sheets can be formed into any shape and size.

PTC rubber sheets can be used as thin flexible [[PTC heater]]s. These heaters will provide high power when they are cold and rapidly heat up themselves to a constant temperature and remain there virtually unaffected by changes in the ambient conditions. They can be powered with any voltage between 5 and 230&amp;nbsp;V, AC or DC.

The PTC rubber material is a [[self-regulating heater]]. It produces the same amount of heat in each point of the heater as is conducted and radiated away from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surroundings. It is in constant thermal equilibrium with the environment, point by point. A measure of the power produced by the heater is actually a measurement of the [[heat transfer]] between the heater and the object. Hence, it can be used as a heat transfer sensor.

[[File:USMC-120605-M-YE163-007.jpg|thumb|Paint remover is applied to an aircraft's landing gear during an inspection looking for cracks in the aluminum. USMC-120605-M-YE163-007]]
'''Paint stripper''', or '''paint remover''', is a product designed to remove [[paint]] and other finishes and also to clean the underlying surface. The removal of paint containing lead may lead to [[lead poisoning]] and is [[Lead-based paint in the United States|regulated]] in the United States. Other paint removal methods involve mechanical (scraping or sanding) or heat (hot air, radiant heat, or steam). A [[material safety data sheet]] will provide more safety information than on the product label.

==Types of chemical paint remover==
Chemical paint removers work only on certain types of finishes, and when multiple types of finishes may have been used on any particular surface, [[trial and error]] testing is typical to determine the best stripper for each application. Two basic categories of chemical paint removers are caustic and solvent.

===Caustics===
Caustic paint removers, typically [[sodium hydroxide]] (also known as lye or caustic soda), work by breaking down the [[chemical bonds]] of the paint, usually by [[hydrolysis]] of the chain bonds of the polymers forming the paint. Caustic removers must be neutralized or the new finish will fail prematurely. In addition, several side effects and health risks must be taken into account in using caustic paint removers. Such caustic aqueous solutions are typically used by [[antique dealer]]s who aim to restore old furniture by stripping off worn [[varnish]]es, for example.

===Solvents===
Solvent paint strippers penetrate the layers of paint and break the bond between the paint and the object by [[swelling (polymer science)|swelling]] the paint.&lt;ref name="Inc.2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Active Interest Media, Inc.|title=Old-House Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-af0BaxVFIC|date=2001-05 - 2001-06|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|issn=0094-0178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal active ingredient in historically common solvent paint strippers is [[dichloromethane]], also called methylene chloride, which has serious health risks including death,&lt;ref&gt;MacIsaac, J., Harrison, R., Krishnaswami, J., McNary, J., Suchard, J., Boysen-Osborn, M., Cierpich, H., Styles, L. and Shusterman, D. (2013), "Fatalities due to dichloromethane in paint strippers: A continuing problem". ''Am. J. Ind. Med.'' doi: 10.1002/ajim.22167
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.22167/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false accessed 6/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt; is likely a [[carcinogen]],&lt;ref name="(NIH)2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nat. Toxicology Program (NTP) (NIH)|title=Report on Carcinogens (12th Ed. )|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raW5FLj408QC|date=8 October 2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-8736-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other risks.

Solvent strippers may also have formulations with [[limonene|orange oil]] (or other [[terpene]] solvents), [[N-methylpyrrolidone]], [[ester]]s such as [[dibasic ester]]s (often dimethyl esters of shorter [[dicarboxylic acid]]s, sometimes aminated, for example, [[adipic acid]] or [[glutamic acid]]), [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, [[dimethylformamide]], and other solvents are known as well. The formula differs according to the type of paint and the character of the underlying surface. [[Nitromethane]] is another commonly used solvent. [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] is a less toxic alternative solvent used in some formulations.

Paint strippers come in a liquid, or a [[gel]] ("[[thixotropic]]") form that clings even to vertical surfaces.

The principle of paint strippers is penetration of the paint film by the molecules of the [[active ingredient]], causing its [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]; this volume increase causes internal strains, which, together with the weakening of the layer's [[adhesion]] to the underlying surface, leads to separation of the layer of the paint from the substrate.

===Other components===
Various co-solvents are added to the primary active ingredient. These assist with penetration into the paint and its removal and differ according to the target paint. [[Ethanol]] is suitable for [[shellac]], [[methyl ethyl ketone]] is used for [[cellulose nitrate]], and [[phenol]] and [[cresol]]s are employed in some industrial formulas.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Benzyl alcohol]] is used as well.

[[Catalyst|Activator]]s increase the penetration rate; for dichloromethane water is suitable, other choices are [[amine]]s, strong acids or strong [[alkali]]s. The activator's role is to disrupt the molecular and intermolecular bonds in the paint film and assist with weakening this. Its composition depends on the character of the paint to be removed. [[Mineral acid]]s are used for [[epoxy]] resins to [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] their [[ether]] bonds. Alkaline activators are usually based on [[sodium hydroxide]]. Some cosolvents double as activators. [[Amine]] activators, alkalines weaker than inorganic hydroxides, are favored when the substrate could be corroded by strong acids or bases.

[[Surfactant]]s assist with [[wetting]] the surface, increasing the area of where the solvent can penetrate the paint layer. Anionic surfactants (e.g., [[Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate|dodecyl benzenesulfonate]] or [[sodium xylene sulfonate]]) are used for acidic formulas, cationic or non-ionic are suitable for alkaline formulas.
Paint strippers containing surfactants are excellent brush cleaners.

[[Thickener]]s are used for [[thixotropic]] formulas to help the mixture form [[gel]] that adheres to vertical surfaces and to reduce the evaporation of the solvents, thus prolonging the time the solvent can penetrate the paint. [[Cellulose]]-based agents, e.g., [[hydroxypropyl cellulose]], are commonly used for mixtures that are not extremely acidic or basic; under such conditions cellulose undergoes hydrolysis and loses effectiveness, so fumed [[silica]] is used for these instead. Another possibility is using [[wax]]es (usually [[paraffin wax]] or [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]] derivatives), or [[polyacrylate]] gels.

[[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are added to the formula to protect the underlying substrate and the paint stripper storage vessel (usually a steel can) from [[corrosion]]. Dichloromethane decomposes with time to [[hydrochloric acid]], which readily reacts with [[propylene oxide]] or [[butylene oxide]] and therefore is removed from the solution. [[Chromate]]-based inhibitors give the mixture a characteristic yellow color. Other possibilities include [[polyphosphate]]s, [[silicate]]s, [[borate]]s and various [[antioxidant]]s.

[[Sequestrant]]s and [[chelating agent]]s are used to "disarm" metal ions present in the solution, which could otherwise reduce the efficiency of other components, and assist with cleaning stains, which often contain metal compounds. The most common sequestrants used in paint strippers are [[EDTA]], [[tributyl phosphate]], and [[sodium phosphate]].

[[Colourant|Colorants]] may be added.

==Alternatives==
[[Heat gun]]s are an alternative to chemical paint strippers. When heated, softened paint clumps and is easier to contain. High-temperature heat guns at {{convert|1,100|F|C|-1}} or more create toxic lead fumes in lead-based paint,&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, ''Reducing lead hazards when remodeling your home'' September 1997, 14. https://books.google.com/books?id=SQQUAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petit, Georges, and Donald Grant. ''The manufacture and comparative merits of white lead and zinc white paints''. London: Scott, Greenwood &amp; Son;, 1907. 13. Print. This source states that lead vapors are given off around {{convert|400|F|C|-1}} http://www.mediafire.com/view/1xyimc3wdo3/manufacturecompa00petirich.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but low-temperature heat guns and {{convert|400|F|C|-1}} infrared paint removers do not create lead fumes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Baker, "All About Exterior Paint", "This Old House Magazine" 2012. http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20586187_21145196,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Fire is a possible hazard of using heat guns.

Steam can be used on large surfaces or items to be stripped, such as window sash, can be placed inside a steam box.&lt;ref&gt;John, Leeke, "Getting up to speed on steam", ''Old-House Journal'' May–June 2006. 31-32. https://books.google.com/books?id=qW03wP0EynUC&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PenetratingFluidCan.jpg|thumb|200px|A 400&amp;nbsp;ml can of penetrating fluid]]
'''Penetrating oil''', also known as '''penetrating fluid''', is very low-[[viscosity]] [[oil]]. It can be used to free rusted mechanical parts (such as nuts and bolts) so that they can be removed, because it can penetrate into the narrow space between the threads of two parts.  It can also be used as a general-purpose [[lubricant]], a cleaner, or a [[corrosion]] stopper. Using penetrating fluids as  general-purpose lubricants is not advisable, because such oils are relatively [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]. As a result, much of the penetrating oil will evaporate in a short amount of time, leaving little residual lubricant.

Other uses include: removing chewing gum and adhesive stickers, lessening friction on metal-stringed musical instruments, various gardening purposes and household repair tasks.

'''''Pericopsis elata''''' is a species of flowering plant in the family ''[[Fabaceae]]'' and is known by the common names '''African teak''', '''afromosia''', '''afrormosia''', '''kokrodua''' and '''assamela'''.&lt;ref name="nils"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nils|first1=Bourland|last2=Lambert|first2=Kouadio Yao |last3=Philippe |first3=Lejeune |last4=Bonaventure|first4=Sonké|last5=Julien|first5=Philippart|last6=Kasso|first6=Daïnou |last7=Fousséni |first7=Fétéké|last8=Jean-Louis|first8=Doucet|title=Ecology of ''Pericopsis elata'' (Fabaceae), an Endangered Timber Species in Southeastern Cameroon|journal=Biotropica|date=November 2012 |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=840–847 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00874.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Range==
The species is native to moist, semi-deciduous forests in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/33191/9759606|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trada.co.uk/wood-species/afrormosia/ Wood Species Database: Afrormosia - TRADA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The species grows to 30-45m tall with a trunk of 1-1.5m in diameter. Annual diameter increases between unlogged and logged areas have been shown to be similar. It is a deciduous species that flowers at the end of the main dry season. The minimum trunk diameter for reproduction is given as 32&amp;nbsp;cm, while that for effective flowering is 37&amp;nbsp;cm. The fruit take 7 months to mature.&lt;ref name="nils"/&gt;

==Uses==
The tree produces hardwood timber of high commercial value due to its texture, strength, density and durability. It is used in the manufacture of boats, veneer and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wood-database.com/afrormosia/ Afrormosia - The Wood Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stocks and extraction==
The DRC has the world's largest remaining stocks of Afrormosia, which are largely confined to the [[Équateur (former province)|Équateur]] and [[Orientale Province]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illegal logging]] and [[habitat loss]] pose a realistic threat to the afrormosia, which ranks among the most valued hard tropical timber species.&lt;ref&gt;ITTO (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Following decades of extraction in the 20th and 21st century, it is ranked [[CITES#Appendix II|CITES Appendix II]]. This implies that it is subject to trade regulation because it is recognised that unregulated trade puts the species at risk of extinction. The factors that control its population dynamics are however imperfectly known.&lt;ref name="nils"/&gt; With a minimum logging diameter of 90&amp;nbsp;cm, full recovery is expected over a 30-year period. Selective logging of 12% of seed trees has been shown to have little influence on its survival. Sustainability is believed to be best achieved by purposeful actions to ensure regeneration after logging.&lt;ref name="nils"/&gt;

'''Polytetrafluoroethylene''' ('''PTFE''') is a synthetic [[fluoropolymer]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]] that has numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is '''Teflon''' by [[Chemours]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

PTFE is a [[fluorocarbon]] solid, as it is a high-[[molecular weight|molecular-weight]] compound consisting wholly of [[carbon]] and [[fluorine]]. PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.

PTFE is used as a [[non-stick]] coating for pans and other [[cookware]]. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon–fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. Also, it is frequently employed as [[coating]] on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.

== History ==

PTFE was accidentally discovered in 1938 by [[Roy Plunkett]] while he was working in New Jersey for DuPont. As Plunkett attempted to make a new [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerant, the [[tetrafluoroethylene]] gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling "empty." Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to the already known [[polyethylene]]) in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|inventor-last = Plunkett|inventor-first = Roy J|inventorlink = Roy Plunkett|issue-date = 4 February 1941|title = Tetrafluoroethylene polymers|country-code = US|patent-number = 2230654}}&lt;/ref&gt; and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.&lt;ref name="fluoroboom"&gt;{{cite news|title = History Timeline 1930: The Fluorocarbon Boom|url= http://www2.dupont.com/Refrigerants/en_US/sales_support/history_1930.html|accessdate =10 June 2009|publisher=''DuPont''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Roy Plunkett: 1938|url = http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1938_dupont/1938_indepth.html|accessdate =10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1948, DuPont, which founded Kinetic Chemicals in partnership with [[General Motors]], was producing over two million pounds (900 tons) of Teflon brand PTFE per year in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]]'', Fall 2010, vol. 25, no. 3, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; An early use was in the [[Manhattan Project]] as a material to coat valves and seals in the pipes holding highly reactive [[uranium hexafluoride]] at the vast [[K-25]] [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] plant in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name = "rhodes"&gt;

In 1954, the wife of French engineer Marc Grégoire urged him to try the material he had been using on fishing tackle on her cooking pans. He subsequently created the first PTFE-coated, non-stick pans under the brandname [[Tefal]] (combining "Tef" from "Teflon" and "al" from aluminium).&lt;ref name="history"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214150646/http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/teflon/index.html Teflon History ]", ''home.nycap.rr.com'', Retrieved 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Marion A. Trozzolo]], who had been using the substance on scientific utensils, marketed the first US-made PTFE-coated pan, "The Happy Pan", in 1961.&lt;ref name="intofire"&gt;Robbins, William (21 December 1986) "[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/us/teflon-maker-out-of-frying-pan-into-fame.html Teflon Maker: Out Of Frying Pan Into Fame ]", ''[[New York Times]]'', Retrieved 21 December 1986 (Subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tefal was not the only company to utilize PTFE in nonstick cookware coatings. In subsequent years, many cookware manufacturers developed proprietary PTFE-based formulas, including [[Swiss Diamond International]], which uses a diamond-reinforced PTFE formula;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swissdiamond.com/about-us/our-nonstick-technology Swiss Diamond Technology] Swiss Diamond International&lt;/ref&gt; Scanpan, which uses a titanium-reinforced PTFE formula;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scanpan.eu/en-GB/About-SCANPAN/Made-in-Denmark.aspx About SCANPAN] SCANPAN&lt;/ref&gt;  and both [[All-Clad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-clad.com/Pages/Customer%20Service/faqs.aspx FAQ's] "Is Nonstick Safe," All-Clad FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newell Rubbermaid]]'s Calphalon, which use a non-reinforced PTFE-based nonstick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calphalon.com/Product-Support/Pages/FAQs.aspx FAQ's] "Does your cookware contain Teflon®?" Calphalon FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; Other cookware companies, such as [[Meyer Corporation]]'s Anolon, use Teflon&lt;ref&gt;[http://meyer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/189/kw/nonstick%20coating%20made%20of Knowledge Base] Analon&lt;/ref&gt; nonstick coatings purchased from Chemours.

In the 1990s, it was found that PTFE could be radiation [[cross-linked]] above its melting point in an oxygen-free environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0969-806X(94)90226-7 |title=Modification of polytetrafluoroethylene by radiation—1. Improvement in high temperature properties and radiation stability|author= Sun, J.Z.|journal=Radiat. Phys. Chem. |year=1994|pages= 655–679|volume=44|issue=6|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994RaPC...44..655S}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electron beam processing]] is one example of radiation processing. Cross-linked PTFE has improved high-temperature mechanical properties and radiation stability. This was significant because, for many years, irradiation at ambient conditions has been used to break down PTFE for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-beamservices.com/chain.htm Electron Beam Processing of PTFE] E-BEAM Services website. Accessed 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This radiation-induced [[chain scission]] allows it to be more easily reground and reused.

== Production ==
PTFE is produced by [[free-radical]] [[polymerization]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]].  The net equation is
:  ''n'' F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → −(F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C−CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;−
Because tetrafluoroethylene can explosively decompose to tetrafluoromethane and carbon, special apparatus is required for the polymerization to prevent hot spots that might initiate this dangerous side reaction.  The process is typically initiated with [[persulfate]], which homolyzes to generate sulfate radicals:
:[O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO−OSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
The resulting polymer is terminated with [[sulfate ester]] groups, which can be hydrolyzed to give OH [[end-group]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Carlson, D. Peter and Schmiegel, Walter (2000) "Fluoropolymers, Organic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because PTFE is poorly soluble in almost all solvents, the polymerization is conducted as an emulsion in water.  This process gives a suspension of polymer particles.  Alternatively, the polymerization is conducted using a surfactant such as [[PFOS]].

[[File:Blintzes in frying pan.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE is often used to coat [[non-stick pan]]s as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.]]

PTFE is a [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]], which is a white solid at room temperature, with a density of about 2200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. According to Chemours, its melting point is {{convert|600|K}}.&lt;ref name=chemours&gt;[https://www.chemours.com/Teflon_Industrial/en_US/tech_info/techinfo_compare.html Fluoroplastic Comparison - Typical Properties] Retrieved 16 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains high strength, toughness and self-lubrication at low temperatures down to {{convert|5|K}}, and good flexibility at temperatures above {{convert|194|K}}.&lt;ref name=ptfe_handbook&gt;[http://www.rjchase.com/ptfe_handbook.pdf Teflon PTFE Properties Handbook] Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; PTFE gains its properties from the aggregate effect of [[carbon-fluorine bond]]s, as do all fluorocarbons. The only chemicals known to affect these carbon-fluorine bonds are highly reactive metals like the [[alkali metal]]s, and at higher temperatures also such metals as aluminium and magnesium, and fluorinating agents such as [[xenon difluoride]] and [[cobalt(III) fluoride]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080704112712/http://www.plastechcoatings.com/dupont_teflon_coating.html DuPont Teflon® Coatings]. plastechcoatings.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hemidactylus turcicus on teflon.webm|thumb|[[Gecko]]s cannot crawl up on teflon.]]
The [[coefficient of friction]] of plastics is usually measured against polished steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matweb.com/reference/coefficient-of-friction.asp Coefficient of Friction (COF) Testing of Plastics] MatWeb Material Property Data Retrieved 1 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; PTFE's coefficient of friction is 0.05 to 0.10,&lt;ref name=chemours/&gt; which is the third-lowest of any known solid material ([[Aluminium magnesium boride|BAM]] being the first, with a coefficient of friction of 0.02; [[diamond-like carbon]] being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE's resistance to [[van der Waals force]]s means that it is the only known surface to which a [[gecko]] cannot stick.&lt;ref name="gecko"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071014063923/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~peattiea/research_main.html Research into Gecko Adhesion ]", ''[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]'', 2007-10-14, Retrieved 8 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, PTFE can be used to prevent insects climbing up surfaces painted with the material. PTFE is so slippery that insects cannot get a grip and tend to fall off. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants climbing out of [[formicarium|formicaria]].

Because of its chemical inertness, PTFE cannot be [[cross-link]]ed like an [[elastomer]]. Therefore, it has no "memory" and is subject to [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Because of its superior chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as a gasket material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasketresources.com/ptfe-gaskets|title=PTFE Sheet {{!}} Gasket Resources Inc|last=Inc.|first=Gasket Resources|website=www.gasketresources.com|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers which exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, [[Belleville washer]]s are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of the gasket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealing.com/fileadmin/docs/Using_Bellville_springs_to_maintain_bolt_preload.pdf|title=Using Belleville Springs To Maintain Bolt Preload|last=Davet|first=George P.|work=Solon Mfg. Co.|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
Processing PTFE can be difficult and expensive, because the high melting temperature, {{convert|327|C}}, is above the initial decomposition temperature, {{convert|200|C}}.&lt;ref name="zapp"/&gt; Even when melted, PTFE does not flow, but instead behaves as a [[gel]] due to the absence of crystalline phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inoflon.com/pdf/PG_Free%20flow%20granular%20PTFE.pdf|title=Free Flow Granular PTFE|last=|first=|date=2017-08-16|website=Inoflon Fluoropolymers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high melt viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cowie.com/thermal.htm|title=COWIE TECHNOLOGY - PTFE: High Thermal Stability|website=www.cowie.com|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some PTFE parts are made by cold-moulding, a form of compression molding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daikinchem.de/downloads/PTFE-M.pdf|title=Polyflon PTFE Molding Powder|last=|first=|date=2017-08-16|website=Daikin Chemical|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, fine powdered PTFE is forced into a mould under high pressure (10–100 MPa).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After a settling period, lasting from minutes to days, the mould is heated at {{convert|360 to 380|C}},&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; allowing the fine particles to fuse into a single mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unraveling Polymers: PTFE |publisher=Poly Fouoro Ltd. |date=26 April 2011 |url=http://polyfluoroltd.blogspot.com/2011/04/ptfe-myths-busted.html |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and uses==

The major application of PTFE, consuming about 50% of production, is for wiring in aerospace and computer applications (e.g. hookup wire, coaxial cables).  This application exploits the fact that PTFE has excellent [[dielectric]] properties,&lt;ref name="MishraYagci"&gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Vinyl Polymers: Radical Polymerization, Process, and Technology, Second Edition |edition=2nd, illustrated, revised |first1=Munmaya |last1=Mishra |first2=Yusuf |last2=Yagci |publisher=CRC Press |year=208 |isbn=978-0-8247-2595-2 |page=574 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC&amp;pg=PA574 Extract of page 574]&lt;/ref&gt; especially at high [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]],&lt;ref name="MishraYagci" /&gt; making it suitable for use as an excellent [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] in [[electrical connector|connector]] assemblies and [[Electrical cable|cable]]s, and in [[printed circuit board]]s used at [[microwave]] frequencies. Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes it the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker and lower-melting-point [[polyethylene]] commonly used in low-cost applications.

In industrial applications, owing to its low friction, PTFE is used for [[plain bearing]]s, [[gear]]s, [[slide plate]]s, seals, gaskets, bushings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.espemfg.com/teflon-machining-fabrication.html|title=Teflon Machining &amp; Fabrication {{!}} ESPE|website=www.espemfg.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]] and [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Mishra &amp; Yagci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC&amp;pg=PA573 p 573]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Its extremely high bulk [[resistivity]] makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life [[electret]]s, the [[electrostatic]] analogues of [[magnet|permanent magnets]].&lt;ref name="MishraYagci" /&gt;

PTFE film is also widely used in the production of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.

Because of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.

[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]], US,  was one of the largest applications of PTFE coatings. {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of the material was used in the creation of the white double-layered PTFE-coated fiberglass dome.

PTFE is often found in musical instrument lubrication product; most commonly, valve oil.

PTFE is used in some aerosol lubricant sprays, including in micronized and polarized form. It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.

[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]

The sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers à repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

Other niche applications include:
*It is often found in ski bindings as a non-mechanical AFD (anti-friction device) 
*It can be stretched to contain small pores of varying sizes and is then placed between fabric layers to make a waterproof, breathable fabric in outdoor apparel.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infinitymotorcycles.com/news/a-motorcyclists-guide-to-gore-tex/119 |title=A Motorcyclist's Guide To Gore-Tex|publisher=Infinity Motorcycles}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is used widely as a fabric protector to repel stains on formal school-wear, like uniform blazers.&lt;ref name=CutterAndTailor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cutterandtailor.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=852|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Teflon-coated Covert Cloth|work=The Cutter and Tailor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is used as a film interface patch for sports and medical applications, featuring a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, which is installed in strategic high friction areas of footwear, insoles, [[ankle-foot orthosis]], and other medical devices to prevent and relieve friction-induced blisters, calluses and foot ulceration.&lt;ref name=FilmInterfacePatch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oandp.org/jpo/library/popup.asp?xmlpage=2006_04_093&amp;type=image&amp;id=f11 |title=Film Interface Patch |publisher=American Academy of Orthotists &amp; Prosthetists}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Expanded PTFE membranes have been used in trials to assist [[trabeculectomy]] surgery to treat glaucoma.&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang X, Khan R, Coleman A |title= Device-modified trabeculectomy for glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |pages= CD010472 |date=2015 |pmid= 26625212 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010472.pub2|pmc=4715269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Powdered PTFE is used in [[pyrotechnic composition]]s as an [[oxidizer]] with powdered metals such as [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]]. Upon ignition, these mixtures form carbonaceous [[soot]] and the corresponding metal [[fluoride]], and release large amounts of heat. They are used in [[infrared decoy flare]]s and as [[igniter]]s for [[solid-fuel rocket]] [[propellant]]s.&lt;ref name=koch&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koch, E.-C. |title=Metal-Fluorocarbon Pyrolants:III.

| issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium and PTFE is also used in some [[thermobaric]] fuel compositions.
*Powdered PTFE is used in a suspension with a low-viscosity, azeotropic mixture of siloxane ethers to create a lubricant for use in twisty puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thecubicle.us/lubicle-p-9146.html|title=Lubicle 1|website=TheCubicle.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In optical [[radiometry]], sheets of PTFE are used as measuring heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., [[illuminance]] meters and [[Ultraviolet|UV]] [[radiometer]]s) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide range of wavelengths, from UV down to near [[infrared]]. In this region, the ratio of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] (PTFE sheet) radiates like [[Lambert's cosine law]]. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar [[irradiance]] measurements.
*Certain types of bullets are coated with PTFE to reduce wear on the rifling of firearms that uncoated projectiles would cause. PTFE itself does not give a projectile an armor-piercing property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.guncite.com/ktwint.html|title=Interview with an inventor of the KTW bullet|journal=NRAction newsletter|volume =4|issue =5 |date=May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Its high corrosion resistance makes PTFE useful in laboratory environments, where it is used for lining containers, as a coating for magnetic stirrers, and as tubing for highly corrosive chemicals such as [[hydrofluoric acid]], which will dissolve glass containers. It is used in containers for storing [[fluoroantimonic acid]], a [[superacid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/08/the-worlds-strongest-acids.html |title=The World's Strongest Acids: Like Fire and Ice |last=Pomeroy |first=Ross |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2016-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*PTFE tubes are used in gas-gas heat exchangers in gas cleaning of waste incinerators. Unit power capacity is typically several megawatts.
*PTFE is widely used as a [[thread seal tape]] in plumbing applications, largely replacing paste thread dope.
*PTFE membrane filters are among the most efficient industrial air filters. PTFE-coated filters are often used in [[dust collection system]]s to collect [[aerosol|particulate matter]] from air streams in applications involving high temperatures and high particulate loads such as coal-fired power plants, cement production and steel foundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baghouse.com/2012/05/28/industrial-air-permits-new-clean-air-regulations-and-baghouses/|title=Industrial Air Permits - New Clean Air Regulations And Baghouses|publisher=Baghouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*PTFE grafts can be used to bypass [[stenosis|stenotic]] [[artery|arteries]] in peripheral vascular disease if a suitable autologous [[vein]] graft is not available.
* Many bicycle lubricants and greases contain PTFE and are used on [[bicycle chain|chains]] and other moving parts subjected to frictional forces (such as [[Bicycle wheel#Bearings|hub bearings]]).
* PTFE can also be used for [[dental fillings]], to isolate the contacts of the anterior tooth so the filling materials will not stick to the adjacent tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dentistrytoday.com/restorative-134/1864--sp-1460991174|title=Using Plumber's Teflon Tape to Enhance Bonding Procedures|first=Dennis E. | last=Brown, DDS|work=Dentistry Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape as a matrix in operative dentistry.|last=Dunn|first=WJ|display-authors=etal|journal=Operative Dentistry|pmid=15279489|volume=29|pages=470–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PTFE sheets are used in the production of [[butane hash oil]] due to its non-stick properties and resistance to non-polar solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Buds |first=Ed |last=Rosenthal |publisher=Quick American Archives |edition=Revised |date=21 October 2014 |isbn=1936807238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PTFE, associated with a slightly textured laminate, makes the plain bearing system of a [[Dobsonian telescope]].
* PTFE is widely used as a non-stick coating for food [http://www.surfacetechnology.co.uk/surface-coatings/fluoropolymer-coating/ processing equipment]; dough hoppers, mixing bowls, conveyor systems, rollers, and chutes. PTFE can also be reinforced where abrasion is present – for equipment processing seeded or grainy dough for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.surfacetechnology.co.uk/surface-coatings/fluoropolymer-coating/|title=Fluoropolymer PTFE coating services from Surface Technology UK|work=Surface Technology|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PTFE has been experimented with for [[electroless nickel plating]].

== Safety ==
[[Pyrolysis]] of PTFE is detectable at {{convert|200|C}}, and it evolves several [[fluorocarbon]] gases and a [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]]. An animal study conducted in 1955 concluded that it is unlikely that these products would be generated in amounts significant to health at temperatures below {{convert|250|C}}.&lt;ref name="zapp"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zapp JA, Limperos G, Brinker KC |title= Toxicity of pyrolysis products of 'Teflon' tetrafluoroethylene resin |journal= Proceedings of the American Industrial Hygiene Association Annual Meeting |date=26 April 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While PTFE is stable and nontoxic at lower temperatures, it begins to deteriorate after the temperature of cookware reaches about {{convert|260|C}}, and decomposes above {{convert|350|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Polytetrafluouroethylene: PTFE Sheets &amp; PTFE Coatings from Porex|url = http://www.porex.com/technologies/materials/porous-plastics/polytetrafluoroethylene/|website = www.porex.com|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation by-products can be lethal to [[bird]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=DuPont|title=Key Safety Questions About Teflon Nonstick Coatings|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Teflon/en_US/products/safety/key_questions.html#q6|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause [[flu-like symptoms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DuPont|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Teflon/en_US/products/safety/key_questions.html#q5|title=Key Safety Questions about the Safety of Nonstick Cookware}}&lt;/ref&gt; in humans—see [[polymer fume fever]]. Meat is usually fried between {{convert|204 and 232|C}}, and most oils start to [[smoke point|smoke]] before a temperature of {{convert|260|C|F}} is reached, but there are at least two cooking oils (refined [[safflower oil]] at {{convert|265|C}} and [[avocado oil]] at {{convert|271|C}}) that have a higher [[smoke point]].

=== PFOA ===
{{Main|Perfluorooctanoic acid}}
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8) has been used as a [[surfactant]] in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of PTFE, although several manufacturers have entirely discontinued its use.

PFOA persists indefinitely in the environment. It is a [[toxicant]] and [[carcinogen]] in animals. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. The general population has been exposed to PFOA through massive dumping of C8 waste into the ocean and near the Ohio River Valley.&lt;ref name="NYTmagazine"&gt;{{cite news|last1=RIch|first1=Nathaniel|title=The Lawyer Who Became Dupont's Worst Nightmare|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html|website=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Mariah|title=Welcome to Beautiful Parkersburg, West Virginia Home to one of the most brazen, deadly corporate gambits in U.S. history.|url=http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/welcome-to-beautiful-parkersburg/|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellner-16June2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fellner |first1=Carrie |title=Toxic Secrets: Professor ‘bragged about burying bad science’ on 3M chemicals |url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/toxic-secrets-professor-bragged-about-burying-bad-science-on-3m-chemicals-20180615-p4zlsc.html |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain resistant carpets, carpet cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food and Teflon cookware.
As a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was probably an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, [[ulcerative colitis]], thyroid disease, [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high cholesterol), and pregnancy-induced hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nicole | first1 = W. | title = PFOA and Cancer in a Highly Exposed Community: New Findings from the C8 Science Panel | doi = 10.1289/ehp.121-A340 | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 121 | issue = 11–12 | pages = A340 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24284021| pmc = 3855507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, PTFE cookware is considered an insignificant exposure pathway to PFOA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Similar polymers ==
[[File:PFA structure.PNG|thumb|Teflon is also used as the trade name for a polymer with similar properties, perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA)]]

The Teflon trade name is also used for other polymers with similar compositions:

* [[Perfluoroalkoxy alkane]] (PFA)
* [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP)

These retain the useful PTFE properties of low friction and nonreactivity, but are more easily formable. For example, FEP is softer than PTFE and melts at {{convert|533|K}}; it is also highly transparent and resistant to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100724195156/http://www.texloc.com/closet/cl_fep_properties.htm FEP Detailed Properties], Parker-TexLoc, 13 April 2006.

'''''ReNew'' magazine''' (currently subtitled '''''ReNew: technology for a sustainable future''''') is an [[Australia]]n magazine covering domestic [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[sustainability|sustainable culture]]. Originally a [[zine|small magazine]], printed and distributed locally in [[Melbourne]], it was first published by the Alternative Energy [[Co-operative]] in 1980 as '''''Soft Technology: Alternative Energy in Australia'''''. Although it sold for the high cover price of [[AUD|$]]0.85, the magazine's circulation increased so rapidly that by issue 35, published in February 1991, it included a full colour cover. The price was increased from $2.50 to $3 and national distribution rights secured for issue 40, published in June the following year. A total of 13,000 copies were printed. The magazine was renamed, after much deliberation, under the present title in 1996.

'''Siberian natural resources''' refers to resources found in [[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], in the North Asian Mainland. The Siberian region is rich in resources, including [[coal]], [[oil]] and metal ores

==Contribution to Soviet economy==
Siberia’s contribution to the Soviet economy in percent of national output was given in Soviet statistical yearbooks for 1973 (1940 in brackets) as: Coal 33% (23%), Coking coal 30% (17%), Oil 21% (1.6%), Natural gas 8.5% (from 1.5% in 1950), Electric power output 18% (6.6%), Iron ore 6.9% (1.6%), Pig iron 9.5% (10%), Crude steel 8.3% (10%), Rolled steel 10% (9.1%). But regional breakdowns were omitted in the yearbooks from 1973, except for a few 1975 figures.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Shabad and Victor L. Mote: ''Gateway to Siberian Resources (The BAM)'' p. 54 (Halstead Press/John Wiley, New York, 1977) {{ISBN|0-470-99040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy sources==
===Coal===
In the important [[Chelyabinsk]] coalfields, production rose from 390,000 tonnes in 1925 to 3,519,000 tonnes in 1936. The total production for the East Urals was 8,080,000 tonnes in 1937.  Reserves for the following coalfields are shown in millions of [[tonne]]s:

*[[East Urals]]: ([[Triassic]] [[lignite]]): 2,872
*[[Karaganda]] ([[Low Carboniferous period]], for [[coking]]): 52,696
*[[Kuznets]] ([[Permian]], for coking): 450,658
*[[Minusinsk]] (Permian): 20,612
*[[Chulym River (Ob River)|Chulym]]-[[Yenisei]]: ([[Jurassic]] lignite): 43,000
*[[Kansk]]: (Jurassic lignite): 42,000
*[[Irkutsk]] and [[Transbaikalia]] (Jurassic): 81,397
*[[Bureya, Russia|Bureya]]: 26,116
*[[Partizanskaya River|Suchan]] (for coking): 42,000
*[[Yenisei River|Tunguska]] (low Carboniferous): 400,000
*[[Lena, Russia|Lena]] ([[Mesozoic]]): 60,000

====Kuznetsk Coal Zone====
The development of the coal fields of [[Kuznetsk Basin]], (sometimes called the "Kuzbass") transformed the Siberian [[steppe]]. The south sector of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] became a great industrial center because of the activity surrounding the coalfields. These ancient reserves of 13,000,000,000 tonnes grew to 450,658,000,000 tonnes. In 1937, the 50 mines in this area produced a total of 17,300,000 tonnes. The coal production of this zone was comparable with that of all of [[British India]], and half of that produced by Japan. Kuznetsk coal was the best in the USSR, with high energy and low [[sulphur]] content. The total [[anthracite]] reserve was 54 million tonnes; and was used in the Ural-Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine. Siberia is also the coldest winters to survive, this includes freezing temperature such as -50 degrees.

====Other coal deposits====
Another important reserve is at Karaganda near the [[Magnitogorsk]] (Magnet City) Higt Ovens. Production in 1937 was 3,937,200 tonnes. Other important coal deposits are: Minusinsk near [[Chernogorsk]], which joins the mining zone of Chulym-Yenisei at the [[Yenisei river]]; the Kansk deposits north of [[Krasnoyarsk]]; the Irkutsk deposits, which yielded 3,000,000 tonnes from the Cheremkovo mine in 1937; the Lake Baikal deposits; the Lena sector; the Norilsk sector in Tunguska mining zone; the Sangar Khai founts in the [[Amur River]] and [[Bureya River]]s near Vladivostok, the Artem and Suchan mines with 1937 production of 2,110,000 tonnes and 590,000 tonnes respectively; and the Sakhalin coal deposits in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains in central Asia.

In the [[Minusinsk]] area, the estimated reserves are 20,612,000,000 tonnes; the Chulym-Yenisei mine is estimated at 43,000,000,000 tonnes; the Kansk sources estimated at 42,000,000,000 tonnes; and Cheremkhovo estimated at 79,000,000,000 tonnes.  The Kuznets area has excellent coal for coke, chemical and gas production. Production in 1913 was 774,000 tonnes.  In 1927, these mines extracted about 2,600,000 tonnes to maintain one extraction of 16,800,000 tonnes.  The modernized Prokopyevsk mine has an expected production capacity of about 3,200,000 tonnes.  The other sources are in Stalinsk (Kuznets), Lenin-Kuznets, Kemerovo, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Chernogorsk, and Cheremkhovo

===Petroleum===
The Siberian petroleum sources follow (in metric tonnes - 1 metric tonne of petroleum is equivalent to 5 or 10 barrels, or 42 gallons, depending on the [[density]])

*Emba: 1,190,400,000
*Perm-Kama: 3,540,000,000
*Other Zones at West Urals and Volga: 471,500,000
*Sakhalin: 339,800,000
*Central Asia: 427,100,000

Table of Total production (for 45 oil well areas)
*1901: 11,000,000
*1913: 7,627,000
*1920: 2,915,000
*1928: 11,625,400
*1932: 21,413,200
*1936: 27,337,700

The most important Siberian petroleum zones are the [[West Siberian petroleum basin]], Central Urals, Sakhalin Island, Nordvyl on the Arctic Siberian coast, and the Kamchatka peninsula.  From the [[Caspian Sea]] there is one oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], which continues to the petrol camps of Emba at Orsk and ends in [[Omsk]], in western Siberia.  Sakhalin Island has the most important [[oil reserves]] in the Russian Far East. In 1936, the Ohka oil wells extracted about 470,000 tonnes;  one-third were obtained for Japanese concessionaires. In the Emba River area about 466,000 tonnes were extracted from about 20 pits of a total of 300 yaciments in 1937.

Total USSR oil production was 230,700,000 tonnes and there exist other reserves of 652,000,000 tonnes.

===Electrical power generation===
The third source of energy is hydro [[electricity]].  The region boasts large rivers capable of accommodating in-river hydro plants of 1000 MW and more per project. This potential was realised at an early stage, leading to investigations into the hydro potential of Pamir Tien-Shan and other East Siberian hydro resources.  Today these hydro systems contribute roughly 40% of the electricity produced in Russia's Second Electricity Zone (Siberia) and helps to explain why the wholesale electricity prices in Zone 2 are structurally cheaper than in Zone 1 (European Russia). 

In 2011, Russia's electricity consumption totalled 1022 TWh, of which Hydropower contributed 63TWh. These energy producing and disposes in 50% of time raised in about 280.690 [[gigawatt]]s (GW), between of theirs based in one disposition of 95% stay 58 GW.

To increase output, studies were made of the Lena, Yenisei and Ob river systems.  In the Lenin Program in 1920, proposed construction of power systems in the Urals, Yenisei, [[Angara River]] and [[Lake Baikal]]. Some of these projects are similar to the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the [[Columbia River]].

A major hydroelectric powerplant was constructed in 1932 on the Dnieper River, at a high latitude in Zaporozhe. But it was destroyed in 1941 by retreating Soviet forces during World War II. The plant had a production capacity of 900 MW, was about 2,500 feet long, and rose 125 feet above water level. In 1940 the total production capacity was 2.5 GW. The new plan proposed plants on a gigantic scale, on the Angara river. Planned output was 9 GW, with four other plants in high Yenisei producing about 4 GW more.

==Iron deposits==
Siberian iron sources were more assorted. They are at [[Magnitogorsk]], [[Nizhni Tagil]] deposits in the south of Kuznetsk, the [[Angara River]] reserves, and Russian Far East mines.

The mines of the [[Urals]] have been known since 1702: Magnitogorsk
with annual extraction of 6,000,000 tonnes in 1931, minerals being 
[[magnetite]] and secondarily [[martite]], with 55% or 66% of iron content. The
other and oldest center was in Ninshi-Tagil. The total Ural iron reserves were 1,390,670,000 tonnes, of which one-third are [[limonite]]
and about 450,000,000 correspond directly at Magnitogorsk. When the deposits
in Kuznets began to be exploited, in 1930 recent discovered the [[Mountainous Shoria]] iron deposits, with reserves calculated as 292,412,000
tonnes, 45% iron content, and the Karaganda deposits. The other 
important founts stay in Petrovsk-Zabaikal near Baikal Lake, and
the Little Khingan Mountains in the Soviet side of the frontier.

Other iron resources in East Siberia are the Angara and Ilim river areas northwest of Baikal Lake, with production of 420,850,000 tonnes. No less than 30% of USSR iron production in the USSR was obtained in the Kuznets zone in 1937.

Iron deposits:
*Urals: sources of these mineral exist in Nizhni-Tagil, Zlatoust and Magnitogorsk, with a total production of 2,600,000 tonnes in 1937.
*[[Gornaya Shoria]]: exist iron, in Magnetite form, inside of Calize mineral why poses one 45% of iron content, but more Sulphur.
*Ridder: if extracted iron mixed with lead and zinc. Your total production in 1936 are about 1,000 tonnes. At the same time in the same mine extracted gold, copper and tin.

==Other minerals and general observations==
*[[Manganese]]: mined in the Urals, [[Kazakhstan]] and west of [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Their extractions effectuated in Achinsk Mine with one mineral with 20 or 25% of purity. The total production in 1937 was about 100,000 tonnes.
*[[Copper]]: possess ample reserves in Urals and Kazakhastan. Its total production in 1930 was 34,105 tonnes, increasing in 1936 to 83,000 tonnes. In East Kazakhastan exist the Yaciment of Kounrad, their minerals are composed of less than 2% copper, and these extraction are uneconomic. And the mine of [[Djezkazgan]] with double production why mentioned mine above.
*[[Pyrite]]: the founts of these mineral stay in diverse sites, such as Krasnouralsk and Orsk.
*[[Lead]] and [[zinc]]: the sources stay in the Siberian areas of Ridder Mine in Altai, Transbaikalia and Maritime Province. The total production of lead and zinc in 1936 were 55,000 and 63,000 tonnes respectively.
*[[Aluminum]]: the sources of these material stay in North Urals, in Khabakovsk ancient, [[Nadezhdinsk]], and south Urals in [[Kamensk]]. The USSR has a total production of aluminum in 1939 of 60,000 tonnes.
*[[Nickel]]: the most important deposits are in [[Norilsk]], near low Yenisei. Local production was 3,000 tonnes in 1938.
*[[Gold]]: Was believed to be mined before in the Urals and in Siberia from medieval times. The estimates in 1936, mentioned about 5,173,000 oz, which then reduced later to about 4,500,000 oz.{{cn|date=March 2017}} These deposits exist near the Aldan and Kolyma rivers in Yakutia and others in Central Asia and the Urals.
*[[Chromium]]: In the Urals mountains was obtained 200,000 tonnes of [[chromite]].
*Tin and Tungsten: there exist deposits of these minerals in the East Baikal Area and Kazakhstan.
*[[Borax]] and [[Potash]]: These minerals are exploited in great quantities in [[Solikamsk]]. The local production was 1,800,000 tonnes in 1937. The total reserves of potash are estimated at 15,000 tonnes, and magnesium stay in about 18,000,000 tonnes. In [[Lake Inder]] (central Asia) there is 30,000 tonnes.
*[[Asbestos]]: This mineral was extracted in an Asbestos mine near Sverdlovsk in the Urals from 1889. The fiber is found in [[Peridotite]], as in [[Quebec]] and [[Rhodesia]]. Other deposits exist in Altai Sayan. The Ural reserves are about 17,500,000 tonnes of fiber with more than 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm in length, so adequate for internal requirements. The USSR is in second place for production of these mineral with a yield of 100,000 tonnes.
*[[Talc]] and [[Steatite]]: deposits of these minerals exist in the Urals in great quantity.
*[[Magnesium]]: Apart from the sources of borax, there are also pure magnesium deposits in Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk, with production of 800,000 tonnes.
*Halite ([[rock salt]]): The extractions of these element are in Solikamsk in the Urals.
*Common salt: This is recovered from the Aral Sea.
*[[Precious stones|Precious Stones and Gems]]: The Urals have many sources of these, including [[beryllium]], [[amethyst]], [[topaz]], [[malachite]], [[alejandrie]], [[zirconium]], etc.  The [[Mir Mine]] in [[Mirny, Sakha Republic]] was the largest (by area) open pit [[diamond]] mine in the world till closure in 2012.
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]: Important sources are in the Urals Mountains.
*[[Mirabilite]]: Sources are in the Kara-Bogaz gulf.

===Coal===
The existence of coal, estimated at 400,000,000,000 tonnes, was about a quarter of the Asian total, or half of the European reserves. The principal coal mining valleys and basins are:
*Kuznetsk Basin
*Irkutsk Valley
*Minusinsk Basin
*Kirguiz Steppe Valleys (Karaganda Basin)
*Sakhalin Island (Alexandrovsk Valley)
*Maritime Provinces
*Tunguska Basin
*Bureisk Valley

During the interwar years, major production was in the Kuznetsk Basin; the Carboniferous Basin of Irkutsk extends joining
at Transiberian railway, in 480&amp;nbsp;km, and the Maritime province near the Vladivostok area.

===Petrol===
Petrol is encounter on north section of Sakhalin island, and their exploitation are accord topic between Japanese and Russians. Other sources are in the Kamchatka or Ohkostk coasts, but the rest of Siberia did not promise much, with the exception of petrol pits in Central Asia or the Urals. These last (referring to the Turkestan zone) are one extension of Caucasian petrol zone and the mentioned Ural petrol sources.

===Gold===
Gold is often found in Siberia; currently the principal mining districts are in the Olekma-Vitim region of the Lena Valley. During the period 1910-1914, the Siberian gold mines extracted an average of 46,655&amp;nbsp;kg and employed 57,000 workers. Exploited deposits are of [[placer deposit|placer]] gold. The joint British Russian Company, [[The Lena Gold-Mining Partnership (Lenzoloto)|Lena Gold Mining Joint Stock Company (Lenzoloto)]], owned and operated the "Lena Goldfields" -- much of the region's gold production. Their mistreatment of workers ultimately led to the [[Lena massacre]] which ignited the [[Russian Revolution]]; the British shareholders secured compensation from the Soviet government in 1935. Russia remains the second biggest gold producer in the world, while using modern workplace standards.

===Copper===
Especially important in the Kirguises Steppes, in the Altai ranges and the Yenisei river basin.

===Zinc, lead and silver===
[[Zinc]] is a natural resource.

===Iron===
Stay more distributed and are exploited. The most important are Telbes Mine (Kuznetsk coal basin), Minusinsk, Yenisei
valley, Olga territory (Maritime Province) and the Irkutsk area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10664">In [[fluid mechanics]] the term '''static pressure''' has several uses:
* In the design and operation of [[aircraft]], ''static pressure'' is the air pressure in the aircraft’s [[Pitot-static system#Static pressure|static pressure system]].
* In [[fluid dynamics]], many authors use the term ''static pressure'' in preference to just ''pressure'' to avoid ambiguity. Often however, the word ‘static’ may be dropped and in that usage [[pressure]] is the same as static pressure at a nominated point in a fluid.  
* The term ''static pressure'' is also used by some authors in [[fluid statics]].

== Static pressure in design and operation of aircraft ==
An aircraft’s [[altimeter]] is operated by the [[Pitot-static system#Static pressure|static pressure system]]. An aircraft’s [[airspeed indicator]] is operated by the static pressure system and the [[Pitot-static system#Pitot pressure|pitot pressure system]].&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, D.A., ''Aircraft Systems'', 2nd edition – chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The static pressure system is open to the exterior of the aircraft to sense the pressure of the atmosphere at the [[Altitude#Altitude in Aviation|altitude]] at which the aircraft is flying. This small opening is called the [[Pitot-static system#Pitot-static pressure|static port]]. In flight the air pressure is slightly different at different positions around the exterior of the aircraft. The aircraft designer must select the position of the [[Pitot-static system#Pitot-static pressure|static port]] carefully. There is no position on the exterior of an aircraft at which the air pressure, for all [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], is identical to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.&lt;ref&gt;"It is virtually impossible to find a position where the static pressure is always exactly the same as the pressure in the free airstream away from the aircraft". Kermode, A.C., ''Mechanics of Flight'', 10th edition – page 65&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in pressure causes a small error in the altitude indicated on the altimeter, and the [[airspeed]] indicated on the airspeed indicator. This error in indicated altitude and airspeed is called [[position error]].&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, A.C., ''Mechanics of Flight'', 10th Edition – page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Of these errors the error in detection of static pressure is generally the most serious and has the special name, ''position error''." Dommasch, D.O., Sherby, S.S., and Connolly, T.F. (1967) ''Airplane Aerodynamics'', 4th edition – page 51, Pitman Publishing Corp., New York&lt;/ref&gt;

When selecting the position for the static port, the aircraft designer’s objective is to ensure the pressure in the aircraft’s static pressure system is as close as possible to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying, across the operating range of weight and airspeed. Many authors describe the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying as the ''[[freestream]] static pressure''. At least one author takes a different approach in order to avoid a need for the expression ''freestream static pressure''. Gracey has written "The static pressure is the atmospheric pressure at the flight level of the aircraft".&lt;ref&gt;Gracey, William, [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800015804_1980015804.pdf ''Measurement of aircraft speed and altitude''] NASA, RP-1046, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gracey, William, ''Measurement of Aircraft Speed and Altitude'', page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Gracey then refers to the air pressure at any point close to the aircraft as the ''local static pressure''.

== Static pressure in fluid dynamics ==
The concept of [[pressure]] is central to the study of fluids. A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion. Pressure can be [[Pressure measurement|measured]] using an [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid]], [[Pressure measurement#Bourdon|Bourdon tube]], mercury column, or various other methods.

The concepts of ''total pressure'' and ''[[dynamic pressure]]'' arise from [[Bernoulli's equation]] and are significant in the study of all fluid flows. (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense - they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.) To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to [[pressure]] in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term ''static pressure'' to distinguish it from ''total pressure'' and ''dynamic pressure''; the term ''static pressure'' is identical to the term ''pressure'', and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.

In ''Aerodynamics'', L.J. Clancy&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', page 21&lt;/ref&gt; writes: "To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures, the actual pressure of the fluid, which is associated not with its motion but with its state, is often referred to as the static pressure, but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure."

[[Bernoulli's equation]] is fundamental to the dynamics of incompressible fluids. In many fluid flow situations of interest, changes in elevation are insignificant and can be ignored. With this simplification, Bernoulli’s equation for incompressible flows can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', equation 3.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurt, H.H. Jr, (1960), ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', page 9, A National Flightshop Reprint, Florida&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D. Jr, ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', 4th edition – page 212, McGraw-Hill, New York.  {{ISBN|978-0-07-295046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P + \tfrac12 \rho v^2 = P_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;/math&gt; is static pressure,
*&lt;math&gt;\tfrac12 \rho v^2&lt;/math&gt; is [[dynamic pressure]], usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the fluid,
*&lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow velocity]], and
*&lt;math&gt;P_0\;&lt;/math&gt; is total pressure which is constant along any [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]]. It is also known as the [[stagnation pressure]].

Every point in a steadily flowing fluid, regardless of the fluid speed at that point, has its own static pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, dynamic pressure &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and total pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;. Static pressure and dynamic pressure are likely to vary significantly throughout the fluid but total pressure is constant along each streamline. In [[Conservative vector field#Irrotational flows|irrotational flow]], total pressure is the same on all streamlines and is therefore constant throughout the flow.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Kuethe and J.D. Schetzer (1959), ''Foundations of Aerodynamics'', Section 3.5 (2nd edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York {{ISBN|0-471-50952-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplified form of Bernoulli's equation can be summarised in the following memorable word equation:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”The total pressure is composed of two parts, the static pressure and the dynamic pressure”.  Streeter, V.L., ''Fluid Mechanics'' 4th edition – page 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bern.html NASA's guide to Bernoulli's Equation]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''static pressure + dynamic pressure = total pressure''.

This simplified form of Bernoulli’s equation is fundamental to an understanding of the design and operation of ships, low speed aircraft, and airspeed indicators for low speed aircraft – that is aircraft whose maximum speed will be less than about 30% of the [[speed of sound]].

As a consequence of the widespread understanding of the term ''static pressure'' in relation to Bernoulli’s equation, many authors&lt;ref&gt;For example: Abbott, I.H. and Von Doenhoff, A.E. (1949) ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Navier-Stokes equations - section 5.4. Dover Publications, Inc., New York.  Standard Book Number 486-60586-8&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of fluid dynamics also use ''static pressure'' rather than ''pressure'' in applications not directly related to Bernoulli’s equation.

The [[British Standards Institution]], in its Standard&lt;ref&gt;British Standard BS 185: Part 1: 1950 ''Glossary of Aeronautical Terms''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glossary of Aeronautical Terms'', gives the following definition:
:''4412 '''Static pressure''' The pressure at a point on a body moving with the fluid.''

== Static pressure in fluid statics ==
The term ''[[Hydrostatics#Hydrostatic pressure|(hydro)static pressure]]'' is sometimes used in [[fluid statics]] to refer to the [[pressure]] of a fluid at a nominated depth in the fluid. In fluid statics the fluid is stationary everywhere and the concepts of dynamic pressure and total pressure are not applicable. Consequently, there is little risk of ambiguity in using the term ''pressure'', but some authors&lt;ref&gt;For example: "The pressure in cases where no motion is occurring is referred to as static pressure." Curtis D. Johnson, [http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/190 Process Control Instrumentation Technology], Prentice Hall (1997) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119225401/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/190 |date=January 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; choose to use ''static pressure'' in some situations.

is a solution technique for the [[Langevin equation]], which is the relevant form of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's 2nd law]] for a [[Brownian motion|Brownian particle]]. The method treats the suspended particles in a discrete sense while the continuum approximation remains valid for the surrounding fluid, i.e., the suspended particles are generally assumed to be significantly larger than the molecules of the solvent. The particles then interact through hydrodynamic forces transmitted via the continuum fluid, and when the particle [[Reynolds number]] is small, these forces are determined through the linear Stokes equations (hence the name of the method). In addition, the method can also resolve non-hydrodynamic forces, such as Brownian forces, arising from the fluctuating motion of the fluid, and interparticle or external forces. Stokesian Dynamics can thus be applied to a variety of problems, including sedimentation, diffusion and rheology, and it aims to provide the same level of understanding for multiphase particulate systems as molecular dynamics does for statistical properties of matter. For &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; rigid particles of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid of viscosity &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the motion of the fluid is governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, while the motion of the particles is described by the coupled equation of motion:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}\frac{d\mathbf{U}}{dt} = \mathbf{F}^\mathrm{H} + \mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B} + \mathbf{F}^\mathrm{P}.  &lt;/math&gt;
In the above equation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the particle translational/rotational velocity 
vector of dimension 6'''N'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the hydrodynamic force, i.e., force exerted by the fluid on the particle due to relative motion between them. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stochastic]] [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] force due to thermal motion of fluid particles. &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}^\mathrm{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the deterministic nonhydrodynamic force, which may be almost any form of interparticle or external force, e.g. electrostatic repulsion between like charged particles. [[Brownian dynamics]] is one of the popular techniques of solving the [[Langevin equation]], but the hydrodynamic interaction in [[Brownian dynamics]] is highly simplified and normally includes only the isolated body resistance. On the other hand, Stokesian dynamics includes the many body hydrodynamic interactions. Hydrodynamic interaction is very important for non-equilibrium suspensions, like a sheared [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where it plays a vital role in its microstructure and hence its properties. Stokesian dynamics is used primarily for non-equilibrium suspensions where it has been shown to provide results which agree with experiments.&lt;ref&gt;

==Hydrodynamic interaction==
When the motion on the particle scale is such that the particle Reynolds number is small, the hydrodynamic force exerted on the particles in a suspension undergoing a bulk linear shear flow is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{H} = -\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FU}(\mathbf{U}-\mathbf{U}^{\infty}) + \mathbf{R}^\mathrm{FE}:\mathbf{E}^{\infty}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the bulk shear flow evaluated at the particle 
center, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric part of the velocity-gradient tensor;  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FU}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FE}&lt;/math&gt; are the configuration-dependent resistance matrices that give the hydrodynamic force/torque on the particles due to their motion relative to the fluid (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FU}&lt;/math&gt;) and due to the imposed shear flow (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FE}&lt;/math&gt;). Note that the subscripts on the matrices indicate the coupling   between kinematic (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;) and dynamic (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;) quantities.

One of the key features of Stokesian dynamics is its handing of the hydrodynamic interactions, which is fairly accurate without being computationally inhibitive (like [[boundary element method|boundary integral methods]]) for a large number of particles. Classical Stokesian dynamics requires &lt;math&gt;O(N^{3})&lt;/math&gt; operations where ''N'' is the number of particles in the system (usually a periodic box). Recent advances have reduced the computational cost to about &lt;math&gt; O(N^{1.25} \, \log N). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Brownian force==
The stochastic or Brownian force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; arises from the thermal fluctuations in the fluid and is characterized by:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B}\right\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B}(0)\mathbf{F}^\mathrm{B}(t)\right\rangle = 2kT\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{FU}\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The angle brackets denote an ensemble average, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature and &lt;math&gt;\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the delta function. The amplitude of the correlation between the Brownian forces at time &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; results from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the N-body system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8328">The '''talent''' ({{lang-la|talentum}}, from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|τάλαντον}}, ''talanton'' "scale, balance,  sum") was one of several ancient units of [[mass]], a commercial weight, as well as corresponding units of value equivalent to these masses of a [[precious metal]]. The talent of [[gold]] was known to [[Homer]], who described how Achilles gave a half-talent of gold to [[Antilochus]] as a prize.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D23%3Acard%3D784  Hom. Il. 23.784].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], or [[Attic talent]], was {{convert|26|kg}}&lt;ref name="Humphrey"&gt;John William Humphrey, [[John Peter Oleson]], Andrew Neil Sherwood, ''Greek and Roman technology'', p.487.&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately the mass of water required to fill an [[Amphora (measure)|amphora]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}), a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] talent was {{convert|32.3|kg}}, an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] talent was {{convert|27|kg}},&lt;ref name="Humphrey"/&gt; and a [[Babylonia]]n talent was {{convert|30.3|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;Herodotus, Robin Waterfield and Carolyn Dewald, ''The Histories'' (1998), p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Israel]], and other [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] countries, adopted the Babylonian talent, but later revised the mass.&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=81&amp;letter=W&amp;search=weights%20and%20measures#217 III. Measures of Weight:]", ''JewishEncyclopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Weight and coins|heavy common talent]], used in New Testament times, was {{convert|58.9|kg}}.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;

==Homeric talent==
The original Homeric talent was probably the gold equivalent of the value of an ox or a cow.&lt;ref name=Seltman&gt;Charles Theodore Seltman (1924) ''Athens, Its History and Coinage Before the Persian Invasion'', pp. 112–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a statement from a later Greek source that "the talent of Homer was equal in amount to the later [[Persian daric|Daric]] [... i.e.] two Attic [[drachma]]s" and analysis of finds from a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] grave-shaft, a weight of about {{convert|8.5|g}} can be established for this original talent.&lt;ref name="Seltman"/&gt; The later Attic talent was of a different weight than the Homeric, but represented the same value in copper as the Homeric did in gold, with the price ratio of gold to copper in [[Bronze Age]] Greece being 1:3000.&lt;ref name="Seltman"/&gt;

==Attic talent==
An Attic talent was the equivalent of 60 [[Mina (unit)|mina]]e or 6,000 [[drachmae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Renfrew|Wagstaff|1982}}: "One Attic talent was the equivalent of 60 ''minae'' or 6,000 ''drachmae''..."&lt;/ref&gt; 

An Attic talent was about {{convert|26|kg}}. Friedrich Hultsch estimated a weight of 26.196 kg,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hultsch|1882}}, p 135&lt;/ref&gt; and {{harvp|Dewald|1998}} offers a weight of 25.992 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dewald|1998}}, in Appendix II&lt;/ref&gt;

An Attic talent of silver was the value of nine man-years of skilled work.&lt;ref&gt;Engen, Darel. "[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/engen.greece The Economy of Ancient Greece]", EH.Net Encyclopedia, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 415&amp;nbsp;BC, an Attic talent was a month's pay for a [[trireme]] crew,&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''History of the Peloponnesian War''. Book 6, verse 8: "Early in the spring of the following summer the Athenian envoys arrived from Sicily, and the Egestaeans with them, bringing sixty talents of uncoined silver, as a month's pay for sixty ships, which they were to ask to have sent them."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] were commonly paid one drachma per day of military service.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Aeginetan talent==
The Aeginetan talent weighed about 37 kg. The German historian Friedrich Hultsch calculated a range of 36.15 to 37.2kg based on such estimates as the weight of one full Aeginetan ''[[metretes]]'' of coins, and concluded that the Aeginetan talent represented the water weight of a Babylonian ''[[ephah]]'': 36.29 kg by his reckoning (the ''metretes'' and the ''ephah'' were units of volume).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hultsch|1882}}, p 502&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Gardner estimated a weight of 37.32 kg, based on extant weights and coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gardner|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Aeginetan talent was worth 60 Aeginetan minae, or 6,000 Aeginetan drachmae{{dubious|date=June 2018}}.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Other talents==

The [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Sumer|Sumerians]], and [[Hebrews]] divided a talent into 60 [[Mina (unit)|minas]], each of which was subdivided into 60 [[shekel]]s. The Greek also used the [[ratio]] of 60 minas to one talent. A Greek mina was approximately 434 ± 3 grams. A Roman talent was 100 [[ancient Roman weights and measures|libra]]. A libra is exactly three quarters of a Greek mina, so a Roman talent is 1.33 Greek talents. An Egyptian talent was 80 librae.&lt;ref name="Humphrey"/&gt;

The talent as a unit of value is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] in [[Jesus]]' [[parable of the talents]] (Matthew 25:14-30).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|25:14-30|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; This parable is the origin of the use of the word "talent" to mean "gift or skill" in English and other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Talent. (F.-L-Gk.) The sense of 'ability' is from the parable; Matt. xxv. F. talent, 'a talent in money; also will, desire;' Cot. —L. talentum. — Gk. тоЛа»Tov, a [[Balance (accounting)|balance]], weight, sum of money, talent. Named from being lifted and weighed; cf. Skt. tul, I.. tollere, to lift, Gk. Tcsa-m, sustaining. (TAL.) Allied to Tolerate. Der. talent-ed, in use before A. D. 1700. p 489 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k2FHAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=reverend+skeat+etymology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A concise etymological dictionary of the English language]'', Rev. Walter W. Skeat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;talent 
late 13c., "inclination, disposition, will, desire," from O.Fr. talent, from M.L. talenta, pl. of talentum "inclination, leaning, will, desire" (1098), in classical L. "balance, weight, sum of money," from Gk. talanton "balance, weight, sum," from PIE *tel-, *tol- "to bear, carry" (see extol). Originally an ancient unit of weight or money (varying greatly and attested in O.E. as talente), the M.L. and common Romanic sense developed from figurative use of the word in the sense of "money." Meaning "special natural ability, aptitude," developed mid-14c., from the parable of the talents in Matt. xxv:14-30. Related: Talented. ''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=talent Online Etymological Dictionary]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] includes a different parable involving the [[Mina (unit)|mina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|19:12-27|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], the talent is called ''mina'' (''maneh'') among the Hebrews, and was the equivalent in weight to one-hundred [[denarii]].&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Treatise on Weights and Measures (Syriac Version)'' James Elmer Dean (ed.), Chicago University Press: 1935, §45&lt;/ref&gt; The talent is found in another parable of Jesus &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|18:23-35|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a servant who is forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents refuses to forgive another servant who owes him only one hundred silver [[Denarius|denarii]]. The talent is also used elsewhere in the [[Bible]], as when describing the material invested in the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|38|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon]] received 666 gold talents a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|9:13|KJV}}&lt;br&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}
'''Thermoelectric cooling''' uses the [[Peltier effect]] to create a [[heat]] flux between the junction of two different types of materials. A Peltier cooler, heater, or [[thermoelectric]] heat pump is a solid-state active [[heat pump]] which transfers heat from one side of the device to the other, with consumption of [[electrical energy]], depending on the direction of the current. Such an instrument is also called a '''Peltier device''', '''Peltier heat pump''', '''solid state refrigerator''', or '''thermoelectric cooler''' ('''TEC'''). It can be used either for heating or for cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TCAPT.2007.906333|title=Comprehensive system-level optimization of thermoelectric devices for electronic cooling applications|journal=Ieee Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies|volume=31|pages=23–31|year=2008|last1=Taylor|first1=R.A.|last2=Solbrekken|first2=G.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice the main application is cooling. It can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools.

This technology is far less commonly applied to refrigeration than [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] is. The primary advantages of a Peltier cooler compared to a vapor-compression refrigerator are its lack of moving parts or circulating liquid, very long life, invulnerability to leaks, small size, and flexible shape. Its main disadvantages are high cost and poor power efficiency. Many researchers and companies are trying to develop Peltier coolers that are cheap and efficient. (See [[Thermoelectric materials]].)

A Peltier cooler can also be used as a [[thermoelectric generator]]. When operated as a cooler, a voltage is applied across the device, and as a result, a difference in temperature will build up between the two sides. When operated as a generator, one side of the device is heated to a temperature greater than the other side, and as a result, a difference in voltage will build up between the two sides (the [[Seebeck effect]]). However, a well-designed Peltier cooler will be a mediocre thermoelectric generator and vice versa, due to different design and packaging requirements.

== Operating principle ==
[[File:Peltierelement.png|thumb|right|300px|Peltier element schematic. Thermoelectric legs are thermally in parallel and electrically in series.]]

{{main|Thermoelectric effect}}
Thermoelectric coolers operate by the Peltier effect (which also goes by the more general name thermoelectric effect). The device has two sides, and when a [[Direct Current|DC]] electric current flows through the device, it brings heat from one side to the other, so that one side gets cooler while the other gets hotter. The "hot" side is attached to a heat sink so that it remains at ambient temperature, while the cool side goes below room temperature. In some applications, multiple coolers can be cascaded together for lower temperature.

== Construction ==
Two unique semiconductors, one n-type and one p-type, are used because they need to have different electron densities. The semiconductors are placed thermally in parallel to each other and electrically in series and then joined with a thermally conducting plate on each side. When a voltage is applied to the free ends of the two semiconductors there is a flow of DC current across the junction of the semiconductors causing a temperature difference. The side with the cooling plate absorbs heat which is then moved to the other side of the device where the heat sink is. Thermoelectric Coolers, also abbreviated to TECs are typically connected side by side and sandwiched between two ceramic plates. The cooling ability of the total unit is then proportional to the number of TECs in it.

Some benefits of using a TEC are:
* No moving parts so maintenance is required less frequently
* No [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC)
* Temperature control to within fractions of a degree can be maintained
* Flexible shape (form factor); in particular, they can have a very small size
* Can be used in environments that are smaller or more severe than conventional refrigeration
* Long life, with mean time between failures (MTBF) exceeding 100,000 hours
* Controllable via changing the input voltage/current

Some disadvantages of using a TEC are:
* Only a limited amount of heat flux can be dissipated
* Relegated to applications with low heat flux
* Not as efficient, in terms of [[coefficient of performance]], as vapor-compression systems (see below)

== Performance ==
A single-stage TEC will typically produce a maximal temperature difference of 70&amp;nbsp;°C between its hot and cold sides.&lt;ref name=HSG&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heatsink Guide|url=http://www.heatsink-guide.com/peltier.htm|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more heat moved using a TEC, the less efficient it becomes, because the TEC needs to dissipate both the heat being moved and the heat it generates itself from its own power consumption. The amount of heat that can be absorbed is proportional to the current and time.
:&lt;math&gt;Q = PIt,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is the Peltier coefficient, ''I'' is the current, and ''t'' is the time. The Peltier coefficient depends on temperature and the materials the TEC is made of.

In refrigeration applications, thermoelectric junctions have about 1/4th the efficiency compared to conventional means (they offer around 10–15% efficiency of the ideal [[Carnot cycle]] [[refrigerator]], compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression-cycle systems (reverse [[Rankine cycle|Rankine]] systems using compression/expansion).&lt;ref name=PNL&gt;{{cite web| last=Brown| first=D. R.| title=The Prospects of Alternatives to Vapor Compression Technology for Space Cooling and Food Refrigeration Applications|url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-19259.pdf|work=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNL)|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=16 March 2013 |author2=N. Fernandez |author3=J. A. Dirks |author4=T. B. Stout|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Due to this lower efficiency, thermoelectric cooling is generally only used in environments where the solid-state nature (no [[moving parts]], low maintenance, compact size, and orientation insensitivity) outweighs pure efficiency.

Peltier (thermoelectric) cooler performance is a function of ambient temperature, hot and cold side [[heat exchanger]] ([[heat sink]]) performance, thermal load, Peltier module (thermopile) geometry, and Peltier electrical parameters.&lt;ref name="PCB Heaven"&gt;{{cite web| title=PCB Heaven – Peltier Elements Explained| url=http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/The_Peltier_Thermo-Element/| work=PCB Heaven| publisher=PCB Heaven|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements for thermoelectric materials:{{cn|date=September 2017}}
* Narrow band-gap semiconductors because of room-temperature operation
* Heavy elements because of their high mobility and low thermal conductivity
* Large unit cell, complex structure
* Highly anisotropic or highly symmetric
* Complex compositions

Common [[thermoelectric materials]] used as semiconductors include [[bismuth telluride]], [[lead telluride]], [[silicon germanium]], and bismuth-antimony alloys. Of these bismuth telluride is the most commonly used. New high-performance materials for thermoelectric cooling are being actively researched.

== Uses ==
[[Image:USB Beverage Cooler.jpg|thumb|right|A USB-powered beverage cooler]]
Thermoelectric coolers are used for applications that require heat removal ranging from milliwatts to several thousand watts. They can be made for applications as small as a beverage cooler or as large as a submarine or railroad car. TECs have limited life time. Their health strength can be measured by the change of their AC resistance (ACR). When a TEC gets "old" or worn out, the ACR will increase.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Consumer products===
Peltier elements are commonly used in consumer products. For example, Peltier elements are used in [[camping]], portable coolers, cooling electronic components and small instruments. The cooling effect of Peltier heat pumps can also be used to extract water from the air in [[dehumidifier]]s. A camping/car type electric [[cooler]] can typically reduce the temperature by up to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (36&amp;nbsp;°F) below the ambient temperature. Climate-controlled jackets are beginning to use Peltier elements.&lt;ref name=Hsu&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=Cold? Put this jacket on. Hot?

They are also used for wine coolers.

===Industrial===
Thermoelectric coolers are used in many fields of industrial manufacturing and require a thorough performance analysis as they face the test of running thousands of cycles before these industrial products are launched to the market. Some of the applications include laser equipment, thermoelectric air conditioners or coolers, industrial electronics and telecommunications,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/using-peltier-modules-thermal-management-electronic-systems-2017-10/ Using Peltier modules for thermal management of electronic systems]. Electronics Weekly, 4 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; automotive, mini refrigerators or incubators, military cabinets, IT enclosures, and more.  

===Science and imaging===
Peltier elements are used in scientific devices. They are a common component in [[thermal cyclers]], used for the synthesis of DNA by polymerase chain reaction ([[PCR]]), a common molecular biological technique, which requires the rapid heating and cooling of the reaction mixture for denaturation primer annealing and enzymatic synthesis cycles.

With feedback circuitry, Peltier elements can be used to implement highly stable temperature controllers that keep desired temperature within ±0.01&amp;nbsp;°C. Such stability may be used in precise laser applications to avoid laser wavelength drifting as environment temperature changes.

The effect is used in [[satellite]]s and [[spacecraft]] to reduce temperature differences caused by direct [[sunlight]] on one side of a craft by dissipating the heat over the cold shaded side, where it is dissipated as [[thermal radiation]] to space.&lt;ref name=gloveboxtemps&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotlyarov|first=Evgeny|author2=Peter de Crom |author3=Raoul Voeten |title=Some Aspects of Peltier-Cooler Optimization Applied for the Glove Box Air Temperature Control|journal=SAE International|volume=1|year=2006|page=1|doi=10.4271/2006-01-2043|series=SAE Technical Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1961, some unmanned spacecraft (including the [[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]] Mars rover) utilize [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) that convert thermal energy into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. The devices can last several decades, as they are fueled by the decay of high-energy radioactive materials.

Photon detectors such as [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] in astronomical [[telescopes]], [[spectrometer]]s, or very high-end [[digital camera]]s are often cooled by Peltier elements. This reduces dark counts due to [[thermal noise]]. A dark count occurs when a pixel registers an electron caused by thermal fluctuation rather than a photon. On digital photos taken at low light these occur as speckles (or "pixel noise").{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Thermoelectric coolers can be used to [[Computer cooling|cool computer components]] to keep temperatures within design limits or to maintain stable functioning when [[overclocking]]. A Peltier cooler with a [[heat sink]] or [[waterblock]] can cool a chip to well below ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Fylladitakis, E. (September 26, 2016) [http://www.anandtech.com/show/10695/the-phononic-hex-2-0-tec-cpu-cooler-review The Phononic HEX 2.0 TEC CPU Cooler Review]. Anandtech.com. Retrieved on 2018-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Optical fiber|fiber-optic]] applications, where the wavelength of a laser or a component is highly dependent on temperature, Peltier coolers are used along with a thermistor in a feedback loop to maintain a constant temperature and thereby stabilize the wavelength of the device.

Some electronic equipment intended for military use in the field is thermoelectrically cooled.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

'''Thiopyrylium''' is a [[cation]] with the chemical formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is analogous to the [[pyrylium]] cation with the oxygen atom replaced by a sulfur atom.

Thiopyrylium salts are less reactive than the analogous pyrylium salts due to the lower [[electronegativity]] of the [[sulfur]] atom.&lt;ref name="krygowski2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foerst2012"&gt;{{cite book | title = Newer Methods of Preparative Organic Chemistry | volume = 3 | author1 = K.

Thiopyrylium salts can be synthesized by hydrogen abstraction from [[thiopyran]] by a hydride ion acceptor, such as [[trityl perchlorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry | title = Thiopyrans | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 1994 | isbn = 9783110854039 | page = 1101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thiopyrylium analogue of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrylium salts can be synthesized by treatment with [[sodium sulfide]] followed by precipitation with acid. This reaction causes the oxygen atom in the pyrylium cation to be substituted with sulfur.&lt;ref name="foerst2012"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}

A '''tipped tool''' is any [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]] in which the cutting edge consists of a separate piece of material that is [[brazing|brazed]], [[welding|welded]], or clamped onto a body made of another material. In the types in which the cutter portion is an [[indexing (motion)|indexable]] part clamped by a screw, the cutters are called '''inserts''' (because they are inserted into the tool body). Tipped tools allow each part of the tool, the shank and the cutter(s), to be made of [[materials science|the material with the best properties]] for its job. Common materials for the cutters (brazed tips or clamped inserts) include [[cemented carbide]], [[polycrystalline diamond]], and [[cubic boron nitride]].&lt;ref name="stephenson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Stephenson | first = David A. | last2 = Agapiou  | first2 = John S. | title = Metal cutting theory and practice | page = 164 | publisher = Marcel Dekker | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=19AdVu1O4fQC&amp;pg=PA164 | isbn = 978-0-8247-9579-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools that are commonly tipped include [[milling cutter]]s (such as [[end mill]]s, [[face mill]]s, and [[fly cutter]]s), [[tool bit]]s, [[router bit]]s, and [[saw]] blades (especially the metal-cutting ones). 

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantage of tipped tools is only a small insert of the cutting material is needed to provide the cutting ability. The small size makes manufacturing of the insert easier than making a solid tool of the same material. This also reduces cost because the tool holder can be made of a less-expensive and [[toughness|tougher]] material. In some situations a tipped tool is better than its solid counterpart because it combines the toughness of the tool holder with the [[hardness]] of the insert.&lt;ref name="stephenson"/&gt;

In other situations this is less than optimal, because the joint between the tool holder and the insert reduces rigidity.&lt;ref name="stephenson"/&gt; However, these tools may still be used because the overall cost savings is still greater.

In industry today, insert tools are perhaps slightly more common than solid tools, but solid tools are still used in many applications. Entire catalogs of solid–[[high-speed steel]] (HSS) and solid-carbide end mills, for example, play prominent parts in some areas of milling practice, including diesinking, moldmaking, and aerospace [[job production|job]] or [[batch production|batch]] production. Most [[machine shop]]s with [[metal lathe|lathes]] have many solid-HSS and solid-carbide tool bits as well as many insert-tipped tool bits, and most commercial operations that involve routers (such as [[cabinetry|cabinetry and furniture shops]]) use plenty of solid-HSS and solid-carbide router bits as well as some tipped bits. 

==Indexable inserts==
Inserts are removable cutting tips, which means they are not brazed or welded to the tool body. They are usually [[Indexing (motion)|indexable]], meaning that they can be exchanged, and often also rotated or flipped, without disturbing the overall geometry of the tool (effective diameter, tool length offset, etc.). This saves time in manufacturing by allowing fresh cutting edges to be presented periodically without the need for tool grinding, setup changes, or entering of new values into a [[CNC]] program.

===Wiper insert===
A ''wiper insert'' is an insert used in a [[milling machine]] or a [[lathe]].  It is  designed for finish cutting, to give a smooth surface on the surface being cut.  It uses special geometry to give a good finish on the workpiece at a higher-than-normal feedrate.  Wiper inserts generally have a larger area in contact with the workpiece, so they exert higher force on the workpiece.  This makes them unsuitable for fragile workpieces.

===ISO insert coding===
[[File:ISO1832 insert code.svg|350px|thumb|ISO1832 insert designation system.]]

''Inserts used for turning and milling'' are often numbered according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 1832. This standard aims to make the naming, specifying and ordering of inserts a simple, consistent and traceable process. This standard takes into account both metric and imperial systems of units, although certain elements differ for each unit system. The code consists of up to 13 symbols with the first 12 of them being compulsory for inserts composed of [[Cubic Boron Nitride|cubic boron]] or [[Synthetic diamond|poly-crystalline diamond]] and the first 7 being compulsory for all other types of composition.&lt;ref&gt;ISO1832:2004, 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vertwindmillonroof.png|thumb|right|Turby prototype - TU Delft]]
The '''Turby''' is a brand of [[Vertical-axis wind turbine|vertical-axis]] [[Darrieus wind turbine]]. The three vertical aerofoil blades have a helical twist of 60 degrees, similar to [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov's water turbines]] .

The turbine consists of three vertical symmetrical [[airfoil]] blades, each having a [[Helix|helical]] twist.  The helical feature spreads the [[torque]] evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill (Darrieus turbine).  The wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and [[leeward]] sides of the turbine.  As with a Darrieus turbine, theoretically, there is no torque on a stationary turbine, due to symmetry of the turbine and of the blades.  Starting is achieved by operating the generator as a motor.  Torque is caused by a change in the apparent wind direction relative to the moving blades.

Another advantage of the helical twist is that the blades generate torque well from upward-slanting airflow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} This is negligible in open country, but tall buildings and cliff faces generate a bow wave which directs airflow up and over them.  Turbines mounted on high building rooftops or clifftops are exposed to significantly slanting flow, and the Turby can extract more useful energy from it than a propeller-type turbine can {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} because [[Horizontal-axis wind turbine|horizontal axis]] (HAWT)  types cannot change their pitch to face the wind directly.

The turbine measures 2.0m (6'7") in diameter by 2.9m (9'6") high (including generator), and weighs 136&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb). It is specified to generate power in winds of between 4&amp;nbsp;m/s (9&amp;nbsp;mph, 7.8kts) and 14&amp;nbsp;m/s (31&amp;nbsp;mph, 27.2kts), and can survive winds of 55&amp;nbsp;m/s (123&amp;nbsp;mph, 107kts). The rated power at 14&amp;nbsp;m/s is 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW (3.35&amp;nbsp;hp). The AC output from the synchronous generator is rectified to DC, then inverted to AC at 230V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Core International]] developed the turbine in the [[Netherlands]] with research input from the [[Delft University of Technology]].

The '''Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station''' occupies a site near [[Jenkinsville, South Carolina]], in [[Fairfield County, South Carolina]], approximately {{convert|20|mi}} northwest of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]].  The [[nuclear power station]] includes the decommissioned experimental [[Carolinas-Virginia Tube Reactor]] (CVTR) unit, just outside the site of the old town of Parr, SC.  The CVTR was a 17&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]], [[heavy water]] reactor. Its cooling water is supplied by the [[Monticello Reservoir]] (not to be confused with the [[Monticello Nuclear Generating Station]] in Minnesota), which is also used by a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage (hydroelectric)]] unit. The plant utilizes a once-through cooling system.

This plant has one [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] 3-loop [[Pressurized Water Reactor]], which has received approval of a 20-year license extension, taking the license expiration of Unit 1 from 2022 to 2042. [[South Carolina Electric and Gas]] was also in the process of constructing two [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] [[AP1000]] plants, which had been scheduled to go into service in 2020, but construction on these was stopped in 2017.

The plant is named after Virgil Clifton Summer, the former Chairman and CEO of SCE&amp;G.&lt;ref name="scana_info"&gt;[http://www.sceg.com/NR/rdonlyres/0065CB41-32BC-490A-9469-AA2B48053D28/0/VCSummerNuclearStation.pdf "V.C. Summer Nuclear Station"], [[SCANA]], retrieved 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unit 1 ==

V. C. Summer Unit 1 is a Westinghouse 3-loop Pressurized Water Reactor. The reactor first began commercial operation on January 1, 1984. The plant cost $1.3 billion to construct – 24 percent less per kilowatt than the average of 13 nuclear plants constructed over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sceg.com/NR/rdonlyres/0065CB41-32BC-490A-9469-AA2B48053D28/0/VCSummerNuclearStation.pdf | title= V.C. Summer Nuclear Station Fact Sheet | work= Information | publisher= [[South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company|SCE&amp;G]] | accessdate= 2013-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit 1 generates 2,900 MW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (Thermal Megawatts) of heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/sum.html | title= V.C.

In 2001, the Summer unit operated at 79.9&amp;nbsp;percent of capacity, producing 6.76&amp;nbsp;billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. In 2007 it produced 8.48&amp;nbsp;billion kilowatt-hours, increasing its [[capacity factor]] to 100.2&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=(Virgil C.) Summer Nuclear Station, South Carolina |publisher=United States [[Energy Information Administration]] |url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/summer.html |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two-thirds (66.7 percent) of the Summer plant is owned by its operator, the [[South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company]] (SCE&amp;G), a subsidiary of the [[SCANA]] corporation. The remaining 33.3&amp;nbsp;percent is owned by the [[Santee Cooper|South Carolina Public Service Authority]] (Santee Cooper).

== Units 2 and 3 ==

On March 27, 2008, South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas applied to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) for a [[Combined Construction and Operating License]] (COL) to build two 1,100&amp;nbsp;MW [[AP1000]] pressurized water reactors at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May&amp;nbsp;27, 2008, SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper announced an [[engineering, procurement and construction]] (EPC) contract had been reached with Westinghouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scana.com/en/investor-relations/news-releases/sceg-santee-cooper-to-build-nuclear-units.htm |publisher=SCANA Press Release |title=SCE&amp;G &amp; Santee Cooper Announce Contract to Build Two New Nuclear Units |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs were estimated to be approximately $9.8&amp;nbsp;billion for both AP1000 units, plus transmission facility and financing costs. The operators are filing an application to increase customers bills by $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion (2.5%) during the construction period to partially finance capital costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2049832 |title=Summer time for AP1000 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=5 June 2008

In March 2012, the NRC approved the construction license of the two proposed reactors at the Summer plant. 
As with the license approval for the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant|Vogtle plant]], NRC chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] cast the lone dissenting vote, saying "I continue to believe that we should require that all [[Fukushima nuclear accident|Fukushima-related]] safety enhancements are implemented before these new reactors begin operating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The reactors were expected to go on-line in 2017 and 2018 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate= 30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of Unit 2 began officially on March 9, 2013, with the pouring of concrete for the basemat. The placement of the first concrete was completed on March&amp;nbsp;11, 2013. Unit&amp;nbsp;2 is the first reactor to start construction in the US in 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=wnn-1203134&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-AP1000_construction_underway_at_Summer-1203134.html |title= Construction officially starts at Summer |work=World Nuclear News |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
First concrete for Unit&amp;nbsp;3 was completed on November&amp;nbsp;4, 2013.&lt;ref name=wnn-0611134&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Second-Summer-AP1000-under-construction-0611134.html |title= Second Summer AP1000 under construction |work=World Nuclear News |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, a delay of at least one year and extra costs of $1.2 billion were announced, largely due to fabrication delays. Unit 2 was expected to be substantially complete in late 2018 or early 2019, with unit 3 about a year later.&lt;ref name=wnn-20141003&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Cost-of-Summer-AP1000s-increases-0310144.html |title=Cost of Summer AP1000s increases |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 2015, V.C. Summer Unit 2 reached a landmark milestone with the successful placement of the CA-01 module, one of the largest, heaviest, and most complicated modules within the Nuclear Island, also referred to as a super module because it was so large that huge submodules had to be shipped from the manufacturer and final assembly was completed on site in the twelve-story Module Assembly Building. Installation of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It is the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds. Because of how much it weighs, lifting and placing the CA-01 module into the Unit 2 Nuclear Island resulted in the heaviest lift for the V.C. Summer construction project to date.&lt;ref name=wnm-20150715&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Landmark-module-installation-at-VC-Summer-2407157.html |title=Landmark module installation at VC Summer |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=24 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017 [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] revised in-service dates to April 2020 and December 2020 for units 2 and 3.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170215&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Westinghouse-reassures-Summer-plant-owners-15021702.html |title=Westinghouse reassures Summer plant owners |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=15 February 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Westinghouse Electric Company filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] because of $9 billion of losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170324&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-idUSKBN16V04G |title=Toshiba decides on Westinghouse bankruptcy, sees $9 billion in charges: sources |first=Taro |last=Fuse |publisher=Reuters |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SCANA]] considered its options for the project,&lt;ref name=wnn-20170330&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Scana-to-evaluate-Summer-options-3003177.html |title=Scana to evaluate Summer options |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately decided to abandon the project in July 2017. SCANA had determined that completing just Unit 2 and abandoning Unit 3 could be feasible and was leaning toward that option internally, however the project died when minority partner Santee Cooper's board voted to cease all construction and SCANA could not find another partner to take their place.

On July 31, 2017, after an extensive review into the costs of constructing Units 2 and 3, South Carolina Electric and Gas decided to stop construction of the reactors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/scana-to-cease-construction-of-two-reactors-in-south-carolina|title=Two Half-Finished Nuclear Reactors Scrapped as Costs Balloon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later filed a Petition for Approval of Abandonment with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;www.ippjournal.com 5 January 2018: [http://www.ippjournal.com/news/ipptoday-129-dominion-energy-acquires-us-utility-scana-for-us-14-6-billion ''IPPToday #129: Dominion Energy acquires US utility Scana for US$14.6 billion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrounding population==
The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of {{convert|10|mi}}, concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about {{convert|50|mi}}, concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power-bg.html  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002131207/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/emerg-plan-prep-nuc-power-bg.html |date=2006-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 U.S. population within {{convert|10|mi}} of Summer was 17,599, an increase of 26.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within {{convert|50|mi}} was 1,187,554, an increase of 14.3 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Columbia (30 miles to city center).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Dedman]], Nuclear neighbors: Population rises near US reactors, ''[[msnbc.com]]'', April 14, 2011 http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42555888/ns/us_news-life/ Accessed May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic risk==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Summer was 1 in 26,316, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Dedman]], "What are the odds?

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus. Khatavkar and Mays (2017) &lt;ref&gt; Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017 a) Model for the Real-Time Operation of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017 (pp. 171-183). &lt;/ref&gt; present a methodology for control of water distribution and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of drought and limited power availability to ascertain at least minimal supply of cooling water to the power plants. Khatavkar and Mays (2017 b) &lt;ref&gt;Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017). Testing an Optimization/Simulation Model for the Real-Time Operations of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

'''Wood ash''' is the residue [[powder (substance)|powder]] left after the [[combustion]] of [[wood]], such as burning wood in a home [[fireplace]] or an industrial power plant. It is used traditionally by [[gardener]]s as a good source of [[potash]].

==Composition==

===Variability in assessment===
Many studies have been conducted regarding the chemical composition of wood ash, with widely varying results. Some quote [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as the major constituent,&lt;ref name=Hume1/&gt; others find no carbonate at all, but [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) instead.&lt;ref name=Naik&gt;{{Citation|author1=Tarun R. Naik |author2=Rudolph N. Kraus |author3=Rakesh Kumar  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2001|title=Wood Ash: A New Source of Pozzolanic Material|publisher=Department of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, College of Engineering and Applied Science, The University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some show as much as twelve percent [[iron oxide]]&lt;ref name=Naik/&gt; while others show none,&lt;ref name=Etiegni/&gt; though iron oxide is often introduced through contamination with soil. A comprehensive set of analyses of wood ash composition from many tree species has been carried out by Emil Wolff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Emil|title=Aschen-Analysen|date=1871|publisher=Wiegandt und Hempel|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Several factors have a major impact on the composition:
#[[Fly ash]]: Some studies include the solids escaping via the flue during combustion, while others do not.
#Temperature of combustion&lt;ref name=misra&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Misra MK, Ragland KW, Baker AJ |year=1993|title=Wood Ash Composition as a Function of Furnace Temperature|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1993/misra93a.pdf|journal=[[Biomass and Bioenergy]]|volume=4|issue=2|pages=103-116|doi=10.1016/0961-9534(93)90032-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces two direct effects:
#*Dissociation: Conversion of carbonates, sulfides, etc., to oxides results in no carbon, sulfur, carbonates, or sulfides. Some metallic oxides (e.g. [[mercuric oxide]]) even dissociate to their elemental state and/or vaporize completely at wood fire temperatures.
#*Volatilization: In studies in which the fly ash is not measured, some combustion products may not be present at all.
#Experimental process: If the ashes are exposed to the environment between combustion and the analysis, oxides may convert back to carbonates by reacting with [[carbon dioxide]] in the air.
#Type, age, and growing environment of the wood stock affect the composition of the wood, and thus the ash.

===Measurements===
Typically between 0.43 and 1.82 percent of the mass of burned wood ([[dry basis]]) results in ash.&lt;ref name=misra/&gt; Also the conditions of the combustion affect the composition and amount of the residue ash, thus higher temperature will reduce ash yield.&lt;ref name=Etiegni&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Etiegni L, Campbell AG |year=1991|title=Physical and chemical characteristics of wood ash|journal=[[Bioresource Technology]]|volume=37|issue=2|pages=173-178|doi=10.1016/0960-8524(91)90207-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much wood ash contains [[calcium carbonate]] as its major component, representing 25&lt;ref name=purdue/&gt; or even 45 percent.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;{{Cite web|author=Hume E|date=11 April 2006|title=Wood Ashes: How to use them in the Garden|url=http://www.humeseeds.com/ashes.htm|publisher=Ed Hume Seeds|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 10 percent is [[potash]], and less than 1 percent [[phosphate]]; there are trace elements of iron, manganese, zinc, copper and some heavy metals.&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lerner BR|date=16 November 2000|title=Wood Ash in the Garden|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/woodash.html|publisher=[[Purdue University]], Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these numbers vary, as combustion temperature is an important variable in determining wood ash composition.&lt;ref name=misra/&gt; All of these are, primarily, in the form of [[oxide]]s.&lt;ref name="misra"/&gt;

==Uses==

=== Fertilizers ===

Wood ash can be used as an [[organic fertilizer]] used to enrich agricultural [[Soil#Nutrients|soil nutrition]]. In this role, wood ash serves a source of [[Soil#Potassium|potassium]] and [[calcium carbonate]], the latter acting as a [[liming (soil)|liming]] agent to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] [[Soil pH|acidic soils]].&lt;ref name=purdue/&gt;

Wood ash can also be used as an amendment for [[Hydroponics#Organic hydroponic solutions|organic hydroponic solutions]], generally replacing [[inorganic compound]]s containing calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sholto Douglas|first1=James|title=Advanced guide to hydroponics: (soiless cultivation)|date=1985|publisher=Pelham Books|location=London|isbn=9780720715712|pages=345–351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hykhAQAAMAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composts ===

Wood ash is commonly disposed of in [[landfill]]s, but with rising disposal costs, ecologically friendly alternatives, such as serving as [[compost]] for agricultural and [[forestry]] applications, are becoming more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Demeyer A, Voundi Nkana JC, Verloo MG |year=2001|title=Characteristics of wood ash and influence on soil properties and nutrient uptake: an overview|journal=[[Bioresource Technology]]|volume=77|issue=3|pages=287–95|doi=10.1016/S0960-8524(00)00043-2|pmid=11272014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because wood ash has a high [[char]] content, it can be used as an odor control agent, especially in composting operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Rosenfeld, P.  |author2=Henry, C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=Activated Carbon and Wood Ash Sorption of Wastewater, Compost and Biosolids Odorants|journal=[[Water Environment Research]]|volume=7|issue=4|pages=388–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pottery ===
Wood ash has a very long history of being used in [[Ash glaze|ceramic glazes]], particularly in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean traditions, though now used by many craft potters. It acts as a flux, reducing the melting point of the glaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Phil|title=Ash Glazes|date=2003|publisher=A&amp;C Black|location=London|isbn=978-0-7136-57821|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soaps ===
[[Potassium hydroxide]] can be made directly from wood ash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=14 May 2009|title=Making lye from wood ash|url=http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_ashlye.html|publisher=Journey to Forever|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in this form, is known as [[caustic potash]] or [[lye]]. Because of this property, wood ash has also traditionally been used to make [[wood-ash soap]].

===Bio-leaching===
The [[ectomycorrhizal]] fungi ''[[Suillus granulatus]]'' and ''[[Paxillus involutus]]'' can release elements from wood ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Metals, minerals and microbes: geomicrobiology and bioremediation|journal=Microbiology|author=Geoffrey Michael Gadd|volume=156|issue = Pt 3|date=March 2010|pages=609–643|pmid = 20019082|doi=10.1099/mic.0.037143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zinc selenide''' ([[Zinc|Zn]]Se) is a light-yellow, solid compound comprising zinc (Zn) and [[selenium]] (Se). It is an [[intrinsic semiconductor]] with a [[band gap]] of about 2.70&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volts|eV]] at {{convert|25|C}}. ZnSe rarely occurs in nature, and is found in the [[mineral]] that was named after [[Hans Stille]] called "[[stilleite]]."

==Properties==
ZnSe can be made in both hexagonal ([[Wurtzite (crystal structure)|wurtzite]]) and cubic ([[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|zincblende]]) crystal structure.

It is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of the  [[List of semiconductor materials#Group II-VI|II-VI semiconductor group]] (since [[zinc]] and [[selenium]] belong to the 12th and 16th groups of the [[periodic table]], respectively). The material can be doped [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with, for instance, [[halogen]] elements. [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] doping is more difficult, but can be achieved by introducing [[gallium]].

==Applications==
* ZnSe is used to form II-VI [[light-emitting diode]]s and [[diode laser]]s. It emits blue light.
* ZnSe doped with [[chromium]] ('''ZnSe:Cr''') has been used as an [[infrared]] [[laser gain medium]] emitting at about 2.4&amp;nbsp;[[µm]].&lt;ref&gt;Cr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; excitation levels in ZnSe and ZnS, G. Grebe, G. Roussos and H.-J. Schulz, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. vol. 9 pp. 4511-4516 (1976)  {{doi|10.1088/0022-3719/9/24/020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is used as an infrared optical material with a remarkably wide transmission wavelength range (0.45&amp;nbsp;µm to 21.5&amp;nbsp;µm&lt;ref name=KayeLaby&gt;http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_5/2_5_8.html Kaye and Laby online at [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]]&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[refractive index]] is about 2.67 at 550&amp;nbsp;nm (green), and about 2.40 at 10.6&amp;nbsp;µm ([[LWIR]]). Similar to [[zinc sulfide]], ZnSe is produced as [[microcrystalline]] sheets by synthesis from [[hydrogen selenide]] gas and [[zinc]] vapour. Another method of producing is a growth from melt under excessive pressure of inert gas ([[Argon|Ar]] usually).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iscrystals.com/page-details.html?cat_id=78&amp;id=91|title=Institute for Single Crystals - Materials and Products - AIIBVI - Passive Laser Optics Elements|first=|date=|website=iscrystals.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When free of absorption and inclusions it is ideally suited for [[carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser]] optics at 10.6&amp;nbsp;µm wavelength. It is thus a very important IR material. In daily life, it can be found as the entrance optic in the new range of [[infrared thermometer|"in-ear" clinical thermometers]], seen as a small yellow window. Zinc selenide can slowly react with atmospheric moisture if poorly polished, but this is not generally a serious problem. Except where optics are used in [[spectroscopy]] or at the [[Brewster angle]], [[antireflection]] or [[beamsplitting]] [[optical coating]]s are generally employed.
* ZnSe [[activator (phosphor)|activated]] with [[tellurium]] ('''ZnSe(Te)''') is a [[scintillator]] with emission peak at 640&amp;nbsp;nm, suitable for matching with [[photodiode]]s. It is used in [[x-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] detectors. ZnSe scintillators are significantly different from the [[zinc sulfide|ZnS]] ones.

==Chemistry==
ZnSe is insoluble in water, but reacts with acids to form toxic [[hydrogen selenide]] gas. {{Citation Needed|date=June 2017}}

It can be deposited as a thin film by [[chemical vapour deposition]] techniques including [[MOVPE]] and vacuum evaporation.
