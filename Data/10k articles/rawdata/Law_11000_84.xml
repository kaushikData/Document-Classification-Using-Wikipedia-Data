      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16749">[[Image:Mapa Cor-de-Rosa.svg|thumb|right|The [[Pink Map]]: areas claimed by Portugal before the Ultimatum.]]
The '''1890 British Ultimatum''' was an [[ultimatum]] by the [[British government]] delivered on 11 January 1890 to [[Portugal]]. The ultimatum forced the retreat of Portuguese military forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of historical discovery and recent exploration, but which the [[United Kingdom]] claimed on the basis of effective occupation. Portugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] including most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]] and a large part of [[Malawi]], which had been included in Portugal's "[[Pink Map|Rose-coloured Map]]".

It has sometimes been claimed that the British government's objections arose because the Portuguese claims clashed with its aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]], linking its colonies from the south of Africa to those in the north. This seems unlikely, as in 1890 Germany already controlled [[German East Africa]], now [[Tanzania]], and [[Sudan]] was independent under [[Muhammad Ahmad]]. Rather, the British government was pressed into taking action by [[Cecil Rhodes]], whose [[British South Africa Company]] was founded in 1888 south of the [[Zambezi]] and the [[African Lakes]] Company and British missionaries to the north.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, London, Hurst &amp; Co, p. 341. {{ISBN|1-85065-172-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the start of the 19th century, the Portuguese presence in Africa south of the equator was limited in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] to [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]] and a few outposts, the most northerly of which was [[Ambriz]] and in [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] to the [[Island of Mozambique]], several other coastal trading posts as far south as [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]] and the virtually independent [[Prazo]] estates in the Zambezi valley &lt;ref&gt;R Oliver and A Atmore, (1986). The African Middle Ages, 1400-1800, Cambridge University Press pp. 163-4, 191, 195. {{ISBN|0-521-29894-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first challenge to Portugal's wider claims came from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]], which in 1868 claimed an outlet to the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay. Although in 1869, Portugal and the Transvaal reached agreement on a border under which all of Delagoa Bay was Portuguese, the UK then lodged an objection, claiming the southern part of that bay. The claim was rejected after [[arbitration]] by [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|President MacMahon]] of [[France]]. His award made in 1875 upheld the border agreed in 1869. A second challenge came from the foundation of a German colony at [[Angra Pequena]], now known as [[Lüderitz]] in Namibia in 1883. Although there was no Portuguese presence there, Portugal had claimed it on the basis of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;H. Livermore (1992), Consul Crawfurd and the Anglo-Portuguese Crisis of 1890 Portuguese Studies, Vol. 8, pp. 181-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A far more serious dispute arose in the area of the Zambezi valley and [[Lake Malawi|Lake Nyasa]]. Portugal occupied the coast of Mozambique from the 16th century, and from 1853 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns to bring the Zambezi valley under its effective control.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1969). The Portuguese on the Zambezi: An Historical Interpretation of the Prazo system, Journal of African History Vol X, No 1 pp. 67-8, 80-2.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1850s, the areas south of Lake Nyasa (now [[Lake Malawi]]) and west of the lake were explored by [[David Livingstone]] and several [[Church of England]] and Presbyterian missions were established in the [[Shire Highlands]] in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1878, the [[African Lakes]] Company was established by businessmen with links to the Presbyterian missions. Their aim was to set up a trading company that would work in close cooperation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and develop European influence in the area. A small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, London, Pall Mall Press pp.77-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal attempted to assert its African territorial claims through three expeditions led by [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto]], first from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, then to the [[Congo River|Congo]] and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876 and lastly crossing Africa from Angola in 1877-79. These expeditions were undertaken with the intention of claiming the area between Mozambique and Angola.&lt;ref&gt;C E Nowell, (1947). Portugal and the Partition of Africa, The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Serpa Pinto’s explorations, the Portuguese government in 1879 made a formal claim to the area south and east of the [[Ruo River]] (the present south-eastern border of [[Malawi]]) and, in 1882, occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo. The Portuguese then asked the British government to accept this territorial claim, but the opening of the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884-85 ended the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, Woodbridge, James Currey, p. 51. {{ISBN|978-1-84701-050-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal’s efforts to establish this corridor of influence between Angola and Mozambique were hampered by one of the articles in the General Act of the Berlin Conference which required effective occupation of areas claimed rather than historical claims based on discovery or those based on exploration, as Portugal had used.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury´s 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 2. http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To validate Portuguese claims, Serpa Pinto was appointed as its consul in Zanzibar in 1884 and given the mission of exploring the region between Lake Nyasa and the coast from the Zambezi to the [[Rovuma River]] and securing the allegiance of the chiefs in that area.&lt;ref&gt;C E Nowell, (1947). Portugal and the Partition of Africa, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition reached Lake Nyasa and the Shire Highlands but failed to make any treaties of protection with the chiefs in territories west of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 276-7, 325-6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the northwest end of Lake Nyasa around [[Karonga]], the African Lakes Company made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs between 1884 and 1886. Its ambition was to become a [[Chartered company]] and control the route from the Lake along the Shire River.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 48-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the outcome of the Berlin Conference, the idea of a trans-African Portuguese zone was not abandoned; to help to create it, Portugal signed treaties with France and Germany in 1886. The German treaty noted Portugal’s claim to territory along the course of the Zambezi linking Angola and Mozambique. Following the treaties, the Portuguese foreign minister prepared what became known as the [[Pink Map|Rose Coloured Map]], representing a claim stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury´s 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 2. http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; North of the Zambezi, these Portuguese claims were opposed by both the African Lakes company and the missionaries. The main opposition to Portuguese claims in the south came from [[Cecil Rhodes]], whose [[British South Africa Company]] was founded in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1888, the British [[Foreign Office]] declined to offer protection to the tiny British settlements in the Shire Highlands. However, it did not accept the expansion of Portuguese influence there, and in 1889, it appointed [[Henry Hamilton Johnston]] as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, and instructed him to report on the extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. The conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.&lt;ref&gt;J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 83-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ultimatum==
In 1888, the Portuguese government instructed its representatives in Mozambique to make treaties of protection with the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands. Two expeditions were organised, one under Antonio Cardosa, a former governor of [[Quelimane]] set off in November 1888 for Lake Nyasa; the second expedition under Serpa Pinto (now governor of Mozambique) moved up the Shire valley. Between them, these two expeditions made over 20 treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Serpa Pinto met Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he crossed the Ruo to Chiromo, now in Malawi in September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 53, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incursion led to an armed conflict between Portuguese troops led by Serpa Pinto and the [[Makololo tribe|Makololo]] on 8 November 1889 near the Shire river.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury´s 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 3. http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this minor clash, Johnston's vice-consul, John Buchanan, using a diplomatic technique in which the British were well versed, accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and declared a British protectorate over the Shire Highlands in December 1889 despite contrary instructions.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Johnston himself declared a further protectorate over the area to the west of Lake Nyasa (also contrary to his instructions) although both protectorates were later endorsed by the Foreign Office.&lt;ref&gt;R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa: The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873-1964, Cambridge (Mass), Harvard University Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions formed the background to an Anglo-Portuguese crisis in which a British refusal of [[arbitration]] was followed by the 1890 British Ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;F Axelson, (1967). Portugal and the Scramble for Africa, Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press, pp. 233-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimatum was a memorandum sent to the Portuguese Government by [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] on 11 January 1890 in which he demanded the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from [[Mashonaland]] and [[Matabeleland]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and the Shire-Nyasa region (now [[Malawi]]), where Portuguese and British interests in Africa overlapped. It meant that the UK was now claiming sovereignty over territories, some of which had been treated as Portuguese for centuries. 

"What Her Majesty's Government require and insist upon is the following: that telegraphic instructions shall be sent to the governor of Mozambique at once to the effect that all and any Portuguese military forces which are actually on the Shire or in the Makololo or in the Mashona territory are to be withdrawn. Her Majesty's Government considers that without this the assurances given by the Portuguese Government are illusory.
Mr. Petre is compelled by his instruction to leave Lisbon at once with all the members of his legation unless a satisfactory answer to this foregoing intimation is received by him in, the course of this evening, and Her Majesty's ship Enchantress is now at Vigo waiting for his orders."

The Mr. Petre mentioned was the British Minister in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury´s 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 1.  http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Although the ultimatum required Portugal to cease from its activities in the disputed areas, there was no similar restriction on further British efforts to establish occupation there. Agents for Rhodes were active in Mashonaland and Manicaland and in what is now eastern Zambia, and John Buchanan asserted British rule in more of the Shire Highlands. There were armed clashes between Portuguese troops who were already in occupation in Manicaland and Rhodes’ incoming men in 1890 and 1891, which ceased only when some areas that had been allocated to Portugal in the unratified 1890 treaty were reassigned to Rhodes’ British South Africa Company in the 1891 treaty, with Portugal being given more land in the Zambezi valley in compensation for this loss.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 353-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Portugal acquiesced to British demands, it was considered as a breach of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)]] and seen as a national humiliation by republicans in Portugal, who denounced the government and the King as responsible for it. The government fell, and [[António de Serpa Pimentel]] was appointed prime minister. The British Ultimatum inspired the original lyrics of the Portuguese National Anthem, "[[A Portuguesa]]". It was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the UK against its [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|oldest ally]].&lt;ref&gt;João Ferreira Duarte, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/2000/v13/n1/037395ar.pdf The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that Lord Salisbury and his diplomatically isolated British government used tactics that could have led to war has been plausibly argued as the result of fear of Portuguese occupation of Manicaland and the Shire Highlands, which would have forestalled British interests.&lt;ref&gt;M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to reach an agreement over Portuguese African borders, the Treaty of London defining the territorial limits of Angola and Mozambique, was signed on 20 August 1890 by Portugal and the United Kingdom. The treaty was published in the ''Diário do Governo'' (Portugal's ''Government Diary'') on 30 August and presented to the parliament that same day, leading to a new wave of protests and the downfall of the Portuguese government. Not only was it never ratified by the Portuguese Parliament but also Cecil Rhodes, whose plans of expansion it affected, also opposed this treaty. A new treaty was negotiated which gave Portugal more territory in the Zambezi valley than the 1890 treaty, but what is now the [[Manicaland Province]] of Zimbabwe passed from Portuguese to British control. This treaty was signed in [[Lisbon]] on 11 June 1891, and in addition to defining boundaries, it allowed freedom of navigation on the Zambezi and Shire rivers and allowed the UK to lease land for a port at [[Chinde]] at the mouth of the Zambezi.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, pp. 6-7. http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes for the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Republican Revolution]], which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later.

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|UNECE]] '''Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters''', usually known as the '''Aarhus Convention''', was signed on 25 June 1998 in the Danish city of [[Aarhus]]. It entered into force on 30 October 2001. As of March 2014, it has 47 parties—46 states and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-13&amp;chapter=27&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|website=Treaties.un.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the ratifying states are in Europe and Central Asia. The EU has begun applying Aarhus-type principles in its legislation, notably the [[Water Framework Directive]] (Directive 2000/60/EC). Liechtenstein and  Monaco have signed the convention but have not ratified it.

The Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.

== Content ==
The Aarhus Convention is a multilateral environmental agreement through which the opportunities for citizens to access environmental information are increased and transparent and reliable regulation procedure is secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aarti|first=Gupta|title=Transparency under scrutiny: Information disclosure in Global  Environmental Governance|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1–7|doi=10.1162/glep.2008.8.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodenhoff|first=Vera|title=The Aarhus convention and its implications for the 'Institutions' of the European Community|journal=Review of European Community and International Environmental Law|year=2003|volume=11|issue=3|pages=343–357|doi=10.1111/1467-9388.00332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a way of enhancing the [[environmental governance]] network, introducing a reactive and trustworthy relationship between civil society and governments and adding the novelty of a mechanism created to empower the value of [[public participation]] in the decision making process and guarantee access to justice: a "governance-by-disclosure" that leads a shift toward an environmentally responsible society.&lt;ref&gt;Aarti, 2008, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Aarhus Convention was drafted by governments, with the highly required participation of [[NGOs]], and is legally binding for all the States who ratified it becoming Parties. Among the latter is included the [[European Economic Community|EC]], who therefore has the task to ensure compliance not only within the member States but also for its institutions, all those bodies who carry out public administrative duties.&lt;ref&gt;Rodehoff, 2003, p.350&lt;/ref&gt;
Each Party has the commitment to promote the principles contained in the convention and to fill out a national report, always embracing a consultative and transparent process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kravchenko|first=S|title=The Aarhus convention and innovations in compliance with multilateral environmental law and Policy|journal=Colorado journal of International Environmental Law and Policy|year=2007|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General features ===
The Aarhus Convention is a rights-based approach: the public, both in the present and in future generations, have the right to know and to live in a healthy environment.

A distinction is made between "the public", all the civil society's actors, and the "public concerned" precisely, those persons or organisations affected or interested in environmental decision-making (e.g. environmental NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=M|title=Information disclosure and environmental rights: The Aarhus Convention|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=10|issue=3|pages=10–31|doi=10.1162/glep_a_00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[Public authority|Public authorities]]" are the addressees of the convention, namely, governments, international institutions, and privatized bodies that have public responsibilities or act under the control of public bodies. The private sector, for which information disclosure depends on voluntary, non- mandatory practices, and bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity, are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Rodenhoff, 2003, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant provisions are the "non-discrimination" principle (all the information has to be provided without taking account of the nationality or citizenship of the applicant), the international nature of the convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wates|first=S|title=The Aarhus convention: a driving force for environmental democracy|journal=Journal for European Environmental and Planning Law|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Margera|first=E|title=An Update on the Aarhus Convention and its continued global relevance|journal=Review of European Community and International Law|volume=14|issue=2|pages=138–147|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9388.2005.00434.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance attributed to the promotion of [[environmental education]] of the public.

=== The Three Pillars ===
#  Access to information: any citizen should have the right to get a wide and easy access to environmental information. Public authorities must provide all the information required and collect and disseminate them and in a timely and transparent manner. They can refuse to do it only under particular situations (such as national defence);&lt;ref&gt;Rodenhoff, 2003, p.345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UNECE|title=Your right to a healthy environment: a simplified guide to the Aarhus convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters|year=2006|publisher=Geneva:United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNECE, 2006
#  Public participation in decision making: the public must be informed over all the relevant  projects and it has to have the chance to participate during the decision-making and legislative process. Decision makers can take advantage from people's knowledge and expertise; this contribution is a strong opportunity to improve the quality of the environmental decisions, outcomes and to guarantee procedural legitimacy &lt;ref&gt;Rodenhoff, 2003, p.346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNECE, 2006"&gt;UNECE, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Access to justice: the public has the right to judicial or administrative recourse procedures in case a Party violates or fails to adhere to [[environmental law]] and the convention's principles.&lt;ref name="UNECE, 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodehoff, 2003, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further reflections ===
The Aarhus convention is a "proceduralisation of the environmental regulation",&lt;ref&gt;Aarti, 2008, p.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=M|author2=Abbot, C.|title=The usual suspects? Public participation under the Aarhus convention|journal=The Modern Law Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=80–108|doi=10.1111/1468-2230.6601004}}&lt;/ref&gt; it focuses more on setting and listing procedures rather than establishing standards and specifying outcomes, permitting the parties involved to interpret and implement the convention on the systems and circumstances that characterize their nation. This model embodies a perfect example of a [[multi-level governance]].

The risk could lay in a loss of time and resources that could be otherwise invested in defining the outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;Aarti, 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding the fact that it renders the convention vague, weak and open to multiple interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M.; Abbot, C., 2003, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;
Other critiques note the fact that private bodies are excluded from the mandatory procedures(Mason, 2010), and that, moreover, it can also be debated whether the NGOs involved are faithfully representing environmental interests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=D.R.|title=Europe, globalization and sustainable development|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|authorlink=Sustainability through democratisation? The Aarhus convention and the future of environmental decision-making|editor=Barry, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M.; Abbot, C., 2003, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; ordinary citizens often do not have the financial means to participate effectively and are therefore have no choice but to be represented by these larger organisations. The relative differences between the participants and social groups' resource inequalities also suggests the possibility for irregular and imbalanced [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compliance Committee ===
The '''Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee''' was established to fulfill the requirement of Article 15 of the Convention on review of compliance to establish arrangements for reviewing compliance with the Convention.&lt;ref name="ccbackground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/pp/ccBackground.htm|title=UNECE Homepage|website=Unece.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention has a unique Compliance Review Mechanism, which can be triggered in four ways: 
# a Party makes a submission concerning its own compliance,
# a Party makes a submission concerning another Party's compliance,
# the Convention Secretariat makes a referral to the Committee, or
# a member of the public makes a communication concerning the compliance of a Party.
The Compliance mechanism is unique in international environmental law, as it allows members of the public to communicate concerns about a Party's compliance directly to a committee of international legal experts empowered to examine the merits of the case (the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee). Nonetheless, the Compliance Committee cannot issue binding decisions, but rather makes recommendations to the full Meeting of the Parties (MoP). However, in practise, as MoPs occur infrequently, Parties attempt to comply with the recommendations of the Compliance Committee. As of August 2009, 41 communication from the public – many originating with non-governmental organizations – and one submission from a Party had been lodged with the Convention's Compliance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/pp/pubcom.htm|title=UNECE Homepage|website=Unece.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollutant Release Protocol ===
'''The Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers''' to the Aarhus Convention was adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties on 21 May 2003, in [[Kiev]], Ukraine. 36 States and the [[European Community]] signed the Protocol. As of May 2016, 34 states plus the European Union have ratified the Protocol.

The Kiev Protocol is the first legally binding international instrument on [[Pollutant Release and Transfer Register]]s (PRTRs). PRTRs are inventories of pollution from industrial sites and other sources such as agriculture and transport.  The objective of the Protocol is "to enhance public access to information through the establishment of coherent, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs)." The Protocol places indirect obligations on private enterprises to report annually to their national governments on their releases and transfers of pollutants.

Parties to the Protocol need not be Parties to the Convention.  The Protocol is in this sense a free-standing, international agreement. The Kiev Protocol on PRTRs will enter into force 90 days after the sixteenth State ratifies or accedes to the agreement.

An amendment to the Aarhus Convention on "Public Participation in Decisions on Deliberate Release into the Environment and Placing on the Market of Genetically Modified Organisms" was adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties on 27 May 2005, in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan. As of August 2009, it had been ratified by 21 countries. The GMO amendment will enter into force 90 days after at least three-quarters of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/pp/ratification.htm|title=UNECE Homepage|website=Unece.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] (1997–2006) has said, "Although regional in scope, the significance of the Aarhus Convention is global. It is by far the most impressive elaboration of principle 10 of the [[Rio Declaration]], which stresses the need for citizens' participation in environmental issues and for access to information on the environment held by public authorities. As such it is the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations."

The influence of the Aarhus Convention also extends beyond the environmental field. At the 2nd [[Internet Governance Forum]], held on 12–15 May 2007, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Convention was presented as a model of public participation and transparency in the operation of international forums.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">A '''beneficial interest''' is "that right which a person has in a contract made with another" (third) person. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/def/b092.htm The 'Lectric Law Library's Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical example is "if A makes a contract with B that A will pay C a certain sum of money, B has the legal interest in the contract, and C the beneficial interest." &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', [http://www.lectlaw.com/def/b092.htm The 'Lectric Law Library's Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a '''beneficial interest''' is any "interest of value, worth, or [[Use (law)|use]] in [[property]] one does not own," for example, "the interest that a [[beneficiary]] of a [[Trust (law)|trust]] has in the trust." &lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 48 (Legal Assistant edition, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it could be:
* "A property interest that inures solely to the benefit of the owner," or
* Property that "remains of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] after the payment of debts and the expenses of administration", or
* The right of a person having a [[power of appointment]] to appoint himself." &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', Ballentine's Law Dictionary, at 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's Law Dictionary defines ''beneficial interest'' as "Profit, benefit or advantage resulting from a contract, or the ownership of an estate as distinct from the legal ownership or control." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/MNDM/MINES/LANDS/policies/gapolicy/ga810-1_e.asp Ontario Government web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622044132/http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/MNDM/MINES/LANDS/policies/gapolicy/ga810-1_e.asp |date=June 22, 2007 }}, citing Black's Law Dictionary, at p. (page needed).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.Asp?selected=50&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law Dictionary], same.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of beneficial interests in mining claims include unrecorded deeds and agreements to share profits, ''but not'' mortgages and other liens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/MNDM/MINES/LANDS/policies/gapolicy/ga810-1_e.asp Ontario Government web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622044132/http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/MNDM/MINES/LANDS/policies/gapolicy/ga810-1_e.asp |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Cf.'' definition of [[real property]] as including mortgages and other liens.&lt;/ref&gt; A beneficial interest is also "distinguished from the rights of someone like a trustee or official who has responsibility to perform and/or title to the assets but does not share in the benefits." &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.Asp?selected=50&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Law Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6207">'''Browse-wrap''' (also '''Browserwrap''' or '''browse-wrap license''') is a term used in [[Internet law]] to refer to a [[contract]] or [[license agreement]] covering access to or use of materials on a [[web site]] or downloadable product.  In a browse-wrap agreement, the terms and conditions of use for a website or other downloadable product are posted on the website, typically as a hyperlink at the bottom of the screen.&lt;ref name=Kwan120103&gt;''Kwan v. Clearwire Corp.'', No. C09-1392JLR, 2012 WL 32380 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 3, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Overstock09&gt;Hines v. Overstock.com, Inc., 668 F. Supp. 2d 362, 366 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[clickwrap]] agreement, where the user must manifest assent to the terms and conditions by clicking on an "I agree" box, a browse-wrap agreement does not require this type of express manifestation of assent.&lt;ref name=Kwan120103/&gt; Rather, a web-site user purportedly gives his or her assent by simply using the product — such as by entering the website or downloading software.&lt;ref name=Kwan120103/&gt;

Browse-wrap agreements, like clickwrap agreements, derive their name by analogy to the "[[Shrink wrap contract|shrink wrap agreements]]" included inside the sealed packaging of tangible products, where one can not see the agreement until the product has been purchased or used.&lt;ref name=Specht&gt;Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 306 F.3d 17 (2nd Cir.2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts that have ruled on the issue have held that the validity of a browse-wrap agreement primarily depends on whether a website user has actual or constructive notice of the terms and conditions prior to using the website or other product.&lt;ref name=Kwan120103/&gt;

==Case law==
In ''[[Specht v. Netscape]]'', the Second Circuit Court of Appeals looked at the enforceability of a browse-wrap contract entered into on the [[Netscape]] website.&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt; Users of the site were urged to download free software available on the site by clicking on a tinted button labeled "download".&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|22}}  Only if a user scrolled down the page to the next screen did he come upon an invitation to review the full terms of the program's [[license agreement]], available by [[hyperlink]].&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|23}}  The plaintiffs, who had not seen the agreement, downloaded the software and then were later sued for violations of federal privacy and computer fraud statutes arising from the use of the software.&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|23–25}}  The Second Circuit then noted that an essential ingredient to contract formation is the mutual manifestation of assent.&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|29}} The court found that "a consumer's clicking on a download button does not communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer did not make clear to the consumer that clicking on the download button would signify assent to those terms."&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|29–30}} Because the plaintiffs were not put on notice of these terms they were not bound by them.&lt;ref name=Specht/&gt;{{rp|30–32}}

In ''[[Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com]]'', the court looked at a [[breach of contract]] claim where the terms and conditions were situated at the bottom of the home page in "[[small print]]." &lt;ref&gt;Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc., 2000 WL 525390, at *3 (C.D.Cal. March 27, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court ruled for the defendant in this case but did allow Ticketmaster to replead if there were facts showing that the defendant had knowledge of the terms and implicitly agreed to them.

In 2005, the [[Illinois Appellate Court]] ruled in favor of a browse-wrap agreement in ''Hubbert v. Dell Corp.'' In this case consumers of [[Dell]] products were repeatedly shown the words "All sales are subject to Dell's Term[s] and Conditions of Sale", including a conspicuous hyperlink, over a series of pages.  The court found that this repeated exposure and visual effect would put a reasonable person on notice of the "terms and conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert v. Dell Corp., 835 N.E. 2d 113 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, in 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled in [[Nguyen v. Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc.]] that Barnes &amp; Noble's 2011 Terms of Use agreement, presented in a browse-wrap manner via hyperlinks alone, was not enforceable since it failed to offer users reasonable notice of the terms.

Similarly, in ''[[In re Zappos.com, Inc., Customer Data Security Breach Litigation]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] ruled against [[Zappos.com]]'s browsewrap terms of use, describing that its presentation was not prominent, and that no reasonable user would have read the agreement.

==Summary==
A browse-wrap agreement can be formed by use of a web page or a hyperlink or small disclaimer on the page.  It may only be enforced if the browsing user assents to it.  For assent to occur the browse-wrap agreement should be conspicuous, state that there is an agreement, and provide where it can be located.  Courts examine the enforceability of browse-wrap agreements on a case-by-case basis, and there are no "bright-line" rules on whether a given agreement is sufficiently conspicuous.  However, based on ''Specht'', some practitioners believe
&lt;blockquote&gt;
that the icon for the terms of use agreement be placed in the upper left-hand quadrant of the homepage and that all visitors be channeled through the homepage. The reason for this suggestion is that the court will take judicial notice of the fact that all Internet pages open from the upper left-hand quadrant, thus the defendant must overcome the presumption that the icon was viewed. Without this presumption, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the defendant did see the icon.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Berger and Jonathan Bick, ''New Jersey Law Journal'', September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] and the Judiciary of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago were the co-hosts of the inaugural conference.{{when|date=May 2018}}

An initial Steering Committee has been tasked with drafting the [[constitution]] of the organization.

CAJO is to be headquartered in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and had its inaugural conference on the 25th, 26 and 27 June 2009 at the Hyatt Regency Trinidad there. 
Sir Sridath Ramphal delivered the feature address, in which he said it was time for the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] to be replaced as the final court of appeal by the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id%3D161497223 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628095407/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161497223 |archivedate=2009-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chen v Home Secretary''''' was a decision of the [[European Court of Justice]] which decided that a minor who is a national of a European Union member state has the right to reside in the European Union with his or her third-country national parents, provided the minor and parents have health insurance and will not become a burden on the public finances of the member state of residence.

==Facts==
Kunqian Catherine Zhu was born on 16 September 2000 in [[Belfast]] to [[China|Chinese]] parents who were living in [[Wales]] (part of the [[United Kingdom]]) and working for a Chinese firm there. The child's mother, Man Lavette Chen, had selected [[Northern Ireland]] as a birthplace for her daughter so that she could gain [[Irish nationality law|Irish nationality]]. As Catherine's parents were only temporary migrants in the UK, she was not eligible for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] simply by virtue of birth in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom abolished automatic ''[[jus soli]]'' in 1983.

However, by being born in Belfast, Catherine was entitled to Irish citizenship because at that time, anyone born on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]] had the automatic, unrestricted right to Irish citizenship. Thus, Mrs Chen obtained a passport and hence Irish citizenship for Catherine, with the intention of using Catherine's status as a [[European Union]] citizen to move the family permanently to [[Cardiff]], Wales. However, British authorities rejected the family's application for permits to reside permanently in the United Kingdom. On appeal, adjudicator [[Michael Shrimpton]] of the [[Immigration Appellate Authority]] referred the decision to the [[European Court of Justice]], which ruled that, as a citizen of the European Union, Catherine Chen had a right under Article 18 of the [[Treaty of Rome|EC Treaty]] to reside anywhere in the EU, and that denying residency to her parents at a time when she is unable to look after herself would conflict with this basic right.

[[Advocate General]] Tizzano stated that it was not an abuse of EU rights to take advantage of the Irish citizenship rules because it is for the Member States and not the EU to decide whether to confer citizenship on a person.

==Judgment==
The court ruled:

{{Cquote|Article 1(2)(b) of Directive 90/364, which guarantees ‘dependent’ relatives in the ascending line of the holder of the right of residence the right to install themselves with the holder of the right of residence, regardless of their nationality, cannot confer a right of residence on a national of a non-member country in Mrs Chen’s situation either by reason of the emotional bonds between mother and child or on the ground that the mother’s right to enter and reside in the United Kingdom is dependent on her child’s right of residence.

According to the case-law of the Court, the status of ‘dependent’ member of the family of a holder of a right of residence is the result of a factual situation characterised by the fact that material support for the family member is provided by the holder of the right of residence.

In circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, the position is exactly the opposite in that the holder of the right of residence is dependent on the national of a non-member country who is her carer and wishes to accompany her. In those circumstances, Mrs Chen cannot claim to be a ‘dependent’ relative of Catherine in the ascending line within the meaning of Directive 90/364 with a view to having the benefit of a right of residence in the United Kingdom.

On the other hand, a refusal to allow the parent, whether a national of a Member State or a national of a non-member country, who is the carer of a child to whom Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 grant a right of residence, to reside with that child in the host Member State would deprive the child’s right of residence of any useful effect. It is clear that enjoyment by a young child of a right of residence necessarily implies that the child is entitled to be accompanied by the person who is his or her primary carer and accordingly that the carer must be in a position to reside with the child in the host Member State for the duration of such residence.}}

==Significance==
This case and similar examples {{citation needed|reason=what other examples|date=October 2016}} led to the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]], making it constitutionally possible in future for the [[Republic of Ireland]] to refuse citizenship to individuals who did not have an Irish parent.

A '''cyber-dissident''' is a professional journalist, an activist or [[citizen journalist]] who posts news, information, or commentary on the [[internet]] that implies criticism of a [[government]] or [[regime]].

The practice of cyber-dissidence may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a [[Gabon]]ese scholar and activist living in political exile in [[New Jersey]] in the United States. In 1998, he created a website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of [[Omar Bongo]] in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.globalwebco.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.bdpgabon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved [[blogosphere]], this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 [[Tunisia]]n and [[Egypt]]ian revolutions, where the Internet has proved to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition and revolution against dictators.

At least two [[Non-profit organizations|nonprofit organizations]] are currently working to raise awareness of the contributions of cyber-dissidents and to defend them against the [[human rights]] violations to which some of them are subjected:  [[Global Voices Online]] and [[Reporters Without Borders]].  The latter has released a ''Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001152614/https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542|title=Reporters sans frontières - Handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents|archivedate=1 October 2005|publisher=|url=https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber-dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206155535/http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119|title=Reporters sans frontières - Cyberdissidents imprisoned|archivedate=6 February 2007|publisher=|url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee to Protect Bloggers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216041912/http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/|title=Committee to Protect Bloggers|archivedate=16 December 2008|publisher=|url=http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4278241.stm|title=Global blogger action day called|date=22 February 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where [[Print media|print]] and [[Broadcast media|broadcast]] media are tightly controlled, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online postings by cyber-dissidents may be the only source of information about the experiences, feelings, and opinions of ordinary citizens.  This advantage may be offset by the difficulty in assessing the [[good faith]] and accuracy of reports originating from anonymous sources.

Recently, social-media tools have been widely credited with igniting pervasive social upheavals, some of which have even brought down governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2014-01-01|title=Sartre and Cyber-Dissidence: The Groupe en Fusion and the Putative We-Subject|url=https://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/sartre-studies/20/1/ssi200102.xml|journal=Sartre Studies International|language=en-US|volume=20|issue=1|doi=10.3167/ssi.2014.200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabon===
In July 2003, [[Amnesty International]] reported the arrest of five Gabonese known to be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2003, [[Cai Lujun]] was imprisoned for posting a series of articles online under the pen name "盼民主"("expecting for democracy") criticizing the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=45625] Cai Lujun, Imprisoned for Posting Internet Articles, Released at End of Sentence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In 2006, several [[blog]]gers in Egypt were arrested for allegedly defaming the president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and expressing critical views about Islam &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6164798.stm Egypt arrests another blog critic], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 November 2006.

===Iran===
In 2005, Mohamad Reza Nasab Abdolahi was imprisoned for publishing an open letter to [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]; Mohamad's pregnant wife and other bloggers who commented on Mohamad's treatment were also imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, A.

===Russia===
When Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2006 called on his nation's women to have more children, journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov published a satiric article on the Internet calling Putin "''the nation's [[phallus|phallic symbol]]''". Rakhmankov was found guilty of offending Vladimir Putin, and fined by the court of the region he lived in to the sum equal of 680 USD. The overall story served as a good adversiting for Rakhmanov's article, that was republished by numerous Russian sources afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211509/http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2007|title=GLASNOST DEFENSE FOUNDATION'S DIGEST No. 298|date=27 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html Russia: 'Phallic' Case Threatens Internet Freedom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111065759/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html |date=11 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1071549.html|title=U.S. Media Watchdog Criticizes Russia|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Russian bloggers has supposed in 2003, that Russian state security service [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]], the main successor to the [[KGB]], created special teams of people who appear on various blogs to [[harass]] and [[intimidate]] [[political blog]]gers and thus effectively prevent free discussion of undesirable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0430/win/polyanskaya_krivov_lomko.htm|title=Анна ПОЛЯНСКАЯ, Андрей КРИВОВ, Иван ЛОМКО: ВИРТУАЛЬНОЕ ОКО СТАРШЕГО БРАТА [WIN]|website=www.vestnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to such tactics are known as "[[active measures]]". A Russian critic of this theory has noted in 2003, that security services have more important tasks than flooding in forums.&lt;ref name="Usup"&gt;[http://old.russ.ru/politics/20030426-yusup-pr.html Conspiracy theory], by Alexander Yusupovskiy, Russian Journal, 25 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Digital Freedom Network]] has pointed out cases of imprisoning cyber-dissidents in Vietnam, such as the 2004 case of [[Pham Que Dong]], a former [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army]] colonel, military [[historian]] who had quit the Communist Party in 1999.  For publicly discussing issues related to corruption in the official structures and encouraging democratic reforms, he was charged with "abuse of democratic freedoms" and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital Freedom Network]] 30 July 2004: [http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml Vietnam's Human Rights Situation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080737/http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml |date=28 September 2007 }} by [[Alicia Burns]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v Canada'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Daishowa‑Marubeni International Ltd. v. Canada|link=|year=2013|court=scc|num=29|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-05-23|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a significant case of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concerning the application of Canadian income tax law, as well as the [[purposive approach|purposive interpretation]] of statutes.

==Background==
Daishowa‑Marubeni International Ltd., a company owned by [[Daishowa Paper Manufacturing]] and [[Marubeni Corporation]], operated pulp mills in [[Peace River, Alberta]] and in [[Quesnel, British Columbia]]. Through separate subsidiaries in [[High Level, Alberta]] ("High Level") and [[Red Earth Creek, Alberta]] ("Brewster"), it carried on the business of harvesting logs and manufacturing finished timber. At the beginning of 1999, the subsidiaries were amalgamated into the parent company.

High Level was sold later in 1999 to [[Tolko Industries Ltd.]], and Brewster in 2000 to Seehta Forest Products. Both transactions included the sale of timber licences, each of which is considered to be a "timber resource property" under the ''Income Tax Act'' (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Income Tax Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)), s. 13 |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/section-13.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109072736/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/section-13.html |archivedate=2013-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Alberta law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Forests Act'' (RSA 2000, c. F-22)|url = http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/F22.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; consent was granted for the transfer of such licences subject to the condition that the purchaser assume all obligations relating to the reforestation of the land covered by the licence.

In filing its 1999 and 2000 tax returns Daishowa did not include the amounts relating to the assumption of such liabilities as part of the proceeds of disposition relating to the sale of such properties. The Minister of National Revenue asserted that it should have been part of such amount, relying on the definition set out in the Act at s. 248(1):

{{quote|"amount" means money, rights or things expressed in terms of the amount of money or the value in terms of money of the right or thing…}}

The Minister accordingly reassessed, adding into the proceeds of disposition $11,000,000 in respect of High Level and $2,966,301 in respect of Brewster, based on the estimated cost in DMI's accounting records, and accordingly adjusted Daishowa's taxable income for the years in question. Daishowa appealed the reassessment to the [[Tax Court of Canada]], contending that the fair market value of those liabilities was not determinable at the time of closing and thus should not be included.

==The courts below==

At the TCC, [[Campbell J. Miller|Miller J]] allowed DMI's appeal of the Minister's reassessment in part. He agreed with the Minister, observing:

{{quote|[24] Dealing first with the issue of consideration, Daishowa has acknowledged that a benefit was received by it on the assumption by Tolko of the reforestation liability. Indeed there is an admitted fact: "If Tolko had not assumed the Appellant’s silviculture liability, the amount of cash or other consideration it would have paid the Appellant would have increased." Given that acknowledgement and admission, it is difficult to find the assumption of liability is not part of the consideration in the deal notwithstanding Daishowa took great pains to have that element of the deal removed from the definition of purchase price in the final agreement.}}

However, he held that it was not appropriate to add the entire estimated cost of the obligations to the proceeds, preferring to restrict the amount added back to the estimated cost that would take place within the 12 months following each sale, plus 20 percent of the estimated cost of the activities that would take place thereafter.

The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] dismissed Daishowa's appeal, allowed the Minister's cross-appeal and set aside the Judge's decision. In his ruling, [[Marc Nadon|Nadon JA]] (as he then was) agreed with Miller J as to the whether assumption of liabilities formed part of consideration, but held that there was no basis for reducing the value in question:

{{quote|[78] As part of its argument that the $11,000,000 relating to the silviculture liability should not be included in the proceeds of distribution, the appellant argued that the liability was uncertain or contingent and, as a result, not subject to taxation. In view of my conclusion that Tolko and the appellant had agreed to a specific price for the assumption of the silviculture liability, this submission is without merit. However, the following remarks regarding that argument will, I hope, be helpful.

[79] Liabilities are absolute or contingent. The Supreme Court defined a contingent liability as "a liability which depends for its existence upon an event which may or not happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Canada v. McLarty|link=|year=2008|court=scc|num=26|format=|pinpoint=par. 17|parallelcite=[2008] 2 SCR 79|date=2008-05-22|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a liability is not contingent, it is absolute. However, the jurisprudence interpreting subsection 13(21) of the Act does not ask whether the liability assumed by the purchaser is contingent or absolute; as a matter of fact, the nature of the liability assumed by a purchaser is irrelevant. Instead, the jurisprudence seems concerned only with the value attributed by the parties, if any, to the liability assumed by the purchaser. If the parties attribute no value to a future liability, then there is nothing to be added to the seller’s proceeds of disposition for the purpose of taxation.

[80] For instance, in the Contracts for the sale of both High Level and Brewster, the purchasers assumed all future tort liability flowing from their running the appellant’s timber mills. Obviously, if a worker had been injured through gross negligence at one of the two mills after the appellant had sold it, the purchasers would be liable for any tort damages that were awarded. Still, despite the existence of such future tort liability, the parties attributed no value to the assumption of this liability by the purchasers. Because no value was attributed by the parties to the purchasers’ assumption of tort liability, the Minister correctly did not add any income to the appellant’s disposition of proceeds for the assumption of that liability. Conversely, if the parties to an agreement attribute a value to a future liability, then the Minister is entitled to add this amount to the vendor’s proceeds of disposition – whether or not the liability assumed by the purchaser is contingent or absolute.}}

[[Robert Mainville|Mainville JA]] dissented, arguing that the reforestation obligations depressed the value of the timber resource properties, and thus resulted in a lower purchase price than would otherwise have been obtained for the sale.&lt;ref&gt;FCA, par. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Daishowa appealed the FCA ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada.

==At the SCC==
{{quote box|width=30%|[1] In this appeal, the Court is called upon to answer the age-old question:  If a tree falls in the forest and you are not around to replant it, how does it affect your taxes?|source= —Justice [[Marshall Rothstein]], in delivering his judgment}}

Appeal was allowed, and the matter was returned to the Minister for appropriate reassessment. In a unanimous ruling, [[Marshall Rothstein|Rothstein J]] dealt with two issues:

#Are the reforestation liabilities to be included in the proceeds of disposition because the vendor is relieved of a liability or are they integral to and run with the forest tenures?
#Does it make any difference that the parties agreed to a specific amount of the future reforestation liability?

On the first issue, he held:

:* Mainville J was correct in stating that the obligations {{emdash}} much like needed repairs to property {{emdash}} are a future cost embedded in the forest tenure that serves to depress the tenure’s value at the time of sale.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
:* as the cost of reforestation is not a distinct existing liability of the vendor, the assumption of such cost is thus excluded from proceeds of disposition independent of whether the cost is absolute or contingent.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the Minister's approach, which would have resulted in different values for the vendor's proceeds of disposition and the purchaser's adjusted cost base, is thus avoided, as "an interpretation of the Act that promotes symmetry and fairness through a harmonious taxation scheme is to be preferred over an interpretation which promotes neither value."&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second issue:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 44{{endash}}46&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the Minister and the lower courts were mistaken in relying on the company's accounting estimates as a basis for their reasoning
:* any amount that the parties assigned to the reforestation obligations in the sale agreement was simply a factor in determining the fair market value of the forest tenures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= I.J. Gamble|year= 2004|title= Taxation of Canadian Mining|url= |location= Toronto|publisher= Carswell|isbn= 0-459-28133-X|pages= 6-14{{endash}}6-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* It is also irrelevant that Daishowa estimated the cost of future reforestation to compute its income for accounting purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= V. Krishna|authorlink = Vern Krishna|year= 2006|title= The Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax|edition = 9th|url= |location= Toronto|publisher= Carswell|isbn=  0-459-28028-7|pages= 171{{endash}}172}}&lt;/ref&gt; as financial accounting and income tax calculation serve distinct purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Canderel Ltd. v.

==Impact==

In ''Daishowa'', the SCC made a distinction between obligations that do not affect the value of assets (such as [[mortgage]]s) and those that affect the value of property (such as the need for repairs). The assumption of the former would be included in the proceeds of disposition, while assumption of the latter would reduce the value (and therefore the purchase price) of the property.&lt;ref name = "EY2013"&gt;{{cite web|title = Supreme Court of Canada allows appeal in ''Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd. v The Queen'', 2013 SCC 29|url = http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Tax_Alert_2013_No_26/$File/TaxAlert2013No26.pdf|date = 24 May 2013|publisher = [[Ernst &amp; Young]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the distinction can be made based on whether a liability can be described as being embedded in a specific property right or not, which causes the following questions to arise:&lt;ref name = "EY2013"/&gt;

:* would pension deficits or post-retirement benefit obligations affect the value of property rights such as workforce in place or goodwill?
:* should an agreed estimate of such liabilities be included in proceeds of disposition to the vendor?
:* should the assumption of such obligations be reflected as an addition to the cost of assets acquired by the purchaser, and does such an addition occur at the time of acquisition or when such expenses are actually incurred?

During the SCC's hearing of the case, the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]], acting as an intervener, submitted that statutory obligations to reclaim mined land may be so physically connected to the process of mining itself that the obligations cannot be separated from the property right. Rothstein J declared in ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'':

{{quote|While I need not decide that question on the record before me, I would certainly not foreclose the possibility that obligations associated with a property right could be embedded in that property right without there being a statute, regulation or government policy that expressly restricts a vendor from selling the property right without assigning those obligations to the purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While of considerable economic significance to Canadian resource industries, and praised by observers as reflecting commercial common sense, ''Daishowa'' also has great importance in assessing the SCC's "modern" approach to statutory interpretation.&lt;ref name = "Spiro"&gt;{{cite web|author = Peter S. Spiro|title = The Supreme Court redefines Taxable Consideration: ''Daishowa‑Marubeni International Ltd. v. Canada''|url = http://www.thecourt.ca/2013/07/17/the-supreme-court-redefines-taxable-consideration-daishowa-marubeni-international-ltd-v-canada/|publisher = thecourt.ca|date = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as extensive in its use of the [[purposive approach]] as it was in ''[[Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)|Rizzo Shoes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)|link=Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.

Canada]]'' where Rothstein J (in his decision there) observed that interpretation should not be based on  "a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor with theories about what tax law ought to be or ought to do."&lt;ref name = "Spiro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3736">'''Deep pocket''' is an [[American English|American]] [[slang]] term; it usually means "extensive financial wealth or resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=deep pockets|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/deep+pockets|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=idioms.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used in reference to big companies or organizations (ex: the American [[tobacco]] companies have "deep pockets"), although it can be used in reference to wealthy individuals (e.g., [[Bill Gates]], [[Warren Buffett]]).

In the context of a lawsuit, the deep pocket is often the target [[defendant]], even when the true (moral) culpability is with another party because the deep pocket has money to pay a verdict. For example, a lawyer may comment that he or she sued the manufacturer of a product rather than the seller because it is the deep pocket, meaning it has more money than the seller with which to compensate the victim.

==Deep pocket as a slang term==
The term “deep pockets” (also given as “deep pocket” and “deep pocketed") is attested sparsely in the 1940s through the 1960s, but became popular with the litigation explosion of the 1970s.

A person with “short arms” and “deep pockets” is a person (sometimes derided as “miserly” or “cheap") who saves money and doesn’t often spend it. The term “short arms and deep/long pockets” is cited in print from at least 1952.

In Ireland, this phrase was attached to a wealthy business man from [[Tipparary]] who, upon his round of drinks, would break his glass on the floor, knowing the owner of the pub would ask him to leave. This was also called the “O’Shea Fiddle”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Deep pocket in law and economics==
Deep pocket is a concept often used in the [[law and economics]] of [[tort law]]. It refers to the idea that the [[risk]] of an activity should be borne by a person who is in a relatively good position to handle it. This can be achieved by either spreading the risk over a large number of risk-bearers (usually by means of [[insurance]]), or by imposing it on a person who is relatively [[risk neutrality|risk-neutral]]. The latter is often assumed to be the case for wealthy individuals or large corporations, who are referred to as having "deep pockets", since their wealth will not be affected very strongly if the risk materializes. For example, a deep-pocket argument might, among other arguments, be used to justify [[product liability]], as producers with "deep pockets" will normally be better able to accommodate the risk of damages than individual consumers not endowed with "deep pockets".

A variation on the term refers to the special subtype of [[frivolous litigation]] where plaintiffs target wealthy or corporate defendants for little other reason than them having high resources.  These cases involve plaintiffs who have suffered genuine damages, but the true [[culpability]] lies squarely with an individual or small entity who has very little money that could be collected if the suit was won.  Instead, the plaintiff targets the nearest marginally related large corporation or wealthy defendant, often with a weak accusation of [[negligence]].  A popular example is a person being shot by a criminal, and suing the manufacturer of the firearm instead of their attacker.  Sometimes legislation is passed to prevent such lawsuits, such as the [[Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act]].

A '''delivery order''' (abbreviated '''D/O'''&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;"小提單[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861605663/D_O.html D/O Definition]," MSN Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition]. 2007. Microsoft Corporation. Accessed 5 July 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023347978550 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a document from a [[Shipment|consignee]], or an owner or his agent of [[freight carrier]] which orders the release of the transportation of cargo to another party.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Mark. "Definition of Delivery Order." Teachmefinance.Com. 2005. markmccracken.com. Accessed 5 July 2007 (http://www.teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/delivery_order.html).&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually the written order permits the direct delivery of goods to a [[warehouseman]], [[Common carrier|carrier]] or other person who in the course of their ordinary business issues [[warehouse receipt]]s or [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;Dalton, Clark. "Uniform Law Conference of Canada - Proceedings of Annual Meetings." Uniform Law Conference of Canada. Aug. 1995. Uniform Law Conference of Canada. Accessed 5 July 2007 (http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/index.cfm?sec=1995⊂=1995af).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC)&lt;ref&gt;"U.C.C. Article 7 - Warehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading and Other Documents of Title." Cornell University Law School. 2005. The American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Accessed 5 July 2007 (https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/7/7-102.html#Bailee_7-102).&lt;/ref&gt; a delivery order refers to an "order given by an owner of goods to a person in possession of them (the carrier or warehouseman) directing that person to deliver the goods to a person named in the order."&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt; 

A delivery order which is used for the import of cargo should not to be confused with [[delivery instruction]]s. Delivery Instructions provides "specific information to the inland carrier concerning the arrangement made by the forwarder to deliver the merchandise to the particular pier or steamship line."&lt;ref name="USDOC"&gt;"Comprehensive Guide to International Trade Terms (Complete Text)." National Trade Data Bank's Guide to International Trade Terms. 1 September 1995. USDOC, OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION - International Government. Accessed 6 July 2007 (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/lexcon.txt).&lt;/ref&gt; 

:"A delivery order was not regarded as a document of title at common law with the result that the transfer of the delivery order did not effect transfer of constructive possession of the goods. Attornment on the part of the bailee was required (i.e., an acknowledgement that the bailee held the goods on behalf of the transferee). The Uniform Documents of Title Act permits the use of negotiable delivery orders (if the order directs delivery to a named person or order). However, it is still necessary to single out delivery orders for special treatment. Until the delivery order is accepted by the bailee, there is no basi for imposing obligations on the bailee. See discussion under sections 18 and 19 . See also the definition of "issuer"."&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt;

The '''Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002''' (2002 c. 13) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which reformed the electoral system in [[Northern Ireland]]. The act amended the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] by strengthening the requirements in the electoral registration process and requiring photographic identification at polling stations.

The [[Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland]] is the [[returning officer]] and [[electoral registration officer]] for all of Northern Ireland, and runs the [[Electoral Office for Northern Ireland]], which compiles the [[Electoral roll]] and manages all elections in Northern Ireland. In the rest of the United Kingdom, these functions are delegated by local authorities.

Under existing legalisation, the "head of household" was required to register all residents who were eligible to vote. The act changed the registration procedure, introducing [[Individual Electoral Registration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual voter ID plan brought forward to 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11312362|website=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requiring eligible voters to provide the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland with their signature, date of birth, [[National Insurance number]] and current residence. The act also required voters to present a photographic [[identity card]] at a polling station before casting a vote, with the [[Northern Ireland Electoral Identity Card]] created for voters without an acceptable form of ID.

Introduced to counter lack of public confidence in the electoral process in Northern Ireland, the Act was found to have improved public perceptions, and returning officers also reported a marked reduction in suspected incidences of voting fraud.&lt;ref name="sc_ni_2003"&gt;[[Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs]], 15 December 2004, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmniaf/131/13102.htm Impact of the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation was not without costs, however. In August 2002 the last register of electors compiled under the old system contained nearly 1.2 million names, while the first register under the new system, published in December 2002, contained less than 1.1 million names, losing some 120,000 names for a net reduction of 10%.&lt;ref name="sc_ni_2003"/&gt;

'''''Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States''''', 309 U.S. 436 (1940),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States|volume=309|page=436|year=1940}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] that limited the doctrine of the Court's 1938 decision in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co|link=|volume=304|page=175|pin=|year=1938}}, affirmed on rehearing, {{ussc|305|124|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 1926 decision in ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. General Electric Co.|link=|volume=272|page=476|pin=|year=1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court made a sharp distinction between (i) [[post-sale restraint]]s that a patentee imposed on purchasers of a patented product and (ii) restrictions (limitations) that a patentee imposed on a licensee to manufacture a patented product: the former being illegal and unenforceable under the [[exhaustion doctrine]] while the latter were generally permissible under a lenient "rule of reason." Thus, under the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine, a patent holder may permissibly license others to ''manufacture'' and then sell patented products in only a specified field (market), such as only a particular type of product made under the patent or only a particular category of customer for the patented product. The ''Ethyl'' decision held, however, that a patent licensing and distribution program based on both the sale of a patented product and licenses to manufacture a related product was subject to ordinary testing under the antitrust laws, and accordingly was illegal when its effect was to "regiment" an entire industry.

==Background==

[[File:EthylCorporationSign.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on an antique gasoline pump advertising tetra-ethyl lead]]

[[Ethyl Gasoline Corporation|Ethyl]] owned several patents on [[tetraethyllead|tetra-ethyl lead]], an anti-knock fuel additive, and on its utilization: two patents on the chemical itself, a patent on a motor fuel—gasoline containing tetra-ethyl lead, and a patent on a method of using the fuel in an automobile engine.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethyl established an elaborate licensing program under its several patents: Ethyl sold the fuel additive, and licensed purchasers to use it to practice the other patents. The licensing program fixed prices for the motor fuel and strictly limited the types of customer (''i.e.'', no price-cutters) to which given licensees could sell the motor fuel. Ethyl's program "controls the business of the major part of those engaged in manufacturing and distributing [gasoline] in the United States." Ethyl licensed almost every US refiner and its licensees refined 88% of the gasoline in the US.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 449.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ethyl's "long established practice .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to refuse to grant licenses to jobbers who cut prices or refuse to conform to the marketing policies and posted prices of the major refineries or the market leaders among them." &lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 450.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States sued Ethyl for violating the antitrust laws, and Ethyl claimed that its patents exempted its conduct.

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

[[File:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone]]

Ethyl emphasized to the Supreme Court the fact that, while it ''sold'' the fuel to refiners subject to a ''post-sale restraint'', it ''licensed'' the other patents, which covered the ''manufacture'' of the fuel (by adding tetra-ethyl lead to ordinary gasoline) and the method of using the fuel in automobile engines. Ethyl argued that the licensed patents and the manufacturing brought the case within the shelter of the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine. Ethyl urged that the various restrictions were "all reasonably necessary for the commercial development of [its] patents and for insuring a financial return from them, and are therefore within its patent monopoly." Further, they "are appropriate and reasonably adapted to the maintenance of the quality of the product and for the protection of the public in its use of a product containing a dangerous poison." &lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]], refused without dissent to make any distinctions among the different patents and struck the whole program down for improperly “regimenting” the industry in violation of the antitrust laws.

The Court said that Ethyl used its patents and licensing program to obtain
&lt;blockquote&gt;the power to exclude at will from participation in the nationwide market for lead-treated motor fuel all of the 12,000 motor fuel jobbers of the country, by refusing to license any of the 1,000 unlicensed jobbers, or by cancelling, as it may at will, the licenses of any of the 11,000 licensed jobbers.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 452.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It then unlawfully 

&lt;blockquote&gt;exercise[d] that power in such manner as to control the patented commodity in the hands of the licensed jobbers who had purchased it, [and] their actions with respect to it in ways not within the limits of the patent monopoly, and conspicuously among such controls which the Sherman law prohibits and the patent law does not sanction is the regulation of prices and the suppression of competition among the purchasers of the patented articles.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 452.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Relying on the exhaustion doctrine and citing ''[[Adams v. Burke]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Adams v. Burke|84|453|1873|Wall.|17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By its sales to refiners, it relinquishes its exclusive right to use the patented fluid and it relinquishes to the licensed jobbers its exclusive rights to sell the lead-treated fuel by permitting the licensed refiners to manufacture and sell the fuel to them. And, by the authorized sales of the fuel by refiners to jobbers, the patent monopoly over it is exhausted, and, after the sale, neither [Ethyl] nor the refiners may longer rely on the patents to exercise any control over the price at which the fuel may be resold.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court found this violative of the antitrust laws:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ethyl] has established the marketing of the patented fuel in vast amounts on a nationwide scale through the 11,000 jobbers and, at the same time, by the leverage of its licensing contracts resting on the fulcrum of its patents, it has built up a combination capable of use, and actually used, as a means of controlling jobbers' prices and suppressing competition among them. It seems plain that this attempted regulation of prices and market practices of the jobbers with respect to the fuel purchased, for which [Ethyl] could not lawfully contract, cannot be lawfully achieved by entering into contracts or combinations through the manipulation of which the same results are reached by the exercise of the power which they give to control the action of the purchasers. Such contracts or combinations, which are used to obstruct the free and natural flow in the channels of interstate commerce of trade even in a patented article, after it is sold by the patentee or his licensee, are a violation of the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 457-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court found it particularly objectionable that Ethyl exploited its patents by fixing the prices on which gasoline was sold, which was not the product that Ethyl manufactured and sold. "The licensing conditions are thus not used as a means of stimulating the commercial development and financial returns of the patented invention which is licensed, but for the commercial development of the business of the refiners and the exploitation of a second patent monopoly not embraced in the first."&lt;ref&gt;309 U.S. at 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N-400.pdf|thumb|USCIS Form N-400, Application for Naturalization (2016 revision)]]'''Form N-400''' is used to apply for [[Citizenship of the United States|US citizenship]] through the [[naturalization]] process. [[Permanent residence (United States)|Lawful permanent residents]] (also known as green card holders) of the United States, who meet the eligibility requirements, can file N-400 form to request citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/n-400 |title=Application for Naturalization &amp;#124; USCIS |publisher=Uscis.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 8.8 million Lawful Permanent Residents are eligible to naturalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/05/prweb12693392.htm|title=MyNaturalization.com, an Affordable Solution for US Naturalization|date=|publisher=Prweb.com|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming an American citizen gives the same rights and privileges of citizenship as [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural born American citizens]], except one : naturalized U.S. citizens are not eligible for the Office of the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Office%20of%20Citizenship/Citizenship%20Resource%20Center%20Site/Publications/PDFs/G-1151.pdf|title=National Customer Service Center|publisher=Uscis.gov|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US citizenship eligibility requirements==
To be able to apply for citizenship through naturalization, you have to meet the following requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-naturalization|title=How to Apply for Naturalization|website=USCIS|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; You must:
* Be 18 years of age or above.
* Be a lawful permanent resident for 5 years (3 years if married to a US citizen).
* Have maintained continuous residence during the past 5 years (3 years if married to a US citizen).
* Have maintained physical presence during the past 5 years (3 years if married to a US citizen).
* Have good moral character.
* Have basic knowledge of [[English language|English]].
* Have basic knowledge of [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] and [[History of the United States|history]].
* Be willing to take the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|Oath of Allegiance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/n-400instr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Instructions for Application for Naturalization|publisher=Uscis.gov|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The N-400 form is a series of questions about eligibility, personal information, marital history, children, criminal activities and the oath of allegiance to the United States. Many services, on the web, help candidates to the naturalization to fill the form. Sometimes, a lawyer's help is required.

Filing the form costs $640 along with a $85 biometric fee for a total of $725, where applicable. Exceptions can be seen on the federal website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/n-400|title=Application for Naturalization &amp;#124; USCIS|date=|publisher=Uscis.gov|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After filing the form, the applicant undergoes an interview process with the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS). The USCIS interview includes an English and civics test. The English test has three components: reading, writing, and speaking. The civics test covers important U.S. history and government topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/study-test |title=Study for the Test &amp;#124; USCIS |publisher=Uscis.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Decretals glossa.jpg|thumb|Decretals with Glossa ordinaria]]
The scholars of the 11th and 12th century legal schools in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] are identified as '''glossators''' in a specific sense. They studied [[Roman law]] based on the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'', the ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' of [[Justinian I|Justinian]], the ''Authenticum'' (an abridged Latin translation of selected constitutions of Justinian, promulgated in Greek after the enactment of the ''Codex'' and therefore called ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]]''), and his law manual, the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones Iustiniani]]'', compiled together in the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]''. (This title is itself only a sixteenth-century printers' invention.) Their work transformed the inherited ancient texts into a living tradition of [[medieval Roman law]].

The glossators conducted detailed text studies that resulted in collections of explanations. For their work they used a method of study unknown to the Romans themselves, insisting that contradictions in the legal material were only apparent. They tried to harmonize the sources in the conviction that for every legal question only one binding rule exists. Thus they approached these legal sources in a [[dialectic]]al way, which is a characteristic of medieval [[scholasticism]]. They sometimes needed to invent new concepts not found in Roman law, such as [[half-proof]] (evidence short of full proof but of some force, such as a single witness). In other medieval disciplines, for example [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], glosses were also made on the main authoritative texts.

In the [[Greek language]], γλῶσσα (''glossa'') means "tongue" or "language." Originally, the word was used to denote an explanation of an unfamiliar word, but its scope gradually expanded to the more general sense of "commentary". The glossators used to write in the margins of the old texts (''glosa marginalis'') or between the lines (''glosa interlinearis'' - interlinear glosses). Later these were gathered into large collections, first copied as separate books, but also quickly written in the margins of the legal texts. The medieval copyists at [[Bologna]] developed a typical script to enhance the legibility of both the main text and the glosses. The typically Bolognese script is called the [[Littera Bononiensis]].

[[Accursius]]'s ''[[Glossa ordinaria]]'', the final standard redaction of these glosses, contains around 100,000 glosses. Accursius worked for decades on this task. There exists no critical edition of his glosses.

The medieval lawyers also wrote glosses on the medieval texts of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] such as the [[Decretum Gratiani]] (around 1140), the ''Liber Extra'' of [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] (1234), the ''Liber Sextus'' of [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]] (1298) and later smaller collections of papal [[decretals]], verdicts in letter form sent to papal delegates. The decrets of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215, too, have received glosses.

In the older historiography of the medieval ''learned law'', the view developed that after the standard gloss had become fixed a generation of so-called ''[[commentator (historical)|commentators]]'' started to take over from the glossators. In fact, the early medieval legal scholars, too, wrote commentaries and lectures, but their main effort was indeed creating glosses.

Most of the older glosses are accessible only in medieval manuscripts: modern editions of only a few manuscripts exist. The main microfilm collections of glossed legal manuscripts are at the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History in Frankfurt am Main, at the universities of Munich, Würzburg, Milan, Leyden and Berkeley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1763">In law, '''horizontal effect''' refers to the ability of legal requirements meant to apply only to public bodies to affect private rights. It arises where a court dealing with a legal dispute between purely private entities interprets a legal provision to be consistent with certain legal norms in such a way as to affect the legal rights and obligations of the parties before it.

==Examples==
In [[European Union law]] under the doctrine of [[direct effect]], national courts are under a legal duty to interpret national laws to be consistent with EU laws which the member state concerned has either not implemented or not implemented correctly. The ability of such interpretations to affect the legal rights and duties of purely private entities is called horizontal direct effect. Normally, direct effect is only vertical, in that it is meant to apply to the state and its emanations (i.e., to public sector employers).

In the [[United Kingdom]], in Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;[2004] UKHL 22&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords found that while the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] cannot create new causes of action between individuals, "if there is a relevant cause of action, the court as a public authority must act compatibly with both parties' Convention rights."&lt;ref&gt;per Baroness Hale.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

'''Impleader''' is a procedural device before trial in which one party [[Joinder|joins]] a third party into a lawsuit because that third party is [[liable]] to an original [[defendant]].  Using the vocabulary of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], the defendant seeks to become a '''third-party plaintiff''' by filing a  '''third party complaint''' against a third party not presently party to the lawsuit, who thereby becomes a '''third-party defendant'''.  This complaint alleges that the third party is liable for all or part of the damages that the original plaintiff may win from the original defendant.

The theory is that two cases may be decided together and justice may be done more efficiently than by having two suits in a series.

Common bases of contingent or derivative [[legal liability|liability]] by which third parties may be impleaded include [[indemnity]], [[subrogation]], [[contribution (law)|contribution]], and [[warranty]].

For example, in a case where a driver rear-ended another car due to faulty brakes, and is sued by the accident victim, the driver may decide to implead the repair shop where the brakes were worked on because the driver's liability derives from the repair shop's liability for their faulty repair of the brakes.

==Federal Rules of Civil Procedure==

An example of this is [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule14.htm Rule 14] ("'''Third Party Practice'''") of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Rule 14(a)(1):  The nonparty must be served with the third party complaint as well as a [[summons (law)|summons]].  If the original defendant intends to do this more than 14 days after serving its original answer, it must first, by motion, obtain the court's leave to do so.

Rule 14(a)(2):  When properly served, the third-party defendant
*must assert any defense against the thirdparty plaintiff's claim under Rule 12;
*must assert any [[counterclaim]]s against the third-party plaintiff that are compulsory under Rule 13(a);
*may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);

The '''Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2006''' is a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;6/29/2006 Placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 303.  '''''See [[#References|References]]'''''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several bills on the topic of [[network neutrality]] proposed as part of a major overhaul of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]].  The Act is sponsored by Rep. [[James Sensenbrenner]] (R-WI), Rep. [[John Conyers]] (D-MI), Rep. [[Rick Boucher]] (D-VA), Rep. [[Zoe Lofgren]] (D-CA), Rep. [[Robert Andrews (politician)|Robert Andrews]] (D-NJ), and Rep. [[Pete Visclosky]] (D-IN).

The legislation was approved 20-13 by the [[House Judiciary committee]] on May 25, 2006, but was never taken up on the floor of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and therefore failed to become law.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Overview==
The "Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2006" has the stated purpose of the promoting competition, facilitating trade, and ensuring competitive and non discriminatory access to the internet (see [[net neutrality]]). It proposes a change in the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination by broadband network providers.  Specifically, the Act would make it unlawful for any broadband network provider to discriminate against any content, applications, or services, or to refuse to connect to other broadband providers.  It would also make it unlawful for any broadband provider to restrict the sending or receiving of lawful conduct, to charge premiums for unrestricted access to lawful content, and to fail to disclose any terms, conditions, or limitations on the service it provides. Additionally, the Act would require any prioritization or enhanced quality of service to certain types of data to apply to all data of that type, regardless of the origin of such data, without imposing a surcharge for the enhanced service.

In [[Italy]] the Senior [[Civil Service]] or "la dirigenza"{{Specify|date=January 2017}} is the set of high-ranking executives (“Dirigenti”) who are in charge of the top and middle management of national or local governmental offices.

==Structure==

Senior executives come in two echelons:
*First level: Directors Generals and Chief of Departments (about 400 executives)
*Second level: Directors of Division and heads of peripheral units (about 3,500 executives)
First and second level positions are identified in each ministry. Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry.
In each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry.

Until October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the "Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter-ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept.

Other public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. 
Today senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: 
* I (Ministries),
* II (Regions and Territorial Autonomies),
* III (National Health Service - administrative),
* IV (National Health Service - medical),
* V (School),
* VI (Fiscal and economic Agencies),
* VII (University),
* VIII (Prime Minister's Office).

Civil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements.

==Recruitment==

Executives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition:

*the “Fast Stream Programme” (“Corso-Concorso di Formazione Dirigenziale”) is for people who join the Public Administration School ("Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione") after a highly selective national exam, getting immediately a senior rank position. The curriculum of this school covers 30 months of alternating theoretical training - mostly in organisational sociology - and practical training - with many hands-on problems - and internships, often at the [[European Commission]] or other international bodies. On completion, students have to pass another examination. Depending on their results, graduates select their future ministry. The level required for every applicant is a master's. Applicants may be students, Italian or foreign government executives or private sector managers. The Public Administration School actively encourages the emergence of a team spirit in all basic training programmes. Graduates from the first classes have set up an association whose aim is to disseminate innovation in the public administration. Moreover, courses are not only taught by government executives but also by academic researchers, which leads to training partnerships with the universities;
*the second type is a competition organised by the ministries. The prerequisites and training standards are less strict than as for the first type. Candidates who pass this competition follow a programme of almost one year at the Public Administration School.

The executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term.

==Appointment and tenure==

The status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts:

*a permanent contract with the ministry where he is employed;
*a fixed-term contract with his or her supervisor (secretary-general of the ministry for first level executives, and first level executives for second level executives).

Fixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is  nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic-planning results.

First level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position.

==Performance assessment and pay==

The pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance ("pay for performance"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service.

Pay is based on:
*a fixed wage (60% of the remuneration);
*a portion (20%) linked to the responsibility attached to the position, corresponding to different [[pay grade]]s adopted by the ministry (three levels at the Civil Service Ministry - A-B-C - and five at the Finance Ministry - A-B-C-D-E). This classification is transparent and published by every ministry;
*a percentage (20%) tied to the achievement of objectives.

Executives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy
of actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the
management-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to
determine whether to keep and/or to promote them.

Assessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee.

When an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration).

==Promotion and mobility==

An executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may  be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities.

When the "rotation" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. 
Five-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career.

==Training and learning==

Continuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give  executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives.

Lastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers.

==History==

===Background of reforms===
In February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws.

*a new agency, ARAN, which represents the public employer in negotiations with unions and is responsible for drafting collective bargaining agreements;
*a separation between political responsibilities (indirizzo politico) and administrative responsibilities (responsabilità dirigenziale );
*a new senior management profile: new values, new responsibilities, new management methods;
*the development of an inter-ministerial pool of executives responsible "for the results of the activity managed by their offices and the execution of programmes and projects entrusted to them in the light of productivity objectives and for financial, technical and administrative management results, including organisational and personnel management decisions."

===Reform initiatives and results===
While the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level:

a) 1993 to 1998: the "privatisation" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements.

b) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter-ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter-ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market.

c) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The "ruolo unico dei dirigenti" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility.

===Objectives and new competencies===
The newly organised "dirigenza" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil  service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.

The '''James J. Lunsford Law Library''' is a member of the [[Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library System]] (THPL) and the [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] Public Library Cooperative (HCPLC). 

Located on Twiggs Street, in Tampa, Florida, the research/reference library is dedicated to providing a place for the public and the legal profession to find relevant source materials for legal research.&lt;ref name=james&gt;[http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/law/ "James J. Lunsford Law Library"], ''Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1937, The Hillsborough County Law Library opened in the Old Courthouse at the corner of Franklin and Lafayette (now Kennedy). At age 67, James Joseph Lunsford, a self-taught attorney, came out of retirement to head the newly founded library. The library's original collection included Lunsford's own law books along with those of his colleagues and peers. He worked there for more than fourteen years and up until his death in 1952 at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcplc.org/hcplc/locations/law/lunsford.html "About the James Joseph Lunsford Law Library"], ''Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the day after James Joseph Lunsford's death, the library moved from the Old Courthouse location to the then new courthouse at Pierce and Kennedy. The library moved several more times after that. In 1991, the library relocated to the [[Fred Karl]] Legal Center at Jefferson and Kennedy. Then, in October 2000, the library moved to a temporary location at 501 E. Kennedy Blvd at Morgan and Kennedy. 

In 2001, the Hillsborough County Law Library was re-dedicated to Hillsborough County's first law librarian, James Joseph Lunsford.

In July 2008 the library moved to its current home in the old courthouse building, located at 701 E. Twiggs St., at the corner of Pierce and Twiggs.

In March 2015, The James J. Lunsford Law Library officially joined the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcplc.org/thpl/history/ "Library History"], ''Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Junta''', '''Junta General''', '''Juntas''', or '''Cortes of the Kingdom of Galicia'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|pp=475–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[representative assembly]] of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]&lt;ref&gt;From the 13th century united with the [[Kingdom of Castile]] under the same [[Crown of Castile|Crown]].&lt;/ref&gt; from the 15th century —when it originated as a general assembly of all the powers of the Kingdom aimed at the constitution of ''[[hermandades]]'' (brotherhood)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barros|first=Carlos|title=As orixes medievais da Xunta de Galicia|url=http://www.h-debate.com/cbarros/spanish/xunta.htm|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;— and until 1834, when the Kingdom and its General Assembly were officially disbanded by a Royal decree. It declared itself the supreme authority of the Kingdom from June 18, 1808, during the [[Peninsular war]] and due to the abdication of the King, and until Galicia was conquered by the [[Napoleon]]ic troops in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|p=XXIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially the ''Xuntas Generales del Reino de Galicia'' was an assembly where representatives of the three states of the Kingdom (noblemen, churchmen, and the commoners) met. But soon it followed the evolution prompted by the [[List of heads of state of Spain|King of Spain]] in other representative institutions, such as the [[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]] of Castile, so becoming monopolized by the [[bourgeoisie]] and lesser nobility (''[[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|fidalgos]]''), who controlled most of the [[city council|local councils]] of the cities and towns of the Kingdom, and at the expenses of Church and nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1599 the composition of the assembly became fixed and reduced to just seven deputies, each one representing one of the Kingdom provinces, and appointed by the council of the province's capital —[[Santiago de Compostela]], [[A Coruña]], [[Betanzos]], [[Lugo]], [[Mondoñedo]], [[Ourense]], and [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|p=XXIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;— from among its members. Other towns, namely [[Viveiro]] and [[Pontevedra]], tried during the 17th and 18th century to regain a direct representative in the assembly, to no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Xunta'', whilst having little direct intervention in law making,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=David|title=Spanish naval power, 1589-1665 : reconstruction and defeat|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-52257-1|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvpi7nLo80QC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=junta+reino+galicia+assembly&amp;hl=gl&amp;ei=h9W6TtjvAdDWsgb_i9mwBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=junta%20reino%20galicia%20assembly&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not much control over the Royal administration,&lt;ref&gt;Only in few occasions the King permitted the deputies to supervise the labour of the ''Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia''. Cf. {{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|pp=258–289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; could nevertheless rise armies, ships and taxes, conceding or denying the King's petitions on behalf of all the local powers of the Kingdom; the assembly could also petition the King himself, this being the usual mean it used for modifying or approving laws, or for promoting the interests of the Kingdom. The ''Xunta'' was also recognized as the voice and representative of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditions and rights (''foros'').

Notwithstanding, the [[List of heads of state of Spain|King]] never consented on the petition of the assembly to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly can only take place when in presence of one representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the [[Governor]]-[[Captain General]] of the Kingdom, so trying to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|De Artaza|1998|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 18th century, with the advent of the [[absolutists]] [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchs, the ''Xunta'' was gradually deprived of its powers.

A '''legal person''' (in legal contexts often simply '''person''', less ambiguously '''legal entity''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/legal-entity/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/entity]&lt;/ref&gt; is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contracts between Legal Persons|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16049|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Lewis A.

The term "legal person" is however ambiguous because it is also used in contradistinction to "natural person", i.e. as a synonym of terms used to refer only to non-human legal entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/juridical-person/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person]&lt;/ref&gt;

So there are of two kinds of legal entities, human and non-human: [[natural person]]s (also called ''physical persons'') and [[juridical person]]s (also called ''juridic'', ''juristic'', ''artificial'', ''legal'', or ''fictitious persons'', {{lang-la|persona ficta}}), which are other entities (such as corporations) that are treated in law as if they were persons.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deiser|first=George F.|title=The Juristic Person.

While human beings acquire legal [[personhood]]  [[birth certificate|when they are born]] (or even before in [[Personhood#Beginning_of_personhood|some]] jurisdictions), juridical persons do so when they are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in accordance with law.

Legal personhood is a prerequisite to [[legal capacity]], the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and [[Law of obligations|obligations]].

In [[international law]], consequently, legal personality is a prerequisite for an [[international organization]] to be able to sign [[international treaties]] in its own [[Legal name|name]].

== Juridical persons ==
{{Main article|Juridical person}}

'''Artificial personality''', '''juridical personality''', or '''juristic personality''' is the characteristic of a non-living [[entity]] regarded by law to have the status of [[personhood]].

A '''juridical''' or '''artificial''' person ({{lang-la|'''persona ficta'''}}; also juristic person) has a [[Legal name (business)|legal name]] and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability|liabilities]] in law, similar to those of a [[natural person]]. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental [[legal fiction]]. It is pertinent to the [[philosophy of law]], as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation ([[Corporate law|corporations law]]).

Juridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (''universitas personarum'') to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its [[shareholder]]s). They may [[Lawsuit|sue and be sued]], enter contracts, incur [[debt]], and own [[property]]. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may [[Limited liability|shield its members]] from [[legal liability|personal liability]].

In some [[common law jurisdictions]] a distinction is drawn between ''corporation aggregate'' (such as a company, which has a number of members) and a ''[[corporation sole]]'' (which is where a person's public office is deemed to have a separate personality from them as an individual). Both have separate legal personality.  Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is a corporation sole), but a [[Corporation sole#Corporations sole in the United Kingdom|number of other public offices]] are now formed as corporations sole.

The concept of juridical personality is not absolute. "[[Piercing the corporate veil]]" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as [[Law of agency|agents]] involved in a [[corporate action|company action]] or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or [[public limited company]] are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or [[Board of directors#Directors|director]]s.

The concept of a juridical person is now central to [[Western law]] in both [[common law|common-law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3313312 The Juristic Person. I], George F. Deiser, University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register, Vol. 57, No. 3, Volume 48 New Series. (Dec., 1908), pp. 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Some examples of juridical persons include:

*[[Cooperative]]s (co-ops), business organization owned and [[Democracy|democratically]] operated by a group of individuals for their mutual benefit
*[[Corporation]]s are bodies corporate created by statute or charter. A [[corporation sole]] is a corporation constituted by a single member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some [[legal benefit]] or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or [[The Crown]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by more than one member.
**[[Municipality|Municipal corporations]] (municipalities) are "creatures of [[statute]]". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons, including [[European economic interest grouping]]s (EEIGs).
*[[Voluntary association|Unincorporated associations]], that is aggregates of two or more persons, are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.
*[[Partnership]]s, an aggregate of two or more persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having an independent legal personality.
*[[Company|Companies]], a form of [[Companies law|business association]] that carries on an industrial enterprise, are often corporations, although companies may take other forms, such as [[trade union]]s, [[Unlimited company|unlimited companies]], [[Investment trust|trusts]], and [[Mutual fund|funds]]. [[Limited liability company|Limited liability companies]]—be they a [[private company limited by guarantee]], [[private company limited by shares]], or [[public limited company]]—are entities having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Different types have a complex variety of advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Complexity&gt;Frisch D. (2011).

''George Mason Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sovereign state]]s are legal persons.
*In the [[international legal system]], various organizations possess legal personality. These include [[intergovernmental organizations]] (the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]]) and some other [[international organization]]s (including the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], a [[religious order]]).
*The [[European Union]] (EU) has legal personality since the [[Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force on 1 December 2009. That the EU has legal personality is a prerequisite for [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|the EU to join the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]]. However, in 2014, the EU decided not to be bound by the rulings of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Opinion 2/13 [2014], nyr [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=DOC&amp;docid=160882&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=240894]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Temples, in some legal systems, have separate legal personality.&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v The Shipping Corporation of India'' (US District Court, Eastern District Virginia), 10 March 1980, 63 ILR 363&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Whanganui River]] was granted legal personality in March 2017 under [[New Zealand]] law because the Whanganui [[Māori people|Māori]] tribe regard the river as their ancestor.&lt;ref name="roy-2017"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also, in March 2017, the [[Uttarakhand High Court|High Court of Uttarakhand]] declared the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] a  legal "person" in a move that according to one newspaper, "could help in efforts to clean the pollution-choked rivers". As of 6 April 2017, the ruling has been commented on in [[India]]n newspapers to be hard to enforce, with assertions that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} do not anticipate immediate benefits, that the ruling is "hardly game changing", that experts{{who|date=July 2017}} believe "any follow-up action is unlikely", and that the "judgment is deficient to the extent it acted without hearing others (in states outside [[Uttarakhand]]) who have stakes in the matter".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Not all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.

== History ==
The concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as [[Ancient Rome]]: a variety of  [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegial institutions]] enjoyed the benefit under [[Roman law]].

The doctrine has been attributed to [[Pope Innocent IV]], who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of ''persona ficta'' as it is called in Latin. In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the doctrine of ''persona ficta'' allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty.  Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of [[delict]] due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities.  This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence and excommunicated.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, “The Historic Background of Corporate Legal Personality,” Yale Law Journal, Vol. XXXV, April 1926, pages 655-673&lt;/ref&gt;

In the common law tradition, only a person could sue or be sued. This was not a problem in the era before the [[Industrial Revolution]], when the typical business venture was either a [[sole proprietorship]] or [[partnership]]—the owners were simply liable for the debts of the business. A feature of the corporation, however, is that the owners/shareholders enjoyed [[limited liability]]—the owners were ''not'' liable for the debts of the company. Thus, when a corporation breached a contract or broke a law, there was no remedy, because limited liability protected the owners and the corporation wasn't a legal person subject to the law. There was no accountability for corporate wrongdoing.

To resolve the issue, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights—the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/892043129|title=Textbook on legal methods, legal systems and research|last=Kanti.|first=Saha, Tushar|isbn=9788175348936|oclc=892043129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of [[personal jurisdiction]]). In ''Louisville, C. &amp; C.R. Co. v. Letson'', 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is "capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person." Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that "those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it," should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.

== Sample cases using the doctrine ==
* In ''U.S. v. The Cooper Corp.'', (1941) the court held that the United States government, as a juristic person, could sue under the [[Sherman Act]]. Section 7 of the act granted the right to sue only to persons. The corporate defendant, which was accused of illegally conspiring and colluding to raise prices on [[tire]]s, argued that the U.S. government didn't have power to enforce the act because the government wasn't a person. The court held that the term "person" includes the U.S. Government, and allowed the action against the collusive corporations to continue.
* In ''Cook County v. U.S. ex rel Chandler'', (2003) the County was accused of violating a law which forbids "any person" from falsely obtaining research funds from the government. The county received a $5 million grant, but used it to conduct inappropriate tests on human subjects. The county argued that it could not be held liable because it was not a person. The court held that the county could be sued under the law as a legal person.
* In ''Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council'', (1993) the court declined to extend certain rights to legal persons. The association of prisoners sought to proceed ''[[in forma pauperis]].'' The court held that the right to sue ''in forma pauperis'' existed only for natural persons, not legal persons.

== Extension of basic rights to legal persons ==

=== Brazil ===
The term juridical person ("pessoa jurídica" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is used in [[legal science]] for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.

[[Brazilian law]] recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.

=== Germany ===
Article 19(3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] sets forth: "Fundamental rights shall also apply to domestic artificial persons insofar as the nature of such rights shall permit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#19|title=Basic Law. Art. 19 Abs. 3 GG|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In Italy [[trade unions]] have legal personality, as stated in Article 39, Paragraph 4 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]]:

{{quote|Registered trade unions are legal persons. They may, through a unified representation that is proportional to their membership, enter into collective labour agreements that have a mandatory effect for all persons belonging to the categories referred to in the agreement. |source=The Italian Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== New Zealand ===
Section 28 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] provides: "... the provisions of this Bill of Rights apply, so far as practicable, for the benefit of all legal persons as well as for the benefit of all natural persons."

=== People's Republic of China ===
For a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the [[General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China]], Chapter III, Article 36., "A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dernelle. "DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA." DePaul Business Law Journal, Spring/Summer 1994. (6 DePaul Bus. L.J. 331)&lt;/ref&gt; Note however that the term [[civil right]] means something altogether different in civil law jurisdictions than in common law jurisdictions.

=== United States ===
In part based on the principle that legal persons are simply organizations of natural persons, and in part based on the history of statutory interpretation of the word "person", the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that certain constitutional rights protect legal persons ([[Corporate personhood|such as corporations]] and other organizations). ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that "the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the [[equal protection]] of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does."

Later opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=147&amp;invol=165 Noble v. Union River Logging]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, because of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the [[Due Process Clause]], a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.

A prominent component of relevant case law is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://origin.www.supremecourt.gov/docket/08-205.htm {{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In Act II, Scene 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have "two independent appetites". He is, however, turned down by the Court (made up of fellow Gondolieri) because the joint rule "... is a legal person, and legal person are solemn things."

Communist parties held permanent majorities in all of these legislatures. As a result, the legislatures themselves held very little power; policy was decided within the [[Communist Party]] and then easily passed through the legislature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28649">A [[geographical indication]] (GI) is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country). [[India]], as a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), enacted the [[Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999]] has come into force with effect from 15 September 2003. GIs have been defined under Article 22(1) of the [[WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]([[TRIPS]]) Agreement as: "Indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a member, or a region or a locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographic origin."&lt;ref name=kt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/k%60taka-gets-highest-numbergi-tags/319698/|title=Karnataka gets highest number of GI tags|date=11 April 2008|publisher=[[Business Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GI tag ensures that none other than those registered as authorised users (or at least those residing inside the geographic territory) are allowed to use the popular product name. [[Darjeeling tea]] became the first [[GI tag]]ged product in India, in 2004-05, since then by  oct 2018, 321 had been added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = GI tag in india|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/geographical-indicators/1/590450.html|work = Geographical Indications Registry|publisher = Intellectual Property Office, Chennai|access-date = 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are listed below.

Madhya Pradesh is just a step away from getting the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Kadaknath, the all-black fowl reared by tribal communities. After five years of detailing, the Geographical Indication registry office in Chennai has given acceptance in principle in this regard. The application was advertised and accepted in the Geographical Indications Journal, Number # 104, dated March 28, 2018.

If all goes well, after 120 days from the date of the publication of the journal, the state would get the certificate, probably in the last week of July.

'''Banning''' was a [[Political repression|repressive]] [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] measure&lt;ref name="SCA"&gt;[[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950]], at Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/suppression-of-communism-act%2C-act-no-44-of-1950 Suppression of Communism Act, 1950], at South African History Online&lt;/ref&gt;, used by the [[racist]] South African [[apartheid]] régime (1948-1994) against its [[Internal resistance to apartheid|political opponents]]&lt;ref name="936bannings"&gt;[https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/number-banned-persons-south-africa-totals-936 Number of banned persons in South Africa totals 936], at South African History Online&lt;/ref&gt;. A banning order entailed restrictions on where the banned person could live and who they could have contact with, required that they report weekly to a police station, and also proscribed them from traveling outside a specific [[Magistrate's court (South Africa)|magisterial district]] and from appearing or speaking in public. It proscribed broadcasters and the press from broadcasting, publishing or reporting the banned person's words. It thus mixed elements of [[internal exile]], [[suppression order]]s and [[censorship]].

Contact restrictions under a banning order typically included a prescribed maximum number of other people permitted to be in the same room with the banned person at any time. As few as two other people might be permitted. The banned person was forbidden all contact with other banned persons and was forbidden to engage in political, social or community organizing.

The legislative authority for banning orders was the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/DC/leg19500717.028.020.044/leg19500717.028.020.044.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;, which defined virtually all opposition to apartheid as "Communism". The régime ceased to deploy bannings and lifted all remaining banning orders in 1990&lt;ref name="936bannings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094918 South Africa profile - Timeline - BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;, in the run-up to the [[South African general election, 1994|advent]] of [[Politics of South Africa|democracy in South Africa]] in 1994&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;.

'''''Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson''''', 478 U.S. 804 (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson|volume=478|page=804|pin=|year=1986}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision involving the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Thompsons, residents of [[Canada]], and the MacTavishes, residents of [[Scotland]], filed virtually identical complaints against [[Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]] in the Court of Common Pleas in [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], claiming negligence, fraud, breach of warranty, and misbranding in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FDCA). The mother in each family had taken the drug [[Bendectin]] during [[pregnancy]] which they claimed caused harm to their children including birth defects.

The case was filed in state court and then removed to federal district court where it was found that Count IV (the misbranding count) of the complaint alleged a cause of action arising under federal law and the motion to remand was denied. It then granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on [[forum non conveniens]] grounds. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] reversed claiming that the FDCA did not create or imply a private right to sue for injury resulting in no federal subject matter jurisdiction.

==Issue==
The question raised was whether the federal district courts have original federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 when a claim arises out of a federal statute that has not specifically granted a private right to a [[cause of action]]. The case considered several different tests to determine when a case is covered under original jurisdiction for the federal courts. These tests include:

'''Holmes' "Creation" Test''':&lt;br /&gt;
The "vast majority" of cases that come within this grant of jurisdiction are covered by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]]' statement that a "`suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Merrell Dow'', 478 U.S. at 808, quoting {{ussc|name=American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp; Bowler Co.|volume=241|page=257|pin=260|year=1916}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Franchise Tax Board'' Test''':&lt;br /&gt;
The Court has also granted jurisdiction "where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turned on some construction of federal law."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust|volume=463|page=1|pin=9-10|year=1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Smith'' Test''' (Quoting from the dissent):&lt;br /&gt;
"The general rule is that where it appears from the bill or statement of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable, and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has jurisdiction [478 U.S. 804, 820] under [the statute granting federal question jurisdiction]."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co.|volume=255|page=180|pin=199|year=1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority opinion==
The Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit and ruled that there was no [[Federal-question jurisdiction|federal question]] [[Subject matter jurisdiction|jurisdiction]].

[[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], writing for the majority, took as his starting point the conclusion that Congress did not intend a private Federal cause of action for violations of the FDCA; in other words, private parties may not bring a suit solely on the basis of a violation of the Act. This was the Sixth Circuit's determination, and it was not disputed by any of the parties to the suit.

The Court states that the significance of the lack of a Federal cause of action "cannot be overstated." The ruling relies heavily on the notion of respect for congressional intent. The Court interprets the fact that Congress did not create a cause of action to be conclusive evidence that Congress did not intend for claimed violations of the FDCA as elements of a state cause of action to be "substantial" enough to confer federal-question jurisdiction.

==Dissent==
[[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]], writing for the dissent, argued that there is federal jurisdiction whenever a federal question is an ingredient of the action. Furthermore, there may be federal question jurisdiction even though both the right asserted and the remedy sought by a plaintiff are state created. Additionally, federal courts are much more adept at interpreting and applying federal law, and more likely to correctly understand Congress’ intent in enacting legislation than are state courts.

==Aftermath==
It was not entirely clear from the opinion whether lack of a private cause of action will always be dispositive in every case. The Court clarified the issue in ''[[Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg.|volume=545|page=308|pin=|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the absence of a right of action is relevant evidence of congressional intent, but does not necessarily decide the question in all cases.

The '''Old County Courthouse''' (also known as the '''Plymouth Old County Courthouse''' or the '''Old Town House''') is an historic [[court house]] on [[Leyden Street]] and Market Street in the Town Square of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].  Built in 1749, the two story wood frame building is believed to be the oldest wooden courthouse in the United States; it stands on the site of the first (1620) courthouse built by [[Plymouth Colony]] settlers, and may incorporate elements of a 1670 building.  It is five bays wide and three deep, with a center entry flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a gabled pediment.  It was built by [[Peter Oliver (loyalist)|Peter Oliver]], and initially served as both a courthouse and as town offices.  It was converted to solely municipal use in 1821, and had a myriad of municipal functions since then.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=PLY.90|title=NRHP nomination for Old County Courthouse|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s it was converted into a museum.

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;  It is now known as the '''1749 Court House and Museum''', and is open from June to September with exhibits of early Plymouth history.

'''Paul Goma''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈpa.ul ˈɡoma}}; born October 2, 1935) is a Romanian writer, also known for his activities as a [[dissident]] and leading opponent of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] before 1989. Forced into exile by the communist authorities, he became a [[political refugee]] and currently resides in France as a [[stateless person]]. After 2000, Goma has expressed opinions on [[World War II]], the [[Holocaust in Romania]] and the Jews, claims which have led to widespread criticism for [[antisemitism]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Goma was born to a Romanian family in [[Selişte, Orhei|Mana]] village, [[Raionul Orhei|Orhei County]], which at that time was a part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], nowadays part of [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]]. His parents, Eufimie Goma (1909–1967) and Maria Goma (''née'' Popescu; 1909–1974), were schoolteachers in Mana. His brother Petre was born in 1933, but died before his first birthday.

After the 1940 [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation of Bessarabia]], Paul Goma's father was taken away by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and deported to [[Siberia]]. In October 1943, Eufimie Goma was found by his family, as a [[prisoner of war]], in "Camp No. 1 for Soviet Prisoners", in [[Slobozia]], [[Ialomiţa County]], Romania.

In March 1944, the Goma family took refuge in [[Sibiu]], [[Transylvania]]. In August 1944, finding themselves in danger of involuntary "[[repatriation]]" to the Soviet Union, they fled to the village of [[Şeica Mare|Buia]], by the [[Târnava Mare River]]. From October to December 1944, the Goma family hid in the forests around Buia. On January 13, 1945 they were captured by Romanian shepherds and turned over to the [[Gendarmerie]] in [[Sighişoara]], where they were interned at the "Centrul de Repatriere" ("Repatriation Center"). There, Eufimie Goma managed to forge documents for his family; however, Maria Goma's brother, who didn't have forged papers, was promptly "repatriated to Siberia". In June 1945, taking advantage of the forged documents, they returned to Buia.&lt;ref name="Goma_bio"&gt;Paul Goma, in {{ro icon}}, [http://paulgoma.com/includes/bio_biblio_Paul_GOMA.php Bio - Bibliografie], November 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Paul Goma would describe his family's refugee saga in the novels ''Arta refugii'' ("The Art of Refuge", a wordplay on the Romanian words for "refuge" and "taking flight"), ''Soldatul câinelui'' ("Dog's Soldier"), and ''Gardă inversă'' ("Reverse Guard").

===Dissident in Romania===

In May 1952, Goma, while a student in 10th grade, was detained for eight days by the [[Securitate]] for speaking out in the classroom about [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|Romanian anti-communist partisans]] and for keeping a [[code]]d personal journal. In September–October of the same year he was barred from all the schools in Romania. After some unsuccessful attempts at re-admission he was finally allowed to attend Radu Negru  high school in [[Făgăraş]].

In 1954 he was admitted to the Faculty of Letters of the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Deletant236"&gt;Deletant, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1956, he was part of the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956]]: during a seminar, he read out to other students parts of a novel he had written about a student who establishes a movement that is similar to the ones in Hungary during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; Goma was arrested on the charge of attempting to organize a strike at University of Bucharest and he was sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; He served his sentence [[Jilava]] and [[Gherla]] prisons, and then put under house arrest in Lăteşti (a village in the [[Bărăgan Plain]]) until 1963.&lt;ref name="Goma_bio"/&gt;

As a former [[political prisoner]], he was not allowed to resume his studies and he had to work as a [[manual labour]]er until 1965, when a decree allowed former prisoners to study at the University.&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; In September 1965, he was re-admitted as a first-year student at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest. In the fall of 1967, under pressure from the Securitate, he was forced to give up his studies at the University.  On August 7, 1968, Paul Goma married Ana Maria Năvodaru. Their son Filip-Ieronim was born in 1975.

At the end of August 1968, Paul Goma became a member of the [[Romanian Communist Party]], in an act of solidarity with the Romanian position during the [[Warsaw Pact]] [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968)|Invasion of Czechoslovakia]] (Romania did not take part, indeed condemning the invasion).&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt;

Several months later, Goma attempted to publish a novel, ''Ostinato'' (based on his experiences with the secret police), but it was not allowed by the censors, after one of them claimed to recognize one character as [[Elena Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; Nevertheless, he published the novel in translation in [[West Germany]] in 1971, as a result of which, Paul Goma was excluded from the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; Paul Goma refused to give up his Party membership by his own will.

During the summer of 1972, he was allowed to visit France, where he wrote ''Gherla'', a novel based on his experiences in the Gherla Prison. This book was also denied publication in Romania and it was published in France in 1976.&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt;

===Goma's 1977 letters===

In 1977, Paul Goma wrote a public letter expressing solidarity with the [[Charter 77]],&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; but, finding few friends willing to sign it, wrote another letter, addressed directly to Ceaușescu, in which he asked him to sign it, as they two (Goma and Ceaușescu) are the only two Romanians not afraid of the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref name="Deletant236"/&gt; Following this, he wrote another letter (addressed to the 35 countries in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]]) in which he called for respect for [[human rights]] in Romania.&lt;ref name="Deletant239"&gt;Deletant, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 1977, Ceaușescu made a speech in which he attacked the "traitors of the country", referring to the two letters Goma wrote.&lt;ref name="Deletant239"/&gt; The following day, a police cordon was in front of his building, not allowing non-residents, to prevent people from signing Goma's letter. The authorities tried to convince Goma to emigrate, but he refused. As the police cordon got more relaxed, several more people signed the letter and they were arrested on exiting Goma's apartment.&lt;ref name="Deletant239"/&gt;

In March, he wrote an even tougher admonitory letter to Ceaușescu, urging him not to break the bond between the people and him, a bond that was created after Ceaușescu condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and attacked the Securitate whom Goma said were "traitors and enemies of Romania, who produce nothing and prevent those who produce from producing more".&lt;ref name="Deletant240"&gt;Deletant, p.240&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Goma gained the support of two intellectuals: psychiatrist [[Ion Vianu]] and literary critic [[Ion Negoiţescu]]; in all, he had 75 signatures.&lt;ref name="Deletant240"/&gt;

Called by [[Cornel Burtică]], the Secretary for Propaganda of the Central Committee, on March 12, Goma got the promise of being allowed to publish again, but he refused as he said that he wants not to be followed by the Securitate.&lt;ref name="Deletant241"&gt;Deletant, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, a former boxer, Horst Stumpf, broke into Goma's flat and attacked him; the attacks repeated the following days. As he was barricading himself with some friends in his apartment, he gave an interview to French TV station [[Antenne 2]].&lt;ref name="Deletant241"/&gt;

Goma was arrested and excluded from the [[Writers' Union of Romania]].&lt;ref name="Deletant241"/&gt; Following his arrest, he was attacked in the Romanian media: in a ''[[Săptămîna]]'' article, [[Eugen Barbu]] called him "a nullity", in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', [[Nicolae Dragoş]] said he was "rousing [[reactionary]] elements" and in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', [[Vasile Băran]], not mentioning Goma, claimed that "individuals calling themselves writers and journalists sully with the dirtiest of dirt our noble profession".&lt;ref name="Deletant241"/&gt;

An international appeal for his release was launched, among the signatories being [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Edward Albee]].&lt;ref name="Deletant241"/&gt; Goma was released on 6 May 1977, four days before the anniversary of 100 years of independence, celebrations which Ceaușescu didn't want overshadowed by Goma's arrest.&lt;ref name="Deletant241"/&gt;

On November 20, 1977, Paul Goma and his family left Romania and went into [[exile]] in France.&lt;ref name="Culoarea77"&gt;Paul Goma, in {{ro icon}} ''Culoarea curcubeului ’77. Cod „Bǎrbosul”'', Polirom, 2005. {{ISBN|973-681-833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goma, in {{fr icon}} ''Le Tremblement des Hommes: peut-on vivre en Roumanie aujourd'hui?'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], Paris, 1979. {{ISBN|2-02-005101-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile in France===
In 1979, Paul Goma was active in the creation of the [[SLOMR|Free Workers' Syndicate]].

On 3 February 1981, Paul Goma and Nicolae Penescu (former Interior Minister) received parcels in their post. Penescu opened his parcel to find a book and when he lifted its cover an explosion wounded him. Goma, who had received two death threats since his arrival in France, called the police. Both packages had been sent on instructions by [[Carlos the Jackal]].&lt;ref name="Follain98"&gt;John Follain, ''Jackal: The Complete Story of the Legendary Terrorist, Carlos the Jackal'', Arcade Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55970-466-7}}. {{ISBN|978-1-55970-466-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Securitate planned to assassinate Goma. [[Matei Pavel Haiducu|Matei Haiducu]], the [[espionage|secret agent]] sent by the Securitate to carry out the plan, turned to [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire|French counter-intelligence]] (DST). With the help of the DST, Haiducu simulated an attempt on Goma's life, by poisoning his drink at a restaurant; the drink was then spilled by a French agent, pretending to be a "clumsy guest".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951810,00.html "Rumanian Sting"], in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', September 13, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Goma's numerous works (both fiction and non-fiction) were translated worldwide, his books, except the first one, were published in Romania only after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]. He now lives in Paris as a stateless political refugee, his Romanian citizenship having been revoked after&lt;!--in or after?--&gt; 1978 by the communist government. He turned down an offer of citizenship from the [[France|French Republic]], extended simultaneously to him and to the [[Czech people|Czech]] writer [[Milan Kundera]]. In September 2006, a petition in favor of restoring his Romanian citizenship did not result in any progress on the issue.

=== Controversies ===
Some of Goma's post-2005 articles and essays have been criticized for their strong [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] nature.&lt;ref name="Andreescu"&gt;Gabriel Andreescu, in {{ro icon}} [http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=169748&amp;data=2005-02-17&amp;ziua=2bd5b7026bde1020c81c2fd5eb84e9c0 "Goma şi tema antisemitismului"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140044/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=169748&amp;data=2005-02-17&amp;ziua=2bd5b7026bde1020c81c2fd5eb84e9c0 |date=2007-10-12 }}, ''[[Ziua]]'', February 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanianjewish.org/en/antisemitism_in_romania_02.html#i13

In February 2007, the [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] and the Israeli Embassy protested against the distinction, arguing that Paul Goma is the author of multiple antisemitic articles.&lt;ref name="Goma_Timisoara"&gt;Paul Goma, in {{ro icon}}, [http://paulgoma.com/dl_links/publicistica/scrisoare_catre_timisoreni.php "Scrisoare către prietenii din Timişoara — şi din toată ţara"], February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2006 he was invited to become a member of the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania|Tismăneanu Commission]],&lt;ref name="Goma 3"&gt;Paul Goma, in {{ro icon}}, [http://paulgoma.com/includes/Despre_Tismaneanu_11_puncte_HTML.php "Despre Vladimir Tismăneanu - şi nu numai - în 11 puncte"], June 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; a body charged with researching the crimes of the communist dictatorship in Romania. Nine days later he was dismissed by the Commission's president, [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], who explained the exclusion based on Goma's  questioning the moral and scientific credibility of the president of the Commission, and disclosing of their private correspondence.&lt;ref name="Goma 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu22"&gt;Tismăneanu, in {{ro icon}} [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2802&amp;nr=2006-06-16 Armand Gosu, "N-am avut de-a face cu Securitatea", in ''22'', nr.849, June 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065724/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2802&amp;nr=2006-06-16 |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary contributions==
Goma's literary debut came in 1966 with a short story published in the review ''Luceafǎrul'' with which he collaborated as well as with ''Gazeta literarǎ'', ''Viaţa românească'' and ''Ateneu''. In 1968 he published his first volume of stories, ''Camera de alături'' ("The Room Next Door"). After ''Ostinato'' and its West German publication in 1971 came ''Uşa'' ("Die Tür" or "The Door") in 1972, also in Germany. After his forced emigration in 1977 and until his books could again be published in Romania after the 1989 revolution, all his books appeared in France and in French. (His novel ''Gherla'' had in fact been published in 1976 first in French by Gallimard of Paris before he left Romania.) There followed such novels as ''Dans le cercle'' ("Within the Circle", 1977); ''Garde inverse'' ("Reverse Guard", 1979); ''Le Tremblement des Hommes'' ("The Trembling of People", 1979); ''Chassée-croisé'' ("Intersection", 1983); ''Les Chiens de la mort'' ("The Dogs of Death", 1981), which details his prison experiences in Piteşti in the 1950s; and ''Bonifacia'' (1986). The autobiographical ''Le Calidor'' appeared in French in 1987 and was subsequently published in Romanian as ''Din Calidor: O copilărie basarabeană'' ("In Calidor: A Bessarabian Childhood", 1989, 1990; translated as ''My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest'') in the Romanian émigré journal ''Dialog'', edited by Ion Solacolu.&lt;ref&gt;Segel, Harold B. ''The Columbia Guide to the Literatures of Eastern Europe Since 1945'', p. 189-90. Columbia University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-231-11404-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its totality, Goma's literary work comprises a "persuasive and grimly fascinating exposure of totalitarian inhumanity"&lt;ref name="Segel190"&gt;Segel, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; from which, in his own case, even foreign exile was no guarantee of safe haven. In such later novels as ''Bonifacia'' and ''My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest'', the biographical element dominates as he focuses on his childhood and adolescence in Bessarabia. Several sets of diaries, all published in Romania in 1997 and 1998, shed light on Goma's later life and career: ''Alte Jurnale'' ("Other Journals"), which covers his stay in the United States in autumn 1978 but concentrates primarily on 1994-96; ''Jurnal I: Jurnal pe sărite'' ("Journal I: By Leaps and Bounds", 1997); ''Jurnal II: Jurnal de căldură mare'' ("Journal II: Journal of Great Heat", 1997), covering June and July 1989; ''Jurnal III: Jurnal de noapte lungă'' ("Journal of the Long Night", 1997), covering September to December 1993; and ''Jurnalul unui jurnal 1997'' ("The Journal of a Journal, 1997"), focusing just on that year.&lt;ref name="Segel190"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1053">The '''Police Act 1919''' (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c.46) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]] which set up an alternative dispute resolution system within [[UK labour law]] for collective disputes involving members of staff in the police force. The current rules are now found under the [[Police Act 1996]]. Following the [[British police strikes in 1918 and 1919]], the government decided that it was a threat to the public to allow strikes among the police force to take place. The Police Act 1919 prohibited police from joining a trade union that could take strike action protected by the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], and provided an alternative in the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]]. A substitute for strikes was binding [[arbitration]] to resolve collective disputes.

The '''power of arrest''' is a mandate given by a central authority that allows an individual to remove a criminal's (or suspected criminal's) liberty. The power of arrest can also be used to protect a person, or persons from harm or to protect damage to property.

However, in many countries, a person also has powers of arrest under [[citizen's arrest]] or [[any person arrest]] powers.

==Individuals with powers of arrest==
Originally, powers of arrest were confined to sheriffs in England for a local area. Over the past few hundred years, the legal power of arrest has gradually expanded to include a large number of people/officials, the majority of which have come to the fore more recently. These various individuals all may utilise similar or different powers of arrest, but generally adhere to one particular field.

The individuals below have been listed in order of when the power of arrest became available to the individual, starting from the earliest.

===United States===
{{Main|Law enforcement in the United States#Types of police}}

In the United States, various [[law enforcement officer]]s are able to legally arrest people. Due to the complexity of the American civil legal system, including the interactions between federal, state, county, and local [[jurisdiction]]s, there are numerous special cases that apply, depending on the reason for the arrest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25754">'''Public Service Motivation''' ('''PSM''') is an attribute of government and non-governmental organization ([[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.

== Common Models  ==
=== How Public Service Motivation (PSM) is Used  ===
PSM helps employees get the most out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and company needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team’s success and productivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GOTTFREDSON|first1=R. K |title=How to get YOUR TEAMS to work |journal=Industrial Management|date=2015 |volume=57 |issue=4 |page=28 in pages 25–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.

=== Perry’s Public Service Motivation Scale ===
Public Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private. Previous research emphasized that PSM was influenced by various social and political factors that ultimately drive employees to take an interest in the public sector. The history and concept of public service motivation has been studied by authors who contributed to the understanding of the practice itself such as Perry and Wise who coined the term PSM in 1990, and other political figures such as Woodrow Wilson who founded the field of Public Administration. Perry and Wise stated that PSM is often influenced by various social, political, and institutional factors and failure on the organization's part to recognize the motivation of its employees could lead to the discouragement of such individuals from the public sector.

=== Mission Valence ===
Mission Valence can be viewed as an employee’s perception of the attractiveness or salience of an organization’s purpose or social contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=dd80fc18-7fce-4698-aeb3-a60b2afd4d8b%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Pulling the Levers: Transformational Leadership, Public Service Motivation, and Mission Valence|last = Wright, Bradley E., Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = March–April 2012|journal = Public Administration Review. Vol. 72 Issue 2, P206-215. 10p. 1 Diagram, 1 Chart.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 206–215|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02496.x|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Valence is a concept formulated by Rainey and Steinbauer in 1999 that serves to provide a better understanding of what compels an employee to uphold and achieve goals within their organization. Mission Valence enhances the satisfaction that an individual experiences or anticipates to receive from advancing the organizational mission, and in turn, it has the "potential to influence the ability of the organization to recruit, retain, and motivate its employees."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, linking the organization’s mission to the values and characteristics of the employee can increase the potential effects of PSM as members of the organization become committed to its success. Rainey and Steinbauer attribute mission valence to enhancing the satisfaction of an employee when the organization’s mission or goal is achieved thus giving the employer the ability to motivate his or her employees and seek their retention. With the desire to help others, public employees are more likely to seek employment within a public organization because the particular mission of that organization often aligns with their own personal values. Previous studies enhance the notion that leadership along with effective management can increase employee mission valence through its ability to promote public service motivation.

=== Transformational Leadership ===
{{Main|Transformational leadership}}
Transformational leadership moves away from a traditional management perspective that is based on self-interest and the exchanging of rewards for positive performance, and instead proposes the ideology of value based leadership to inspire and thus motivate employees. Although value based leadership is not new to the scope of public management, it is important to understand the evolution of how employers communicate the vision of the organization’s purpose to their employees. Transformational leadership can motivate employees by appealing to their ideals and moral values, which in turn leads to a more effective and meaningful work environment. Transformational leaders create shared organizational value through "inspirational communication, ongoing practices, setting meaningful goals and designating significant work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=97a0cead-a156-46fe-91ed-29d496d045a5%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Transformational Leadership and Public Service Motivation: Driving Individual and Organizational Performance |last = Paarlberg Laurie E, Lavigna, Bob |date = September–October 2010|journal = Public Administration Review. Vol. 70 Issue 5, P710-718. 9p. 1 Chart|volume = 70 |issue = 5 |pages = 710–718 |doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02199.x|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paarlberg and Lavigna exclaim that linking transformational leadership and public service motivation to human resource management strategies will not radically improve the outcome of the workplace, but rather steadily transform management practices to garner the best organizational outcome to better motivate public sector employees.

=== The Role of Organizations in Promoting PSM ===
The impact of organizational institutions can either have a positive or negative ramifications on the motivational attitude of employees. According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed to the understanding of the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual’s "predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ddcb9dec-7de2-4c7e-81a6-b93e2e097e66%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title = The Role of Organizations in Fostering Public Service Motivation|last = Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = January–February 2007|journal = Public Administration Review, 1/1/2007, Vol. 67, Issue 1, P. 40-53|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize rule-based control of employees and bureaucratic personality,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.

=== Fields ===
Early authors in the field of public administration described differences between public and private employees and concerns over motivating public sector employees.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perry|first=James L. |author2=Hondeghem, Annie |year=2008 |chapter=Editors' Introduction |editor=Perry, James L. |editor2=Hondeghem, Annie |title=Motivation in public management: The call of public service |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=2 |isbn=978-0-19-923403-5 }} citing de Tocqueville, Alexis (1856) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t3kw6j47x;view=1up;seq=7 ''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution''] and Weber, Max (1922) [https://archive.org/details/wirtschaftundges00webeuoft/ ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft''].&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Van Riper described the issue in his 1952 history of the U.S. [[civil service]] system.&lt;ref name="Riper1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul P.

=== Formulation ===
The concept of Public Service Motivation was formalized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by authors like Buchanan, Mosher, Perry, Porter, and Rainey;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce|title=Red-Tape and the Service Ethic Some Unexpected Differences Between Public and Private Managers|journal=Administration &amp; Society|year=1975|volume=6|issue=4|pages=423–444|doi=10.1177/009539977500600403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mosher1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosher|first=Frederick C.|title=Democracy and the Public Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psT07f8bcxUC|accessdate=14 December 2012|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-503018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=James L.|author2=Porter, Lyman W.  |title=Factors Affecting the Context for Motivation in Public Organizations|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=January 1982|volume=7|issue=1 |pages=89–98|jstor=257252 |doi=10.5465/AMR.1982.4285475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rainey|first=H.G.|title=Reward Preferences among Public and Private Managers: In Search of the Service Ethic|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|year=1982|volume=16|issue=4|pages=288–302|doi=10.1177/027507408201600402}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term was officially coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Perry, James L.  |author2=Wise, Lois Recascino |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=The motivational bases of public service |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=50|issue=3|pages=367–373 |jstor=976618|url=http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/mark.wattier/Perry1990.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304181115/http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/mark.wattier/Perry1990.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |doi=10.2307/976618}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Perry and Wise in 1990.&lt;ref name="Kelman"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kelman, Steve|date=April 2015|title=The Lectern: How do we get public servants who want to serve the public?|work=FCW: The Business of Federal Technology |publisher=1105 Public Sector Media Group|url=http://fcw.com/Blogs/Lectern/2015/04/Kelman-PSM.aspx |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Xys37BEw |archivedate=21 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vandenabeele, Wouter |year=2007 |title=Toward a public administration theory of public service motivation: An institutional approach |journal=Public Management Review |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=545–556 |doi=10.1080/14719030701726697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Perry, James L. |author2=Hondeghem, Anne |author3=Wise, Lois Recascino  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Revisiting the Motivational Bases of Public Service: Twenty Years of Research and an Agenda for the Future |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02196.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, PSM has gained international prominence from various scholars and  researchers.&lt;ref name="Kettl2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald F.

Studies by Homberg, McCarthy, and Tabvuma attribute PSM to the positive impact on job satisfaction in the public sector because public employment helps satisfy individuals’ pro-social needs.&lt;ref&gt;Homberg, F., McCarthy, D. and Tabvuma, V. (2015), A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between Public Service Motivation and Job Satisfaction. Public Administration Review, 75: 711–722 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12423/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Previous authors that are familiar with motivational factors associated with the public sector suggests that many employees tend to characterize themselves with pro-social identities such as caring and compassionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An integrative analytical framework for understanding the effects of autonomous and controlled motivation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915001579|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–15|volume = 84|series = Theory and Measurement in Personality and Individual Differences|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2015.02.034|first = Jennifer|last = Brunet|first2 = Katie E.|last2 = Gunnell|first3 = Patrick|last3 = Gaudreau|first4 = Catherine M.|last4 = Sabiston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of motivational theory and management emphasize that individuals will go above and beyond to be viewed as "moral" or good by their peers and fellow employees, so finding pro-social ways to motivate individuals can be beneficial.

Crewson argued that a responsive and cost-effective government should acknowledge that a failure to properly understand the motivations of public employees may have undesirable short term effects such as low job performance which may lead to long term effects such as the permanent displacement of the public service ethic.&lt;ref name="Crewson1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Philip E. Crewson |year=1997|title=Public Service Motivation: Building Empirical Evidence of Incidence and Effect |journal= Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=499–518, page 500 |url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/499.short |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenblatt noted that there is a surprising link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments because they want to be innovative or because they want to receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The use of innovation awards in the public sector: individual and organizational perspectives|last = Rosenblatt|first = Michael|date = 2011|journal = Innovation : Management, Policy, &amp; Practice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Matei and Cornea considered that although intrinsic, PSM is influenced by a variety of external factors such as social, political, institutional etc. and, in time, those factors can have an effect and lead to a change in the initial PSM of the individual that was present at the beginning of the position. Such factors demonstrate that if the external factors that act on the public servant are negative, PSM will influence the behavior of the individual for a period of time that is smaller than the professional career of that individual. If the extrinsic factors are positive, PSM can influence the behavior of the public servant throughout their entire career. Matei and Cornea concluded that during this period of time, when PSM influences the activity of the individual, the public servant is led by a certain “lyricism of public service", and connected to their job by “administrative romanticism" with the ultimate desire to serve their community, state, nation etc.&lt;ref name="Matei"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Matei, L.  |author2=Cornea, I. Catalin  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013 |title=Organizational context and factors affecting public service motivation |journal=International Journal of Academic Research (IJAR) |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=44–48, page 47 |doi=10.7813/2075-4124.2013/5-2/B.6  |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/92948957/organizational-context-factors-affecting-public-service-motivation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann also conducted a study among non profit employees and came to the conclusion that although there is a dichotomy within the public and private sectors, if an employee is working for a non profit organization he or she would be satisfied regardless of PSM or not. The reason behind this behavior is because employees who work for non profits already have a passion for the work that they do. According to Mann's study, even if these individuals didn't receive compensation, they would return to work the next day and work just as hard because they have intrinsic motivation that doesn't need to be externalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A motive to serve: Public service motivation in human resource management and the role of PSM in the nonprofit sector|last = Mann|first = Gregory|date = Oct 9, 2015|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and Alternatives ==
=== Leadership Practices ===
The agency's mission, goals, and objectives can help improve employee performance and motivation. Many employees who hold jobs within the public sector and non-profit organizations do not receive large salaries. It is important for an organization to motivate its employees and align their values and characteristics with the mission and values of the agency rather than subject employees to a stressful and hostile work environment motivated by financial gain. Leadership practices should emphasize to employees the importance of motivation and involvement which can ultimately help the agency or organization in the hiring and retention process if they are aware of the motives of their employees.

=== Surface Acting ===
Studies performed by various researchers attribute an individual's motivation with the individual level of stress and job dissatisfaction. These factors can lead to surface acting which is characterized by adjusting observable emotional expressions to mask true feelings, pretending to feel a desired emotion, and faking emotional displays. It is hard to evaluate the motivation of each individual working in the public sector when they exhibit a false persona. Representing an agency or organization in the public sector often requires one to display and act in a certain behavior and attitude. This behavior often leads to surface acting.

=== Emotional Labor ===
Situational factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the duration of such interactions, career fields, customer hostility, and organizational expectations can all contribute to one's [[emotional labor]]. Emotional labor is the act of behaving or displaying specific emotions and behaviors within one's job profession. Employees are constantly under the influence of interactions between other employees and customers. Many citizens expect a certain level of satisfaction from each level of government which often burdens the employee with an immense amount of pressure to fulfill those expectations and who in turn will often face backlash and harsh criticism when citizens feel they are not satisfied.

=== Employment Relationship ===
If an employee finds themselves in a hostile, stressful work environment this can deter motivation and counteract productivity which can ultimately effect the individuals  goals, expectations, and disrupt the balance of the workplace. Motivation stems from an individuals desire to satisfy the needs for automaton, direct communication between employees, and asocial inclusions. Having an open approach in the workplace can help new less experienced employees feel a sense of involvement and value which an ultimately increase their motivation to succeed and continue with the organization and vie for its success. As generational changes continue to occur and public sector employees rotate between positions, it is vital to understand how employment relationships can be improved in order to increase public service motivation. Nonprofit employees are becoming more similar to public employees based on motivational aspects such as intrinsic rewards.

The '''Seattle Liberation Front''', or '''SLF''', was a radical anti-[[Vietnam War]] movement, based in [[Seattle, Washington]], in the [[United States]]. The group, founded by then-[[University of Washington]] visiting philosophy professor and political activist [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], carried out its protest activities from 1970 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Stern 216&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous members of the SLF were the "'''Seattle Seven'''" &amp;mdash; seven SLF members charged with "conspiracy to incite a riot" in the wake of a violent protest at a courthouse.  The members of the Seattle Seven were Lerner himself, as well as [[Jeff Dowd]], [[Joe Kelly (protestor)|Joe Kelly]], [[Susan Stern]], Michael Abeles, [[Roger Lippman]] and [[Chip Marshall|Charles Marshall III]].&lt;ref&gt;FBI Surveillance Files 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
After the nationwide organization [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) disintegrated in 1969, [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], an instructor newly arrived in Seattle from [[Berkeley, California]], felt compelled to start up his own local group.  He kick-started his efforts by inviting [[Jerry Rubin]], a notable counterculture figure, to speak on the University of Washington campus on January 17, 1970 &amp;ndash; two days later, the SLF was formed, largely composed of students and radicals coming out of organizations (like the SDS) that had recently disbanded.&lt;ref name="Walt Crowley 1995"&gt;Walt Crowley, Rites of Passage, A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The exact impetus for Lerner seeking a new organization is somewhat vague.  The founding of SLF came less than a month after SDS [[Weather Underground|Weatherman]], which had staged violent street demonstrations during the latter half of 1969, announced that it was going underground to adopt a strategy of random acts of bombing, arson, and other sabotage.  It has not been explained whether or not Lerner was seeking a new organization prior to Weatherman's underground turn.  One of the SLF's first actions was to hold a demonstration in support of the [[Chicago Seven]], a group of radicals charged with inciting riots at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]].

==Affiliation with Weather Underground==
The relationship between the [[Weather Underground]] and the Seattle Liberation Front remains somewhat ambiguous. Both groups shared many of the same political viewpoints, where they participated in protests and demonstrations, and there was overlap in membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.lib.washington.edu/protestsweb/index.html University of Washington Libraries Digital Collections- Vietnam War Era Ephemera] "Protest UW affiliation with BYU" and "Off BYU"&lt;/ref&gt;  The violent, confrontational style of protest at events sponsored by SLF was identical with that of the SDS Weatherman faction before the latter went underground at the end of 1969.  There were no official ties between the Seattle Liberation Front and the [[Weather Underground]], however, two of the Seattle Seven, [[Roger Lippman]] and [[Susan Stern]], were also members of the Weather Underground along with fugitive SLF member [[Michael Justesen]]. [[Chip Marshall]] was one of the leading members of the Seattle Liberation Front. In an interview with Time magazine in 1980, Marshall commented on the takeover of the SDS by [[Weather Underground|Weatherman]], a violent radical left faction. He said Weatherman had established cultural standards to which members were to adhere. Marshall did not agree with destroying monogamy, cutting family ties, and devaluing personal relationships.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923945,00.html David Aikman, In Seattle: Up from Revolution ''Time''] magazine, April 14, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  SLF founder [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] was never known to be affiliated with the Weather Underground or to endorse its strategy of bombing and arson.

==Demonstrations==
SLF planned a demonstration to be held at the Federal Courthouse in downtown Seattle on February 17, 1970.  It is commonly referred to by former SLF members as "The Day After" or "TDA."  The roughly 2,000 protesters in attendance escalated their protests into violence, throwing rocks and paint bombs at both the courthouse and at police responding to the scene. Twenty were injured in the riot, and 76 were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] stated that it was a different sequence of events: "when it [the demonstration] was attacked by police, it turned into a riot." In March 1970, the Seattle Liberation Front, UW Black Student Union, and the Weathermen organized hundreds of protesters at the University of Washington’s campus.&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/special/centennial/october/outrage.html Sharon Boswell and Lorraine McConaghy, "Outrage and rebellion 'Boomers' bring battle of Vietnam to American Soil-and a counterculture is born." ''Seattle Times''] October 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The groups wanted the university to sever its athletic links with Brigham Young University, a Mormon school that was accused of racism.  Seattle Liberation Front and Black Student Union supporters initiated a riot that moved through eleven buildings at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; Around 200 chanting demonstrators left a trail of damage throughout the campus.&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"/&gt;  Members of the SLF collective based at 814 South Weller Street spoke at a design hearing for the then-proposed I-90 freeway in June 1970, denouncing the project as "racist" and advocating revolution.

==Charges and trial==
Two months later, on April 16, a federal [[grand jury]] indicted members of the SLF on charges of inciting the February 17 riot - Lerner was charged with "using the facilities of interstate commerce [a telephone] with the intent of inciting to riot," but he was not charged with "inciting to riot." (One of the eight, [[Michael Justesen]], disappeared but was later arrested in California by the FBI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912056-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Nation: Infiltrating the Underground | date=January 9, 1978 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an infiltration of the [[Weather Underground|Weathermen]]).  Federal District Judge [[George Hugo Boldt|George Boldt]] was assigned the case, which began in his [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] courtroom on November 6, 1970.  The trial was quickly derailed by the defendants' vocal disruptions, a protest walkout, and their eventual refusal to enter the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944273,00.html Anarchy in Tacoma] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, December 28, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  Boldt declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] on December 10, citing all defendants for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; He summarily found them guilty of contempt, sentenced them to six months in prison, and refused to grant [[bail]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/05/archives/denial-of-bail-to-seattle-7-assailed-here-by-attorneys.html Denial of Bail to Seattle 7 Assailed Here by Attorneys] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 5, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants eventually served three months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/02/archives/susan-stern-a-radical-activist-and-writer-dies-at-33-on-coast.html Susan Stern, a Radical Activist And Writer, Dies at 33 on Coast] ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 2, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The original charges of inciting a riot, or of intent to incite to riot, and conspiracy to damage the Seattle Federal Building, were unsuccessfully prosecuted. Lerner stated the reason for the failure to win a conviction was "because it was revealed that the FBI agents who were infiltrating the anti-war organization were themselves the people who had precipitated the violence." Most observers agreed that the prosecution's case was floundering (aided by the admission of government witnesses on the stand that they would "go to any length" to combat the radicals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is believed by some that the Seattle Seven would have been freed if some of them had not provoked the elderly judge with catcalls during the proceedings.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

==Aftermath/ Recent Activities==
Due to the publicity of the trial, the Seattle Liberation Front faced ideological dissension, personality conflicts, and charges of "male chauvinism." In the fall of 1970 SLF sponsored a short-lived weekly underground newspaper, ''[[Sabot (newspaper)|Sabot]]'', which folded in December after a three-month run amid political infighting among the staff.&lt;ref name="Walt Crowley 1995"/&gt; In late 1971, the SLF was disbanded.  Many of the individual SLF members continued to promote diverse social movements, such as Capitol Hill's Country Doctor Clinic.&lt;ref name="Walt Crowley 1995"/&gt;  Lerner, the founder of SLF, eventually became the editor of ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' and an advisor to President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].  [[Jeff Dowd]] went to [[Hollywood]] to become a [[screenwriter]] and [[Film producer|producer]]. [[Chip Marshall]] remained active in Washington politics, running for [[Seattle City Council]] in 1975 and working as a neighborhood activist in [[Issaquah]].

==Cultural References==
In the movie ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', the main character Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski says, "Did you ever hear of the Seattle Seven? That was me ... and six other guys." This refers to Jeff Dowd's involvement in the Seattle Seven, who was a friend of the Coen brothers and the inspiration for the character "The Dude".&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/26831/dude-port-huron-statement-and-seattle-seven&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">'''Shannon's law''' refers to specific changes in [[Arizona]] [[statutes]], enacted in 2000, making it a [[felony]] offense to discharge [[firearms]] randomly into the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/03107.htm 13-3107 - Unlawful discharge of firearms; exceptions; classification; definitions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Shannon's law'' is named after Shannon Smith, a fourteen-year-old [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] girl killed by a stray bullet in June 1999.  Smith's parents, after being informed that the assailant's activity constituted, at most, a [[misdemeanor]] offense, advocated stronger penalties, to prevent future incidents of this kind.

Their campaign took them all over Arizona, and their efforts were supported by [[city council]]s of medium-sized Arizona cities such as [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. Then-Governor [[Jane Dee Hull|Jane Hull]] also joined them in their cause. After the [[Arizona legislature]] failed to pass the law twice in 1999, it finally received both [[Arizona Senate|state senate]] and [[Arizona House of Representatives|state house]] approval in April 2000, and was enacted in that July. The [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] supported the law and worked in cooperation to form the 'Shannon's Law'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0116phx-shannon0118.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2009/12/31/20091231shannon1231.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
Violation of ''Shannon's law'' is defined as a felony offense in Arizona. However, as with most felony offenses in United States [[jurisdiction]]s, a person charged with this offense can strike a [[plea bargain]] with [[prosecutor]]s, and may be eligible for only a misdemeanor [[conviction]]. The decision of whether such an offer is available lies solely in the hands of the prosecutor, and presently these offenses are being charged as "dangerous" offenses, thereby making the accused ineligible for probation under state law, requiring a prison sentence even for a first offense.

On December 31, 2003, police in the city of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] began using equipment which alerted them to the location from which a shot was fired. As random discharge of firearms are common in some areas of the United States on [[New Year's Eve]], [[Fourth of July]], and other [[holiday]]s, four arrests of ''Shannon's law'' violators were made that night, and it is expected that more Arizona [[police]] departments will receive similar equipment.

==Shannon Smith==
Shannon Smith had been an award-winning athlete and honor student, and had graduated from the eighth grade a few weeks prior to her death. While she stood in her backyard talking on the telephone with a friend, a stray bullet hit her in her head, causing instant death.  Smith's death sparked a furor among [[Arizona]] residents. Her funeral was attended by approximately 1,300 people. A monument, made with melted metal from confiscated firearms, was raised in her honor at her middle school by her classmates and friends.  Tens of thousands of dollars in donations for the monument were primarily raised by Shannon's friends and classmates holding car washes.

After being informed by the [[police]] that random discharge of firearms was a simple [[misdemeanor]], Smith's parents resolved to change the laws and ran a statewide campaign advocating harsher punishment for random shooters. Their campaign gained support from such people as then-[[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Jane Dee Hull]]. In April 2000, "Shannon's law" was passed.

'''Sororicide''' (from [[Latin]] ''soror'' "sister" + ''-cide'', from ''caedere'' "to cut, to kill") is the act of killing one's own [[sister]].

There are a number of examples of sororicide and [[fratricide]] in [[adolescent]]s, even pre-adolescents, where [[sibling rivalry]] and resulting physical aggression can get out of hand and lead to the death of one of them, particularly when a potent weapon is available or one is significantly older than the other and misjudges his/her own strength.

==Known or suspected examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31376">'''Statutes of limitations''' are laws passed by legislative bodies in [[common law]] systems to set the maximum time after an event within which [[legal proceeding]]s may be initiated.&lt;ref name=cal&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of Limitations|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/9618.htm|website=California Court Judicial Branch|publisher=Public Access Records|accessdate=6 June 2014|ref=California Code of Civil Procedure sections 312–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, a claim might no longer be filed, or, if filed, may be liable to be struck out if the defense against that claim is, or includes, that the claim is time-barred as having been filed after the statutory limitations period. When a statute of limitations expires in a criminal case, the courts no longer have jurisdiction. Most crimes that have statutes of limitations are distinguished from serious crimes as these may be brought at any time.

In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, similar provisions are typically part of their [[civil code|civil]] or [[criminal code]]s and known collectively as ''periods of prescription''. The [[cause of action]] dictates the statute of limitations, which can be reduced (or extended) to ensure a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Special Historic Session|title=Opening Remarks:HistoricSpecial section|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/compsum2.pdf|website=www.courts.ca.gov|publisher=Supreme Court Of California|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of these laws is to facilitate resolution within a "reasonable" length of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Courts|first1=Judicial Council|title=Public Access Records|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-start.htm|website=California Courts|publisher=Rewriting Amendments|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; What period of time is considered "reasonable" varies from country to country, and within countries such as the United States from state to state.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of Limitations by State for Civil Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/limitations_by_state/index.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Statutes of Limitations|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/statutes-of-limitations.html|website=FindLaw|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within countries and states, the statute of limitations may vary from one civil or criminal action to another. Some nations have no statute of limitations whatsoever.

Analysis of a statute of limitations also requires the examination of any associated [[statute of repose]], tolling provisions, and exclusions.

==Applications==
Common law legal systems can include a statute specifying the length of time within which a claimant or prosecutor must file a case. In some civil jurisdictions (e.g., [[California]]),&lt;ref name=cal/&gt; a case cannot begin after the period specified, and courts have no jurisdiction over cases filed after the statute of limitations has expired. In some other jurisdictions (e.g., [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]), a claim can be filed which may prove to have been brought outside the limitations period, but the court will retain jurisdiction in order to determine that issue, and the onus is on the defendant to plead it as part of their defence, or else the claim will not be statute barred.

Once filed, cases do not need to be resolved within the period specified in the statute of limitations.

==Purpose==
The purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants. There are three reasons for their enactment:&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th edition&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A plaintiff with a valid cause of action should pursue it with reasonable diligence.
* By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to disprove the claim.
* Litigation of a long-dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice.

In [[Classical Athens]], a five-year statute of limitations was established for all cases except [[homicide]] and the prosecution of non-constitutional laws (which had no limitation). [[Demosthenes]] wrote that these statutes of limitations were adopted to control "[[sycophant]]s" (professional accusers).&lt;ref name="Allen2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen |first=Danielle S. |title=The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKW3yiINadEC&amp;pg=PA154 |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-09489-2 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitation period generally begins when the plaintiff's cause of action accrues, meaning the date upon which the plaintiff is first able to maintain the cause of action in court, or when the plaintiff first becomes aware of a previous injury (for example, [[occupational lung disease]]s such as [[asbestosis]]).

==Statute of repose==
A [[statute of repose]] limits the time within which an action may be brought based upon when a particular event occurred (such as the completion of construction of a building or the date of purchase of manufactured goods), and does not permit extensions. A statute of limitations is similar to a statute of repose, but may be extended for a variety of reasons (such as the [[age of majority|minority]] of the victim).

For example, most U.S. jurisdictions have passed statutes of repose for construction defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutes of Repose for Construction|url=http://www.sdvlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Statutes-of-Repose.pdf|website=SDVLaw.com|publisher=Saxe Doernberger &amp; Vita, P.C.|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCL 600.5839|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-600-5839|website=Michigan Legislature|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 337.15|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&amp;sectionNum=337.15|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=State of California|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fla. Stat. § 95.11(3)(c)|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0000-0099/0095/Sections/0095.11.html|website=Online Sunshine|publisher=State of Florida|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person receives an [[electric shock]] due to a wiring defect that resulted from the builder's negligence during construction of a building, the builder is potentially liable for damages if the suit is brought within the time period defined by the statute, normally starting with the date that construction is substantially completed. After the statutory time period has passed, without regard to the nature or degree of the builder's negligence or misconduct, the statute of repose presents an absolute defense to the claim.

Statutes of repose are sometimes controversial; manufacturers contend that they are necessary to avoid unfair litigation and encourage consumers to maintain their property. Alternatively, consumer advocates argue that they reduce incentives to manufacture durable products and disproportionately affect [[poverty|the poor]], because manufacturers will have less incentive to ensure low-cost or "bargain" products are manufactured to exacting safety standards.

==Tolling and the discovery rule==
{{Globalize/US|date=August 2015}}
Many jurisdictions suspend, or [[tolling (law)|toll]], the limitation period under certain circumstances such as if the aggrieved party (plaintiff) was a minor or filed a [[bankruptcy]] proceeding. In those instances, the running of limitations is tolled, or paused, until the condition ends. Equitable tolling may also be applied if an individual may intimidate a plaintiff into not reporting or has been promised a suspended period.

The statute of limitations may begin when the harmful event, such as fraud or injury, occurs or when it is discovered. The US Supreme Court has described the "standard rule" of when the time begins as "when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action." The rule has existed since the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17933875001306187435&amp;scilh=0 Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission].&lt;/ref&gt; A "discovery rule" applies in other cases (including [[medical malpractice]]), or a similar effect may be applied by tolling.

As discussed in ''Wolk v. Olson'', the discovery rule does not apply to mass media such as newspapers and the Internet; the statute of limitations begins to run at the date of publication. In 2013, the US Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled in ''[[Gabelli v. SEC]]'' that the discovery rule does not apply to [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s investment-advisor-fraud lawsuits since one of the purposes of the agency is to root out fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Macy J. (2013). [http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=160227 Opinion analysis: That which does not kill the SEC may make the agency stronger]. [[SCOTUSblog]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In private civil matters, the limitations period may generally be shortened or lengthened by agreement of the parties. Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], the parties to a contract for sale of goods may reduce the limitations period to one year but not extend it.

Limitation periods that are known as [[laches (equity)|laches]] may apply in situations of [[equity (law)|equity]]; a judge will not issue an [[injunction]] if the requesting party waited too long to ask for it. Such periods are subject to broad [[judicial discretion]].

For [[US military]] cases, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) states that all charges except those facing [[court-martial]] on a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] have a five-year statute of limitations. If the charges are dropped in all UCMJ proceedings except those headed for general court-martial, they may be reinstated for six months after which the statute of limitations has run out.

==Prescription==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, almost all lawsuits must be brought within a legally-determined period known as ''prescription''. Under Italian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La prescrizione del reato dopo la ex-Cirielli|url=http://www.diritto-penale.it/la-prescrizione-del-reato.htm|work=Diritto Penale|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Romanian law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codul Penal, Articolul 180 – Prescripția|url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-122-cpen|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; criminal trials must be ended within a time limit.

In criminal cases, the public prosecutor must lay charges within a time limit which varies by jurisdiction and varies based on the nature of the charge; in many jurisdictions, there is no statute of limitations for [[murder]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Over the last decade of the 20th century, many United States jurisdictions significantly lengthened the statute of limitations for sex offenses, particularly against children, as a response to research and popular belief that a variety of causes can delay the recognition and reporting of crimes of this nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Common triggers for suspending the prescription include a defendant's fugitive status or the commission of a new crime. A criminal may be convicted [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ridley|first1=Yvonne|title=Bush Convicted of War Crimes in Absentia|url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/05/12/bush-convicted-of-war-crimes-in-absentia/|website=www.foreignpolicyjournal.com|publisher=Foreign Policy Journal|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription should not be confused with the need to prosecute within "[[Laches (equity)|a reasonable delay]]" as obligated by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

==Laws by region==

===International crimes===
Under [[international law]], [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]] are usually not subject to the statute of limitations as codified in a number of multilateral [[Treaty|treaties]]. States [[Ratification|ratifying]] the [[Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity]] agree to disallow limitations claims for these crimes. In Article 29 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes "shall not be subject to any statute of limitations".

==={{anchor|Crimes against children and people under guardianship in Victoria, Australia}}Australia===

An argument for abolishing statutes of limitations for civil claims by minors and people under guardianship is ensuring that abuse of vulnerable people would be acknowledged by lawyers, police, organisations and governments, with enforceable penalties for organisations which have turned a blind eye in the past.

===Canada===
For crimes other than [[summary offence|summary conviction offences]], there is no statute of limitations in Canadian criminal law. For indictable (serious) offences such as major theft, murder, kidnapping or sexual assault, a defendant may be charged at any future date;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/criminal-procedure/|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases, warrants have remained outstanding for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=16 July 2015|location=Section 46|date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, the statute of limitations on crimes varies by type of crime, with the highest being 30 years for voluntary manslaughter (Totschlag).  Murder, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crime of aggression have no statute of limitations.

Murder used to have 20 years' statute of limitations, which was then extended to 30 years in 1969. The limitations were abolished altogether in 1979, to prevent Nazi criminals from avoiding criminal liability.

For most other criminal offences, the statute of limitations is set by Section 78(3) of the Criminal Code ([[Strafgesetzbuch]]) as follows:

* 30 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment for life;
* 20 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 10 years but not by imprisonment for life;
* 10 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 5 years but no more than 10 years;
* 5 years for offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 1 year but no more than 5 years;
* 3 years for all other offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html|title=GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the civil code ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]), the regular statute of limitations is three years (plus the time until the end of the calendar year). However, different terms between two and thirty years may apply in specific situations. For example, the term is only two years for claims for alleged defects of purchased goods, but 30 years for claims resulting from a court judgement (such as awarded damages).

===India===
The statute of limitations in India is defined by the Limitations Act, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;http://comtax.up.nic.in/Miscellaneous%20Act/limitation-act-1963.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute of limitations for criminal offences is governed by Sec. 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

===Norway===
The statute of limitations on murder was abolished by a change in law on 1 July 2014, causing any murders committed after 1 July 1989 to have no statute of limitations. This led to the national police force implementing a new investigation group for old cases called the "Cold Case" group. The law was also changed to let cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage, human trafficking and genital mutilation to count from the day the defendant turns 18 years old. Cases where the statute of limitations has already passed can not be extended due to the constitution preventing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/stortinget-fjerner-foreldelsesfristen-1.285858 |title=Stortinget fjerner foreldelsesfristen |language=Norwegian |publisher=Dagsavisen |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===

In July 2015, the National Assembly abolished a 25-year-old statute on first degree murder; it had previously been extended from 15 to 25 years in December 2007.

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Limitation periods in the UK}}
Unlike other European countries, the United Kingdom has no statute of limitations for any criminal offence. Following a number of acquittals and wrongful convictions of people charged with serious sexual crimes alleged to have been committed several decades prior, there has been some debate as to whether there should be a statute of limitations for historical rape and sexual assault cases, as prosecutions rely solely on personal testimonies and have no physical or scientific evidence due to the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theopinionsite.org/should-britain-have-a-statute-of-limitations-on-sex-crimes/ |title=Should Britain have a Statute of Limitations on sex crimes? |publisher=Theopinionsite.org |date=2011-03-19 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, statutes of limitations may apply to both civil lawsuits and to criminal prosecutions. Statutes of limitations vary significantly between U.S. jurisdictions.

====Civil statutes====
A civil statute of limitations applies to a non-criminal legal action, including a [[tort]] or [[contract]] case.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; If the statute of limitations expires before a lawsuit is filed, the defendant may raise the statute of limitations as an [[affirmative defense]] to seek dismissal of the charge.

====Criminal statutes====
A criminal statute of limitations defines a time period during which charges must be initiated for a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doyle|first1=Charles|title=Statute of Limitation in  Federal Criminal Cases: An Overview|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31253.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a charge is filed after the statute of limitations expires, the defendant may obtain dismissal of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Time Limits for Criminal Charges: What's the Statute of Limitations|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-statute-of-limitations|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Initiation of charges=====
The statute of limitations in a criminal case only runs until a criminal charge is filed and a warrant is issued, even if the defendant is a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Jonathan|title=Speedy Trial and the Statute of Limitations|url=http://www.sdap.org/downloads/research/criminal/jg14.pdf|website=Sixth District Appellate Program|accessdate=6 December 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the identity of a defendant is not known, some jurisdictions provide mechanisms to initiate charges and thus stop the statute of limitations from running. For example, some states allow an indictment of a "John Doe" defendant based upon a DNA profile derived from evidence obtained through a criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullmer|first1=Frank B.|title=Using DNA Profiles to Obtain John Doe Arrest Warrants and Indictments|journal=Washington &amp; Lee Law Review|date=2001|volume=58|page=1585|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/waslee58&amp;div=52&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare, a [[grand jury]] can issue an [[indictment]] [[in absentia]] for high-profile crimes to get around an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. One example is the [[skyjacking]] of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 by [[D.B. Cooper]] in 1971. The identity of D. B. Cooper remains unknown to this day, and he was indicted under the name "John Doe, aka Dan Cooper." &lt;ref&gt;Denson, Bryan (November 24, 1996). D.B. Cooper legend lives.

====={{anchor|Heinous crimes in the United States}}Heinous crimes=====
Crimes considered heinous by society have no statute of limitations.
Although there is usually no statute of limitations for murder (particularly [[Murder#Degrees of murder|first-degree murder]]), judges have been known to dismiss murder charges in [[cold case]]s if they feel the delay violates the defendant's right to a speedy trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixth Amendment - Limited Protection Against Excessive Prosecutorial Delay|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6346&amp;context=jclc|website=Northwestern University School of Law|publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, waiting many years for an [[alibi]] witness to die before commencing a murder trial would be unconstitutional. In 2003, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Stogner v. California]]'' ruled that the retroactive extension of the statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors was an unconstitutional ''[[ex post facto]]'' law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2002/2002_01_1757&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Military law=====
Under the U.S. [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), [[desertion]] has no statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/17/airman-who-went-missing-in-1977-found-living-double-life-in-florida.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maritime Injury Law'''

Under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/30106 46 U.S. Code § 30106], "Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action for damages for personal injury or death arising out of a maritime tort must be brought within 3 years after the cause of action arose." There are some exceptions to this, primarily with regard to Jones Act cases filed against the government, in which case the statute of limitations can be less than 2 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonesactlaw.com/faqs/what-is-the-jones-act-claim-statute-of-limitations/|title=What is the Jones Act Claim Statute of Limitations?|last=Young|first=Timothy|date=|website=http://www.jonesactlaw.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====
U.S. jurisdictions recognize exceptions to statutes of limitation that may allow for the prosecution of a crime or civil lawsuit even after the statute of limitations would otherwise have expired. Some states stop the clock for a suspect who is not residing within the state or is purposely hiding. Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina have no statutes of limitation for felonies, while Wyoming includes misdemeanors as well. However, the right to [[Speedy Trial Clause|speedy trial]] may derail any prosecution after many years have passed.&lt;ref&gt;https://resources.lawinfo.com/criminal-defense/criminal-statute-limitations-time-limits.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fraud upon the court=====&lt;!-- [[Fraud upon the court]] redirects to here --&gt;
When an [[officer of the court]] is found to have fraudulently presented facts to impair the court's impartial performance of its legal task, the act (known as ''fraud upon the court'') is not subject to a statute of limitation. Officers of the court include lawyers, judges, referees, [[legal guardian]]s, parenting-time expeditors, mediators, evaluators, administrators, special appointees and any others whose influence is part of the judicial mechanism. Fraud upon the court has been defined by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] to "embrace that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication".&lt;ref&gt;''Kenner v. C.I.R.'', 387 F.3d 689 (1968); 7 ''Moore's Federal Practice'', 2nd ed., p.&amp;nbsp;512, ¶ 60.23&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bulloch v. United States'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled: "Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury&amp;nbsp;... It is where the court or a member is corrupted or function—thus where the impartial functions of the court have been directly corrupted."&lt;ref&gt;''Bulloch v. United States'', 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

====={{anchor|Continuing violations doctrine}}Continuing-violations doctrine=====
In [[tort]] law, if a defendant commits a series of illegal acts against another person (or in criminal law if someone commits a continuing crime) the limitation period may begin to run from the last act in the series. In the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] case of ''Treanor v. MCI Telecommunications, Inc.'', the court explained that the continuing-violations doctrine "tolls [freezes] the statute of limitations in situations where a continuing pattern forms due to [illegal] acts occurring over a period of time, as long as at least one incident&amp;nbsp;... occurred within the limitations period."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/00/01/991836P.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the continuing-violations doctrine applies to a particular violation is subject to judicial discretion; it was ruled to apply to [[copyright infringement]] in ''Taylor v. Meirick'' (712 F.2d 1112, 1119; 7th Cir. 1983) but not in ''Stone v. Williams'' (970 F.2d 1043, 1049–50; 2d Cir. 1992).&lt;ref&gt;http://gonzagalawreview.org/files/2011/02/Graham.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strait passage''' is a concept in [[Admiralty law]] which allows for a vessel to pass through a [[strait]]. Given the [[United Nations]]' extension of [[territorial waters]] to a maximum width of 12&amp;nbsp;miles, straits with width of less than 24 miles are entirely composed of territorial waters. Under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] however, [[innocent passage]] rules do not apply and ships both commercial and military are allowed passage as if they were traversing the [[high seas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4820">'''Tallage''' or '''talliage''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''tailler, i.e. '' a part cut out of the whole) may have signified at first any [[tax]], but became in England and France a land use or land tenure tax. Later in [[England]] it was further limited to assessments by the crown upon [[city|cities]], [[borough]]s, and [[monarchy|royal]] domains. In effect, tallage was a [[land tax]].

==England==
Land taxes were not unknown in England, as the Anglo-Saxon kings had periodically levied a [[Danegeld]] on that basis, but tallage was brought to England by the [[Normans]] as a feudal duty. Under the sons of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] it became a common source of royal revenue. It was condemned in the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215, and was abolished in England in 1340 under [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].

Like [[scutage]], tallage was superseded by the [[subsidy]]{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!-- simplistic administrator Hack! - all references were provided before being deleted by Hackers --&gt; system in the 14th century. The last occasion on which tallage was levied in England appears to be about the year 1332.

The famous statute of ''25 Edw. I.'' (in some editions of the statutes ''34 Edw. I.''), ''De [[Tallagio non Concedendo]]'', though it is printed among the statutes of the realm, and was cited as a statute in the preamble to the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, and by the judges in [[John Hampden|John Hampden's]] case in 1637, is probably an imperfect and unauthoritative abstract of the ''[[Confirmatio Cartarum]]''. The first section enacts that no tallage for aid shall be imposed or levied by the [[monarch|king]] and his heirs without the will and assent of the [[archbishop]]s, [[bishop]]s, and other [[prelate]]s, the [[earl]]s, [[baron]]s, [[knight]]s, [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es, and other freemen in the kingdom.

''Tallagium facere'' was the technical term for rendering accounts in the [[exchequer]], the accounts being kept by means of ''tallies'' or notched sticks. The tellers (a corruption of ''talliers'') of the exchequer were at one time important financial officers. The system of keeping the national accounts by tallies was abolished by ''23 Geo. III. c. 82'' and the office of teller by ''57 Geo. II. c. 84''.

===Tallage and Jews===

The tax was frequently levied on English Jews during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A tallage of £60,000, known as the "[[Saladin tithe|Saladin tallage]]", was levied at [[Guildford]] in 1189, the ostensible object being preparation for the [[Third Crusade]].  It was reported that [[John of England|John]] may have imposed a Tallage&lt;!-- Middle English word 'Tallage' (proper noun) cannot be turned into a verb --&gt; upon Jews in 1210 to the extent of 60,000 marks (£40,000). There are likewise records of tallages under [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] of 4,000 marks (1225) and 5,000 marks (1270).  Important tallages were made by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in the second, third and fourth years, (£1,000) and in the fifth year (25,000 marks), of his reign. These taxes were in addition to the various claims which were made upon Jews for relief, [[wardship]], marriage, [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], law-proceedings, [[debts]], [[licenses]], [[amercements]] etc. and which Jews paid to the English exchequer, like other English subjects.  It has been claimed that after their expulsion from England in 1290, the loss of the income from Jews was a chief reason why Edward I was obliged to give up his right of tallage upon Englishmen.

==France==
Tallage lasted much longer in France, where it was a royal tax and one of estate owners with tenants. It came to be called 'taille' and was much used during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It was not abolished in France until the [[French Revolution]].

==Germany==
Tallage never became significantly developed in the German states. It remained a small tax owed to a feudal lord in lieu of other feudal duties, dying out along with other feudal duties.

A 2014 report to the [[UN General Assembly]] by the [[United Nations]]' top official for [[counter-terrorism]] and [[human rights]] condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core [[privacy]] rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions and makes a distinction between "targeted surveillance" - which "depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization" — and "mass surveillance", by which "states with high levels of [[Internet]] penetration can [...] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular [[website]]s".&lt;ref name=theintercept1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Glenn|title=UN Report Finds Mass Surveillance Violates International Treaties and Privacy Rights|url=https://theintercept.com/2014/10/15/un-investigator-report-condemns-mass-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom's [[House of Lords]] also distinguishes between these two broad types of surveillance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance: Citizens and the State - Constitution Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldconst/18/1804.htm|publisher=House of Lords|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Mass surveillance is also known as “passive” or “undirected” surveillance. [...] It is not targeted on any particular individual but gathers images and information for possible future use. CCTV and databases are examples of mass surveillance.
* Targeted surveillance is surveillance directed at particular individuals and can involve the use of specific powers by authorised public agencies. Targeted surveillance can be carried out overtly or covertly, and can involve human agents. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA), targeted covert surveillance is “directed” if it is carried out for a specific investigation or operation. By comparison, if it is carried out on designated premises or on a vehicle, it is “intrusive” surveillance. Targeting methods include the interception of communications, the use of communications “traffic” data, visual surveillance devices, and devices that sense movement, objects or persons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including [[terrorism]], is justified, according to a decision by the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=theguardian1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European court’s snooping judgment ‘bolsters privilege’|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/european-courts-snooping-judgment-bolsters-privilege/5059203.article|publisher=Law Society Gazette|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=EU's highest court delivers blow to UK snooper's charter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 January 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heathman|first1=Amelia|title=EU court deals major blow to UK's controversial snooper's charter|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/eu-rules-against-snoopers-charter|publisher=WIRED UK|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current approach of the [[NSA]] and its related organizations is attempting to collect all [[SIGINT|signals]] of everybody at all times without any prior selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The crux of the NSA story in one phrase: 'collect it all'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/crux-nsa-collect-it-all|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maass|first1=Peter|title=Inside NSA, Officials Privately Criticize "Collect It All" Surveillance|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/05/28/nsa-officials-privately-criticize-collect-it-all-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=David|title=‘No Place to Hide’ by Glenn Greenwald, on the NSA’s sweeping efforts to ‘Know it All’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald-on-the-nsas-sweeping-efforts-to-know-it-all/2014/05/12/dfa45dee-d628-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So any current selection is only used for targets of special interest, human review or special resource allocation.

Such selectors include searching the web for the [[Privacy software|privacy-enhancing software tools]] such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=The NSA Is Targeting Users of Privacy Services, Leaked Code Shows|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/nsa-targets-users-of-privacy-services/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA targets the privacy-conscious|url=https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html|publisher=Das Erste|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal control and consent ===
Selectors for who to surveil and for what to look for in searches for unknown threats as well as their extents can be decided upon by society. Verifiable public consent on broad selectors and their extents as well as proper mechanisms and institutions for oversight may allow for a better cooperation of private sectors and citizens with their intelligence communities.

=== Germany and NSA's selector lists ===
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" − search terms for their [[Dragnet (policing)|dragnet surveillance]]. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BND's project group charged with supporting the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA investigative committee in German parliament]] set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association [[Eco International]], has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calls for targeted surveillance ==

=== Intelligence officials ===
Former [[NSA]] director and [[whistleblower]] [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] testified that while targeted data collection operations could help prevent terror attacks, "overcollection" of mass data undermined security and had consistently cost lives because of "analysis paralysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Travis|first1=Alan|last2=Bowcott|first2=Owen|title='Snooper's charter' will cost British lives, MPs are warned|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/snoopers-charter-will-cost-british-lives-mps-warned|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the UK government should "redirect" intelligence agencies and law enforcement to targeted surveillance with it being "based on probable cause and developing knowledge about the targets and make sure they qualify for things like warrants". He also states that "retroactively analysing people, anybody you want, any time you want, that's certainly possible with bulk acquisition of data but that's certainly not what democracies are built on". According to him "that's what [[totalitarian]] states are built on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|title=UK mass surveillance 'totalitarian' and will 'cost lives', warns ex-NSA tech boss|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mass-surveillance-william-binney-nsa-uk-ip-bill|publisher=WIRED UK|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] states:
{{Quote|text=What I protest most strongly is mass surveillance, indiscriminate surveillance where they are watching everyone. Targeted surveillance that's backed by a court...is the least intrusive means of achieving these investigative goals without destroying the rights of everyone else in a free society |author=Edward J.

Snowden also noted that the men who committed recent terrorist attacks in France, Canada and Australia were under surveillance but they weren't singled out.
{{Quote|text=It wasn't the fact that we weren't watching people or not, it was the fact that we were watching people so much that we did not understand what we had.

In May 2015 ''[[The Intercept]]'' revealed that it obtained documents that showed that officials inside the NSA have criticized the 'collect it all'-approach as well with the documents having titles such as "Data Is Not Intelligence", "The Fallacies Behind the Scenes", "Cognitive Overflow?", "Summit Fever", "In Praise of Not Knowing", "Dealing With a 'Tsunami' of Intercept", "Overcome by [[Information overload|Overload]]?" and "Too Many Choices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maass|first1=Peter|title=Inside NSA, Officials Privately Criticize "Collect It All" Surveillance|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/05/28/nsa-officials-privately-criticize-collect-it-all-surveillance/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents feature conclusions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The SIGINT mission is far too vital to unnecessarily expand the haystacks while we search for the needles. Prioritization is key.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We in the agency are at risk of a similar, collective paralysis in the face of a dizzying array of choices every single day&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Analysis paralysis' isn’t only a cute rhyme. It's the term for what happens when you spend so much time analyzing a situation that you ultimately stymie any outcome [...] It's what happens in SIGINT when we have access to endless possibilities, but we struggle to prioritize, narrow, and exploit the best ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Politics ===
[[United Kingdom]]'s [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have demanded that the Government ends indiscriminate mass surveillance and introduces a more targeted and effective [[counter-terrorism]] policy that uses targeted surveillance of specific individuals who are suspected of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lib Dems call for targeted surveillance not Big Brother|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/targeted-surveillance-not-big-brother|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en|date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson [[Alistair Carmichael]] asks that "mass spying on the British people should be replaced with targeted surveillance of specific individuals suspected of wrongdoing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How spies broke law to snoop on your emails|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3845800/How-spies-broke-law-snoop-emails-Intelligence-agencies-harvested-data-websites-visited-people-called-texted.html|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British spies illegally kept databases on UK citizens.

In the 2015 "Resolution 2045" the [[European Parliamentary Assembly]] "recognises the need for effective, targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists and other organised criminal groups" and states that "such targeted surveillance can be an effective tool for law enforcement and crime prevention", while at the same time "according to independent reviews carried out in the United States, mass surveillance does not appear to have contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks, contrary to earlier assertions made by senior intelligence officials. Instead, resources that might prevent attacks are diverted to mass surveillance, leaving potentially dangerous persons free to act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass surveillance - Resolution 2045 (2015)|url=https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=21692&amp;lang=en|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizations ===
Privacy campaigners argue that instead of "wasting resources gathering and sifting through the volume of data being accumulated through mass surveillance", resources would be better allocated in providing more personnel for targeted surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|title=Does the Berlin attack make the case for increased surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/22/berlin-terrorist-attack-surveillance-intelligence-agencies|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of 10 recent [[terror attack]]s [[Ryan Gallagher]] of ''[[The Intercept]]'' concludes that "if any lesson can be learned from studying the perpetrators of recent attacks, it is that there needs to be a greater investment in conducting targeted surveillance of known terror suspects and a move away from the constant knee-jerk expansion of dragnet surveillance, which has simply not proven itself to be effective, regardless of the debate about whether it is legal or ethical in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=From Paris to Boston, Terrorists Were Already Known to Authorities|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/11/18/terrorists-were-already-known-to-authorities/|publisher=The Intercept|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Privacy International]] launched a legal case against Britain's security services Thomas de la Mare QC of the group states there is a danger that "de facto constant surveillance" such as the services' orders for bulk data from telecom companies on request could become "the most potent instrument of repression" and argued during the hearing, that such non-targeted forms of surveillance have turned investigations on their head. The campaigners argue that whereas in the past, individual inquiries based on suspicion would throw up leads, it is now algorithmic processing of data providing those leads with that amounting to mass surveillance.&lt;ref name=ft1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=UK heading towards era of parliament-approved mass surveillance|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/uk-heading-towards-era-of-parliament-approved-mass-surveillance/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], which is challenging the legality of bulk collection in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] criticizes the "Report of the bulk powers review" by [[David Anderson (British politician)|David Anderson]] QC for failing to answer whether information gathered via bulk powers was the "critical factor in preventing or detecting serious crime, and whether that information could have been obtained from smart, targeted surveillance instead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lomas|first1=Natasha|title=UK spy agencies’ use of mass surveillance backed by external reviewer|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/19/uk-spy-agencies-use-of-mass-surveillance-backed-by-external-reviewer/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Paddick]] comments the 2016 [[Investigatory Powers Act]], saying "as with any legislation, there is a significant risk that authorities will use powers in a way that parliament never intended" and called for proper oversight to ensure any surveillance is targeted and proportionate.&lt;ref name=theguardian1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asthana|first1=Anushka|title=Revealed: British councils used Ripa to secretly spy on public|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;? --&gt;
Privacy campaigners say the bill clearly lays out the mass surveillance powers that would be at the disposal of the security services, and want it amended so that the surveillance is targeted and based on suspicion and argue that the powers are so sweeping, and the bill's language so general, that not just the security services but also government bodies will be able to analyse the records of millions of people even if they are not under suspicion.&lt;ref name=ft1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viña|first1=Gonzalo|title=Surveillance: Taking liberties?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1b7df076-57bb-11e6-9f70-badea1b336d4|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Troy Wolverton]] notes that the documents leaked by Snowden revealed widespread abuses, both at home and abroad. He says that "instead of targeted surveillance of particular threats, the NSA had a motto and mentality of 'collect it all' on everybody, the privacy of anyone involved be damned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolverton|first1=Troy|title=Opinion: Tech industry should lead Snowden pardon charge|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-09-opinion-tech-industry-snowden-pardon.html|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jo Glanville, editor of [[Index on Censorship]] and a member of the Ministry of Justice working party on libel reform, asserts that keeping the country safe does not entitle the government or the intelligence services to act without regards to our human rights and that "it is possible to conduct targeted surveillance with effective oversight while according respect to all our rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=David|last2=Kreissl|first2=Reinhard|title=Surveillance in Europe|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317915461|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sauQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientists at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] have developed an algorithmic framework for conducting targeted surveillance of individuals within social networks while protecting the privacy of "untargeted" digital bystanders that "outputs a list of confirmed targeted individuals discovered in the network, for whom any subsequent action (e.g., publication in a most-wanted list, further surveillance, or arrest in the case of terrorism; medical treatment or quarantine in the case of epidemics) will not compromise the privacy of the protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Michael|title=Algorithms Claim to Hunt Terrorists While Protecting the Privacy of Others|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/algorithms-claim-to-hunt-terrorists-while-protecting-the-privacy-of-others|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kearns|first1=Michael|last2=Roth|first2=Aaron|last3=Wu|first3=Zhiwei Steven|last4=Yaroslavtsev|first4=Grigory|title=Private algorithms for the protected in social network search|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=26 January 2016|volume=113|issue=4|pages=913–918|doi=10.1073/pnas.1510612113|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/913|accessdate=2 January 2017|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4743768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 it was reported that German federal agencies are using a new program called "Radar", developed by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] and the [[University of Zürich]], that aims to help evaluate the risk posed by persons. It includes a catalog of questions such as about the person's relationship to violence and access to weapons and takes into account data on past terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neues Sicherheitssystem: "Radar" soll Gefährder besser erkennen|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Radar-soll-Gefaehrder-besser-erkennen-article19609922.html|website=n-tv.de|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neue BKA-Software soll Gefährder beurteilen|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/amri-125.html|website=tagesschau.de|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crypto and security communities can make the Internet more secure by making population-wide surveillance technically or economically infeasible, understanding that modest amounts of targeted surveillance will always be technically and economically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Privacy and Security in an Age of Surveillance|doi=10.4230/DagMan.5.1.25|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc17/0ae9d483812e8244089eca297abb03d2af73.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Snowden]] notes that "we're thwarting mass surveillance when we use [[encryption]]. We're not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden: 'Journalists Are a Threatened Class' in Era of Mass Surveillance|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/10/26/snowden-journalists-are-threatened-class-era-mass-surveillance|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to legalize mass surveillance as targeted surveillance ==
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] claims that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and its defenders are trying to pass off their mass surveillance as being authorized under Section 702 of the [[FISA Amendments Act]] as "targeted surveillance" even though it includes the collection of the content of hundreds of millions of communications annually and the real-time search of billions more which according to them fits the definition "mass surveillance" under Section 702.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Games: What the NSA Means by "Targeted" Surveillance Under Section 702|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/nsa-word-games-mass-v-targeted-surveillance-under-section-702|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://www.law360.com/articles/848733/3rd-circ-revives-challenge-to-nsa-email-surveillance--&gt;

Furthermore, the organization asks how the US government justified the [[Yahoo! email scanning program|Yahoo email scanning]] under [[FISA]], asking whether the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] has interpreted FISA – which authorizes targeted surveillance of certain foreigners' (such as spies or terrorists) communications – to mean that the government can conscript Yahoo into mass surveillance of all of its users' emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time for Answers on Yahoo's Email Scanning|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/its-time-answers-yahoos-email-scanning|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents obtained from Edward Snowden and published by [[Glenn Greenwald]] the NSA and [[GCHQ]] have been automating targeted operations, allowing for "industrial scale exploitation" that can potentially infect "millions" of machines with [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopfstein|first1=Janus|title=The NSA’s "Targeted" Surveillance Is Looking Less Targeted All the Time|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/12/nsa_tailored_access_operations_turbine_surveillance_looking_less_targeted.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=NSA trove shows 9:1 ratio of innocents to suspicious people in "targeted surveillance"|url=https://boingboing.net/2014/07/06/huge-nsa-surveillance-trove-sh.html|publisher=Boing Boing|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Who Sell Out''''' is the third [[studio album]] by the British rock band [[the Who]]. It was released on 15 December 1967 by [[Track Records]] in the UK and [[Decca Records]] in the US. 

A [[concept album]], ''The Who Sell Out'' is structured as a collection of unrelated songs interspersed with fake commercials and [[public service announcement]]s.&lt;ref name=pc49&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 – The British are Coming! The British are Coming!: With an emphasis on Donovan, the Bee Gees and The Who. [Part 6, : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |year=1969 |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album purports to be a broadcast by [[pirate radio]] station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. The reference to "[[selling out]]" was an intended irony, as The Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.

The album's release was reportedly followed by lawsuits due to the mention of real-world commercial interests in the ''faux'' commercials and on the album covers, and by the makers of the real [[jingle]]s (Radio London jingles), who claimed the Who used them without permission. (The jingles were produced by [[PAMS]] Productions of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which created thousands of [[Station identification|station ID]] jingles in the 1960s and 1970s). It was the deodorant company, [[Odorono]], who took offence that [[Chris Stamp]] made a request for endorsement dollars.&lt;ref&gt;"B.O., Baked Beans, Buns and The Who", Rolling Stone. Vol 1 No. 3, 14 December 1967&lt;/ref&gt; "[[I Can See for Miles]]" was released as a single and peaked at #10 in the UK and #9 in the US.

''The Who Sell Out'' has received widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as The Who's best record. It has also frequently been featured on all-time lists of the best albums, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]", on which it ranked 113th.

==Background==
In his book ''Maximum R &amp; B'', Who confidant Richard Barnes claims to have come up with the idea of the band recording commercial jingles after their cover of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] theme appeared on the ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'' EP. Barnes posited the idea to Roger Daltrey, whose similar suggestions to Pete Townshend were allegedly met with derision. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Richard|title=Maximum R &amp; B|date=1982|publisher=Plexus|location=London|isbn=0-85965351-X|page=45|edition=Revised, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the band's follow-up to ''[[A Quick One]]'' was to be titled ''Who's Lily'' after their recent single "[[Pictures of Lily]]." Early cuts such as a cover of "Summertime Blues," the Coke jingles, and the instrumental "Sodding About," showed the influence of Track Records label-mate [[Jimi Hendrix]] on Townshend's guitar playing.

Even before the group had formed, the members of The Who had been profoundly influenced by [[rock n roll]] appearing on the radio. The BBC did not broadcast much music at the time, which was left to stations like [[Radio Luxembourg]] and then [[pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} By the end of 1966, The Who had achieved commercial success owing to the [[mod (subculture)|mod movement]] that made up a significant section of the group's early audience. However, the movement was fading, and the TV show ''[[Ready, Steady, Go]]'' that had boosted the group to fame, had been cancelled.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=239}} The group started touring the US the following year, and started to achieve success with their live act.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=246}} In summer 1967, the group's managers [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]] suggested the band could create a [[concept album]] based on pirate radio and structure it in the same manner as that, or a typical US AM radio station.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=5}} As pirate radio had been influential to mods, it was felt particularly appropriate to pay tribute to it.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=172-173}} As well as the music, the inter-song announcements and [[jingle]]s were a key component of radio, so it was decided to include a selection of humorous asides on the album.{{sfn|Marsh|1995|p=7}} The [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] came into effect at midnight on 14 August 1967, outlawing all pirate stations and strengthening the album's effect as a tribute.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=276}} The aspect separated The Who from their contemporaries in the developing underground rock scene, both musically and stylistically.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=173}}

The first song to be written specifically for the concept was "Jaguar", paying tribute to the car, which was quickly followed by an instrumental the group had recorded for [[Coca-Cola]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=278}} "Armenia City in the Sky", was written by a friend of the band, [[Speedy Keen|John "Speedy" Keen]].{{efn|Keen later found fame as a member of [[Thunderclap Newman]] whose smash hit  [[Something in the Air (song)|"Something in The Air"]]  features production by Pete Townshend and bass playing from Townshend under the pseudonym Bijou Drains.}} According to music critic [[Richie Unterberger]], ''The Who Sell Out'' featured "jubilant" [[psychedelic pop]] music that veers between "melodic [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] pop and powerful instrumentation",&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt; while Edna Gundersen from ''[[USA Today]]'' said the album's style was [[power pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-12-04-album-list_x.htm|accessdate=2 July 2013|title=Top 40 albums — the USA TODAY way|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|date=5 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having finished touring the US, including an appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], the group returned to the UK on 16 September to start recording. They made progress on the album for the next three weeks; the first song to be completed was the single, "[[I Can See For Miles]]", released the following month.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}} By October, the group had also completed "Armenia (City In The Sky)", "Early Morning Cold Taxi" and "Girl's Eyes".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=179}} "Heinz Baked Beans", "Odorono" and "Top Gear" had been completed mid-month, along with a series of linking adverts and jingles mostly recorded by Entwistle and Moon.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=180}} "Tattoo", "Odorono" and "Rael" were completed by 20 October, {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=181}} while most of the remainder of the album was recorded in between live shows at the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=183}} "Sunrise", a solo Townshend piece, was the last piece to be recorded on 2 November. The album was mixed by Lambert and Damon Lyon-Shaw intermittently throughout November, coming up with a finished master on the 20th.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=184}}

==Packaging==
The cover is divided into panels featuring a photograph by [[David Montgomery (photographer)|David Montgomery]] of each of the band members, two on the front and two on the back. On the front is [[Pete Townshend]] applying Odorono brand [[deodorant]] from an oversized stick, and [[Roger Daltrey]] sitting in a [[bathtub]] full of [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] baked beans (holding an oversized tin can of the same). Daltrey claims to have caught [[pneumonia]] after sitting for a prolonged period in the bathtub, as the beans had been frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7951056.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Roger Daltrey's concert conundrum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the back is [[Keith Moon]] applying Medac (a fictitious [[acne]] ointment) from an oversized tube, and [[John Entwistle]] in a leopard-skin ''[[Tarzan]]'' suit, squeezing a blonde woman in a leopard-skin bikini with one arm and a [[teddy bear]] with the other (an ad for the [[Angelo Siciliano|Charles Atlas]] course mentioned in one of the album's fake commercials).

Original vinyl copies of ''Sell Out'' end with an audio oddity that repeats into a [[locked groove]] (In response to [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''). The music in the locked groove is a vocal chanting jingle for The Who's UK label [[Track Records]].

When the LP was released on Track Records in the UK in 1967 (Track 612 002 Mono &amp; Track 613 002 Stereo), a poster was included inside the first 1000 copies (500 stereo and 500 mono). They came with a sticker on the front cover stating 'Free Psychedelic Poster Inside'. Because of their rarity, first pressings with poster and sticker have sold for more than £600. Included in the inner sleeve of the 1995 MCA CD reissue; the poster art of a butterfly initially intended as the LP cover was scrapped, and turned into the free poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Who - Posters|url=http://www.thewho.info/Posters2.htm|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released in the UK on 15 December 1967. It reached #13 in the charts. The original release date of 17 November had been pushed back due to arguments about the running order. It was released in the US on 6 January 1968, reaching #48.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=187}} The concept of the album hampered its commercial performance despite positive reviews,{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=98}} as its irony sat awkwardly with the serious ambitions of the [[underground music]] scene, and it was too specific to the mod scene's background for many younger pop fans.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=174}}

In a contemporary review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Jann Wenner]] called ''The Who Sell Out'' "fantastic" and praised its "exquisite" sense of humor and the Who's "consummate" musicianship, which includes "wholly original" instrumentation and cleverly placed electronic sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenner|first=Jann|authorlink=Jann Wenner|date=10 February 1968|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-who-sell-out-19680210|title=The Who Sell Out|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|location=New York|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Christgau]], writing in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', said the album establishes the band as "the third best not just in Britain but the world", while citing "Tattoo" as the best song Townshend has "ever written, worth the price of the album".&lt;ref name="Christgau68"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=May 1968|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-aow/column3.php|title=Columns|journal=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|location=New York|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective review for [[AllMusic]], Richie Unterberger said that, "on strictly musical merits, it's a terrific set of songs that ultimately stands as one of the group's greatest achievements."&lt;ref name="Unterberger"&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sell-out-mw0000652659|title=The Who Sell Out – The Who|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociomusicologist]] [[Simon Frith]] referred to it as a "[[Pop art|Pop]] [[art pop]] masterpiece".{{sfn|Frith|Horne|2016|p=107}}

In 1995, ''The Who Sell Out'' was [[reissue]]d by [[MCA Records]] with numerous outtakes and rejected jingles added to the end of the original album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/who-sell-out-deluxe-edition-mr0001360678|title=Who Sell Out &lt;nowiki&gt;[Deluxe Edition]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the liner notes for the reissue, [[Dave Marsh]] called it "the greatest rock and roll album of its era" and "the Who's consummate masterpiece, the work that holds together most tightly as concept and realization".

An '''unfair labor practice''' in [[US labor law]] refers to certain actions taken by employers or unions that violate the [[National Labor Relations Act|National Labor Relations Act of 1935]] (49 Stat. 449) {{usc|29|151–169}} (also known as the NLRA and the Wagner Act after NY Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]]&lt;ref&gt;See also {{USPL|74|198}}, {{USStat|49|449}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other legislation. Such acts are investigated by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB).&lt;ref&gt;[[Schlesinger Jr., Arthur M.]] ''The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal: 1933–1935.'' Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]], 1958, p. 400-406.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of "unfair labor practice"==
The NLRB has the authority to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices, which are defined in Section 8 of the Act. In broad terms, the NLRB makes it unlawful for an employer to:

*interfere with two or more employees acting in concert to protect rights provided for in the Act, whether or not a union exists
*to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of a labor organization
*to discriminate against an employee from engaging in concerted or union activities or refraining from them
*to discriminate against an employee for filing charges with the NLRB or taking part in any NLRB proceedings
*to refuse to [[collective bargaining|bargain]] with the union that is the lawful representative of its employees

The Act similarly bars unions from:

*restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights or an employer in the choice of its bargaining representative
*causing an employer to discriminate against an employee
*refusing to bargain with the employer of the employees it represents
*engaging in certain types of [[secondary boycott]]s
*requiring excessive [[union dues|dues]]
*engaging in [[featherbedding]] (requiring an employer to pay for unneeded workers)
*picketing for recognition for more than thirty days without petitioning for an election
*entering into "[[hot cargo]]" agreements (refusing to handle goods from an anti-union employer)
*striking or picketing a health care establishment without giving the required notice

Applying this general language to the real world requires, in the words of [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], "distinctions more nice than obvious". The substantive law applied by the NLRB is described elsewhere under specific headings devoted to particular topics.

Not every unfair act amounts to an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an individual worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might be a violation of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.

==Filing of a charge==

While the employees of the NLRB may assist individuals in filing charges, the employees of the NLRB cannot file charges on their own. Under the Act, "any person" (except an employee of the Board) may file a charge with the NLRB.

Such charges must be filed and served within six months of the events that constitute the basis of the charge. This deadline may be extended in some cases, e.g., if the party fraudulently conceals its violations of the law.  Charges may also be amended if done so within six months of the alleged violation.

==Investigation and processing of the charge==

The General Counsel of the NLRB is responsible for investigating unfair labor practice charges and making the decision whether to issue a complaint. This job is delegated to the Regional Director of the region of the NLRB in which the charge has been filed; the Regional Director in turn assigns it to an employee of the region. It is the responsibility of the charging party to identify the witnesses who can support its charge; should it fail to do so the Regional Director will typically dismiss the charge.

The Regional Director generally seeks to reach a decision as to whether to issue a complaint or to dismiss the charge within thirty days of the filing of the charge. The Region may also ask the charging party to amend its charge to eliminate unsupported claims in an otherwise meritorious charge or to add new claims uncovered by the Region in the course of its investigation.

A party unsatisfied with the Regional Director's decision to dismiss its charge can appeal the dismissal to the office of the General Counsel. The General Counsel's decision to dismiss a charge is not subject to further appeal and cannot be challenged in court.

If the issues raised by an unfair labor practice charge could also be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration. In those cases the General Counsel does not dismiss the charge, but holds it in abeyance while the parties to the contract arbitrate their contractual dispute.

==Issuance of complaint and settlement==

If the Region finds merit in the charge it will file a formal complaint setting out the violations of the law allegedly committed by the respondent. While the Act requires that the original unfair labor practice be filed within six months, there is no comparable [[statute of limitations]] for issuance of a complaint. The complaint may also be amended in some circumstances to include other alleged violations of the Act not specified in an unfair labor practice charge.

The Region will usually renew its attempts to settle the matter after it has made the decision to issue complaint but before it has actually done so. It can settle unfair labor practice charges unilaterally, i.e., without the agreement of the charging party.

The Board draws a distinction between formal and informal settlements, i.e., those that call for issuance of a formal Board order and those that do not. A party unhappy with the Regional Director's settlement of its unfair labor practice charges can appeal a formal settlement to the Board itself, which must approve any formal settlement in any case, but can only appeal an informal settlement to the General Counsel.

The Board will set aside an informal settlement agreement if the employer violates the agreement or commits other violations of the Act after the agreement. The Board can, by  contrast, enforce a formal settlement like any other Board order by petitioning the Court of Appeals for an order enforcing it.

The Board will also accept non-Board settlements, in which the charging party withdraws its charge in return for promises from the other side. The Board is not, however, obliged to accept the parties' settlement agreement or to allow withdrawal of the charge.

==Interim injunctive relief==

If the General Counsel believes that there is cause to issue complaint, then he can seek [[injunction|injunctive relief]] from a [[United States district court|federal district court]] under Section 10(j) of the Act. Injunctive relief is usually ordered when necessary to preserve the [[status quo]] pending the Board's decision on the complaint or to prevent employees from suffering irreparable harm. Any injunction lapses once the NLRB issues its decision.

The General Counsel does not have to prove that the allegations in the complaint are well-founded, but only that he has some evidence, together with an arguable legal theory, to support his claims. Even so, the General Counsel rarely uses this power to seek relief while complaints are pending, other than in secondary boycott cases, in which the Act commands the General Counsel to seek injunctive relief.

==Hearing and decision==

If the case is not settled following issuance of a complaint, then the case will proceed to hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the NLRB. The Regional Director has the power to issue subpoenas for use by any party prior to the hearing; the [[Administrative Law]] Judge has that power once the hearing commences. The hearing is governed by the same rules of evidence that would apply in a federal court trial.

The General Counsel functions as the prosecutor in these proceedings. Just as only the General Counsel can decide whether to issue a complaint, the General Counsel has exclusive authority to decide what charges to pursue. Interested parties may, however, intervene in these proceedings to present evidence or offer alternative theories in support of the charges that the General Counsel has alleged and to seek additional or different remedies than those that the General Counsel has proposed.

The Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, which becomes final if not appealed to the NLRB. While the Administrative Law Judge's credibility determinations are ordinarily given great weight by the Board, they are not binding on it. The Board likewise is free to substitute its own view of the law for that of the Administrative Law Judge and frequently reverses its own precedents.

==Review by the courts==

A party that is aggrieved by a decision of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the [[United States court of appeals|Court of Appeals]]. The Act gives parties a good deal of latitude as to which court they want to hear their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the [[Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.

The NLRB's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders. The Court of Appeal reviews the Board's decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on a correct view of the law.

While the courts are obligated in theory to give deference to the NLRB's interpretation of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it is convinced that the Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically in the choice of remedies to be applied.

Any aggrieved party may also ask the Supreme Court to review a decision of the Court of Appeals. Such review by the Supreme Court is, however, discretionary and rarely granted.

==Compliance==

If the Court of Appeals enforces the Board's order then the case will return to the Region for it to monitor the respondent's compliance. In those cases in which the Board's order requires payment of backpay, the Region will commence compliance proceedings if it is not able to resolve all disputes over the amount of backpay. These compliance proceedings are also held before an Administrative Law Judge, based on the compliance specification filed by the Region. The same procedural rights apply in these proceedings as in the earlier proceedings on the merits of the charge.

'''''Vance v. Ball State University''''', 570 U.S. 421 (2013), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case regarding who is a "[[supervisor]]" for the purposes of [[harassment]] lawsuits. The Supreme Court upheld the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]]'s decision in a 5–4 opinion written by [[Samuel Alito]], rejecting the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s interpretation of who counts as a supervisor.&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=Vance v. Ball State University|volume=570|docket=11-556}}, 133 S.

The issue presented before the Court was:
{{quote|Whether, as the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits have held, the ''Faragher'' and ''Ellerth'' "supervisor" liability rule (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim's daily work, or, as
the First, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to "hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline" their victim.|Questions presented, ''Vance v. Ball State University''&lt;ref name="Questions Presented" /&gt;}}

== Background ==

While working at Ball State University, Maetta Vance contended that Saundra Davis, a catering specialist, had made Vance’s life at work unpleasant through physical acts and racial harassment. Vance sued her employer, the university, for workplace harassment by a supervisor.

To win a lawsuit for harassment under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], it is necessary to show that the employer is [[Negligence in employment|negligent]] in responding to complaints about harassment. However, to win a lawsuit for harassment by a ''supervisor'', the employer does not have to be negligent because Title VII [[Imputation (law)|imputes]] the supervisor’s acts to the employer. Vance asserted that Davis was a supervisor; Ball State claimed the opposite.

The District Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had determined that Davis was not Vance’s supervisor, because Davis did not have the power to direct the terms and conditions of her employment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/11-556 Vance v. Ball State] Legal Information Institute. Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supreme Court decision==

The Court upheld the Seventh Circuit's interpretation in its decision issued on June 24, 2013. It used a narrow interpretation of the term "supervisor", so that a person may only be considered a supervisor if he or she can take tangible action against the employee.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

The majority of the High Court held that because the President of the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] was appointed for seven years and not life as required by s 72 of the Constitution, the Arbitration Court could not exercise judicial powers of the Commonwealth.

==Background==
The [[Maritime Union of Australia|Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia]] applied to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a penalty to be imposed on J W Alexander Ltd for the breach of an [[Industrial award|award]]. [[H. B. Higgins]] was appointed for life as a judge of the High Court, however his appointment as President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was for seven years only. J W Alexander Ltd objected to the case being heard by the Court, arguing that the Court was not validly constituted because the President was not appointed for life.

Higgins referred questions for the opinion of the High Court, by way of a stated case.  Two primary issues arose in the case, whether the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could validly exercise (1) judicial power of the Commonwealth and (2) the arbitration powers of the Commonwealth. In the High Court [[Owen Dixon]] represented the Waterside Workers' Federation while [[Hayden Starke]] appeared for J W Alexander Ltd.

At the time s 72 of the Constitution provided :&lt;blockquote&gt;The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament:
(i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;

(ii) shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;

(iii) shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.{{r|s72}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case followed shortly after the [[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|Wheat Case]] where the High Court held that the seven year term mandated by s103 of the Constitution for members of the [[Inter-State Commission]] precluded that commission from exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915) |court=HCA |num=17 |year=1915 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 54]}} at p. 64 per Griffith CJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The High Court was divided with the majority of judges agreeing as to the conclusions but for different reasons such that there was no [[majority opinion]] and the [[ratio decidendi]] is, in part, uncertain.  The [[plurality opinion]] is found in the judgments of [[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]], [[Charles Powers|Powers]] and [[George Rich|Rich]] [[Justices|JJ]].

=== The exercise of judicial power ===
A majority of judges, [[Samuel Griffith|Griffith]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]], [[Edmund Barton|Barton]], Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ, held that the power to enforce awards, being convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties and punishments, are matters appertaining exclusively to judicial power.&lt;ref&gt;''WWF v J W Alexander Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/56.pdf (1918) 25 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 434] at p. 444 per Griffiths CJ, pp. 454-5 per Barton J, p. 463 per Isaacs &amp; Rich JJ and p. 481 per Powers J.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the power conferred by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1915&lt;ref name=Act&gt;{{cite web|title=''Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act'' 1904 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1904A00013/Amendments |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could only do so if the ''Arbitration Act'' complied with the requirements of a Chapter III court.

Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ held that any judge of a Chapter III court must be appointed for life, subject only to the removal powers in section 72(ii).&lt;ref name=s72&gt;{{cite web|title=s 72 ''Constitution'' |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013Q00005 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life appointment must be to the particular court, not just to a court.  It followed that the appointment of the President for a term of seven years was contrary to s 72 of the Constitution.

Because the President was invalidly appointed, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth and the provisions conferring upon it the power to enforce its awards were, therefore, invalid.

Isaacs &amp; Rich JJ in their joint judgement held that the only power the Constitution gave the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with respect to judges under Chapter III was to appoint or, in limited circumstances, remove the judge from office. The Governor-General had no power to assign judicial duties.&lt;ref&gt;''WWF v J W Alexander Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/56.pdf (1918) 25 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 434] at p. 468 per Isaacs &amp; Rich JJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith CJ agreed with the majority that a judge must be appointed for life, however his Honour dissented as to the conclusion, holding at p 448 that being the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was not a separate judicial office, as it conferred no additional remuneration nor any personal right or advantage. As such the Governor-General was assigning these judicial duties to one of the Justices of the High Court and it was not an appointment under section 72 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''WWF v J W Alexander Ltd'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1918/56.pdf (1918) 25 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 434] at p. 448 per Griffith CJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate judgments Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ dissented on the basis that s 72 of the Constitution did not require the appointment of a judge for life and that a person who ceased to be a judge on the expiration of that person's term of office was not removed by the Governor-General.

If the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not enforce the award, then who could?  Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that the award could be enforced in any [[Magistrates' court]] exercising [[summary jurisdiction]].

===The exercise of arbitration powers ===
The majority decision that the provisions conferring judicial power to enforce awards were invalid, raised the issue as to whether the invalidity extended to the provisions that allowed the award to be made. That is whether the invalid conferral of judicial power could be severed from the valid conferral of powers of arbitration. Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that these portions of the could be severed and that the rest of the Act was valid.

Barton J dissented on the basis that the intention of parliament was that the two spheres of power "should coexist in the same tribunal as parts of one whole", such that the Act was wholly beyond the powers of the Parliament and that award was invalid and not enforceable.

Griffith CJ held that the entire Act was valid and so upheld the validity of the award.  His Honour however agreed with Barton J that the Act was not severable and that if the enforcement powers were invalid, as found by the majority, then the entire Act was invalid.

== Significance ==
The effect of the decision was to uphold the validity of the award and that it was enforceable, just not in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.  There was thus no immediate practical need to amend the legislation.  Higgins J continued to sit as the President, exercising the arbitral powers until his resignation in 1921.  He was replaced as President by Powers J.

It was not until 1926 that the Parliament passed the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1926 which replaced the President with a Chief Judge who was appointed in the precise terms of s 72 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1926 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1926A00022 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the case is still quoted in relation to the extent of the judicial power,&lt;ref&gt;see for example {{cite AustLII|litigants=[[South Australia v Totani]] |court=HCA |year=2010 |num=39 |parallelcite=(2010) 242 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}} at [60] per [[Robert French|French CJ]].&lt;/ref&gt; the main significance of the decision in relation to the powers of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was subsumed by the decision in the [[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia|Boilermakers case]] in 1956, that no Court could exercise both judicial and arbitral powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] (Boilermakers case) |year=1956 |court=HCA |num=10 |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was referred to by the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney General]] in the second reading speech for the proposed referendum to provide for a retirement age for federal judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act 1977 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A01721 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As long ago as 1918, the High Court held in Alexander's case that section 72 requires that every justice of the High Court and every justice of any other court created by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indeed every magistrate so appointed, shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, be appointed for life. It has, in consequence, been generally accepted that justices of the High Court, and other Federal judges including magistrates, cannot be required to retire on reaching a specified age. This is an unsatisfactory situation. There is an almost universal practice that the holders of public offices retire on attaining a maximum retirement age. The reasons for this practice are well known and they do not need to be spelt out here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22hansard80%2Fhansardr80%2F1977-02-16%2F0153%22 |title=Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Bill 1977 2nd reading speech |house=House of Representatives |date=16 February 1977 |page=147 |speaker=[[Bob Ellicott|Robert Ellicott]] |position=Attorney-General}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subsequent [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Retirement of Judges)|referendum]] was approved by a majority of electors nationwide, and in a majority of states. The constitution now requires appointment for a term expiring on the judge's age, with the consequence that the interpretation favoured by Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ, permitting appointment for a fixed term, is not available unless there is a further constitutional amendment.

'''Winterval''' was a season of public events in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], organised by [[Birmingham City Council]] in each of two consecutive [[winter]]s: first from 20 November to 31 December 1997,&lt;ref name="bcc1997"&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971210073015/http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |url=http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |archivedate=10 December 1997 |accessdate=21 October 2009 |date=19 November 1997 |title=Winterval 1997 |publisher=Birmingham City Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again from mid-October 1998 to mid-January 1999. The intention was to encourage people into the newly rejuvenated city centre,&lt;ref name="guar2006"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities |title=The phoney war on Christmas |first=Oliver |last=Burkeman |work=The Guardian |date=8 December 2006 |location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with [[secular]] and [[religion|religious]] events marking religious and other occasions during the relevant period. The name "Winterval" has since become used in the UK as shorthand for what are presented as attempts to  "[[Rebranding|rebrand]]" Christmas so as not to exclude non-[[Christian]]s.

== 1997 ==
The name "Winterval" was a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[winter]]'' and ''[[festival]]'', coined by the Council's Head of Events, Mike Chubb.&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/winterval-the-truth/ |title=Winterval – the truth |publisher=Pigsonthewing.org.uk |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 he explained:&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"/&gt;

{{quote|Quite simply, as head of events at that time, we needed a vehicle which could cover the marketing of a whole season of events... [[Diwali]] (the Festival of Lights), Christmas Lights switch-on, [[BBC]] [[Children in Need]], [[Aston Hall]] by Candlelight, [[Chinese New Year]], [[New Year's Eve]], etc. Also, a season that included theatre shows, an open-air [[ice-rink]], the Frankfurt Open-air Christmas Market and the Christmas seasonal retail offer. Christmas—called Christmas!—and its celebration lay at the heart of Winterval.

[[Political correctness]] was never the reasoning behind Winterval, but yes, it was intended to be inclusive—which is no bad thing to my mind—and a brand to which other initiatives could be developed as part of the Winterval offer, in order to sell the city at a time when all cities are competing against each other for the seasonal trade.}}

The programme of events in 1997 included theatre and arts events; marking of [[Diwali]]; candlelit tours of [[Aston Hall]]; an outdoor [[ice rink]]; a German-style [[Christmas market]]; [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] in the streets;  and a [[New Year's Eve]] Party.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; The front cover of the promotional brochure used the word "Christmas" three times&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; and featured a photograph of the City's official [[Christmas tree]].&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; Each of its six pages featured the word "Christmas" in text or images.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt;

== 1998 ==

The extended Winterval the following year included: [[Hallowe'en]]; [[Guy Fawkes Night]]; [[Diwali]]; [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]; [[Hanukkah]]; [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]; [[New Year's Eve]]; and [[Chinese New Year]].

Posters were displayed, advertising Christmas events, with the word "Christmas" in large type, and the "Winterval 98" logo only as a footnote.&lt;ref name="Pickles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2010/11/30/local-government-secretary-eric-pickles-attacks-1998-s-winterval-65233-27738640/|title=Local Government secretary Eric Pickles attacks 1998's Winterval|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=2010-11-30|publisher=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church of England]] leaders in Birmingham criticised the 1998 "Winterval" concept. [[Mark Santer]], then [[Bishop of Birmingham]], said in a message to his parishes that he "laughed out loud" when he learned of the concept of Winterval, which he considered to be "a way of not talking about Christmas" and "a well-meaning attempt not to offend". He wondered whether Christianity had been censored.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Winterval gets frosty reception |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Archdeacon]] of [[Aston]] called it "a totally unnecessary example of political correctness to avoid sensitivities people simply do not have".&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; The council responded that "Christmas is the very heart of Winterval", saying that Christmas-themed events were prominent among those included in Winterval, and that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; While the Winterval season was longer than the Christmas season, Christmas was the focus of the relevant portion of Winterval, and a statement from Birmingham Council explained:&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

{{quote|...there was a banner saying Merry Christmas across the front of the council house, Christmas lights, Christmas trees in the main civil squares, regular carol-singing sessions by school choirs, and the Lord Mayor sent a Christmas card with a traditional Christmas scene wishing everyone a Merry Christmas.}}

Neighbouring [[Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council|Solihull council]] invited Birmingham residents desiring a traditional Christmas to go there instead.&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Birmingham City Council did not use the name "Winterval" after the 1998–9 season,&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt; but it persists as shorthand for any secular replacement for Christmas, used both by supporters&lt;ref&gt;

The "Winterval" trope was also debunked by [[Stephen Fry]], in a 2007 episode of the quiz-show ''[[QI]]''.&lt;ref name= ""&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Empire |series=QI  |serieslink=QI |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRlZvn-KiH4 |accessdate=7 October 2017 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 7 December 2007  |season=E |number=12 |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer and law correspondent [[David Allen Green]], and the campaigner [[Inayat Bunglawala]] both included Winterval as an example in evidence to the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press.&lt;ref name="Allen Green"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen Green |first1=David |authorlink1=David Allen Green |title=Witness Statement of David Allen Green |url=http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-David-Allen-Green.pdf |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140122175531/http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Witness-Statement-of-David-Allen-Green.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2014 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowater"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowater|first1=Donna|title=Leveson Inquiry: as it happened January 24|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9037670/Leveson-Inquiry-as-it-happened-January-24.html|accessdate=7 October 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green wrote:&lt;ref name="Allen Green" /&gt;
