'''4K Media Inc.''' is an American production company currently owned by [[Konami]]. It was formerly a subsidiary of [[4Kids Entertainment]] (which later became 4Licensing Corporation) and was responsible for adapting and producing English language [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of Japanese anime, mainly the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise, having dubbed over 800 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yugioh.com/news/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was shut down by 4Kids Entertainment on June 30, 2012, due to continued lack of profitability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=8772949-1054-176461&amp;type=sect&amp;TabIndex=2&amp;companyid=2289&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcompanyid%253d2289|title=Form 10-Q|page= 9|publisher=.brand.edgar-online.com|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the production office was acquired by [[Konami]] and renamed "4K Media" later that year. The company is currently dedicated to the licensing, sales, and distribution of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' brand in the United States, including ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters]]'' and its spinoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/23540.html|title=The 4Kids 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' Transition|publisher=[[ICv2]]|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office produced dubbed episodes of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yugioh.com/news/new-yu-gi-oh-series-yu-gi-oh-arc-v-to-premiere-in-2014|title=New Yu-Gi-Oh! Series ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!

The company was recently granted the rights to manage the gaming properties, [[Bomberman]], [[Contra (series)|Contra]] and [[Frogger]] from Konami. Rounding out their IP portfolio is Rebecca Bonbon, the girl’s anime brand created by [[Yuko Shimizu|Yuko Shimuzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.multichannel.com/pr-feed/4k-media-konami-gaming-titles|title=4K Media licenses three gaming titles from Konami|publisher=multichannel.com|date=June 4, 2018|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akha''' is the language spoken by the [[Akha people]] of southern China ([[Yunnan]] Province), eastern Burma ([[Shan State]]), northern Laos, and [[northern Thailand]].

Western scholars group Akha, [[Hani language|Hani]] and [[Honi language|Honi]] into the [[Hani languages]], treating all three as separate mutually unintelligible, but closely related, languages. The Hani languages are, in turn, classified in the [[Hanoish languages|Hanoish]] branch of [[Loloish languages|Loloish]]. Alternatively, Chinese linguists consider all Hani languages, including Akha, to be dialects of a single language in accordance with China's [[List of ethnic groups in China|official classification of ethnic groups]], which groups all speakers of Hani languages into one ethnicity.

Speakers of Akha live in remote mountainous areas where it has developed into a wide-ranging dialect continuum. Dialects from villages separated by as little as ten kilometers may show marked differences. The isolated nature of Akha communities has also resulted in several villages with divergent dialects. Dialects from extreme ends of the continuum and the more divergent dialects are mutually unintelligible.&lt;ref name=Katsura&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katsura|first1=M.|title=Phonemes of the Alu Dialect of Akha|journal=Papers in Southeast Asian Linguistics No.3|date=1973|volume=3|issue=3|pages=35–54|publisher=Pacific Linguistics, the Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The Akha dialect spoken in Alu village, 55 kilometers northwest of [[Chiang Rai (city)|Chiang Rai]] city in [[Chiang Rai Province]], Thailand is described below. Katsura conducted his study in during the late 1960s. With a population of 400 it was, at the time, one of the largest Akha villages in Northern Thailand and was still growing as a result of cross-border migration from Burma. The Akha in Alu spoke no [[Thai language|Standard Thai]] and communicated with outsiders using either [[Lahu language|Lahu Na]] or [[Shan language|Shan]].

The Alu dialect has 23 or 24 consonants depending on how the [[syllabic consonant|syllabic nasal]] is analyzed. The {{IPA|/m̩/}}, realized variously as {{IPA|[ˀm]}} or {{IPA|[m̥]}}, can be analyzed as a separate single consonant or as sequences of /ʔm/ and /hm/. Katsura chose the latter but listed the /m/ component of the syllabic consonant with the vowels.&lt;ref name=Katsura/&gt;

&lt;small&gt;*&lt;/small&gt;Akha {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is often described as glottal "tension" rather than a true stop

Any consonant may begin a syllable, but native Akha syllables which don't end in a vowel may only [[Syllable#Coda|end]] in either -m or -ɔŋ. A few loan words have been noted that end in -aŋ or -aj. In the case of a nasal coda, some vowels become [[Nasal vowel|nasalized]]. Alu Akha distinguishes ten vowel qualities, contrasting rounded and unrounded back vowels at three heights while only the mid front vowels contrast roundness.

===China===
In [[Jinghong]] City and [[Menghai County]], the two major [[Hani people|Hani]] subgroups are Jiuwei 鸠为 and Jizuo 吉坐.&lt;ref&gt;云南省编辑委员会编. 2009. "景洪县哈尼族社会调查." In 哈尼族社会历史调查, p.116-119. 民族出版社. {{ISBN|9787105087754}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jizuo 吉坐 are the largest Hani ethnic subgroup in Jinghong.

The Jiuwei claim to have migrated from [[Honghe County|Honghe]] and [[Mojiang County|Mojiang]]. The Jiuwei live in various villages in Jinghong, including:
*Mengbozhai 勐波寨, Menghan Town 勐罕寨, Jinghong City
*Agupu 阿古普 (also called Manwoke 曼窝科) in Leiwu 类吴, Mengsong Township 勐宋, Jinghong City
*Napazhai 那帕寨 in Damenglong 大勐笼, Jinghong City
*Baiya village 拜牙村 in Menghun 勐混, Menghai County (The [[Akeu language|Ake]] 阿克 subgroup lives in Lougu 楼固村, located in Menghun 勐混 as well.)
*Babingzhai 坝丙寨, Xidingshan 西定山, Menghai County

There are also ethnic Hani that are locally called Aini 爱尼 living in 7 villages on Nanlin Mountain 南林山 of southwestern [[Jinghong]], namely Manbage 曼八阁, Manjinglong 曼景龙, Manjingnan 曼景囡, Mangudu 曼固独, Manbaqi 曼把奇, Manbasan 曼巴伞, and Manjingmai 曼景卖.&lt;ref&gt;云南省编辑委员会编. 2009.

All [[vertebrate]]s (including humans) have the same basic [[body plan]]{{snd}} they are strictly [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]] in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=1}} That is, they have mirror-image left and right halves if divided down the middle.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003"&gt;Hickman, C. P., Jr., Roberts, L. S. and Larson, A. ''Animal Diversity''. McGraw-Hill 2003 {{ISBN|0-07-234903-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other ([[invertebrate]]) organisms as well.

While these terms are standardized within specific fields of [[biology]], there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic, differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that, to some extent, still separates the [[#Humans|terminology of human anatomy]] from that used in the study of various other zoological categories.

==Introduction==
[[File:1303 Human Neuroaxis.jpg|thumbnail|300px|&lt;center&gt;Because of differences in the way humans and other animals are structured, different terms are used according to the [[neuraxis]] and whether an animal is a [[vertebrate]] or [[invertebrate]].&lt;/center&gt;]]

Standardized [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[zoology|zoological]] terms of location have been developed, usually based on [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.&lt;ref name="Craigie1838"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Craigie |title=Elements of Anatomy, General, Special, and Comparative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lA82AQAAMAAJ |year=1838 |publisher=A. and C. Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vertebrate]]s and ''[[Craniata]]'' share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.

For humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. For one reason, this is because humans have a different [[neuraxis]] and, unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the [[standard anatomical position]]. Thus what is on "top" of a human is the [[head]], whereas the "top" of a dog may be its back, and the "top" of a [[flounder]] could refer to either its left or its right side.

For [[invertebrate]]s, standard application of locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when the differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] are so radical that common concepts are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]]. In these species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry (if any).

===Standard anatomical position===
{{Main|Standard anatomical position}}
[[File:Radiate Oral-aboral Axes.JPG|thumbnail|A [[jellyfish]] of the ''[[Chrysaora]]'' species. Like other animals, its [[appendage]]s move, and in this image are not in a standard anatomical position. In anatomical position, the proximodistal axis (labelled) is straight, and the point labelled "distal end" neither to the left or the right of the jellyfish's main axis.]]
Because [[animal]]s can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because [[appendage]]s like [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[tentacle]]s can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its [[standard anatomical position]]. All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.

In humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to be [[Status quo bias|too well established to be worth changing]].

=== Combined terms ===
[[File:Many-banded krait (2).JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Dorsolateral flattening in the anatomy of a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross-section.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Many anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, "anterolateral" indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the [[pectoralis major]] muscle). In [[radiology]], an [[X-ray]] image may be said to be "anteroposterior", indicating that the beam of X-rays pass from their source to patient's [[anterior]] body wall through the body to exit through [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] body wall.&lt;ref name=dorland&gt;''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers''. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definite limit to the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an "o" or an "i" is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral might be called a "dorsolateral" view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of an organ or [[Habit (biology)|habitus]] of an animal such as many of the [[Platyhelminthes]], one might speak of it as "dorsiventrally" flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as [[ocean sunfish]].

Where desirable three or more terms may be [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] or [[Concatenation|concatenated]], as in "anteriodorsolateral". Such terms sometimes used to be hyphenated, but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen. There is however little basis for any strict rule to interfere with choice of convenience in such usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dorsolateral |title=dorsolateral |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planes===
{{Main|Anatomical plane}}
[[File:BodyPlanes.jpg|thumb|right|299px|Anatomical planes in a human]]

Three basic reference planes are used to describe location.

* The '''[[sagittal plane]]''' is a plane parallel to the [[sagittal suture]]. All other sagittal planes (referred to as ''parasagittal planes'') are parallel to it. It is also known as a "longitudinal plane".{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground. 
* The '''median plane''' or '''midsagittal plane''' is in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} This passes through the [[head]], [[spinal cord]], [[navel]], and, in many animals, the [[tail]].{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The term "median plane" can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.
* The '''[[frontal plane]]''' or '''coronal plane''' divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or posterior and anterior) portions. For post-[[embryo]]nic humans a [[coronal plane]] is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A ''longitudinal plane'' is any plane perpendicular to the transverse plane. The [[coronal plane]] and the [[sagittal plane]] are examples of ''longitudinal planes''.
* A '''[[transverse plane]]''', also known as a ''cross-section'', divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.

In human anatomy:
* A '''transverse''' (also known as '''horizontal''') plane is an X-Z plane, parallel to the ground, which (in humans) separates the [[#Directions: human anatomy|superior]] from the [[#Directions: human anatomy|inferior]] or, put another way, the head from the feet.
* A '''coronal''' (also known as '''frontal''') plane is a X-Y plane, [[perpendicular]] to the ground, which (in humans) separates the anterior from the posterior, the front from the back, the ventral from the dorsal.

To begin with, distinct, polar-opposite ends of the [[organism]] are chosen. By definition, each pair of opposite points defines an '''[[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis]]'''. In a bilaterally symmetrical organism, there are 6 polar opposite points, giving three axes that intersect at right angles{{snd}} the x, y, and z axes familiar from three-dimensional geometry.

The terms "intermediate", "ipsilateral", "contralateral", "superficial", and "deep", while indicating directions, are relative terms and thus do not properly define fixed anatomical axes. Also, while the "rostrocaudal" and anteroposterior directionality are equivalent in a significant portion of the human body, they are different directions in other parts of the body.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Main terms==

===Superior and inferior===
{{Anchor|superior|inferior}}
In anatomical terminology '''superior''' ({{ety|la||above}}) is used to refer to what is above something, and '''inferior''' ({{ety|la||below}}) to what is below it. For example, in the [[anatomical position]] the most superior part of the human body is the head, and the most inferior is the feet.&lt;ref name="Marieb1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marieb |first=E. N. |title=Human Anatomy and Physiology |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8053-4281-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tortora2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tortora |first=G. J. |last2=Derrickson |first2=B. |title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68934-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second example, in humans the [[neck]] is superior to the [[chest]] but inferior to the [[head]].

===Anterior and posterior===
{{Redirect|Anterior}}&lt;!-- [[Posterior]] is a dab page, not redirect --&gt;
'''Anterior''' refers to what is in front ({{ety|la|ante}}, meaning "before") and  '''posterior''', what is to the back of the subject ({{ety|la|post}}, meaning "after").{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} For example, in a dog the [[nose]] is anterior to the eyes and the [[tail]] is considered the most posterior part; in many [[fish]] the [[gill]] openings are posterior to the eyes, but anterior to the tail.

===Medial and lateral===
{{Anchor|medial|median|lateral}}
'''Lateral''' ({{ety|la|lateralis|to the side}}) refers to the sides of an animal, as in "left lateral" and "right lateral". The term '''medial''' ({{ety|la|medius|middle}}) is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the "median plane".&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt; For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head though the navel and going between the legs— the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be "right medial" and "left medial".

The terms "left" and "right" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives ({{lang-la|dexter}}; "right", {{lang-la|sinister}}; "left"). However, as left and right sides are [[mirror images]], using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the [[dorsal fin]] of a [[dolphin]] is "right of" the left [[pectoral fin]], but is "left of" the right [[eye]], but much easier and clearer to say "the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins".

Derived terms include:

* '''Contralateral''' ({{ety|la|contra|against}}): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., [[Contralateral brain|contralateral side of the forebrain]]. 
* '''Ipsilateral''' ({{ety|la|ipse|same}}): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.
* '''Bilateral''' ({{ety|la|bis|twice}}): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (removal of testes on both sides of the body's axis) is surgical [[castration]].
* '''Unilateral''' ({{ety|la|unus|one}}): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral [[paresis]] is [[hemiparesis]].

[[Varus deformity|Varus]] and [[valgus deformity|valgus]] correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.

===Proximal and distal===
{{Redirect2|Proximal|distal|the linguistic terms|Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|the dental terms|Glossary of dentistry}}
{{Anchor|proximal|distal}}
[[File:Blausen 0019 AnatomicalDirectionalReferences.png|thumb|350px|Anatomical directional reference]]
The terms '''proximal''' ({{ety|la|proximus|nearest}}) and '''distal''' ({{ety|la|distare|to stand away from}}) are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.

These terms are frequently used when describing [[appendage]]s such as [[fins]], [[tentacle]]s, [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or any structure that extends that can potentially move separately from the main body. Although the direction indicated by "proximal" and "distal" is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Do Distal and Proximal Mean? |website=The Survival Doctor |url=http://www.thesurvivaldoctor.com/2011/10/04/what-do-distal-and-proximal-mean/ |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=Chemistry, design, and structure-activity relationship of cocaine antagonists.|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=8 March 2000|volume=100|issue=3|pages=925–1024|pmid=11749256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and peripheral ===
'''Central''' and '''peripheral''' are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between [[Central nervous system|central-]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include ''Central and peripheral circadian clocks'',&lt;ref&gt;Mohawk JA1, Green CB, Takahashi JS. Central and peripheral circadian clocks in mammals. Annu Rev Neurosci. 2012; 35:445–62. {{doi|10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153128}}. Epub 2012 Apr 5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''central versus peripheral vision''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam M. Larson; Lester C. Loschky. The contributions of central versus peripheral vision to scene gist recognition. Journal of Vision September 2009, Vol. 9, 6. {{doi|10.1167/9.10.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superficial and deep===
{{Anchor|superficial|deep}}
These two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.

'''Deep''' ({{ety|ang}}) refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the [[external oblique muscle]] of the abdomen is deep to the skin. "Deep" is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from [[Old English]] rather than Latin – the anglicised Latin term would have been "profound" ({{ety|la|profundus|due to depth}}).

'''Superficial''' ({{ety|la|superficies|surface}}) refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in [[skin]] the [[epidermis]] is superficial to the [[subcutis]].

===Dorsal and ventral===
These two terms, used in anatomy and [[embryology]], refer to back (''dorsal'') and front or belly (''ventral'') of an organism.

The '''dorsal''' ({{ety|la|dorsum|back}}) surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc="dorsal/ventral axis specification" (GO:0009950)}}

The '''ventral''' ({{ety|la|venter|belly}}) surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc="dorsal/ventral axis specification" (GO:0009950)}}

For example, in a fish the [[pectoral fins]] are dorsal to the [[anal fin]], but ventral to the [[dorsal fin]].

===Cranial and caudal===
{{Anchor|caudal|cranial|rostral}}
[[File:Rostralcaudal.svg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;In the human skull the terms ''rostral'' and ''caudal'' are adapted to the curved [[neuraxis]] of [[Hominidae]]]]

Specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:

* '''Rostral''' ({{ety|la|rostrum|beak, nose}}), meaning situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.
* '''Cranial''' ({{ety|el|κρανίον|skull}}) or '''cephalic''' ({{ety|el|κεφαλή|head}}).&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003"/&gt; 
* '''Caudal''' ({{ety|la|cauda|tail}}) is used to describe how close something is to the end{{when defined as|date=October 2018}} of an organism,

For example, in the [[horse]], the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.

These terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; In humans, "cranial" and "cephalic" are used to refer to the skull, with "cranial" being used more commonly. The term "rostral" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term "caudal" is only occasionally used in human anatomy.&lt;ref name="Tortora2006"/&gt;  This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus the "rostrocaudal axis" refers to a C shape (see image).

==Other terms and special cases==

===Anatomical landmarks===
The location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different [[anatomical landmark]]s.

Structures may be described as being at the level of a specific [[spinal vertebrae|spinal vertebra]], depending on the section of the [[vertebral column]] the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth [[cervical vertebra]] may be abbreviated as "C4", at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra]] "T4", and at the level of the third [[lumbar vertebra]] "L3". Because the [[sacrum]] and coccyx are fused,  they are not often used to provide location.

References may also take origin from  [[superficial anatomy]], made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the [[anterior superior iliac spine]], the [[medial malleolus]] or the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]].

[[List of anatomical lines|Anatomical lines]], theoretical lines drawn through structures, are also used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the [[cardiac examination|cardiac exam]] in medicine to feel the [[apex beat]] of the [[heart]].

===Mouth and teeth===
{{Main|Dental terminology}}
Fields such as [[osteology]], [[palaeontology]] and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like "anterior" or "lateral" become ambiguous.&lt;ref name="Folkens2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pieter A. Folkens|title=Human Osteology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrLL-X5bg_0C&amp;pg=PA558|year=2000|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-746612-5|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithDodson2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=J. B. |last2=Dodson |first2=P. |year=2003 |title=A proposal for a standard terminology of anatomical notation and orientation in fossil vertebrate dentitions |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2003)23[1:APFAST]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/ees_papers/34 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "distal" and "proximal" are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the [[mandibular symphysis]]. Terms used to describe structures include "buccal" ({{ety|la|bucca|cheek}}) and "palatal" ({{ety|la}}) referring to structures close to the [[cheek]] and [[hard palate]] respectively.

===Hands and feet===
[[Image:Hand Directional Axes.JPG|thumb|right|Anatomical terms used to describe a human hand]]

Several anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.

For improved clarity, the directional term '''palmar''' ({{ety|la|palma|palm of the hand}}) is usually used to describe the front of the hand, and '''dorsal''' is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a [[dog]]'s [[paw]] is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The [[palmar fascia]] is palmar to the [[tendon]]s of muscles which flex the fingers, and the [[dorsal venous arch]] is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.

'''Volar''' can also be used to refer to the underside of the [[hand#Areas|palm]] or [[sole (foot)|sole]], which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as ''[[wikt:palmar#Adjective|palmar]]'' and ''[[wikt:plantar#Adjective|plantar]]''. For example, volar pads are those on the underside of hands, fingers, feet, and toes.

These terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the "anterior" or "posterior" surface{{snd}} "anterior" can be used to describe the [[Hand|palm]] of the hand, and "posterior" can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can [[pronate]] and [[supinate]].

Similarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the [[radius (bone)|radius]] are '''radial''', structures closer to the [[ulna]] are '''ulnar''', and structures relating to both bones are referred to as '''radioulnar'''. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the [[tibia]] (shinbone) are '''tibial''' and structures near the [[fibula]] are '''fibular''' (or '''peroneal''').

===Rotational direction===
Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion ([[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|translation]]) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]] as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes.

'''Anteversion''' and '''retroversion''' are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body) respectively, relative to some datum position. The terms also describe the positioning of surgical implants, such as in [[arthroplasty]].

* '''Anteversion''' refers to an anatomical structure being tilted further ''forward'' than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, there may be a need to measure the anteversion of the neck of a bone such as a femur.&lt;ref&gt;http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/02841858909177461?journalCode=ard Evaluation of Three Methods for Measurement of Femoral Neck Anteversion Femoral neck anteversion, definition, measuring methods and errors 1989, Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 69–73 by Arne Høiseth1†, O. Reikerås1 and E. Fønstelien&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a woman's [[uterus]] typically is anteverted, tilted slightly ''forward''. A misaligned [[pelvis]] may be anteverted, that is to say tilted ''forward'' to some relevant degree.
* '''Retroversion''' is rotation around the same axis as that of anteversion, but in the opposite sense, that is to say, tilting ''back''. A structure so affected is described as being [[retroverted uterus|retroverted]]. As with anteversion, retroversion is a completely general term and can apply to a backward tilting of such hard structures as bones, soft organs such as uteri, or surgical implants.

===Other directional terms===
Several other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:
* '''Axial''' ({{ety|la|axis|axle}}): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, "abaxial" and "adaxial", refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively
* '''Parietal''' ({{ety|la|paries|wall}}): pertaining to the wall of a body cavity. For example, the [[parietal peritoneum]] is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the [[parietal bone]] of the skull or associated structures.
* '''Posteromedial''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after||medius|middle}}): situated towards the middle of the posterior surface.
* '''Posterosuperior''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after}} and superior): situated towards the upper part of the posterior surface.
* '''Terminal''' ({{ety|la|terminus|boundary or end}}) at the extremity of a (usually projecting) structure, as in "...an antenna with a terminal sensory hair".
* '''Visceral''' and ''viscus'' ({{ety|la|viscera|internal organs}}): associated with organs ''within'' the body's cavities. For example, the [[stomach]] is covered with a lining called the visceral [[peritoneum]] as opposed to the parietal pertoneum. Viscus can also be used to mean "organ". For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity.

===Prefixes, suffixes, and other modifiers===
Directional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.

Prefixes
* '''Sub-''' ({{ety|la|sub|preposition beneath, close to, nearly etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, qualifies terms in various senses. Consider ''subcutaneous'' as meaning beneath the skin, ''subterminal'' meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or ''"more-or-less"''; for instance ''subglobular'' means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-"
* '''Hypo-''' ({{ety|grc|ὑπό|under}}) Like "sub" in various senses as in ''hypolingual nerve'' beneath the tongue, or ''hypodermal'' fat beneath the skin 
* '''Infra-''' ({{ety|la|infra|preposition beneath, below etc}}) Similar to "sub"; a direct opposite to ''super-'' and ''supra-'', as in ''[[Infratemporal space]]'' or ''[[wikt:infraorbital|infraorbital]]''. 
* '''Inter-''' ({{ety|la|inter|between}}): between two other structures. For example, the [[navel]] is ''intermediate'' to the left arm and the contralateral (right) leg. The ''[[intercostal muscle]]s run between the ribs.
* '''Super-'' or ''Supra-''' ({{ety|la|super, supra|above, on top of, beyond etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, as in ''[[superciliary arches]]'' or ''[[wikt:supraorbital|supraorbital]]''

Suffixes
* '''-ad''' ({{ety|la|''ad''|towards or up to}})
Commonly when, for example, one anatomical feature is nearer to something than another, one may use an expression such as "nearer the distal end" or "distal to". However, an unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix ''-ad'', meaning "towards", or sometimes "to". {{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} So for example, "''distad''" means "in the distal direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction". The suffix may be used very widely, as in the following examples: anteriad (towards the anterior), apicad (towards the apex), basad (towards the basal end), caudad, centrad, cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, dextrad, dextrocaudad, dextrocephalad, distad, dorsad, ectad (towards the ectal, or exterior, direction), entad (towards the interior), laterad, mediad, mesad, neurad, orad, posteriad, proximad, rostrad, sinistrad, sinistrocaudad, sinistrocephalad, ventrad''.''&lt;ref name= "GGHDHD"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordh |first=Gordon |last2=Headrick |first2=David H |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |publisher=CABI |year=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1845935429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific animals and other organisms==
The large variety of [[body plan|body shapes]] present in invertebrates presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, literally meaning "near" refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, literally meaning "standing away from" is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the [[body plan]] of the organism.

For example, especially in organisms without distinct heads for reasons of broader applicability, "anterior" is usually preferred.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002"&gt;Miller, S. A. ''General Zoology Laboratory Manual'' McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-252837-0}} and {{ISBN|0-07-243559-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004"&gt;Ruppert, E. E., Fox, R. S. and Barnes, R. D. ''Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach''. Thomson, Belmont, 2004. {{ISBN|0-03-025982-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans===
As humans are approximately [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]] organisms,{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=1}} anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for vertebrates and other members of the taxonomic group [[Bilateria]]. However, for historical and other reasons, standard human directional terminology has several differences from that used for other bilaterally symmetrical organisms.

The terms of zootomy and anatomy came into use at a time when all scientific communication took place in Latin. In their original Latin forms the respective meanings of "anterior" and "posterior" are ''in front of'' (or ''before'') and ''behind'' (or ''after''), those of "dorsal" and "ventral" are ''toward the spine'' and ''toward the belly'', and those of "superior" and "inferior" are ''above'' and ''below''.

Humans, however, have the rare property of having an upright torso. This makes their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same, and the inferior/superior directions necessary.&lt;ref name= "Latin Tucker"&gt;{{cite book | author= Tucker, T. G.| title = A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin | publisher = Max Niemeyer Verlag | location = Halle (Saale)| year = 1931 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to their environment. So while "up" might refer to the direction of a standing human's head, the same term ("up") might be used to refer to the direction of the belly of a [[supine position|supine]] human. It is also necessary to employ some specific anatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For example, while the ears would be ''superior'' to (above) the shoulders in a human, this fails when describing the [[armadillo]], where the shoulders are above the ears. Thus, in [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] terminology, the ears would be ''cranial'' to (i.e., "toward the head from") the shoulders in the armadillo, the [[dog]], the [[kangaroo]], or any other [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is considered ''anterior'' to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails for the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly would be ''ventral'' ("toward the abdomen") in all vertebrates.

While it would be possible to introduce a system of axes that is completely consistent between humans and other vertebrates by having two separate pairs of axes, one used exclusively for the head (e.g., anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) and the other exclusively for the torso (e.g., dorsal/ventral and caudal/rostral, or "toward the tail"/"toward the beak"), doing so would require the renaming of many anatomical structures.

===Asymmetrical and spherical organisms===
[[Image:Asymmetrical and Spherical.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Asymmetrical and spherical [[body plan|body shapes]]. (a) An organism with an asymmetrical, amoeboid, body plan (''Amoeba proteus''{{snd}} an amoeba). (b) An organism with a spherical body plan (''Actinophrys sol''{{snd}} a [[heliozoan]]).]]
In organisms with a changeable shape, such as [[amoeboid]] organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in [[Spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as ''superficial'' and ''deep'', or sometimes ''proximal'' and ''distal'', are usefully descriptive.
[[Image:Longitudinal Diatom (Labelled).JPG|thumb|right|Four individuals of ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'', a [[diatom]] with a fixed elongated shape.]]

===Elongated organisms===
In organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The ''long'' or ''longitudinal axis'' is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular ''transverse axis'' can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are [[planktonic]] (free-swimming) [[protists]], and are nearly always viewed on [[microscope slide]]s, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal [[cytostome]] or other unique structure is present.&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt;

[[Image:Labelled Ciliates.JPG|thumb|left|Organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct. (''Paramecium caudatum'', above, and ''[[Stentor roeselii]]'', below.)]]

Some elongated [[protists]] have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the [[cytostome]] in ''[[Paramecium]]'' or ''[[Stentor]]''), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism's [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] (such as the end with the [[flagellum]] in ''[[Euglena]]''), is normally designated as the '''anterior''' end. The opposite end then becomes the '''posterior end'''.&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always [[planktonic]] (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] (normally attached to a surface).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Origin of Phyla |last=Valentine |first=James W. |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-84548-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Venus Flower Basket (sponge-labelled).JPG|thumb|right|A cluster of [[Venus' Flower Basket|''Euplectella aspergillum'' sponges (Venus flower baskets)]], showing the apical-basal axes.]]

{{Anchor|apical}}
Organisms that are attached to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], such as [[Porifera|sponges]], or some [[Protista|animal-like protists]] also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the '''basal end''' ({{ety|la|basis|support/foundation}}), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the '''apical end''' ({{ety|la|apex|peak/tip}}).

===Radially symmetrical organisms===
[[Radial symmetry|Radially symmetrical organisms]] include those in the group [[Radiata]]{{snd}} primarily [[Cnidaria|jellyfish, sea anemones and corals]] and the [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]].&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Adult [[Echinodermata|echinoderms]], such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|discrete rotational]] [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]]. Echinoderm [[larva]]e are not included, since they are [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]].&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Radially symmetrical organisms always have one distinctive axis.

[[Cnidaria]]ns (jellyfish, sea anemones and corals) have an incomplete digestive system, meaning that one end of the organism has a mouth, and the opposite end has no opening from the gut (coelenteron).&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; For this reason, the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the '''oral end''' ({{ety|la|ōrālis|of the mouth}}), and the opposite surface is the '''aboral end''' ({{ety|la|ab-|away from}}).

Unlike vertebrates, cnidarians have no other distinctive axes. "Lateral", "dorsal", and "ventral" have no meaning in such organisms, and all can be replaced by the generic term '''peripheral''' ({{ety|grc|περιφέρεια|circumference}}). '''Medial''' can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible '''radial axes''' and '''medio-peripheral''' (half-) '''axes'''. However, it is noteworthy that some biradially symmetrical [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] do have distinct "tentacular" and "pharyngeal" axes&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert ''et al.'' (2004), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and are thus anatomically equivalent to [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetrical]] animals.

As with vertebrates, [[appendage]]s that move independently of the body ([[tentacles]] in [[cnidaria]]ns and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]]), have a definite ''proximodistal axis'' (Fig. 9).

===Spiders===
{{See also|Glossary of spider terms|Spider anatomy}}
Two specialized terms are useful in describing views of [[arachnid]] legs and [[pedipalp]]s. '''Prolateral''' refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid's body. '''Retrolateral''' refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid's body.&lt;ref name="Kaston1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaston|first=B.J.|author-link=B. J. Kaston|title=How to Know the Spiders|edition=3rd|year=1972|page=19|publisher=W.C. Brown Co.|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-0-697-04899-8 |oclc=668250654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the unusual nature and positions of the eyes of the [[Spider|Araneae]] (spiders), and their importance in taxonomy, evolution and anatomy, special terminology with associated abbreviations has become established in arachnology. Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the [[carapace]] of the [[prosoma]], and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other [[taxon|taxa]]. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly [[troglobite]]s) have no functional eyes at all.

In what is seen as the likeliest ancestral arrangement of the eyes of the Araneae, there are two roughly parallel, horizontal, symmetrical, transverse rows of eyes, each containing two symmetrically placed pairs, respectively called: anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).

As a rule it is not difficult to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.

[[File:I Ain't Got Nobody (1932).webm|thumb|thumbtime=5:53|start=5:48|end=6:27|upright=1.5|[[The Mills Brothers]] sing "[[I Ain't Got Nobody]]" with the bouncing ball in 1932]]
The '''bouncing ball''' is a device used in [[Film|motion picture films]] and [[video recording]]s to visually indicate the [[rhythm]] of a [[song]], helping audiences to sing along with live or prerecorded music. As the song's [[lyrics]] are displayed on the screen, an [[Animation|animated]] ball bounces across the top of the words, landing on each [[syllable]] when it is to be sung.

The bouncing ball is mainly used for English language songs in video recordings; however, in Japan, a similar device is used where the text changes color as it is sung, just like in [[karaoke]].

== History ==

The bouncing ball technique was invented by [[Max Fleischer]] originally for the "[[Ko-Ko]]" ''[[Song Car-Tunes]]'' (1924–1927) and revised in 1929 as Screen Songs (1929–1938) for Paramount. It was introduced in March 1924 with the film ''[[Come Take a Trip in my Airship]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pointer|2016|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early ''Song Car-Tunes'' such as "[[Margie (song)|Margie]]" and [[Irving Berlin]]'s "When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'" the ball is animated, looking like a beach ball clumsily hitting the words without precise timing. This awkwardness was eliminated by filming the ball live over printed lyrics, and the ball attached to a black baton that "bounced" a white disc over the tops of the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pointer|2016|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was captured on high-contrast film that rendered the stick invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maltin|1980|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball would usually appear as white-on-black, though sometimes the ball and lyrics would be superimposed over (darkened) still drawings or photographs or even live-action footage.

While the Screen Song series started out employing standard songs such as "[[Yankee Doodle Boy]]", "[[My Pony Boy]]", and "[[Yes! We Have No Bananas]]", the series soon integrated live action appearances of celebrities of Broadway, radio, and recordings. Many of these Screen Songs were planned as promotions for live theatrical appearances. This was part of a new marketing plan launched by Paramount for the 1930–1931 season. [[Rudy Vallee]] was the first on-screen celebrity, appearing in "[[Betty Co-Ed]]" (1931), and returned in "Kitty From Kansas City" (1931). He also appeared in a cameo in "Rudy Vallee Melodies" (1932). Other celebrities included [[Arthur Tracy]] in "Russian Lullaby" (1931) and "Romantic Melodies" (1932), [[Ethel Merman]] in "Let Me Call you Sweetheart" (1932), "You Try Somebody Else" (1932), "[[Time on My Hands (song)|Time on my Hands]]" (1932), and "Song Shopping" (1933).

The [[Mills Brothers]] appeared in three Screen Songs: "[[I Ain't Got Nobody]]" (1932), "[[Dinah]]" (1933), and "When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba" (1933). [[Lillian Roth]] appeared in "Down Among the Sugar Cane" (1932) and "[[Ain't She Sweet]]" (1933).

[[Rose Marie]] (later famous from television's [[Dick Van Dyke Show]]) was an established child singer in the late 1920s and made a number of early Vitaphone shorts for [[Warner Brothers]] billed as "Baby Rose Marie". She appeared in "Sing Babies, Sing" (1933). Radio comedians [[Stoopnagle and Budd]] appeared in the zany ''Stoopnocracy'' that also featured 12-year-old Harold Nicholas of the famous [[Nicholas Brothers]] Dance Team as a baby Cab Calloway.

By 1935, the Screen Songs series capitalized on the new Swing Era and featured appearances by a number of the Big Band Orchestras. This series of films was more commercially oriented with the films being booked a week in advance of live appearances of each orchestra. From 1935 to 1938, the "[[Screen Songs]]" featured the orchestras of Abe Lyman, Richard Huber, Hal Kemp, Vincent Lopez, Joe Reichman, Dick Stable, Nat Brandywine, Hal King, Shep Fields, Gus Arnheim, Jay Freeman, Jerry Baline, Bert Block, Frank Dailey, and Jimmy Dorsey. Although a popular attraction, the Screen Songs series was retired after nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pointer|2016|pp=105&amp;ndash;106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Screen Songs were revived in 1945 starting with "When G.I. Johnny Comes Home" and continued into the early 1950s using an animated ball with a bounce cycle rendered on Pan cells [[cel animation]]. Some modern video editing programs offer a "bouncing ball" feature.  Others as in the Karaoke achieve the same effect by highlighting each displayed syllable as it is sung. An attempt was made to revive the series in 1963 with "Hobo's Holiday", using a more modern [[Folk Music]] style. Meanwhile, in the United States, younger generations of children continued to be familiar with the cartoons from television rebroadcasts into the 1970s, home video collections, and are now present on the Internet at sites such as YouTube and Daily Motion.

'''Brian Skyrms''' (born 1938) is a Distinguished Professor of [[Logic]] and [[Philosophy of Science]] and [[Economics]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and a Professor of Philosophy at [[Stanford University]].  He has worked on problems in the philosophy of science, causation, [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], and the foundations of [[probability]].  Most recently, his work has focused on the evolution of [[social norms]] using [[evolutionary game theory]].  His two recent books ''Evolution of the Social Contract'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Skyrms|title=Evolution of the Social Contract|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BENfDAAAQBAJ|date= 2014|origyear=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-43428-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Stag Hunt'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Skyrms|title=The Stag Hunt and the Evolution of Social Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JykQZ9-wkcAC|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53392-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are both on this topic.  These books use arguments and examples from evolutionary game theory to cover topics of interest to [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of social science]], [[philosophy of language]], and the [[philosophy of biology]].

Skyrms is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] and one of two living philosophers (along with [[Allan Gibbard]]) to be elected a Fellow of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Broadcast quality''' is a term stemming from [[Videotape#Quad|quad videotape]] to denote the quality achieved by [[professional video camera]]s and [[time base corrector]]s (TBC) used for [[broadcast television]], usually in [[standard definition]]. As the standards for [[commercial television]] broadcasts have changed from [[analog television]] using [[analog video]] to [[digital television]] using [[digital video]], the term has generally fallen out of use.&lt;ref name="BQ"&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/mag/broadcasting_broadcast_quality/ Broadcast Engineering - Broadcast quality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127080614/http://broadcastengineering.com/mag/broadcasting_broadcast_quality/ |date=November 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.adobe.com/genesisproject/2007/08/what_is_broadcast_quality.html The Genesis Project - What is broadcast quality?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers have used it to describe both [[professional]] and [[prosumer]] or "Semi-Professional" devices. A camera with the minimum requirements typically being the inclusion of three [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] and relatively low-[[Video compression|compression]] [[analog recording]] or [[Digital data|digital]] recording capability with little or no [[chroma subsampling]], and the ability to be [[genlock]]ed. The advantages of three CCDs include better color definition in shadows, better overall low-light sensitivity, and reduced [[noise]] when compared to single-CCD systems.  With continuing improvements in [[image sensor]]s, [[Optical resolution|resolution]], [[recording media]], and [[codec]]s, by 2006 the term no longer carried much weight in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="BQ"/&gt;

The term is also used in its literal sense in [[broadcasting]] jargon in judging the fitness of audio or video for broadcast.

'''Caddo''' is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] language, the traditional language of the [[Caddo|Caddo Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Linguist List&lt;/ref&gt; It is critically endangered, with no exclusively Caddo-speaking community and only 25 speakers as of 2009 who acquired the language as children outside school instruction.&lt;ref&gt;SIL International, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Caddo has several mutually intelligible dialects. The most commonly used dialects are Hasinai and Hainai; others include Kadohadacho, Natchitoches and Yatasi.&lt;ref&gt;Caddo Nation, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic connections==
Caddo is linguistically related to the members of the Northern Caddoan language family; these include the Pawnee-Kitsai (Keechi) languages ([[Arikara language|Arikara]], [[Kitsai language|Kitsai]], and [[Pawnee language|Pawnee]]) and the [[Wichita language|Wichita]] language. Kitsai is now extinct, and Pawnee, Arikara, and Wichita each have fewer surviving speakers than Caddo does.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Native Languages of the Americas, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another language, [[Adai people|Adai]], is postulated to have been a Caddoan language while it was extant, but because of scarce resources and the language's extinct status, this connection is not conclusive, and Adai is generally considered a language isolate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Use and language revitalization efforts ==
The Caddo Nation is making a concentrated effort to save the Caddo language. The Kiwat Hasinay ('Caddo Home') foundation, located at the tribal home of Binger, Oklahoma, offers regular Caddo language classes, in addition to creating dictionaries, phrase books, and other Caddo language resources. They have also made a long-term project of trying to record and digitally archive Caddoan oral traditions, which are an important part of Caddo culture.&lt;ref&gt;Kiwat Hasinay Foundation, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, the Caddo Nation teaches weekly language classes; language CDs, a coloring book, and an online learning website are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Caddo has 19 contrastive consonants, a normal-sized consonant inventory. It is somewhat unusual in that it lacks [[lateral consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World Atlas of Language Structures Online&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA symbols for the consonants of Caddo are given below:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! colspan="2" rowspan="2" |

Caddo also features contrastive [[gemination]] of consonants, which is generally indicated in orthography by a double letter: /nɑ́ttih/ "woman."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Vowels===
Caddo has three contrastive vowel qualities, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ/}}{{clarify|reason=back or central?|date=December 2013}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}, and two contrastive vowel lengths, long and short, for a total of 6 vowel phonemes. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! 
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[High vowel|High]]
| {{IPA|i}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|iː}}
| 
| {{IPA|u}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|uː}}
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| 
| {{IPA|a}} &amp;nbsp; {{IPA|aː}}
| 
|}

However, there is a great deal of phonetic variation in the short vowels. The high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is generally realized as its lower counterpart {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, and the high back vowel {{IPA|/u/}} is similarly often realized as its lower counterpart {{IPA|/ʊ/}}. The low central vowel {{IPA|/a/}} has a wider range of variation, pronounced (most commonly) as {{IPA|/ɐ/}} when it is followed by any consonant except a semivowel or a laryngeal consonant, as a low central vowel (for which IPA lacks a symbol) at the end of an open syllable or when followed by a laryngeal consonant, and as {{IPA|/ə/}} before a semivowel.

In general, the long vowels do not feature this kind of variation but are simply lengthened versions of the phonemes that are represented in the chart.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Melnar, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Caddo also has four diphthongs, which can be written a number of different ways; the transcription below shows the typical Caddo Nation orthography (a vowel paired with a glide) and the IPA version, represented with vowels and offglides.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
*'''ay'''   {{IPA|/aj/}} – English ''eye''
*'''aw'''   {{IPA|/aw/}} – English ''ou''t
*'''iw'''   {{IPA|/iw/}} – English ''ew''
*'''uy'''   {{IPA|/uj/}} – English b''oy''

===Tone===
Caddo is a [[tone language]]. There are three tones in Caddo: low tone, which is unmarked '''{{IPA|(a)}}'''; high tone, which is marked by an acute accent over the vowel '''{{IPA|(á)}}'''; and falling tone, which is always long and marked by a grave accent over the vowel '''{{IPA|(àː)}}'''.

Tone occurs both lexically (as a property of the word), non-lexically (as a result of tonological processes), and also as a marker of certain morphological features. For instance, the past tense marker is associated with high tone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Tonological processes===
There are three processes that can create non-lexical high tone within a [[syllable nucleus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; See the section below for an explanation of other phonological changes which may occur in the following examples.

:'''1. H-deletion'''
:'''VhCC → V&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;CC'''
:An /h/ before two consonants is deleted and the preceding vowel gains high tone:
:'''/kiʃwɑhn-t-ʔuh/ → [kiʃwɑ́nːt'uh] "parched corn"'''

:'''2. Low tone-deletion'''
:'''VRV&lt;sup&gt;Low&lt;/sup&gt;C → V&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;RC'''
:A low tone vowel following a [[sonorant|resonant]] (sonorant consonant) is deleted, and the preceding vowel gains a high tone.
:'''/sa-baka-nah-hah/ → [sawkɑ́nːhah] "does he mean it?"'''

:'''3. Backwards assimilation'''
:'''VRV&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt; → V&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;RV&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;'''
:A vowel preceding a resonant and a high tone vowel gains high tone.
:''/nanɑ́/ → [nɑ́nɑ́ː] "that, that one"'''

===Phonological processes===
====Vowel syncope====
There are two vowel syncope processes in Caddo, which both involve the loss of a low-tone vowel in certain environments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The first syncope process was described above as low tone-deletion. The second syncope process is described below:

:'''Interconsonantal syncope'''
:'''VCV&lt;sup&gt;Low&lt;/sup&gt;CV → VCCV'''
:A low-tone vowel in between a vowel-consonant sequence and a consonant-vowel sequence is deleted.
:'''(Shown with intermediary form): /kak#(ʔi)t'us-jaʔah/ → kahʔit'uʃaʔah → [kahʔit'uʃʔah] "foam, suds"'''

====Consonant cluster simplification====
As a result of the syncope processes described above, several consonant clusters emerge that are then simplified by way of phonological process. At the present stage of research, the processes seem to be unrelated, but they represent a phonetic reduction in consonant clusters; therefore, they are listed below without much further explanation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

:'''1.	nw → mm'''
:'''2.	tw → pp'''
:'''3.	tk → kk'''
:'''4.	n → m / __ [+labial]'''
:'''5.	ʔʔ → ʔ'''
:'''6.	hh → h'''
:'''7.	ʔ+Resonant → Resonant+ʔ / syllable final'''

====Syllable coda simplification====
Similar to the consonant cluster simplification process, there are four processes by which a syllable-final consonant is altered:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

:'''1.	b → w / syllable final'''
:'''2.	d → t / syllable final'''
:'''3.	k → h / syllable final (but not before k)'''
:'''4.	tʃ → ʃ / syllable final'''

====Word boundary processes====
There are three word-boundary processes in Caddo, all of which occur word-initially:

:'''1.	n → t / # __'''
:'''2.	w → p / # __'''
:'''3.	y  → d / # __'''
:'''ni-huhn-id-ah/ → [tihúndah]  "she returned"'''

Such processes are generally not applicable in the case of [[proclitic]]s (morphemes that behave like an affix and are phonologically dependent on the morpheme to which they are attached). An example is the English articles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Glottalization====
Caddo has a glottalization process by which any voiceless stop or affricate (except p) becomes an ejective when it is followed by a glottal stop.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

:'''Glottalization'''
:'''[-sonorant, -continuant, -voice, -labial, -spread glottis] → [+constricted glottis] / ___ [+constricted glottis, -spread glottis]'''
:A voiceless stop or affricate (except p) becomes an ejective when it is followed by a glottal stop.
:'''/sik-ʔuh/ → [sik'uh] "rock"'''

====Palatalization====
Caddo has a palatalization process that affects certain consonants when they are followed by /j/, with simultaneous loss of the /j/.

:'''Palatalization'''
:'''a)	/kj/ → [tʃ]'''
:'''b)	/sj/ → [ʃ]'''
:/kak#ʔa-k'as-jaʔah/ → [kahʔak'a ʃʔah] " one's leg"

(Melnar includes a third palatization process, /tj/ → [ts]. However, /ts/ is not a palatal affricate so it has not been included here. Nevertheless, the third process probably occurs.)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Lengthening====
Caddo has three processes by which a syllable nucleus (vowel) may be lengthened:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 
	
:'''Syllable Lengthening Process One'''
:'''V&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;(Resonant)CVC# → V&lt;sup&gt;High&lt;/sup&gt;(Resonant)ːCVC#'''
:When the second-to-last syllable in a word has a nucleus consisting of a high tone vowel (and, optionally, a resonant), and the last syllable has the form CVC, the high tone nucleus is then lengthened.
:'''/bak-'ʔawɑ́waʔ/ → [bahʔwɑ́ːwaʔ] "they said"'''

:'''Syllable Lengthening Process Two'''
:'''V(Resonant)ʔ → V(Resonant) ː / in any prepenultimate syllable'''
:In any syllable before the penultimate, a glottal stop coda is deleted, and the remaining nucleus is lengthened.
:'''/hɑ́k#ci-(ʔi)bíhn-saʔ/ → [hɑ́hciːbíːsaʔ] " I have it on my back"'''

:'''Syllable Lengthening Process Three'''
:'''a) ij → iː'''
:'''b) uw →uː'''
:Any syllable nucleus with ij or uw must convert to a long vowel.

'''Caradog Prichard''' (3 November 1904 – 25 February 1980) was a Welsh [[poet]] and [[novelist]] writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/gogleddorllewin/enwogion/llen/pages/caradogprichard.shtml BBC Gogledd Orllewin - "Awdur Un Nos Ola Leuad ac enillydd tair coron a chadair Eisteddfodol" (Welsh)]. Accessed 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, [[Mari Prichard]], was married to the late [[Humphrey Carpenter]].

Caradog Prichard was born and grew up in the [[Gwynedd]] slate-quarrying town of [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], in north-west Wales.  His father died when he was a baby, and his mother suffered from mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com:8080/978-0-8112-1342-4 ''Publishers' Weekly'', "One Moonlit Night", 2 February 1997].Accessed 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Prichard began his career as a journalist with [[Welsh language]] newspapers in [[Caernarfon]], [[Llanrwst]] and [[Cardiff]], before moving to [[London]], where he spent much of his life.

== Un Nos Ola Leuad ==
His best-known work is ''[[Un Nos Ola Leuad]]'' (1961), set in a mythologically subversive version of his native area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/remembering-caradog-prichard-three-s4c-1797743 Wales Online - "Remembering Caradog Prichard in three S4C shows", 26 November 2011]. Accessed 30 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was made into a film in 1991 by the Gaucho Company.

===Translations of the novel===
* Full Moon 1973 (English) partial translation by [[Menna Gallie]] (translated from Prichard's Welsh)
* Une nuit de pleine lune 1990 (French) (translated from Prichard's Welsh)
* One Moonlit Night 1995 (English) full translation by [[Philip Mitchell]]. (translated from Prichard's Welsh)
* Za úplnku (Czech) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* Una noche de luna (Spanish) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* In einer mondhellen Nacht (German) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* Mia núhta me fengári (Greek) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* In de maneschijn (Dutch) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* En manelys nat (Danish) (translated from Philip Mitchell's English translation)
* Jedna księżycowa noc 2017 (Polish) translation from Welsh by Marta Listewnik

===Radio broadcasts===
Following the success of his English translation, [[Philip Mitchell]] was commissioned by the BBC to adapt the book for broadcast in English as a radio play and this was transmitted as 'One Moonlit Night' in Radio 4's 'Afternoon Play' series on 28 March 1996.

==Poetry and other works==
In addition to ''Un Nos Ola Leuad'', he also wrote a number of short stories, ''Y Genod yn Ein Bywyd'' (1964), and a striking semi-fictional autobiography, ''Afal Drwg Adda'' (1973). He had made his mark as a poet at an early age and was crowned Bard of the [[National Eisteddfod]] three years running between 1927 and 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Tamworth Herlald, 10 August 1929&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the chair at the Llanelli National Eisteddfod in 1962 for his poem ''Llef un yn Llefain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s10-PRIC-CAR-1904.html|title = Dictionary of Welsh Biography|date = |access-date = 15 January 2016|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At their best his poems are as powerful and disturbing as ''Un Nos Ola Leuad''. His published collections of verse are:
*''Canu Cynnar'' (1937)
*''Tantalus'' (1957)
*''Llef Un yn Llefain'' (1963)
A full collected edition of his poems was published in 1979.

A '''catamaran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|t|ə|m|ə|ˈ|r|æ|n}}) (informally, a "cat") is a [[multihull|multi-hulled]] [[watercraft]] featuring two parallel [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide [[beam (nautical)|beam]], rather than from a ballasted [[keel]] as with a [[monohull]] [[sailboat]].  Catamaran is from a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word "Kattumaram" which means logs tied together. 

Catamarans typically have less hull volume, higher displacement, and shallower [[draft (hull)|draft]] (draught) than monohulls of comparable length. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|resistance]] than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both [[Heeling (sailing)#Heeling|heeling]] and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.

Catamarans range in size from small ([[sailing]] or [[rowing]] vessels) to large (naval ships and [[Roll-on/roll-off|car ferries]]). The structure connecting a catamaran's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or cargo space.

==History==
Catamarans from [[Polynesia]] and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] became the inspiration for modern catamarans.

===Polynesian and Asian catamarans===

[[File:Hobie Cat 16.jpg|thumb|Hobie 16 beachable catamaran.]]

Catamaran-type vessels were first developed as early as [[2nd millennium BC|1500 BCE]] by the  [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.pbs.org/wayfinders/polynesian2.html | title = Polynesian History and Origin | website = Wayfinders: A Pacific Odyssey| publisher = PBS | access-date = January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early examples were likely related to [[outrigger canoe]]s and consisted of two canoes bound together with a wooden frame, sometimes accompanied by a sail. Despite their simplicity they were nonetheless effective, allowing seafaring Polynesians to [[Polynesian navigation|voyage to distant Pacific islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirch|first=Patrick|title=Hawaiki|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|page=80|isbn=978-0-521-78309-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catamarans were seldom constructed in the West before the 19th century, but they were in wide use as early as the 5th century by the [[Tamils|Tamil people]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[South India]]. The word "catamaran" is derived from the Tamil word, ''kattumaram'' (கட்டுமரம்),   which means "logs bound together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lück |first=Michael |date=2008 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tourism and Recreation in Marine Environments |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yuc2Aro6ukkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=tamil+catamaran+5th+century&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZOa-qhmr7S&amp;sig=Pdhu2BN37qDZFthn4rdE0bYUf68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiupYiJlIzKAhXJ6yYKHXElDfQQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=tamil%20catamaran%205th%20century&amp;f=false |location=Wallingford, UK |publisher=CABI |page=86 |isbn=978-1-84593-350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Catamaran |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com Unabridged |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catamaran |year=2016 |publisher=Random House, inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century English adventurer and [[privateer]] [[William Dampier]] encountered the Tamil people of southeastern India during his first circumnavigation of the globe. He was the first to write in English about the watercraft he observed in use there. In his 1697 account of his trip, ''A New Voyage Round the World'', he wrote, {{quote|On the [[Malabar Coast|coast of Malabar]] they call them Catamarans. These are but one Log, or two, sometimes of a sort of light Wood ... so small, that they carry but one Man, whose legs and breech are always in the Water.&lt;ref name = Dampier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dampier|first1=William|title=A New Voyage Round the World|date=1697|isbn=1933698047|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500461h.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Development of modern catamarans===
The first documented example of double-hulled craft in [[Early modern Europe|Europe]] was designed by [[William Petty]] in 1662 to sail faster, in shallower waters, in lighter wind, and with fewer crew than other vessels of the time. However, the unusual design met with skepticism and was not a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/350years/twin-hulled-ship/ |title=Model of a twin-hulled ship - William Petty |publisher=Royal Society |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 22, 2000 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=153561&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Sailing with an Achilles' keel &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design remained relatively unused in the West for almost 160 years until the early 19th-century, when the Englishman Mayflower F. Crisp built a two-hulled merchant ship in [[Yangon|Rangoon, Burma]]. The ship was christened ''Original''. Crisp described it as "a fast sailing fine sea boat; she traded during the monsoon between Rangoon and the Tenasserim Provinces for several years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertie Reginald Pearn|title=A History of Rangoon|publisher=Corporation of Rangoon|year=1938|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. F.

Later that century, the American [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] constructed a double-hulled sailing boat of his own design (US Pat. No. 189,459).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US189459|date=April 10, 1877|title=US Patent Number 189459: Improvement in construction of sailing-vessels|author=[[Nathanael Herreshoff]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craft, ''Amaryllis'', raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulstc.org/Herreshoff.html |title=The Spirit of the Times, November 24, 1877 (reprint) |author=L.

In 1936 [[Eric de Bisschop]] built a Polynesian "double canoe" in [[Hawaii]] and sailed it home to a hero's welcome in France. In 1939, he published his experiences in a book, ''Kaimiloa'', which was translated into English in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voyage of the Kaimiloa'', London, 1940 (translated from French: ''Kaimiloa : D'Honolulu à Cannes par l'Australie et Le Cap, à bord d'une double pirogue polynésienne''), Editions Plon, Paris, 1939 (''Au delà des horizons lointains 1'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prout Brothers, Roland and Francis, experimented with catamarans in 1949 and converted their 1935 boat factory in [[Canvey Island]], Essex (England), to catamaran production in 1954. Their Shearwater catamarans won races easily against the monohulls. ''Yellow Bird,'' a 1956-built Shearwater, raced successfully by Francis Prout in the 1960s, is in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-twentieth century, [[beachcat]]s became a widespread category of sailing catamarans, owing to their ease of launching and mass production. In California, a maker of [[surfboard]]s, [[Hobie Alter]], produced the {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Hobie cat#Hobie 14|Hobie 14]] in 1967, and two years later the larger and even more successful [[Hobie 16]]. As of 2016, the Hobie 16 was still being produced with more than 100,000 having been manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hobie 16 2012 Class Report 2012|url=http://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/H162012ClassReport-%5B11980%5D.pdf|accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado catamaran]] was designed by three Englishmen for a crew of two in 1967 as an Olympic catamaran candidate. At the Olympic Catamaran Trials of the International Yacht Racing Union, IYRU, it outperformed the other challengers for the role and was selected for the multihull discipline in the [[Olympic Games]] from 1976 through 2008. It was redesigned in 2000 and remains one of the fastest double-handed catamaran models.&lt;ref&gt;

==Performance characteristics==
Catamarans have two distinct primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to passage through the water and greater stability (initial resistance to capsize). Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.

===Resistance===
At low to moderate speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through water that is approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed.&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt; For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, [[Forces on sails#Reactive forces on sailing craft|low forward resistance]]&lt;ref&gt;

Large merchant vessels have a Fn&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; between one and zero, whereas higher-performance powered catamarans may approach 2.5—denoting a ''higher speed'' per unit volume for ''catamarans''. Each type of vessel has a corresponding calm water transportation efficiency, with large transport ships being in the range of 100–1,000, compared with 11-18 for transport catamarans—denoting a ''higher efficiency'' per unit of payload for ''monohulls''.&lt;ref name = Watson&gt;

==Sailing catamarans==

[[File:Catamaran de croisière Lagoon 560.JPG|thumb|A cruising catamaran.]]
[[File:Gitana 13.jpg|thumb|[[Gitana 13]], an ocean-racing catamaran.]]
Sailing catamarans have been noted for incorporating technological advances over traditional monohull craft. These include [[hydrofoil|foils]] that lift racing catamarans out of the water, capacious and stable cruising vessels, and racers that have achieved average speeds on the open ocean, comparable to much larger vessels.

===Sport===
Recreational and sport catamarans typically are designed to have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.&lt;ref&gt;

For the [[33rd America's Cup]], both the defender and the challenger built {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} long multihulls. [[Société Nautique de Genève]], defending with team [[Alinghi]], sailed a catamaran. The challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, used a trimaran, replacing its soft sail rig with a towering [[wing sail]]—the largest sailing wing ever built. In the waters off [[Valencia]], Spain in February 2010, the BMW Oracle Racing trimaran with its powerful wing sail proved to be superior. This represented a break from the traditional monohulls that had always been sailed in previous [[America's Cup]] series.&lt;ref&gt;

On San Francisco Bay, the [[2013 America's Cup]] was sailed in {{convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[AC72]] catamarans (craft set by the rules for the 2013 America's Cup). Each yacht employed [[Sailing hydrofoil|hydrofoil]]s and a wing sail. The regatta was won 9-8 by [[Oracle Team USA]] against the challenger, [[Emirates Team New Zealand]], in fifteen matches because Oracle Team USA had started the regatta with a two-point penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/sailing/24274103|title=Ben Ainslie's USA beat Team New Zealand in decider|date=September 26, 2013|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/oracle-team-usa-completes-historic-america-cup-comeback-article-1.1467496|title=Oracle Team USA completes greatest comeback in America's Cup history, defeating Emirates New Zealand|date=September 25, 2013|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruising===
Cruising sailors must make trade-offs among volume, useful load, speed, and cost in choosing a boat. Choosing a catamaran offers increased speed at the expense of reduced load per unit of cost. Howard and Doane describe the following tradeoffs between cruising monohulls and catamarans:&lt;ref name="Offshore" /&gt; A long-distance, offshore cruising monohull may be as short as {{convert|30|ft|m}} for a given crew complement and supporting supplies, whereas a cruising catamaran would need to be {{convert|40|ft|m}} to achieve the same capacity. In addition to greater speed, catamarans draw less water than do monohulls—little as {{convert|3|ft|m}}—and are easier to beach. Catamarans are harder to tack and take up more space in a marina. Cruising catamarans entail added expense for having two engines and two rudders. Tarjan adds that cruising catamarans boats can maintain a comfortable {{convert|300|nmi|mi km}} per day passage, with the racing versions recording well over {{convert|400|nmi|mi km}} per day. In addition, they do not heel more than 10-12 degrees, even at full speed on a reach.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ocean racing===
Yachting has seen the development of multihulls over {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length. "[[The Race (yachting race)|The Race]]" helped precipitate this trend; it was a circumnavigation challenge which departed from Barcelona, Spain, on New Year's Eve, 2000. Because of the prize money and prestige associated with this event, four new catamarans (and two highly modified ones) over {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length were built to compete. The largest, ''[[PlayStation (yacht)|PlayStation]]'', owned by [[Steve Fossett]], was {{convert|125|ft|m}} long and had a mast which was {{convert|147|ft|m}} above the water. Virtually all of the new mega-cats were built of pre-preg [[carbon fiber]] for strength and the lowest possible weight. The top speeds of these boats can approach {{convert|50|kn|mph km/h}}. The Race was won by the {{convert|33.50|m|abbr=on}}-long catamaran ''[[Club Med (yacht)|Club Med]]'' skippered by [[Grant Dalton]]. It went round the globe in 62 days at an average speed of {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;

A catamaran configuration fills a niche for powered vessels, where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or operation in the littoral zone. Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the ''small-waterplane-area twin hull'' (SWATH) and the ''wave-piercing'' configuration—the latter having become a widely favored design.

===Cruising===
An outgrowth of the popularity of cruising sailing catamarans are powered catamarans, which share many of the amenities found in a sail cruising catamaran.  The saloon typically spans two hulls wherein are found the staterooms and engine compartments. As with sailing catamarans, this configuration minimizes boat motion in a seaway.&lt;ref&gt;

===SWATH===
{{main|Small-waterplane-area twin hull}}
The [[small-waterplane-area twin hull]] (SWATH) configuration reduces wave-generating resistance by moving displacement volume below the waterline, using a pair of tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves.&lt;ref name = Misra/&gt; The SWATH form was invented by Canadian [[Frederick G. Creed]], who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as oceanographic research vessels or [[submarine]] rescue ships.&lt;ref&gt;

*Larger wetted surface, which causes higher skin friction drag.
*Significant reduction in wave-induced drag, with the configuration of struts and submerged hull structures.
*Lower water plane area significantly reduces pitching and heaving in a seaway.
*No possibility of planing.
*Higher sensitivity to loading, which may bring the bridge structure closer to the water.

===Wave-piercing===
[[Wave-piercing hull|Wave-piercing]] catamarans employ a low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is pointed at the water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured with some of the characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.&lt;ref&gt;

==Whitewater catamarans==
{{unreferenced section|date = February 2018}}
[[File:Katamarans in Russia.jpg|thumb|right|Catamarans for whitewater sports. Picture was taken in Altai, Russia]]
The catamarans for whitewater sports are widely spread in [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet countries]]. They consists of two inflatable hulls connected with a lattice scaffold. The frame of the tourist catamaran can be made of both - aluminum (duralumin) pipes, and from felled tree trunks. The inflatable part has two layers - airtight balloon with inflation holes and shell made of dense tissue, protecting the balloon from mechanical damage. 

Advantages of such catamarans are light weight, compactness and convenience in transportation (the whole product is packed in one pack-backpack, suitable for air traffic standards), the speed of assembly (10-15 minutes for the inflation). Landing on such a catamaran can be a raft-type, as well as a sports knee-type.

The '''[[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for "[[crisis]]"''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|危机}}|t={{linktext|危機}}|p=wēijī}}) is frequently invoked in Western motivational speaking as being composed of two [[Chinese characters]] respectively signifying "danger" and "opportunity". This is, however, incorrect, as the primary meaning of the character pronounced ''jī'' ({{zh|s=[[:wikt:机|机]]|t=[[:wikt:機|機]]}}) is not "opportunity".&lt;ref name="langlog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2363/is-the-chinese-word-for-crisis-a-combination-of-danger-and-opportunity "The Straight Dope: Is the Chinese word for "crisis" a combination of "danger" and "opportunity"?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[United States|American]] [[linguist]] [[Benjamin Zimmer]] has traced mentions in English of the Chinese term for "crisis" as far as an anonymous editorial in a 1938 journal for missionaries in China.&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese Recorder'' (January 1938, "The Challenge of Unusual Times")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="langlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004343.html |date=27 March 2007 |work=[[Language Log]] |title=Crisis = danger + opportunity: The plot thickens |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But its use probably gained momentum in the [[United States]] after [[John F. Kennedy]] employed this [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]] in speeches in 1959 and 1960:&lt;ref name="langlog"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Chinese language, the word "crisis" is composed of two characters,&lt;br/&gt;
one representing danger and the other, opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Quotations.aspx#C Speeches] by President Kennedy at [[United Negro College Fund]] fundraiser, Indianapolis, Indiana, 12 April 1959, and Valley Forge Country Club, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 29 October 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Referencing the word has since become a staple meme for American business consultants and motivational speakers, as well as gaining popularity in educational institutions, politics and in the popular press. For example, in 2007, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] applied it during [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Middle East peace talks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801881.html |title=Rice Highlights Opportunities After Setbacks On Mideast Trip |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |date=2007-01-19 |page=A14 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] did so both in testimony before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Energy and Commerce Committee]], in the introduction of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|An Inconvenient Truth]]'', and in his [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/032107_gore.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/gore-lecture_en.html |title=Al Gore: The Nobel Peace Prize 2007: Nobel Lecture |location=[[Oslo]] |first=Al |last=Gore |authorlink=Al Gore |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |date=2007-12-10 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Zimmer attributes the appeal of this anecdote to its "handiness" as a rhetorical device and optimistic "call to action",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004330.html |work=[[Language Log]] |accessdate=19 January 2009 |date=22 March 2007 |title=Stop Him Before He Tropes Again |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to "[[wishful thinking]]".&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt;

==Popular mistranslation==
[[Sinologist]] [[Victor H. Mair]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] states the popular interpretation of ''wēijī'' as "danger" plus "opportunity" is a "widespread public misperception" in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world.&lt;ref name="mair"/&gt; While the character ''wēi'' ([[Wikt:危|危]]) does indeed mean "dangerous" or "precarious", the character ''jī'' ([[Wikt:機|機]]) is highly [[polysemous]] and does not, in isolation, translate as "opportunity".&lt;ref name="mair"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html | title=danger + opportunity ≠ crisis: How a misunderstanding about Chinese characters has led many astray | last=Mair | first=Victor H. | authorlink=Victor H. Mair | publisher=PinyinInfo.com | year=2005 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion no doubt arises from the fact that ''jī'' (機) is a component of the Chinese word for "opportunity" ''jīhuì'' ([[wikt:機會|機會]]／机会, literally "meeting a critical point").

According to the 10th Edition of ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]'', the best-selling Chinese dictionary, the character ''jī'' (機) in ''wēijī'' (危機) means "a point where things happen or change", this meaning appears to be neutral, from which derive two other meanings: "an event that has a confidential nature", and "chance (opportunity), good timing" which appears to be a positive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Xinhua Zidian]]|date=2004|publisher=Commercial Press|location=Beijing|isbn=7-100-02893-0|page=205|edition=10th revised, large-print|url=|ref=xhzd|language=Chinese|quote=❶事物发生、变化的枢纽：生～.危～.转～.(引)1.对事情成败有保密性质的事件：军～.～密.～要.2.机会，合宜的时候：随～应变.勿失良～.好时～.[...].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13456">{{About|the syntax of comparative forms|general information about comparison in language|Comparison (grammar)|other uses|Comparative (disambiguation)}}
In linguistics, the '''comparative''' is a syntactic construction that serves to express a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, or degree. See [[comparison (grammar)]] for an overview of comparison, as well as positive and [[superlative]] degrees of comparison.

Ex: " This sofa is more comfortable than that one. " "James is smaller than Chris."
The syntax of comparative constructions is poorly understood due to the complexity of the data. In particular, the comparative frequently occurs with independent mechanisms of syntax such as [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and forms of [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] ([[gapping]], [[pseudogapping]], null complement anaphora, [[Stripping (linguistics)|stripping]], [[verb phrase ellipsis]]). The interaction of the various mechanisms complicates the analysis.

==Absolute and null forms==
A number of fixed expressions use a comparative form where no comparison is being asserted, such as ''higher education'' or ''younger generation''. These comparatives can be called ''absolute''.

Similarly, a '''null comparative''' is one in which the starting point for [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] is not stated. These comparisons are frequently found in [[advertising]], for example, in typical assertions such as ''Our [[Hamburger|burgers]] have more flavor'', ''Our picture is sharper'' or ''50% more''. These uses of the comparative do not mention what it is they are being compared to. In some cases it is easy to infer what the missing element in a null comparative is. In other cases, the speaker or writer has been deliberately vague, for example "[[Glasgow's miles better]]".

Scientific classification, taxonomy, and geographical categorization conventionally include the adjectives ''greater'' and ''lesser'', when a ''large'' or ''small'' variety of an item is meant, as in the [[greater celandine]] as opposed to the [[lesser celandine]]. These adjectives may at first sight appear as a kind of ''null comparative'', when as is usual, they are cited without their opposite counterpart. It should be apparent, however, that an entirely different variety of animal, scientific, or geographical object is intended. Thus it may be found, for example, that the [[lesser panda]] entails a [[giant panda]] variety, and a gazetteer would establish that there are the [[Lesser Antilles]] as well as the [[Greater Antilles]]. It is in the nature of grammatical conventions evolving over time that it is difficult to establish when they first became widely accepted, but both ''greater'' and ''lesser'' in these instances have over time become mere adjectives (or adverbial constructs), so losing their ''comparative'' connotation. Further, ''Greater'' indicates the inclusion adjacent areas when referring to [[metropolitan area]]s, such as when [[suburb]]s are intended. Although it implies a comparison with a narrower definition that refers to a central city only, such as [[Greater London]] versus the [[City of London]], or [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York]] versus [[New York City]], it is not part of the "comparative" in the grammatical sense of this article. A comparative  always compares something directly with something else.

==Comparative coordination vs. comparative subordination==
At times the syntax of comparatives matches the syntax of coordination, and at other times, it must be characterized in terms of subordination.

===Comparative coordination===
The syntax of comparatives can closely mirror the syntax of [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]]. The similarity in structure across the following a- and b-sentences illustrates this point. The conjuncts of the coordinate structures are enclosed in square brackets:&lt;ref&gt;The examples are taken from Osborne (2009:428).&lt;/ref&gt;

::a. [The boys] and [the girls] sent flowers to him today.
::b. '''More''' [boys] '''than''' [girls] sent flowers to him today.

::a. [The boys sent] and [the girls dropped off] flowers for him today.
::b. ['''More''' boys sent] '''than''' [girls dropped off] flowers for him today.

::a. The boys sent [flowers to him] and [chocolates to her] today.
::b. '''More''' boys sent [flowers to him] '''than''' [chocolates to her] today.

::a. The boys sent [flowers to him today] and [chocolates to her yesterday].
::b. '''More''' boys sent [flowers to him today] '''than''' [chocolates to her yesterday].

The structure of the b-sentences involving comparatives is closely similar to the structure of the a-sentences involving coordination. Based on this similarity, many have argued that the syntax of comparatives overlaps with the syntax of coordination at least some of the time.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of accounts that argue that the syntax of comparatives overlaps with the syntax of coordination at least some of the time, see Pinkham (1982), Napoli (1983), McCawley 1988, Lechner (2004), Corver (2006), and Osborne (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the ''than'' in the b-sentences should be viewed as a coordinator (coordinate conjunction), not as a subordinator (subordinate conjunction).

===Comparative subordination===
Examples of the comparative that do not allow an analysis in terms of coordination (because the necessary parallel structures are not present) are instances of comparative [[subordination (linguistics)|subordination]].&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between comparative coordination and comparative subordination is discussed at length by Osborne (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, ''than'' has the status of a preposition or a subordinator (subordinate conjunction), e.g.

::a. We invited '''more''' people '''than''' wanted to come.

::b. A '''better''' striker was playing for them '''than''' we have.

::c. '''More''' passengers '''than''' the airline had issued tickets tried to board the plane.&lt;ref&gt;The example is taken from Pinkham (1982:50).&lt;/ref&gt;

::d. '''More''' guests '''than''' we had chairs showed up.

::e. Who did he eat '''more''' hotdogs '''than'''?

Since the parallel structures associated with coordinate structures, i.e., the conjuncts, cannot be acknowledged in these sentences, the only analysis available is one in terms of subordination, whereby ''than'' has the status of a subordinator (as in sentences a-d) or of a preposition (as in sentence e). What this means is that the syntax of comparatives is complex because at times an analysis in terms of coordination is warranted, whereas at other times, the analysis must assume subordination.

==Comparative deletion and subdeletion==
There are two types of ellipsis that are unique to the ''than''-clauses of comparatives: ''comparative deletion'' and ''comparative subdeletion''. The existence of comparative deletion as an ellipsis mechanism is widely acknowledged,&lt;ref&gt;The classic work that explores comparative deletion is Bresnan (1973). See Corver (2006) also.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the status of comparative subdeletion as an ellipsis mechanism is more controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2009:447), for instance, rejects the ellipsis analysis of structure assumed to involve comparative subdeletion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative deletion===
Comparative deletion is an obligatory ellipsis mechanism that occurs in the ''than''-clause of a comparative construction. The elided material of comparative deletion is indicated using a blank, and the unacceptable b-sentences show what is construed as having been elided in the a-sentences:

::a. Fred reads '''more''' books '''than''' Susan reads ___. 
::b. *Fred reads '''more''' books '''than''' Susan reads &lt;u&gt;books&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Sentence is bad because comparative deletion has not occurred.&lt;/small&gt;

::a. We invited '''more''' people '''than''' ___ came.
::b. *We invited '''more''' people '''than''' &lt;u&gt;people&lt;/u&gt; came. &lt;small&gt;- Sentence is bad because comparative deletion has not occurred.&lt;/small&gt;

::a. She was happi'''er than''' I was ___.
::b. *She was happi'''er than''' I was &lt;u&gt;happy&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;small&gt;- Sentence is bad because comparative deletion has not occurred.&lt;/small&gt;

===Comparative subdeletion===
Comparative subdeletion is a second type of ellipsis in comparatives that some accounts acknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;For analyses of comparative subdeletion, see for instance Bresnan (1973), Grimshaw (1987), and Corver (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when the focused constituent in the ''than''-clause is not deleted because it is distinct from its counterpart in the main clause. In other words, comparative subdeletion occurs when comparative deletion does not because the constituents being compared are distinct, e.g.

::a. He has '''more''' cats '''than''' he has __ dogs.

::b. Few'''er''' women showed up '''than''' __ men wanted to dance.

::c. You were happi'''er than''' I was __ sad.

::b. The table is '''as''' wide '''as''' it is __ tall.

Accounts that acknowledge comparative subdeletion posit a null measure expression in the position marked by the blank (x-many, x-much). This element serves to focus the expression in the same way that ''-er'' or ''more'' focuses its counterpart in the main clause. Various arguments are put forth that motivate the existence of this null element.&lt;ref&gt;See Bresnan (1973) and Corver (2006) for the arguments in favor of an ellipsis analysis of subdeletion.&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments will not be reproduced here, though. Suffice it to say that the sentences in which subdeletion is supposedly occurring are qualitatively different from sentences in which comparative deletion occurs, e.g., ''He has more cats than you have ___ .''

==Independent ellipsis mechanisms in ''than''-clauses==
There are a number of independent [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] mechanisms that occur in the ''than-''clauses of comparative constructions: [[gapping]], [[pseudogapping]], null complement anaphora, [[Stripping (linguistics)|stripping]], and [[verb phrase ellipsis]]. These mechanisms are independent of comparative clauses because they also occur when the comparative is not involved. The presence of these ellipsis mechanisms in ''than''-clauses complicates the analysis considerably, since they render it difficult to discern which aspects of the syntax of comparatives are unique to comparatives.

::a. You should visit me on Tuesday, and I ___ you on Wednesday. &lt;small&gt;- Gapping without the comparative&lt;/small&gt;
::b. You visited me on Tuesdays '''more than''' I ___ you on Wednesdays. &lt;small&gt;- Gapping with the comparative&lt;/small&gt;

::a. He will say it twice before she has ___ once. &lt;small&gt;- Pseudogapping without the comparative&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''More''' people will say it twice '''than''' ___ will ___ just once. &lt;small&gt;- Pseudogapping with the comparative; comparative deletion also present&lt;/small&gt;

::a. He did it as I expected ___ . &lt;small&gt;- Null complement anaphora without the comparative&lt;/small&gt;
::b. He did it '''more than''' I expected ___ . &lt;small&gt;- Null complement anaphora with the comparative&lt;/small&gt;

::a. Men did it, and women ___ too. &lt;small&gt;- Stripping without the comparative&lt;/small&gt;
::b. '''More''' men did it '''than''' women ___ . &lt;small&gt;- Stripping analysis possible here&lt;/small&gt;

::a. Susan has helped when you have ___ . &lt;small&gt;- Verb phrase ellipsis without the comparative&lt;/small&gt; 
::b. Susan has helped '''more than''' you have ___ . &lt;small&gt;- Verb phrase ellipsis with the comparative&lt;/small&gt;

The fact that the five independent ellipsis mechanisms (and possibly others) can occur in the ''than''-clauses of comparatives has rendered the study of the syntax of comparatives particularly difficult. One is often not sure which ellipsis mechanisms are involved in a given ''than''-clause. One thing is clear, however: the five ellipsis mechanisms illustrated here are distinct from the two ellipsis mechanisms that are unique to comparatives mentioned above (comparative deletion and comparative subdeletion).

A '''drill string''' on a [[drilling rig]] is a column, or string, of [[drill pipe]] that transmits [[drilling fluid]] (via the [[mud pump]]s) and torque (via the [[kelly drive]] or [[top drive]]) to the [[Well_drilling#Drill_bits_in_mechanical_drilling|drill bit]]. The term is loosely applied to the assembled collection of the drill pipe, [[drill collar]]s, tools and drill bit. The drill string is hollow so that [[drilling fluid]] can be pumped down through it and circulated back up the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] (the void between the drill string and the casing/open hole).

== Drill string components ==
The drill string is typically made up of three sections:
* Bottom hole assembly (BHA)
* Transition pipe, which is often heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP)
* Drill pipe

=== Bottom hole assembly (BHA) ===
The BHA is made up of: a [[drill bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]], which is used to break up the rock [[Geologic formation|formation]]s; [[drill collar]]s, which are heavy, thick-walled tubes used to apply weight to the drill bit; and [[drilling stabilizer]]s, which keep the assembly centered in the hole. The BHA may also contain other components such as a [[downhole motor]] and [[rotary steerable system]], [[Measurement While Drilling|measurement while drilling]] (MWD), and [[Logging While Drilling|logging while drilling]] (LWD) tools.  The components are joined together using rugged threaded connections. Short "subs" are used to connect items with dissimilar threads.

=== Transition pipe ===
Heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP) may be used to make the transition between the drill collars and drill pipe. The function of the HWDP is to provide a flexible transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. This helps to reduce the number of fatigue failures seen directly above the BHA. A secondary use of HWDP is to add additional weight to the drill bit. HWDP is most often used as weight on bit in deviated wells. The HWDP may be directly above the collars in the angled section of the well, or the HWDP may be found before the kick off point in a shallower section of the well.

=== Drill pipe ===
Drill pipe makes up the majority of the drill string back up to the surface.  Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill pipe tubular, larger-diameter portions called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male ("pin") connection whilst the other has a female ("box") connection. The tool joint connections are threaded which allows for the mating of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.

== Running a drill string ==
Most components in a drill string are manufactured in 31 foot lengths (range 2) although they can also be manufactured in 46 foot lengths (range 3). Each 31 foot component is referred to as a joint. Typically 2, 3 or 4 joints are joined together to make a stand. Modern onshore rigs are capable of handling ~90&amp;nbsp;ft stands (often referred to as a triple).

Pulling the drill string out of or running the drill string into the hole is referred to as '''tripping'''. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically racked  back in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick if they are to be run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit.  The disconnect point ("break") is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh pipe dope applied.

== Stuck drill string ==
A stuck drill string can be caused by many situations.

*Packing-off due to cuttings settling back into the wellbore when circulation is stopped.
*Differentially when there is a large difference between formation pressure and wellbore pressure. The drill string is pushed against one side of the well bore. The force required to pull the string along the wellbore in this occurrence is a function of the total contact surface area, the pressure difference and the friction factor.
*Keyhole sticking occurs mechanically as a result of pulling up into doglegs when tripping.
*Adhesion due to not moving it for a significant amount of time.

Once the tubular member is stuck, there are many techniques used to extract the pipe. The tools and expertise are normally supplied by an oilfield service company. Two popular tools and techniques are the oilfield jar and the surface [[resonant]] vibrator. Below is a history of these tools along with how they operate.

=== History of Jars ===
[[File:8 inch drilling jar 532.jpg|thumb|8 inch drilling jar (red and white) on casings]]
The mechanical success of [[cable tool drilling]] has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, in the salt well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received {{cite patent|US|2243}} for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling.  Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently meet the demands of drilling wells for oil.

The jars were improved over time, especially at the hands of the oil drillers, and reached the most useful and workable design by the 1870s, due to another {{cite patent|US|78958}} received in 1868 by Edward Guillod of Titusville, Pennsylvania, which addressed the use of steel on the jars' surfaces that were subject to the greatest wear.  Many years later, in the 1930s, very strong steel alloy jars were made.

A set of jars consisted of two interlocking links which could telescope.  In 1880 they had a play of about 13&amp;nbsp;inches such that the upper link could be lifted 13&amp;nbsp;inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together.Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,
imparting an impact load.

In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness is
determined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.

When pipe stretch alone cannot provide enough energy to free a fish, compounders or accelerators are used. Compounders or accelerators are energized when you over pull on the working string and compress a compressible fluid through a few feet of stroke distance and at the same time activate the fishing jar. When the fishing jar releases the stored energy in the compounder/acclerator lifts the drill collars upwards at a high rate of speed creating a high impact in the jar.

=== System Dynamics of Jars ===

Jars rely on the principle of stretching a pipe to build elastic potential energy such that when the jar trips it relies on the masses of the drill pipe and collars to gain velocity and subsequently strike the anvil section of jar. This impact results in a force, or blow, which is converted into energy.

=== History of Surface Resonant Vibrators ===

[[File:SurfaceResonantVibrator.jpg|thumb|400px|Oilfield Surface Resonant Vibrator]]

The concept of using vibration to free stuck objects from a wellbore originated in the 1940s, and probably stemmed from the 1930s use of vibration to drive piling in the Soviet Union. The early use of vibration for driving and extracting piles was confined to low frequency operation; that is, frequencies less than the fundamental [[resonant frequency]] of the system and consequently, although effective, the process was only an improvement on conventional hammer equipment. Early patents and teaching attempted to explain the process and mechanism involved, but lacked a certain degree of sophistication. In 1961, A. G. Bodine obtained {{cite patent|US|2972380}}&lt;ref&gt;Patent number: 2972380, Filing date: Feb 20, 1956, Issue date: Feb 1961, Inventor: Albert G. Bodine Title: "Acoustic Method and Apparatus For Moving Objects Held Tight Within a Surrounding Medium"&lt;/ref&gt; that was to become the "mother patent" for oil field tubular extraction using sonic techniques. Mr. Bodine introduced the concept of [[Resonance|resonant]] [[vibration]] that effectively eliminated the reactance portion of [[mechanical impedance]], thus leading to the means of efficient sonic power transmission. Subsequently, Mr. Bodine obtained additional patents directed to more focused applications of the technology.

The first published work on this technique was outlined in a 1987 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) paper presented at the International Association of Drilling Contractors in Dallas, Texas &lt;ref&gt;O. Gonzalez, "Retrieving Stuck Liners, Tubing, Casing And Drillpipe With Vibratory Resonant Techniques" Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 14759&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the nature of the work and the operational results that were achieved. The cited work involving liner, tubing, and drill pipe extraction and was very successful. Reference Two&lt;ref&gt;O. Gonzalez, Henry Bernat, Paul Moore, "The Extraction of Mud Stuck Tubing Using Vibratory Resonant Techniques" Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 109530&lt;/ref&gt; presented at the Society of Petroleum Engineers Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in Anaheim, California, November, 2007 explains the [[resonant]] [[vibration]] theory in more detail as well as its use in extracting long lengths of mud stuck tubulars.

=== System Dynamics of Surface Resonant Vibrators ===

Surface Resonant Vibrators rely on the principle of counter rotating eccentric weights to impart a [[sinusoidal]] [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic motion]] from the surface into the work string at the surface. Reference Three (above) provides a full explanation of this technology. The frequency of rotation, and hence [[vibration]] of the pipe string, is tuned to the [[resonant frequency]] of the system. The system is defined as the surface resonant vibrator, pipe string, fish and retaining media. The resultant forces imparted to the fish is based on the following logic:

* The delivery forces from the surface are a result of the static overpull force from the rig, plus the dynamic force component of the rotating eccentric weights
* Depending on the static overpull force component, the resultant force at the fish can be either tension or compression due to the sinusoidal force wave component from the oscillator
* Initially during startup of a vibrator, some force is necessary to lift and lower the entire load mass of the system. When the vibrator tunes to the [[resonant frequency]] of the system, the [[reaction (physics)|reactive]] load [[Impedance matching|impedance]] cancels out to zero by virtue of the [[inductance reactance]] (mass of the system) equaling the compliance or stiffness reactance (elasticity of the tubular). The remaining impedance of the system, known as the resistive load impedance, is what is retaining the stuck pipe.
* During resonant vibration, a [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] sine wave travels down the pipe to the fish with an attendant pipe mass that is equal to a quarter [[wavelength]] of the [[resonant]] [[vibrating]] [[frequency]].
* A phenomenon known as [[fluidization]] of soil grains takes place during [[resonant]] [[vibration]] whereby the granular material constraining the stuck pipe is transformed into a fluidic state that offers little resistance to movement of bodies through the media. In effect, it takes on the characteristics and properties of a liquid.
* During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of the pipe body, known as [[Poisson's ratio]], takes place such that when the stuck pipe is subjected to axial strain due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its [[diameter]] will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] and [[compressive]] forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its [[diameter]] will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a [[vibration]] cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.

'''Frederick J. Damerau''' (December 25, 1931 – January 27, 2009) was a pioneer of [[research]] on [[natural language processing]] and [[data mining]].

After earning his B.A. from [[Cornell University]] in 1953, he spent most of his career at [[IBM]], in the [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]].

One of his most influential and ground-breaking papers was "A technique for computer detection and correction of spelling errors" published in 1964.  He also developed and patented for IBM the first [[algorithm]] for placing [[hyphen]]s automatically in words.
In 1971 he published the book "Markov Models and Linguistic Theory : An Experimental Study of a Model for English."

After being active in research for over four decades, Fred Damerau died on January 27, 2009.

'''''Gabacho''''' ({{IPA-es|ɡaˈβatʃo}}; feminine, '''''gabacha''''') is a word used in the [[Spanish language]] as a pejorative reference to French people. It derives from the [[Occitan]] word gavach, which translates as "someone who speaks with a faulty speech".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=gabacho gabacho]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabacha is also a word used in [[Guatemala]] for apron.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Central America]], it is used to refer to certain types of coats, such as that of a doctor, a kindergarten student, a lab coat or a graduation vest.

In the [[United States]], it is a [[slang]], [[derogatory term]] used for [[white American]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1206">'''Grinding''' is a sliding stunt performed in many [[extreme sports]]. Stances in which slides are performed are known as '''grinds'''.

Grinding is performed by sliding across the top of an obstacle, and can be accomplished in a number of ways. A range of equipment can be used to grind an object or obstacle and each sport lends the performer different options of obstacles and subsequent grind positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6596">In [[mathematics]], the '''Grothendieck–Katz p-curvature conjecture''' is a [[local-global principle]] for [[Linear differential equation|linear ordinary differential equation]]s, related to [[differential Galois theory]] and in a loose sense analogous to the result in the [[Chebotarev density theorem]] considered as the [[polynomial]] case. It is a conjecture of [[Alexander Grothendieck]] from the late 1960s, and apparently not published by him in any form.

The general case remains unsolved, despite recent progress; it has been linked to geometric investigations involving algebraic [[foliation]]s.

==Formulation==
In a simplest possible statement the conjecture can be stated in its essentials for a vector system written as

:&lt;math&gt;dv/dz = A(z)v&lt;/math&gt;

for a vector ''v'' of size ''n'', and an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix ''A'' of [[algebraic function]]s with [[algebraic number]] coefficients. The question is to give a criterion for when there is a ''full set'' of algebraic function solutions, meaning a fundamental matrix (i.e. ''n'' vector solutions put into a [[block matrix]]). For example, a classical question was for the [[hypergeometric equation]]: when does it have a pair of algebraic solutions, in terms of its parameters? The answer is known classically as [[Schwarz's list]]. In [[monodromy]] terms, the question is of identifying the cases of finite monodromy group.

By reformulation and passing to a larger system, the essential case is for rational functions in ''A'' and rational number coefficients. Then a necessary condition is that for [[almost all]] prime numbers ''p'', the system defined by reduction modulo ''p'' should also have a full set of algebraic solutions, over the finite field with ''p'' elements.

Grothendieck's conjecture is that these necessary conditions, for almost all ''p'', should be sufficient. The connection with [[p-curvature|''p''-curvature]] is that the mod ''p'' condition stated is the same as saying the ''p''-curvature, formed by a recurrence operation on ''A'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/SB/SB_1991-1992__34_/SB_1991-1992__34__183_0/SB_1991-1992__34__183_0.pdf Daniel Bertrand, Bourbaki Seminar 750, 1991-2], section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; is zero; so another way to say it is that ''p''-curvature of 0 for almost all ''p'' implies enough algebraic solutions of the original equation.

==Katz's formulation for the Galois group==
[[Nicholas Katz]] has applied [[Tannakian category]] techniques to show that this conjecture is essentially the same as saying that the [[differential Galois group]] ''G'' (or strictly speaking the [[Lie algebra]] '''g''' of the [[algebraic group]] ''G'', which in this case is the [[Zariski closure]] of the monodromy group) can be determined by mod ''p'' information, for a certain wide class of differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nicholas M. |last=Katz |title=A conjecture in the arithmetic theory of differential equations |journal=Bull. Soc. Math. France |volume=110 |year=1982 |issue=2 |pages=203–239 |url=http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/BSMF/BSMF_1982__110_/BSMF_1982__110__203_0/BSMF_1982__110__203_0.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
A wide class of cases has been proved by [[Benson Farb]] and [[Mark Kisin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farb |first=Benson |last2=Kisin |first2=Mark |year=2009 |title=Rigidity, Locally Symmetric Varieties, and the Grothendieck–Katz Conjecture |journal=Int Math Res Notices |volume=2009 |issue=22 |pages=4159–4167 |doi=10.1093/imrn/rnp082 |url=http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~farb/papers/pcurv5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; these equations are on a [[locally symmetric variety]] ''X'' subject to some group-theoretic conditions. This work is based on the previous results of Katz for [[Picard–Fuchs equation]]s (in the contemporary sense of the [[Gauss–Manin connection]]), as amplified in the Tannakian direction by André. It also applies a version of [[superrigidity]] particular to [[arithmetic group]]s. Other progress has been by arithmetic methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last=Chambert-Loir |first=Antoine |year=2002 |title=Théorèmes d'algébrisation en géométrie diophantienne |eprint=math/0103192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nicholas Katz related some cases to [[deformation theory]] in 1972, in a paper where the conjecture was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nicholas M. |last=Katz |title=Algebraic solutions of differential equations (p-curvature and the Hodge filtration) |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae|Invent. Math.]] |volume=18 |year=1972 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–118 |doi=10.1007/BF01389714 |bibcode=1972InMat..18....1K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, reformulations have been published. A [[q-analogue]] for [[difference equation]]s has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Di Vizio |first=Lucia |year=2002 |title=Arithmetic theory of q -difference equations |journal=Invent. Math. |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=517–578 |doi=10.1007/s00222-002-0241-z |arxiv=math/0104178 |bibcode=2002InMat.150..517D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In responding to Kisin's talk on this work at the 2009 Colloque Grothendieck,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8juqx_colloque-grothendieck-mark-kisin_tech Video record.]&lt;/ref&gt; Katz gave a brief account from personal knowledge of the genesis of the conjecture. Grothendieck put it forth in public discussion in Spring 1969, but wrote nothing on the topic. He was led to the idea by foundational intuitions in the area of [[crystalline cohomology]], at that time being developed by his student [[Pierre Berthelot]]. In some way wishing to equate the notion of "nilpotence" in the theory of connections, with the [[divided power structure]] technique that became standard in crystalline theory, Grothendieck produced the conjecture as a by-product.

It  may have been the first language to be described as having an [[object–verb–subject]] word order (by linguist [[Desmond C. Derbyshire]]), though determining this is "difficult".{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the quote|date=August 2017}}

* {{IPA|/ɽˡ/}} is a [[retroflex]] tap with a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] release.
* The orthography used is as follows: {{IPA|/tʃ ɟ/}} = {{angbr|tx dy}}; {{IPA|/ɸ ʃ/}} = {{angbr|f x}}; {{IPA|/ɲ/}} = {{angle bracket|ny}}; {{IPA|/ɽˡ/}} = {{angle bracket|ry}}; {{IPA|/j/}} = {{angle bracket|y}}.

Hixkaryana has the following vowel phonemes:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+
!
![[Front vowel|Front]]
![[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
![[Close vowel|Close]]
|
|{{IPA|ɯ}}, {{IPA|u}}
|-
![[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]
|{{IPA|e}}
|
|-
![[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
|
|{{IPA|ɔ}}
|-
![[Open vowel|Open]]
|{{IPA|æ}}
|
|}

The vowels {{IPA|/ɯ/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, and {{IPA|/æ/}} are written {{angle bracket|ɨ}}, {{angle bracket|u}}, {{angle bracket|e}}, {{angle bracket|o}}, and {{angle bracket|a}}, respectively.

==Grammar==

In Hixkaryana, arguments are indexed on the verb by means of person prefixes.  These prefixes form an inverse-like pattern in which the argument highest in the hierarchy 2nd &gt; 1st &gt; 3rd is indexed on the verb.  If the object of a transitive verb outranks the subject according to this hierarchy, the appropriate O-prefix is used; otherwise, an A-prefix is used.

{| class="IPA wikitable" cellpadding="2"
 | colspan="2" | A-prefixes || colspan="2" | O-prefixes
 |-
 | 1A || 0-/ɨ- || 1O || r(o)
 |-
 | 2A || m(ɨ)- || 2O || o(j)-/a(j)-
 |-
 | 1+2A || t(ɨ)- || 1+2O || k(ɨ)-
 |-
 | 3A || n(ɨ)-/j-
|}

Intransitive verbs take prefixes mostly similar to the transitive prefixes given above, with an [[active-stative language|active–stative]] .  The arguments' grammatical number is indexed on the verb by means of portmanteau suffixes that combine tense, aspect, mood, and number.

In most cases, the person prefixes unambiguously determine which of the arguments is the subject and which is the object.  When both the subject and the object are third person, however, the person prefix is inadequate to fully determine the identity of the arguments.  In these situations, therefore, word order is crucial in determining their identity. Hixkaryana may have an [[object–verb–subject]] word order. The example below, "toto yonoye kamara", cannot be given the AVO reading "the man ate the jaguar"; the OVA reading – "the jaguar ate the man" – is the only possible one.

{| class="IPA wikitable"
| ''toto''
| colspan="3"|''yonoye''
| ''kamara''
|-
| toto
| y-
| ono
| -ye 
| kamara
|-
| person
| 3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-
| eat
| -&lt;small&gt;DIST&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;COMPL&lt;/small&gt; 
| jaguar
|-
| colspan="5"|"The jaguar ate the man."
|}

Indirect objects, however, follow the subject:

{| class="IPA wikitable"
| ''bɨryekomo''
| colspan="4"|''yotahahono''
| ''wosɨ''
| ''tɨnyo''
| ''wya''
|-
| bɨryekomo
| y-
| otaha
| -ho
| -no
| wosɨ
| tɨnyo
| wya
|-
| boy
| 3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-
| hit
| -&lt;small&gt;CAUS&lt;/small&gt;
| -&lt;small&gt;IMM&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;
| woman
| her-husband
| by
|-
| colspan="8"|"The woman caused her husband to hit the boy."
|}

Moreover, word order in non-finite [[embedded clause]]s is SOV. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070221213347/http://www.ling.umd.edu/~soltan/LING419B/Handouts/handout3.pdf]  Like most other languages with objects preceding the verb, it is [[postposition]]al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16763">An '''intact forest landscape''' ('''IFL''') is an unbroken [[natural landscape]] of a [[forest]] [[ecosystem]] and its [[habitat]]–[[plant community]] components, in an extant forest zone. An IFL is a [[natural environment]] with no signs of significant human activity or [[habitat fragmentation]], and of sufficient size to contain, support, and maintain the complex of indigenous [[biodiversity]] of viable populations of a wide range of [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] [[genus|genera]] and [[species]], and their [[Ecological effects of biodiversity|ecological effects]].&lt;ref name="SA-201701"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potapov|first1=Peter|last2=Hansen|first2=Matthew C|last3=Laestadius|first3=Lars|title=The last frontiers of wilderness: Tracking loss of intact forest landscapes from 2000 to 2013|journal=Science Advances|date=January 2017|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1600821|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1600821.full|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFLs are estimated to cover 23 percent of forest ecosystems (13.1 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Two [[biomes]] hold almost all of these IFLs: dense tropical and subtropical forests (45 percent) and boreal forests (44 percent), while the proportion of IFLs in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests is very small. IFLs remain in 66 of the 149 countries that could potentially have them. Three of these countries, [[Canada]], [[Russia]], and [[Brazil]], contain 64 percent of the total IFL area. Nineteen percent of the global IFL area is under some form of protection, but only 10 percent is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to [[IUCN]] protected areas categories I–III. It is estimated that the planet has lost seven percent of its IFLs since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Chelsea|title=Humans have destroyed 7% of Earth’s pristine forest landscapes just since 2000|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/13/humans-have-destroyed-7-percent-of-earths-pristine-forest-landscapes-just-since-2000/|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=Washington Post|date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "intact forest landscape" was developed by a group of [[Non-governmental organization|environmental non-governmental organizations]] including [[Greenpeace]], the [[World Resources Institute]],  Biodiversity Conservation Center, International Socio-Ecological Union, and Transparent World. IFL has been used in regional and global forest monitoring projects such as Intact-Forests.org, and in scientific [[forest ecology]] research.
==Definition==
The concept of an intact forest landscape and its technical definition were developed to help create, implement, and monitor policies concerning the human impact on forest landscapes at the regional or country levels.

Technically, an IFL is defined as an area which contains forest and non-forest ecosystems minimally influenced by human economic activity, with an area of at least 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (50,000 ha) and a minimal width of 10&amp;nbsp;km (measured as the diameter of a circle that is entirely inscribed within the boundaries of the territory).

Areas with evidence of certain types of human influence are considered "disturbed" and not eligible for inclusion in an IFL:
* Settlements (including a buffer zone of one kilometer)
* Infrastructure used for transportation between settlements or for industrial development of natural resources, including roads (except unpaved trails), railways, navigable waterways (including seashore), pipelines, and power transmission lines (including in all cases a buffer zone of one kilometer on either side)
* Agriculture and [[timber]] production
* Industrial activities during the last 30–70 years, such as [[logging]], [[mining]], oil and [[gas exploration]] and extraction, [[peat extraction]]

Areas with evidence of low intensity and old disturbances are treated as subject to “background” influence and are eligible for inclusion in an IFL. Sources of background influence include local shifting cultivation activities, diffuse grazing by domesticated animals, low-intensity selective logging and hunting.

This definition builds on and refines the concept of a frontier forest as has been used by the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;[http://www.globalforestwatch.org/english/pdfs/Last_Frontier_Forests.pdf Bryant D., Nielsen D., Tangley L. (1997) "The last frontier forests: ecosystems and economies on the edge". World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation value==
{{See also|High conservation value areas}}

Most of the world’s original [[forests]] have either been lost to conversion or altered by logging and forest management. Forests that still combine large size with insignificant human influence are becoming increasingly important as their global extent continues to shrink.

[[Ecosystems]] are generally better able to support their natural biological diversity and ecological processes the lower their exposure to humans and the greater their area. They are also better able to absorb and recover from disturbance (resistance and resilience).

Fragmentation and loss of natural habitats are the main factors threatening plant and animal species with [[extinction]]. Forest [[biodiversity]] largely depends on intact forest landscapes. Large roaming animals (such as forest elephants, great apes, bears, wolves, tigers, jaguars, eagles, deer, etc.) especially require that intact forest landscapes be preserved. Loss of natural habitat can occur through introduction of forest [[monoculture]] or by [[even aged timber management]], which are also destructive of biodiversity&lt;ref&gt;Philip Joseph Burton. 2003. ''Towards sustainable management of the [[boreal forest]]'' 1039 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and wildlife abundance. For example, many wildlife species such as the [[wild turkey]] depend upon variegation of tree ages and sizes for its optimal sub-canopy flight;&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=2199 ''Wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]&lt;/ref&gt; forests that have been managed for even aged composition fail to achieve abundance values of the wild turkey and many other organisms.

Large natural forest areas are also important for maintaining ecological processes and supplying [[ecosystem services]] like water and air purification, nutrient cycling, [[carbon sequestration]], [[erosion]] and [[flood control]].

The conservation value of forest landscapes that are free from human disturbance is therefore high, although it varies among regions. At the same time the cost of conserving large unpopulated areas is often low. The same factors that have kept them from being developed, such as remoteness and low economic value, also help to reduce the cost of protecting them.&lt;ref name="Yaroshenko"&gt;[http://www.globalforestwatch.org/english/russia/pdf/GFW_Russia_Report_en.pdf Yaroshenko A., Potapov P., Turubanova S. (2001) The Last Intact Forest Landscapes of Northern European Russia. Greenpeace Russia and Global Forest Watch, Moscow.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several international initiatives to protect forest biodiversity ([[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]]), to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ([[IGBP]], [[REDD]]&lt;ref&gt;http://un-redd.net/&lt;/ref&gt;), and to stimulate use of sustainable forest management practices ([[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]) require that large natural forest areas be preserved. Mapping, conservation and monitoring of intact forest landscapes is a therefore a task of global importance.

==IFL mapping initiatives==
[[Image:Iflmap.png|thumb|400px|right|The world's IFLs&lt;ref name="Potapov"&gt;[http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss2/art51/]
Potapov P., Yaroshenko A., Turubanova S., Dubinin M., Laestadius L., Thies C., Aksenov D., Egorov A., Yesipova Y., Glushkov I., Karpachevskiy M., Kostikova A., Manisha A., Tsybikova E., Zhuravleva I. (2008) "Mapping the World’s Intact Forest Landscapes by Remote Sensing". ''Ecology and Society'' 13 (2):51&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Several attempts have been made since the 1990s to map the remaining extent of large natural forests. At the global level, these include: wilderness area maps by McCloskey and Spalding;&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey J.M., Spalding H. (1989) A reconnaissance level inventory of the amount of wilderness remaining in the world. ''Ambio'' 18(4):221-227&lt;/ref&gt; human footprint map by Sanderson, et al.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcs.org/sw-high_tech_tools/landscapeecology/humanfootprintatlas Sanderson E.W., Jaiteh M., Levy M.A., Redford K.H., Wannebo A.V., Woolmer G. (2002) "The human footprint and the last of the wild". ''BioScience'' 52(10):891-904]&lt;/ref&gt; and frontier forests map by Bryant, et al.&lt;ref name="Bryant" /&gt; These efforts have generally combined already existing maps and information to identify areas of low human impact at a coarse scale, typically no finer than 1:16 million.

The IFL mapping initiatives differ from these by using the IFL definition mentioned above, by using information from satellites in addition to other sources, and by producing results at a much finer scale, approximately 1:1 million.

The first regional IFL map was presented by Greenpeace Russia in 2001, covering northern European Russia.&lt;ref name="Yaroshenko" /&gt; The report also contains a complete description of the IFL concept and the mapping algorithm.

A number of regional IFL maps were presented in 2002–2006, using similar methods, by a group of scientists and environmental non-governmental organizations under the framework of [[Global Forest Watch]], an initiative of the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-forest-watch Global Forest watch reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the same method, a global IFL map was prepared in 2005–2006 under the leadership of Greenpeace, with contributions from the Biodiversity Conservation Center, International Socio-Ecological Union, Transparent World (Russia), Finnish Nature League, Forest Watch Indonesia, and [[Global Forest Watch]].&lt;ref name="Potapov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intactforests.org/publications/forestmapreport_preview.pdf Greenpeace (2006) Roadmap to Recovery: The World's Last Intact Forest Landscapes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The global IFL map relies on publicly available high spatial resolution [[satellite imagery]] provided by Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) and [[USGS]] and on a simple and consistent set of criteria.

==Implementation of the IFL concept==
The IFL concept is a useful tool for making, implementing, and monitoring policy in the realms of sustainable forest management, conservation and climate, as shown by the following examples.

===Forest degradation assessed by IFL monitoring===

The distinction between intact and non-intact forest landscapes can be used to account for losses of carbon from forest degradation, as proposed by Mollicone, et al.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | year=2007 | title=An incentive mechanism for reducing emissions from conversion of intact and non-intact forests. | journal=Climatic Change | volume=83 | issue=4 | pages=477–493

* it provides a globally consistent and highly detailed snapshot of the ecological integrity of the world’s forest biomes at the beginning of the new millennium (approximately year 2000)
* the method that was used to create the map can easily be adapted into a monitoring method that uses high spatial resolution satellite images
* its high precision and fine scale make it a meaningful baseline for assessment of small-scale disturbances that can be detected by remotely sensed data

===Nature conservation strategies formulated using IFL maps===
Conservation of large IFLs is a robust and cost-effective way to protect biodiversity and maintain ecological integrity and should therefore be an important component of a global conservation strategy. The remoteness and large size of these areas provide the best guarantee for their continued intactness. Withdrawing remaining intact areas from the production base would lead to small or negligible economic loss.

Russian NGOs have, for example, used IFL maps to argue that the most valuable of the remaining intact natural landscapes of northern European Russia and Far East be preserved, and to propose several new national parks: Kutsa and Hibiny (Murmansk Region), Kalevalsky (Karelia Republic) and Onezhskoye Pomorye (Arkhangelsk Region).

===Sustainable forest management underpinned by IFL maps===
Several boreal countries are using the IFL concept in the context of forest certification. One of the categories of High Conservation Value Forest used by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsc.org/keepout/en/content_areas/77/134/files/FSC_STD_01_001_V4_0_EN_FSC_Principles_and_Criteria.pdf Forest Stewardship Council (2004) FSC International standard. FSC principles and criteria for forest stewardship (FSC-STD-01-001). Bonn, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; is analogous to that of IFLs. The formulation used in the Canadian and Russian national [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] standards—globally, nationally, or regionally significant forest landscapes, un-fragmented by permanent infrastructure and of a size to maintain viable populations of most species—calls for IFL maps for implementation. IFLs are directly mentioned among other categories of High Conservation Value Forest in the [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Controlled Wood standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsc.org/keepout/en/content_areas/77/134/files/FSC_STD_40_005_V2_1_EN_Company_Evaluation_of_Controlled_Wood.pdf Forest Stewardship Council (2006) FSC standard for company evaluation of FSC Controlled Wood (FSC-STD-40-005). Bonn, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several retailers, including [[IKEA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikea-group.ikea.com/repository/documents/917.pdf IKEA Trading und Design AG (2005) IWAY Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lowe's,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=pg&amp;p=PressReleases/wood_policy.html Lowe's (2008) Lowe's Policy on the Wood Contained in its Products]&lt;/ref&gt; have committed not to use wood from IFLs unless intactness values are preserved. Others, such as [[Bank of America]], invest only in companies that maintain such values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofamerica.com/environment/index.cfm?template=env_workrel Bank of America Corporation (2008) Bank of America forests practices - global corporate investment bank policy]&lt;/ref&gt; These companies use regional IFL maps to implement their policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6476">In [[Marxist theory]], '''interpellation''' is an important concept regarding the notion of [[ideology]]. It is associated in particular with the work of French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Louis Althusser]]|year=1971|title=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes towards an Investigation)|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm|journal=Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays}}(Verso: 1970, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, every society is made up of [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]] (ISAs) and [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Repressive State Apparatuses]] (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the relations to production of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which [[ideology]], embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s' identities through the process of "hailing" them in social interactions.

Althusser’s thought has made significant contributions to other French philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Derrida]], [[Kristeva]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]].

== Overview ==
In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Althusser introduces the concepts of Ideological State Apparatuses (ISA), Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs), ideology, and interpellation. In his writing, Althusser argues that "there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This notion of subjectivity becomes central to his writings.

To illustrate this concept, Althusser gives the example of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside asks "Who is there?" and only opens the door once the "It’s me" from the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes in "a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Althusser’s central thesis is that "you and I are always already subjects" and are constantly engaging in everyday rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us subjected to ideology.

Althusser goes further to argue that "all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects" and emphasizes that "ideology ‘acts’ or ‘functions’ in such a way that it ... ‘transforms’ the individual into subjects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is made possible through Althusser’s notion of interpellation or hailing which is a non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police officer shouts (or hails) "Hey, you there!" and an individual turns around and so-to-speak ‘answers’ the call, he becomes a subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.

Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities.

Althusser's argument here strongly draws from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s concept of the [[mirror stage]]. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the "I" and the "subject", Althusser collapses both concepts into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Other applications ==
German philosophers [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] employ a method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in their text ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', although they do so 26 years before "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" was released. Rather than situating their analysis on the State, Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the mass media is responsible for the construction of passive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; So unlike the police officer in Althusser’s example who reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media has now taken over this role and interpellates, or hails at, the passive consumer.

[[Feminism|Feminist]] scholar and [[Queer theory|queer]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] has critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight the [[Social constructionism|social construction]] of [[Gender identity|gender identities]]. She argues that by hailing "It’s a boy/girl," the newborn baby is ultimately positioned as subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media theorist [[David Gauntlett]] argues that "interpellation occurs when a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV show, for example, this
uncritical consumption means that the text has ''interpellated'' us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to tacitly accept a particular approach to the world."&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett. ''Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction''. London: Routledge, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jin''' ({{zh|s=晋语|t=晉語|p=jìnyǔ}}) is a group of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects or languages]] spoken by roughly 63&amp;nbsp;million people in northern [[China]]. Its geographical distribution covers most of [[Shanxi]] province except for the lower [[Fen River]] valley, much of central [[Inner Mongolia]] and adjoining areas in [[Hebei]], [[Henan]], and [[Shaanxi]] provinces. The status of Jin is disputed among linguists: Some prefer to classify it as a dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], but others set it apart as a closely related, but separate sister-language to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

==Classification==
Until the 1980s, Jin dialects were universally included within [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In 1985, however, [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] proposed that Jin should be considered a separate top-level dialect group, similar to [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. His main criterion was that Jin dialects had preserved the [[entering tone]] as a separate category, still marked with a glottal stop as in the Wu dialects, but distinct in this respect from most other Mandarin dialects.

Other linguists have subsequently adopted this classification. However, some linguists still do not agree that Jin should be considered a separate dialect group for these reasons:{{sfn|Yan|2006|pp=60–61, 67–69}}{{sfn|Kurpaska|2010|pp=74–75}}
#Use of the entering tone as a diagnostic feature is inconsistent with the way that all other Chinese dialect groups have been delineated based on the reflexes of the [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials.
#Certain other Mandarin dialects also preserve the glottal stop, especially the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Jianghuai]] dialects, and so far, no linguist has claimed that these dialects should also be split from Mandarin.

In the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'', Jin was divided into 8 subgroups:{{sfn|Kurpaska|2010|p=68}}
;Bingzhou
:spoken in central [[Shanxi]] (the ancient [[Bing Province]]), including [[Taiyuan]].
;Lüliang
:spoken in western Shanxi (including [[Lüliang]]) and northern [[Shaanxi]].
;Shangdang
:spoken in the area of [[Changzhi]] (ancient [[Shangdang]]) in southeastern Shanxi.
;Wutai
:spoken in parts of northern Shanxi (including [[Wutai County]]) and central [[Inner Mongolia]].
;Da–Bao
:spoken in parts of northern Shanxi and central Inner Mongolia, including [[Baotou]].
;Zhang-Hu
:spoken in [[Zhangjiakou]] in northwestern [[Hebei]] and parts of central Inner Mongolia, including [[Hohhot]].
;Han-Xin
:spoken in southeastern Shanxi, southern Hebei (including [[Handan]]) and northern [[Henan]] (including [[Xinxiang]]).
;Zhi-Yan
:spoken in [[Zhidan County]] and [[Yanchuan County]] in northern Shaanxi.

==Phonology==
Unlike most varieties of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], Jin has preserved a final [[glottal stop]], which is the remnant of a final [[stop consonant]] ({{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}}). This is in common with the [[Early Mandarin]] of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (c. 14th century AD) and with a number of modern southern varieties of Chinese. In Middle Chinese, syllables closed with a stop consonant had no tone; Chinese linguists, however, prefer to categorize such syllables as belonging to a separate tone class, traditionally called the "[[entering tone]]". Syllables closed with a [[glottal stop]] in Jin are still toneless, or alternatively, Jin can be said to still maintain the entering tone. (In standard Mandarin Chinese, syllables formerly ending with a glottal stop have been reassigned to one of the other tone classes in a [[Checked tone#Mandarin|seemingly random fashion]].)

Jin employs extremely complex [[tone sandhi]], or tone changes that occur when words are put together into phrases. The tone sandhi of Jin is notable in two ways among Chinese varieties:{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Tone sandhi rules depend on the grammatical structure of the words being put together. Hence, an adjective–noun compound may go through different sets of changes compared to a verb–object compound.
* There are tones that merge when words are pronounced alone, but behave differently (and hence are differentiated) during tone sandhi.

==Grammar==
Jin readily employs prefixes such as 圪 {{IPA|/kəʔ/}}, 忽 {{IPA|/xəʔ/}}, and 入 {{IPA|/zəʔ/}}, in a variety of [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] constructions. For example:&lt;br /&gt;
入鬼 "fool around" &lt; 鬼 "ghost, devil"

In addition, there are a number of words in Jin that evolved, evidently, by splitting a mono-syllabic word into two, adding an 'l' in between (cf. [[Ubbi Dubbi]], but with /l/ instead of /b/). For example:

{{IPA|/pəʔ ləŋ/}} &lt; 蹦 {{IPA|pəŋ}} "hop"&lt;br /&gt;
{{IPA|/tʰəʔ luɤ/}} &lt; 拖 {{IPA|tʰuɤ}} "drag"&lt;br /&gt;
{{IPA|/kuəʔ la/}} &lt; 刮 {{IPA|kua}} "scrape"&lt;br /&gt;
{{IPA|/xəʔ lɒ̃/}} &lt; 巷 {{IPA|xɒ̃}} "street"

A similar process can in fact be found in most Mandarin dialects (e.g. 窟窿 kulong &lt; 孔 kong), but it is especially common in Jin.

This may be a kind of reservation for double-initials in [[Old Chinese]]. For example, the character 孔 (pronounced {{IPA|/kʰoːŋ/}} in Mandarin) which appears more often as 窟窿 {{IPA|/kʰuəʔ luŋ/}} in Jin, had the pronunciation like {{IPA|/kʰloːŋ/}} in [[Old Chinese]].

==Vocabulary==
Some dialects of Jin make a three-way distinction in [[demonstrative]]s. (Modern English, for example, has only a two-way distinction between "this" and "that", with "yonder" being archaic.)

'''Joseba Sarrionandia Uribelarrea''' ([[Iurreta]], [[Biscay]], April 13, 1958 – ) is a [[Basque people|Basque]] writer who has published a large number of books of poetry and short stories, as well as novels. He has been awarded on numerous occasions for his work, and is nowadays a respected literary personality in the Basque Country.

In the early 80s, he was member of the [[Basque separatist]] group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. In 1985 he escaped from prison and since then he lived underground for decades while continuing to create and publish. In November 2016, it was revealed that he lives in Cuba, where he holds a position as lecturer at the [[University of Havana]].

==Biography==
He earned a [[Basque language|Basque Philology]] PhD from the [[University of Deusto]], [[Bilbao]] and started working as a Basque language teacher. He taught [[phonetics]] in the [[Bergara]] center of the [[UNED]] and also in the [[Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea]] and wrote pieces for ''[[Zeruko Argia]]'', ''[[Anaitasuna]]'', ''[[Jakin (magazine)|Jakin]]'' and ''[[Oh Euzkadi]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=Correo&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20111003/mas-actualidad/cultura/polemico-premio-euskadi-ensayo-201110031234.html |title = El Gobierno vasco retiene el Premio Euskadi de Ensayo a Sarrionandia por su pasado etarra |publisher = El Correo |language = spanish |date = 3 October 2011 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the [[Pott Banda]] group along with [[Bernardo Atxaga]], [[Manu Ertzilla]], [[Ruper Ordorika]], [[Jon Juaristi]] and [[Joxemari Iturralde]]. He also created the ''Ibaizabal'' magazine. He worked with short narrations and also translated books, notably [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.

In 1980, while a member of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] he was arrested by Spanish police and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Since then the realities of prison have appeared in his writings. In 1985 on [[San Fermin]] day (July 7) he escaped from prison with [[Iñaki Pikabea]] as there was a concert in the jail with Basque singer [[Imanol Larzabal]]. They hid themselves inside a loudspeaker.&lt;ref name=Pais3&gt;{{cite web |url = http://elpais.com/diario/1985/07/08/espana/489621605_850215.html |title = Dos 'etarras' lograron fugarse de la carcel de Martutene escondidos en aparatos de megafonía tras un recital |author = Javier García |publisher = El País |language = spanish |date = 8 July 1985 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Basque Radical Rock]] group [[Kortatu]] created the song ''[[Sarri, Sarri]]'' in honor of this. The escape was planned with theater critic [[Mikel Albisu]], who would become the leader of ETA. During three months, the two fugitives and Antza were hiding in a flat in [[San Sebastián]], before moving to France.&lt;ref name=Correo /&gt;

Since that day he has lived in secret and the topic of banishment/exile is foremost in his writing. In his novel ''[[Lagun Izoztua]]'' (in [[basque language|Basque]] ''The Frozen Friend'') he writes about banishment. He has written books and poems which have been sung by different Basque singers as [[Jexuxmai Lopetegi]], [[Mikel Laboa]], [[Ruper Ordorika]] and [[Fermin Muguruza]]. There is also an audio book called ''Hau da ene ondasun guzia'' with his voice reading poems and many songs performed by different singers.

On 3 October 2011, he was awarded the Euskadi Prize for Essay in Basque for his work ''Moroak gara behelaino artean?'' (''Are we Moors in the fog?'') on the miseries of colonialism; however, the Basque Government withheld the prize sum of 18,000 euros until the author's status was resolved.&lt;ref name=Pais&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2011/10/03/actualidad/1317592801_850215.html |title = Controvertido Premio Euskadi de ensayo para Joseba Sarrionandia |author = Borja Hermoso |publisher = El País |language = spanish |date = 3 October 2011 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diagonal&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/culturas/la-paz-supone-la-renuncia-imponer-relaciones-poder.html |title = "La paz supone la renuncia a imponer relaciones de poder" |author = Manuel Tabernas |publisher = Diagonal |language = spanish |date = 10 June 2013 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, judges and lawyers interviewed by [[Cadena SER]] confirmed that Sarrionandia could not be prosecuted by Spanish law, as more than 20 years had passed since his original prison sentence and his escape. While terrorist acts have no time limit, the provision applies only if there was at least one victim.&lt;ref name=Pais2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cadenaser.com/emisora/2011/10/03/radio_bilbao/1317599430_850215.html |title = Los delitos de Joseba Sarrionandia han prescrito |author = Javier Alvarez |publisher = Cadena SER |language = spanish |date = 3 October 2011 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a month and a half, the Spanish High Court confirmed to the Basque government that Sarrionandia was 'clean', with no criminal or civil liability. The prize amount was handed over to his family.&lt;ref name=Diario2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariovasco.com/v/20111123/cultura/jueces-afirman-sarrionandia-esta-20111123.html |title = Los jueces afirman que Sarrionandia está 'limpio' y la familia recoge hoy el premio |author = Inaki Esteban |publisher = [[Diario Vasco]] |language = spanish |date = 11 November 2011 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Spanish counter-terrorism sources, the writer has been hiding in [[Cuba]]. In 2014, he accepted the invitation of [[Mondragon University]] to give two lectures in [[Eskoriatza]]. It would have been his first public appearance since his escape in 1985.&lt;ref name=Diario&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariovasco.com/politica/201407/10/joseba-sarrionandia-regresara-cuba-20140710165227.html |title = Joseba Sarrionandia regresará de Cuba para ofrecer dos charlas en Gipuzkoa |author = Vasco Press |publisher = [[El Diario Vasco]] |language = spanish |date = 10 July 2014 |accessdate = 11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he cancelled the trip because he did not obtain the traveling permissions he needed.&lt;ref name=EITB&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eitb.eus/es/cultura/literatura/detalle/2403872/sarrionandia-no-podra-asistir-cursos-mondragon-unibertsitatea/ |title = Sarrionandia no podrá asistir a los cursos de Mondragon Unibertsitatea |publisher = EITB |language = spanish |date = 11 July 2014 |accessdate = 11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Cuban government has not acknowledged his presence, ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' reported in 2015 that Sarrionandia went to the Spanish consulate to regulate his status.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/02/28/54f119f5e2704e5d128b4579.html |title = España pide la extradición de dos históricos etarras a Cuba |author = Ángeles Escrivá |publisher = El Mundo |language = spanish |date = 28 February 2015 |accessdate = 11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernardo Atxaga]] divided Sarrionandia's works in four distinct chronological phases. In the first phase, a young Sarrionandia wanted to be a part of Basque literature through a literary magazine. In the second phase, the imprisoned poet talked about suffering (''La literatura y la revolución''). In the third phase, after his escape, his themes were exile and homeland (''Geografía'', ''He llegado a casa casi a medianoche''). In the current phase, "the brightest of them all," Sarrionandia is more serene, with a sense of humor and irony. Atxaga speculates on a fifth phase, based on the poem ''La vida ha llegado y tiene tus ojos,'' where the "life that has arrived" could be a child.&lt;ref name=Deia&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.deia.com/2015/06/03/ocio-y-cultura/cultura/atxaga-defiende-que-a-sarrionandia-se-le-encuentra-en-la-poesia-de-su-vida |title = Atxaga defiende que a Sarrionandia se le encuentra en la poesía de su vida |author = Leyre Eguskiza |publisher = Deia |language = spanish |date = 3 June 2015 |accessdate = 20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The blacksmith slave'''
&lt;br /&gt;Captive in the rainforests of the West
&lt;br /&gt;they brought you to Rome, slave,
&lt;br /&gt;they gave you the blacksmith work
&lt;br /&gt;and you make chains.
&lt;br /&gt;The red iron that you carry out the oven
&lt;br /&gt;can be adapted as you want,
&lt;br /&gt;you can make swords
&lt;br /&gt;in order that your people could break the chains,
&lt;br /&gt;but you, this slave,
&lt;br /&gt;you make chains, more chains.

The '''Guna language''', spoken by the [[Guna people]] of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]], belongs to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]].

==History==
The Guna were living in what is now Northern Colombia and the Darién Province of Panama at the time of the Spanish invasion, and only later began to move westward towards what is now Guna Yala due to a conflict with the Spanish and other indigenous groups.  Centuries before the conquest, the Guna arrived in [[South America]] as part of a [[Chibchan]] migration moving east from [[Central America]].  At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba and near the borders of what are now [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Caldas Department|Caldas]]. [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] explored the coast of Colombia in 1500 and 1501.  They spent the most time in the [[Gulf of Urabá]], where they made contact with the Guna.

In far Eastern Guna Yala, the community of New Caledonia is near the site where [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorers tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a [[Darien scheme|colony in the "New World"]]. The bankruptcy of the expedition has been cited as one of the motivations of the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Acts of Union]].

There is a wide consensus regarding the migrations of Guna from Colombia and the Darien towards what is now Guna Yala.  These migrations were caused partly by wars with the [[Catio people]], but some sources contend that they were mostly due to bad treatment by the Spanish invaders. The Guna themselves attribute their migration to Guna Yala to conflicts with the native peoples, and their migration to the islands to the excessive mosquito populations on the mainland.

During the first decades of the twentieth century, the Panamanian government attempted to suppress many of the traditional customs. This was bitterly resisted, culminating in a short-lived yet successful revolt in 1925 known as the [[Tule Revolution]] (or people revolution), led by Iguaibilikinya Nele Gantule of Ustupu  and supported by American adventurer and part-time diplomat [[Richard Marsh (diplomat)|Richard Marsh]]&lt;ref name=howe/&gt; - and a treaty in which the Panamanians agreed to give the Guna some degree of cultural autonomy.&lt;ref name=howe&gt;James Howe. ''A PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT KNEEL: Panama, the United States, and the San Blas Kuna'' (Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry). Smithsonian, 1998. {{ISBN|978-1-56098-865-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonemes==

Most consonants may appear either as short (lax) or long (tense).  The long consonants only appear intervocalically. However, they are not always a result of morpheme concatenation, and they often differ phonetically from the short analogue.  For example, the long stop consonants p, t, and k are pronounced as voiceless, usually with longer duration than in English.  The short counterparts are pronounced as voiced b, d, and g when they are between vowels or beside [[sonorant]] consonants m, n, l, r, y, or w (they are written using b, d, and g in the Guna alphabet).  At the beginnings of words, the stops may be pronounced either as voiced or voiceless; and are usually pronounced as voiceless word-finally  (Long consonants do not appear word-initially or word-finally).  In an even more extreme case, the long s is pronounced [tʃ].  Underlyingly long consonants become short before another consonant. The letter ''w'' may be pronounced as either [v] or [w] depending on dialect and position.

In 2010, the National Guna Congress decided a spelling reform by which long consonants should be written with double letters. Equally the phonemes /p, t, k/ that may sound like [p, t, k] or [b, d, g] are represented by {{angbr|b, d, g}} in all positions. Equally the old digraph {{angbr|ch}} becomes {{angbr|ss}} or {{angbr|ds}} depending on its morphological procedence (narassole [naraʧole] &lt; naras + sole, godsa [koʧa] 'called' &lt; godde 'to call' + -sa (past). So the reformed orthography uses only the fifteen letters {{angbr|b, d, g, l, m, n, r, s, w, y; a, e, i, o, u}} for transcribing all the sounds of the language, with the digraphs {{angbr|bb, dd, gg, ll, mm, nn}} for the tense consonants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120206093117/http://www.congresogeneralkuna.com/ISGAR.Dic.%20010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other phonological rules==

The alveolar /s/ becomes the postalveolar [ʃ] after /n/ or /t/.
Both long and short /k/ become [j] before another consonant.

==Morphology==
Guna is an [[agglutinative language]] which contains words of up to about 9 morphemes, although words of two or three morphemes are more common. Most of the morphological complexity is found in the verb, which contains suffixes of tense and aspect, plurals, negatives, position (sitting, standing, etc.) and various adverbials. The verb is not marked for person.

In the [[formal language theory]] of [[computer science]], '''left recursion''' is a special case of [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] where a string is recognized as part of a language by the fact that it decomposes into a string from that same language (on the left) and a suffix (on the right).  For instance, &lt;math&gt;1+2+3&lt;/math&gt; can be recognized as a sum because it can be broken into &lt;math&gt;1+2&lt;/math&gt;, also a sum, and &lt;math&gt;{}+3&lt;/math&gt;, a suitable suffix.

In terms of [[context-free grammar]], a [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols#Nonterminal symbols|nonterminal]] is left-recursive if the leftmost symbol in one of its productions is itself (in the case of direct left recursion) or can be made itself by some sequence of substitutions (in the case of indirect left recursion).

== Definition ==
A grammar is left-recursive if and only if there exists a nonterminal symbol &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that can derive to a [[Formal grammar#The semantics of grammars|sentential form]] with itself as the leftmost symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.may.ie/~jpower/Courses/parsing/parsing.pdf#search='indirect%20left%20recursion'  Notes on Formal Language Theory and Parsing], James Power, Department of Computer Science National University of Ireland, Maynooth Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland.[[JPR02]]&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt; A \Rightarrow^+ A\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow^+&lt;/math&gt; indicates the operation of making one or more substitutions, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is any sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols.

=== Direct left recursion ===
Direct left recursion occurs when the definition can be satisfied with only one substitution.  It requires a rule of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A \to A\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of nonterminals and terminals . For example, the rule
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression} \to \mathit{Expression} + \mathit{Term}&lt;/math&gt;
is directly left-recursive. A left-to-right [[recursive descent parser]] for this rule might look like
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
void Expression() {
  Expression();
  match('+');
  Term();
}
&lt;/source&gt;
and such code would fall into infinite recursion when executed.

=== Indirect left recursion ===
Indirect left recursion occurs when the definition of left recursion is satisfied via several substitutions.  It entails a set of rules following the pattern
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 \to \beta_0A_1\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_1 \to \beta_1A_2\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_n \to \beta_nA_0\alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; are any sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols.  Note that these sequences may be empty.  The derivation
:&lt;math&gt;A_0\Rightarrow\beta_0A_1\alpha_0\Rightarrow^+ A_1\alpha_0\Rightarrow\beta_1A_2\alpha_1\alpha_0\Rightarrow^+\cdots\Rightarrow^+ A_0\alpha_n\dots\alpha_1\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt;
then gives &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; as leftmost in its final sentential form.

== Removing left recursion ==
Left recursion often poses problems for parsers, either because it leads them into infinite recursion (as in the case of most [[top-down parsing|top-down parsers]]) or because they expect rules in a normal form that forbids it (as in the case of many [[bottom-up parsing|bottom-up parsers]], including the [[CYK algorithm]]).  Therefore, a grammar is often preprocessed to eliminate the left recursion.

=== Removing direct left recursion ===
The general algorithm to remove direct left recursion follows. Several improvements to this method have been made.&lt;ref name="Moore2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert C.|title=Removing Left Recursion from Context-Free Grammars|journal=6th Applied Natural Language Processing Conference|date=May 2000|pages=249–255|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/68869/naacl2k-proc-rev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For a left-recursive nonterminal &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, discard any rules of the form &lt;math&gt;A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; and consider those that remain:
:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow A\alpha_1 \mid \ldots \mid A\alpha_n \mid \beta_1 \mid \ldots \mid \beta_m &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty sequence of nonterminals and terminals, and
* each &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of nonterminals and terminals that does not start with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
Replace these with two sets of productions, one set for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \beta_1A^\prime \mid \ldots \mid \beta_mA^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
and another set for the fresh nonterminal &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; (often called the "tail" or the "rest"):
:&lt;math&gt;A^\prime \rightarrow \alpha_1A^\prime \mid \ldots \mid \alpha_nA^\prime \mid \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Repeat this process until no direct left recursion remains.

As an example, consider the rule set
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression} \rightarrow \mathit{Expression}+\mathit{Expression} \mid \mathit{Integer} \mid \mathit{String}&lt;/math&gt;
This could be rewritten to avoid left recursion as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression} \rightarrow \mathit{Integer}\,\mathit{Expression}' \mid \mathit{String}\,\mathit{Expression}'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression}' \rightarrow {}+\mathit{Expression} \mid \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

=== Removing all left recursion ===
By establishing a [[topological ordering]] on nonterminals, the above process can be extended to also eliminate indirect left recursion {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}:
:'''Inputs''' ''A grammar: a set of nonterminals &lt;math&gt;A_1,\ldots,A_n&lt;/math&gt; and their productions''
:'''Output''' ''A modified grammar generating the same language but without left recursion''
:# ''For each nonterminal &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;:''
:## ''Repeat until an iteration leaves the grammar unchanged:''
:### ''For each rule &lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; being a sequence of terminals and nonterminals:''
:#### ''If &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; begins with a nonterminal &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;i&lt;/math&gt;:''
:##### ''Let &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; without its leading &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt;.''
:##### ''Remove the rule &lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;.''
:##### ''For each rule &lt;math&gt;A_j\rightarrow\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt;:''
:###### ''Add the rule &lt;math&gt;A_i\rightarrow\alpha_j\beta_i&lt;/math&gt;.''
:## ''Remove direct left recursion for &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; as described above.''
Note that this algorithm is highly sensitive to the nonterminal ordering; optimizations often focus on choosing this ordering well.{{Clarify|date=November 2015}}

== Pitfalls ==
Although the above transformations preserve the language generated by a grammar, they may change the [[parse tree]]s that [[Witness (mathematics)|witness]] strings' recognition.  With suitable bookkeeping, [[Rewriting#Term rewriting systems|tree rewriting]] can recover the originals, but if this step is omitted, the differences may change the semantics of a parse.

Associativity is particularly vulnerable; left-associative operators typically appear in right-associative-like arrangements under the new grammar.  For example, starting with this grammar:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression} \rightarrow \mathit{Expression}\,-\,\mathit{Term} \mid \mathit{Term}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Term} \rightarrow \mathit{Term}\,*\,\mathit{Factor} \mid \mathit{Factor}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Factor} \rightarrow (\mathit{Expression}) \mid \mathit{Integer}&lt;/math&gt;
the standard transformations to remove left recursion yield the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression} \rightarrow \mathit{Term}\ \mathit{Expression}'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Expression}' \rightarrow {} - \mathit{Term}\ \mathit{Expression}' \mid \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Term} \rightarrow \mathit{Factor}\ \mathit{Term}'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Term}' \rightarrow {} * \mathit{Factor}\ \mathit{Term}' \mid \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Factor} \rightarrow (\mathit{Expression}) \mid \mathit{Integer}&lt;/math&gt;

Parsing the string "1 - 2 - 3" with the first grammar in an LALR parser (which can handle left-recursive grammars) would have resulted in the parse tree:
[[File:Left-recursive-parse-of-a-double-subtraction.png|center|Left-recursive parsing of a double subtraction]]
This parse tree groups the terms on the left, giving the correct semantics ''(1 - 2) - 3''.

Parsing with the second grammar gives
[[File:Right-recursive-parse-of-a-double-subtraction.png|center|Right-recursive parsing of a double subtraction]]
which, properly interpreted, signifies ''1 + (-2 + (-3))'', also correct, but less faithful to the input and much harder to implement for some operators.  Notice how terms to the right appear deeper in the tree, much as a right-recursive grammar would arrange them for ''1 - (2 - 3)''.

== Accommodating left recursion in top-down parsing==
A [[formal grammar]] that contains left recursion cannot be [[parse]]d by a [[LL parser|LL(k)-parser]] or other naive [[recursive descent parser]] unless it is converted to a [[Weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] right-recursive form. In contrast, left recursion is preferred for [[LALR parser]]s because it results in lower stack usage than [[right recursion]]. However, more sophisticated top-down parsers can implement general [[context-free grammar]]s by use of curtailment. In 2006, Frost and Hafiz described an algorithm which accommodates [[ambiguous grammar]]s with direct left-recursive [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rules]].&lt;ref name="FrostHafiz2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=R.|author2=R. Hafiz |date=2006|title=A New Top-Down Parsing Algorithm to Accommodate Ambiguity and Left Recursion in Polynomial Time.|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|volume=41|issue=5|pages=46–54|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1149988|doi=10.1145/1149982.1149988}}, available from the author at http://hafiz.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/pub/p46-frost.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; That algorithm was extended to a complete [[parsing]] algorithm to accommodate indirect as well as direct left recursion in [[polynomial]] time, and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007.&lt;ref name="FrostHafizCallaghan2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=R.|author2=R.

'''Manuel Zapata Olivella''' ([[Santa Cruz de Lorica|Santa Cruz of Lorica]], [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba]], 17 March 1920 – [[Bogotá|Bogota]], 19 November 2004) was a [[Medicine|doctor]], [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[Colombia]]n [[Literature|writer]].

== Biography ==
When he was a boy, his father, the professor Antonio María Zapata Vásquez, moved  with his family to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]]. Zapata Olivella's younger sister, [[Delia Zapata Olivella]], is a Colombian dancer and folklorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA605|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|authorlink=Kwame Anthony Appiah|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780195170559|page=605|language=en|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied Medicine in the [[National University of Colombia]], in Bogota. In [[Mexico City]], he worked in the Psychiatric Sanatorium of Dr. Ramírez and afterwards in the Hospital Ortopédico of Alfonso Ortiz Thrown. He also worked for the magazine ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' and  for the magazine ''Events for All''. It argued against his brother Virgil by defending the United States, but he later changed his mind after being racially discriminated during a trip to the country.

During his stay in Mexico, he wrote the unpublished novel "Bitter Rice". He published several studies on the cultures of Afrocolombians. He taught in several universities of [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Central America]], and [[Africa]]. He founded and directed the literary magazine ''National Letters''.

The main theme of his narrative is the history and the culture of the inhabitants of the Colombian Caribbean, especially the lives of blacks and natives. His more important work is the novel ''Changó'' (1983), an extensive work that is presented as an epic of the [[Afro-American peoples of the Americas|''afroamericanos'']], narrating their origins in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Manuel Zapata Olivella y la afrocolombianidad - Aurora Boreal|url = http://www.auroraboreal.net/literatura/ensayo/333-manuel-zapata-olivella-y-la-afrocolombianidad|website = www.auroraboreal.net|accessdate = 2015-10-02|last = Luca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, Changó is a culmination of all of his previous writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Fiction in the Works of Manuel Zapata Olivella|last=Captain-Hidalgo|first=Yvonne|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=1993|isbn=0826208916|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His previous novel ''In Chimá is born a saint'' (1964) was a finalist in two contests, the Esso of 1963, in which it was defeated by [[Gabriel García Márquez]] with ''[[In Evil Hour|The bad hour]]'', and the Prize of Brief Novel Seix Barral, in which first place went to ''[[The Time of the Hero|The city and the dogs]]'' by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]].

==Research areas==
McGowan specializes in studying the subtle ways that speech can be used to alter normative facts, and how this technique may be involved in the perpetuation of unjust social systems.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She argues that conversational contributions enact normative fact in a way that is not, at the surface, visible, and in a way that in fact requires little authority.&lt;ref name=sep1&gt;{{cite web|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|title=Feminist Philosophy of Language|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her more recent work has generalized this phenomenon to settings that are not entirely conversational, arguing that sexist speech, some pornography, and some types of hate speech are much more harmful than are currently recognized, and that this has significant implications in public and legal debates over the limits of free speech.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She's also interested how one defines the liminal areas of speech; burning a flag, though not an obvious act of speech, is considered protected speech, whereas orally agreeing to a contract for murder for hire, though most certainly speech, is universally not protected.&lt;ref name=Obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Kate McGowan {{!}} Wellesley college|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/philosophy/faculty/mcgowan|publisher=Wellesley College|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">'''Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani''' (1854 - 1896/97) was an Iranian intellectual reformer, [[Babism|Bayani]], and son-in-law of [[Subh-i-Azal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aqa-khan-kermani Encyclopedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varnava, Andrekos, Nicholas Coureas, and Marina Elia, eds. The Minorities of Cyprus: Development patterns and the identity of the internal-exclusion. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, he advocates for political, social, and religious reform characteristic of his generation of intellectuals whose reformist ideas and engagement with sociopolitical themes set the stage for the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906, and the political and literary changes that were to follow.

Kermani was also a literary critic and like many of his contemporaries an advocate of simpler, more accessible prose. He believed that meaning as opposed to the mode of expression exerts real influence on the reader. He thus discouraged the destruction of the natural clarity of language by means of complicated metaphors, difficult words, long sentences, and complex expressions.&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;Iraj Parsinejad, ''A History of Literary Criticism in Iran, 1866-1951'', pps. 72-73. Ibex Publishers (2002) {{ISBN|1-58814-016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani was born in 1854 in [[Kerman]] into a family with a proper position on the socio-economic ladder. There, he was schooled in mathematics, natural science, and theology (''ḥekmat-i ilāhī'') and also learned some French and English. At age 32, because of hardship he faced from the governor of Kerman, he moved to [[Isfahan]] and then [[Tehran]] where he taught Qur'anic interpretation ([[Tafsir|tafsīr]]). Eventually, he ended up in [[Istanbul]] where many Iranian intellectuals resided. There, he wrote letters to the ulema and statesmen of Iran and elsewhere calling for Islamic unity and attacked [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasir al-Din Shah]] and his court, including prime minister [[Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Soltan]]. These attacks motivated the prime minister to seek Kermani’s blood, instructing the Iranian ambassador to Istanbul to convince the Ottomans that Kermani had played a role in the Armenian riots two years earlier. Eventually, the Ottomans turned Kermani over to Iranian authorities and he was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Saba to Nima: 150 Years of Persian Literature: Volume I (Az sabā tā Nīmā: tārīkh-ī 150 sāl adab-i Fārsī: jeld-ī yek)|last=Aryanpour|first=Yahya|publisher=Sherkat-i sahami|year=1972|isbn=|location=Tehran|pages=390|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Royal Cypher]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], surmounted by [[St Edward's Crown]].]]
[[Queen Elizabeth II]] was proclaimed sovereign throughout [[Commonwealth realm|her realms]] after her father, King [[George VI]], died in the night between 5 and 6 February 1952, while Elizabeth was in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. Proclamations were made in different realms on 6, 7, 8, and 11 February (depending on geographic location and time zone). The line of succession was identical in all the Commonwealth realms, but the royal title as proclaimed was not the same in all of them.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Accession Council]] met twice at [[St James's Palace]]: first at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 February, before the Queen had returned from Kenya, to make their proclamation declaring the accession of the new sovereign, as the late king's successor in accordance with the [[line of succession to the British throne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard| jurisdiction=United Kingdom| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1952/feb/06/preamble| house=House of Lords| date=6 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, secondly, at a meeting begun at 10 a.m. on Friday, 8 February, when the Queen was personally present, to receive her oath for the security of the [[Church of Scotland]] and her own personal declaration, pledging that she would always work to uphold constitutional government and to advance the happiness and prosperity of her peoples all the world over.&lt;ref name=trove.nla.gov.au&gt;{{citation| url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49014603| title=Elizabeth's Pledge as Queen Heavy Task Accepted| date=9 February 1952| newspaper=The West Australian| accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her declaration for securing the Protestant succession, as required by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Accession Declaration Act 1910]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Maer| first=Lucinda| last2=Gay| first2=Oonagh| title=The Coronation Oath| date=27 August 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to be made later, at the next state opening of parliament on 4 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpolcon/1615/1615we02.htm| last=Parliament of the United Kingdom| title=Written evidence submitted by Professor Robert Blackburn, PhD, LLD, Professor of Constitutional Law, King's College London| date=November 2011| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Accession Council had completed the formalities for their proclamation on 6 February, it had been issued for publication in a supplement to that day's ''[[London Gazette]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39458|page=757| date=6 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding: 1px; text-align:left; margin:auto; border:1px solid #7BA05B; color:#000000; width:90%;"&gt;{{quote|Upon the intimation that our late Most Gracious Sovereign King George the Sixth had died in his sleep at Sandringham in the early hours of this morning the Lords of the Privy Council assembled this day at St. James's Palace, and gave orders for proclaiming Her present Majesty.&lt;br /&gt;WHEREAS it has pleased Almighty God to call to His Mercy our late Sovereign Lord King [[George VI|George the Sixth]] of Blessed and Glorious memory, by whose Decease the Crown is solely and rightfully come to the High and Mighty Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary:&lt;br&gt;WE, therefore, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this Realm, being here assisted with these His late Majesty's [[Privy Council]], with representatives of other Members of the Commonwealth, with other Principal Gentlemen of Quality, with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of London, do now hereby with one voice and Consent of Tongue and Heart publish and proclaim that the High and Mighty Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary is now, by the death of our late Sovereign of happy memory, become Queen Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of this Realm and of all Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, to whom Her lieges do acknowledge all Faith and constant Obedience with hearty and humble Affection, beseeching God by whom Kings and Queens do reign, to bless the Royal Princess Elizabeth the Second with long and happy Years to reign over us.&lt;br /&gt;Given at St. James's Palace this Sixth Day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-two.}}&lt;/div&gt;

The accession proclamation was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 7 February, quoting the ''London Gazette''. According to the ''Times'', it was expected that the public proclamation would be made in due form by the heralds of the [[College of Arms]]. The practice had been to read it first from the [[Friary Court]] balcony at St James's Palace and, in the [[City of London]], the custom had been to lay it before the Court of Aldermen and to read it, after a ceremony at [[Temple Bar, London]], at the corner of [[Chancery Lane]], in [[Fleet Street]], and at the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].

After the meeting with the Queen at St James's Palace in the morning of 8 February, the accession proclamation was read to the public by the [[Garter King of Arms]], Sir [[George Bellew]], first at 11 a.m. from the Friary Court balcony, then in [[Trafalgar Square]], in [[Fleet Street]], and at the Royal Exchange.&lt;ref name=trove.nla.gov.au/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6510000/newsid_6511800/6511853.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;bbcws=1| title=1952: New Queen proclaimed for UK| publisher=BBC| accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of George VI's death had been formally communicated to the [[House of Assembly (Turks and Caicos Islands)|Legislative Board]] of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (at that time a dependency of [[Jamaica]], itself then a [[Crown colony]]), a proclamation was issued and published there on Friday, 8 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tcmuseum.org/culture-history/royal-events/queen-elizabeth-ii/| title=Culture &amp; History &gt; Royal Events &gt; Queen Elizabeth II &gt; Queen Elizabeth II Biography| publisher=Turks and Caicos National Museum| accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal title==
The proclamation in the United Kingdom marked the first inclusion, by an Accession Council, of the title ''[[Head of the Commonwealth]]'', and the first reference to "representatives of other Members of the Commonwealth" as among those proclaiming. Also, [[the Crown]], which had been referred to as the ''Imperial Crown of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]'', was also now non-specific, and Elizabeth's title was not her official one. These last two points reflected the existence of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (Ireland would not be officially removed from the Queen's title until the year following), as well as the sovereignty of countries over which Elizabeth was now separately queen. However, the Canadian proclamation, necessarily separate due to the country's legal independence from the UK, continued to refer to the new sovereign as Queen of Ireland, and the Crown she inherited as being that of "Great Britain, Ireland and all other His late Majesty's dominions." Elizabeth was also proclaimed Queen of Ireland in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/brit-proclamations.htm#Elizabeth2| title=Proclamations of Accession of English and British Sovereigns (1547-1952)| publisher=Heraldica| accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of the royal style and title in any realm do not as such change the constitutional status or position of the monarch or the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Cox ''The Development of a Separate Crown in New Zealand''[http://www.reocities.com/noelcoxfiles/Development_of_Separate_Crown_in_New_Zealand.pdf] which considers also the positions of Australia and Canada; and see Noel Cox LLM (Hons), PhD, Lecturer, Auckland University of Technology, in Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law Volume 9, Number 3 (September 2002): ''Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence'' (Ontario Court of Appeal).[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ram Shankar Tripathi''' is an Indian scholar of Buddhism, editor and author of a large number of texts focusing on Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist Tantra. Partly inspired by Jagannath Upadhyaya, Ram Shankar Tripathi has been instrumental in reviving the study of Buddhist texts among Sanskritist in India and abroad, having taught a vast number of scholars from different parts of the world, and through a long-lasting association with traditional Buddhist scholars, from Tibet, Burma and elsewhere. Much of the important editorial work from the CUTS (former CIHTS) in Sarnath was encouraged and supported by Ram Shankar Tripathi's guidance; several prominent Tibetan Lamas, as well as a good number of contemporary Buddhologists, have studied with him.

He is the former Dean of the Faculty of Śabdavidyā at the [[Central University of Tibetan Studies]].&lt;ref name="CUTS Annual Report"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuts.ac.in/guestsection/annual_report/AnnualReport2010-11Eng.pdf | title=CUTS Annual Report | publisher=Central University of Tibetan Studies | date=2011 | accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as the Head of the Department of ''Bauddhadarśana'' at the [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]].&lt;ref name="Monastic Dialogue - Seminars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tibethouse.in/content/monastic-dialogue-seminars | title=Monastic Dialogue - Seminars | publisher=Tibet House, New Delhi | date=2015 | accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also associated with the [[Savitribai Phule Pune University]], where he is a visiting faculty of [[Pali]] and Buddhist Studies.&lt;ref name="Collaborative Academic Activities"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/fine_arts/pali/Pali_webfiles/academic.htm | title=Collaborative Academic Activities | publisher=Savitribai Phule Pune University | date=2016 | accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of several books in Hindi and [[Sanskrit]], including ''Sautrāntikadarśanam'',&lt;ref name="Sautrāntikadarsanam"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bibliaimpex.com/index.php?p=sr&amp;Uc=8511&amp;l=0 | title=Sautrantikadarsanam | publisher=Central University of Tibetan Studies | author=Ram Shankar Tripathi | year=1990 | pages=682 | isbn=9788187127734}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has edited [[Dalai Lama]]'s ''The Path to Tranquility: Daily Meditations'',&lt;ref name="The Path to Tranquility: Daily Meditations"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=8074202046&amp;searchurl=an%3Dram%2520shankar%2520tripathi%26fe%3Don | title=The Path to Tranquility: Daily Meditations | publisher=Penguin Books India | author=Dalai Lama | editor=Ram Shankar Tripathi | translator=Thuptan Chhogdup | year=2012 | isbn=9780143418023}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref name="A Direct Path to the Buddha Within"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=Eso6AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA566&amp;lpg=PA566&amp;dq=Ram+Shankar+Tripathi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIOVyq7ysf&amp;sig=zwNni5gyIKjcsbRbdiCO-eSrS7k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1oazT4v7KAhWHORQKHSzLB084FBDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Ram%20Shankar%20Tripathi&amp;f=false | title=A Direct Path to the Buddha Within | publisher=Simon and Schuster | date=2016 | accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hevajratantram: With Muktāvalī Pañjikā of Mahāpaṇḍitācārya Ratnākaraśānti''&lt;ref name="Hevajratantram: With Muktāvalī Pañjikā of Mahāpaṇḍitācārya Ratnākaraśānti"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bagchee.com/books/BB3798/hevajratantram-with-muktavali-panjika-of-mahapanditacarya-ratnakarasanti/ | title=Hevajratantram: With Muktavali Panjika of Mahapanditacarya Ratnakarasanti | publisher=Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies |author1=Ram Shankar Tripathi |author2=Thakur Sain Negi | year=2001 | pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Jainavidyā evaṃ Prākr̥ta''&lt;ref name="Jainavidyā evaṃ Prākr̥ta"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Jainavidy%C4%81_eva%E1%B9%83_Pr%C4%81kr%CC%A5ta.html?id=MbAcAAAAMAAJ | title=Jainavidyā evaṃ Prākr̥ta | publisher=Sampurnanand Sanskrit University |author1=Ram Shankar Tripathi |author2=Gokulacandra Jaina | year=1987 | pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two of his other notable works.

Chalon depicts three of the greatest ballerinas in three of the era's defining roles: (left to right) [[Marie Taglioni]] as the Sylph in [[Filippo Taglioni]]'s 1832 ballet ''La Sylphide''; [[Fanny Elssler]] as Florinda in the dance ''La Cachucha'' from [[Jean Coralli]]'s 1836 ballet ''Le Diable boiteux''; and [[Carlotta Grisi]] as Béatrix in the ''Grand pas de Diane chasseresse'' from [[Albert (dancer)|Albert]]'s 1842 ballet ''La Jolie Fille du Gand''.]]

The '''Romantic ballet''' is defined primarily by an era in [[ballet]] in which the ideas of [[Romanticism]] in art and literature influenced the creation of ballets. The era occurred during the early to mid 19th century primarily at the [[Salle Le Peletier|Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in [[London]]. It is typically considered to have begun with the 1827 début in Paris of the ballerina [[Marie Taglioni]] in the ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'', and to have reached its zenith with the premiere of the [[divertissement]] ''[[Pas de Quatre]]'' staged by the Ballet Master [[Jules Perrot]] in London in 1845. The Romantic ballet had no immediate end, but rather a slow decline. [[Arthur Saint-Léon]]'s 1870 ballet ''[[Coppélia]]'' is considered to be the last work of the Romantic Ballet.

During this era, the development of [[Pointe technique|pointework]], although still at a fairly basic stage, profoundly affected people's perception of the ballerina.  Many lithographs of the period show her virtually floating, poised only on the tip of a toe.  This idea of weightlessness was capitalised on in ballets such as ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and ''[[Giselle]]'', and the famous leap apparently attempted by [[Carlotta Grisi]] in ''[[La Péri (Burgmüller)|La Péri]]''.

Other features which distinguished Romantic ballet were the separate identity of the scenarist or author from the [[Choreography|choreographer]], and the use of specially written music as opposed to a ''[[pastiche]]'' typical of the ballet of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  The invention of [[gas lighting]] enabled gradual changes and enhanced the mysteriousness of many ballets with its softer gleam.  Illusion became more diverse with wires and trap doors being widely used.

==Cult of the ballerina ==

The premiere of the ''Pas de Quatre'' is considered to be the Romantic ballet at its zenith.]]

The Romantic era marked the rise of the [[ballerina]] as a central part of ballet, where previously men had dominated performances. There had always been admiration for superior dancers, but elevating ballerinas to the level of celebrity came into its own in the nineteenth century, especially as female performers became idealized and objectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Marian|title=The Cambridge Companion to Ballet|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|pages=175–176|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marie Taglioni became the prototypical Romantic ballerina, praised highly for her lyricism.  The movement style for Romantic ballerinas was characterized by soft, rounded arms and a forward tilt in the upper body.  This gave the woman a flowery, willowy look.  Leg movements became more elaborate due to the new [[Ballet Tutu|tutu]] length and rising standards of technical proficiency. Important Romantic ballerinas included [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Lucille Grahn]], [[Fanny Cerrito]], [[Pauline Leroux]] and [[Fanny Elssler]]. The plots of many ballets were dominated by spirit women—sylphs, wilis, and ghosts, who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men and made it impossible for them to live happily in the real world.

While ballerinas became increasingly virtuosic, male dancers became scarce, particularly in Paris (although they were still common in other European areas, such as Denmark).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SMITH|first=MARIAN|date=2007-03-01|title=The disappearing danseur|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s095458670700225x|journal=Cambridge Opera Journal|volume=19|issue=01|pages=33|doi=10.1017/s095458670700225x|issn=0954-5867}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the rise of the female travesty dancer - a female dancer who played male roles. While travesty dancing had existed prior to the romantic period it was generally used in tableau and walk-on (marcheuse) parts. Now it became a high-status occupation, and a number of prima ballerinas made their names by dancing ''en travestie''. Fanny Elssler and her sister both played travesty parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garafola|first=Lynn|date=1985|title=The Travesty Dancer in Nineteenth-Century Ballet|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1478078|journal=Dance Research Journal|volume=17|issue=2|pages=35|doi=10.2307/1478078|issn=0149-7677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known travesty dancer was Eugénie Fiocre, who was the first dancer to play Frantz in ''[[Coppélia]]'', as well as a number of ballerina roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Fenella|date=2017-05-04|title=Rethinking the Travesty Dancer: Questions of Reading and Representation in the Paris Opera|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01472526.2017.1321374|journal=Dance Chronicle|volume=40|issue=2|pages=192–210|doi=10.1080/01472526.2017.1321374|issn=0147-2526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and scenography==

===Romantic tutu===
[[File:Наталья Колосова кадр 1.jpg|thumb|A romantic tutu]]
The costume for the Romantic ballerina was the [[Ballet Tutu|romantic tutu]].  This was a full, white, multi-layered skirt made of [[tulle]].  The ballerina wore a white [[Corset|bodice]] with the tutu.  In the second acts of Romantic ballets, representing the spiritual realm, the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' appeared on stage in Romantic tutus, giving rise to the term "white act" or [[Ballet blanc|ballet-blanc]]. The dancers wore [[pointe shoe]]s to give the effect of floating. However, sometimes they decided to throw in extra sharp, sassy movements to portray the given concept or intent, often using high kicks and fast turns.

===Special effects===

Romantic ballet owed much to the new developments in theatre effects, particularly gas lighting.  Candles had been previously used to light theatres, but gas lighting allowed for dimming effects and other subtleties.  Combined with the effects of the Romantic tutu, ballerinas posing ''en pointe'', and the use of wires to make dancers "fly," directors used gas lighting to create supernatural spectacles on stage.

[[Image:Bilingualstopsign.jpg|right|thumb|A bilingual (English and French) [[stop sign]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]]. An example of bilingualism at the federal government level.]]
'''Section 16''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the first of several sections of the Constitution dealing with [[Canada]]'s two [[official language]]s, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].  Section 16 declares that English and French are the official languages of Canada and of the province of [[New Brunswick]].

==Text==
Under the heading "Official Languages of Canada", the section reads:

{{quotation|16.  (1) English and French are the official languages of Canada and have the equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and government of Canada.

(2) English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the legislature and government of New Brunswick.

(3) Nothing in this Charter limits the authority of Parliament or a legislature to advance the equality of status or use of English and French.}}

==Function==
This section sets out general principles that are expanded in [[Section Sixteen One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 16.1]] to [[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|22]]. Section 16 itself expands upon language rights in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''; whereas section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' merely allowed for both languages to be used in [[Canadian Parliament|Parliament]] and in the [[Quebec]] legislature, and in some courts, section 16 goes further by allowing bilingualism in the federal and New Brunswick [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], and in the New Brunswick legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Constitutional Law of Canada.''  2003 Student Ed.  Scarborough, Ontario:  Thomson Canada Limited, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was not entirely new, as Canada's ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' had provided for this at the federal level since 1969, and New Brunswick had similar legislation.  Those laws, however, were merely [[statute]]s, and section 16 thus made some of their key aspects into constitutional principles.

==Judicial interpretation==

===Subsections 16(1) and 16(2)===
It has not been easy to understand how section 16 can be applied.  In ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'' (1986), [[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]] [[Brian Dickson]] made reference to the "academic debate about the precise significance of s. 16," and the question of "Whether s. 16 is visionary, declaratory or substantive in nature."  He did, however, decide that "at the very least it provides a strong indicator of the purpose of the language guarantees in the Charter [ie., [[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 17]] to 22]... the federal government of Canada and the government of New Brunswick have demonstrated their commitment to official bilingualism within their respective jurisdictions." 

In the same case, Justice [[Jean Beetz]] wrote that the political nature of section 16, as opposed to the generous nature of the rights in the rest of the Charter, indicate that courts should be cautious in interpreting section 16 in new ways.  Elected governments would play a larger role in determining its scope.  Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] went on to speculate that section 16 is meant to represent an opportunity for expansion of language rights.  Thus, courts must always ask themselves how their rulings fit in with the current state of affairs regarding official languages policy, and how their rulings are consistent with it.  While the rights guaranteed under another language provision of the ''Charter'', [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 20]], are limited, this does not mean that section 16 is limited or cannot have an effect on the growth of language rights.  As far as New Brunswick is concerned, she added, bilingualism was considered "crucial" to "social and cultural development," and thus there should be "heightened public expectations" that this could be supported by the ''Charter''.&lt;ref name="Acadiens v 1986"&gt;''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[R. v. Beaulac]]'' (1999), the Supreme Court rejected some of its earlier conservative interpretations.  It ruled that a [[purposive interpretation|purposive]] (generous) interpretation would be appropriate for language rights, since this would help [[minority language]] communities (i.e. those who speak English or French in a region where that language is the minority language) achieve equality.

Many ''Charter'' cases regarding the use of the English and French languages have not been fought on the grounds of section 16.&lt;ref name="Dyck"&gt;Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches''. Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Quebec's [[Bill 101]], which limited the use of English, was considered to be invalid in certain respects not because it conflicted with section 16, but because it infringed [[freedom of expression]], which is guaranteed by [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2]] of the ''Charter''.&lt;ref name="Dyck"/&gt;

Likewise, section 16 does not really apply to [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] besides New Brunswick; as the only province that currently considers itself to be officially bilingual, New Brunswick is the only province to have its bilingualism guaranteed by section 16.  When [[Manitoba]]'s laws declaring English to be the only official language of the province were found to be invalid in ''[[Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' (1985), this was due to its contradictions with the ''[[Manitoba Act]]''.&lt;ref name="Dyck"/&gt;

===Subsection 16(3)===
Subsection 16(3) provides that a Parliament or provincial government may strive for progress in official bilingualism.  This reflects a 1975 court decision, ''[[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]]'', in which it was found governments may do this.&lt;ref name="Acadiens v 1986"/&gt;  Thus, the Supreme Court in ''Société des Acadiens'' has argued that it is the elected governments and "political compromise", rather than the courts, that will mostly advance language rights.  

Justice Wilson added that subsection 16(3) demonstrates that while language rights need to be improved, they should not be eroded once they have been established.&lt;ref name="Acadiens v 1986"/&gt;

'''Stellingwarfs''' ({{lang-nl|Stellingwerfs}}) is the form of [[Dutch Low Saxon]] spoken in [[Ooststellingwerf]] and [[Weststellingwerf]] in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]], and also in [[Steenwijkerland]] and [[Westerveld]] in the Dutch province of [[Overijssel]] and [[Drenthe]].

Stellingwarfs is easily intelligible for many Dutch people. There is modern literature in Stellingwarfs.

Like [[Het Bildt]] and [[Leeuwarden]], Weststellingwerf and Ooststellingwerf are among the municipalities of Friesland where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is not spoken.

The language was identified by the government of the [[Netherlands]] in 1996 within Low Saxon.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;

The '''Subanen language''' (also '''Subanon''' and '''Subanun''') is an [[Austronesian language]] belonging to the [[Greater Central Philippine languages]]. It is typically considered by [[linguistics|linguists]] as a [[dialect cluster]] more than a monolithic language. Subanon is spoken in various areas of [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] namely the [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], and in [[Misamis Occidental]] of Northern Mindanao. There is also a sizeable Subanon community in [[Misamis Oriental]]. Most go by the name of [[Subanen people|''Subanen'', ''Subanon'' or ''Subanun'']], while those who adhere to [[islam in the Philippines|Islam]] refer to themselves as ''Kalibugan''.

==Internal classification==
Jason Lobel (2013:308) classifies the Subanen varieties as follows.

*'''Subanen'''
**Western
***''Western Subanon''
***''Western Kolibugan''
**Nuclear
***West Nuclear
****''Tawlet-Kalibugan Subanen''
****''Salug-Godod Subanen''
***East Nuclear
****''Southern Subanen''
****''Central Subanen''
****''Northern Subanen''
****''Eastern Subanen''

Lobel (2013:308) lists the following innovations among each of the following subgroups.
*Nuclear Subanen: *k &gt; Ø
*Western Subanen: *k &gt; /k/
*East Nuclear Subanen: *r &gt; /l/
*West Nuclear Subanen: *r &gt; /r/
*Western Subanen: *r &gt; /l/ (independently took place, likely due to contact with Tausug, Maguindanaon, Butuanon, Cebuano, and/or Ilonggo, which have also undergone the *r &gt; /l/ shift independently of one another)

Proto-Subanen is also notable for having completely lost Proto-Greater Central Philippine *h.

Lobel (2013) also provides a reconstruction of Proto-Subanen.

'''Tactical bombing''' is [[aerial bomb]]ing aimed at targets of immediate [[military]] value, such as [[combatant]]s, [[Military base|military installation]]s, or [[Military technology|military equipment]]. This is in contrast to [[strategic bombing]], or attacking [[enemy]] [[City|cities]] and [[Factory|factories]] to cripple future military production and enemy [[civilian]]s' will to support the [[war effort]], in order to debilitate the enemy's long-term capacity to wage [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A '''tactical bomber''' is a [[bomber]] [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] with an intended primary role of tactical bombing.

Tactical bombing is employed for two primary assignments.  Aircraft providing '''[[close air support]]''' attack targets in nearby proximity to friendly [[Army|ground forces]], acting in direct support of the ground operations (as a "flying [[artillery]]"). '''[[Air interdiction]]''', by contrast, attacks tactical targets that are distant from or otherwise not in contact with friendly units.

==History==
Tactical bombing was the first type of aerial bombing mission. It began in [[World War I]] when pilots dropped small [[Aerial bomb|bomb]]s over the side of their open cockpits onto enemy troops below. One of the earliest examples of tactical bombing was at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915 when the [[Royal Flying Corps]] dropped bombs on [[German Empire|German]] rail communications. By the time of [[World War II]] a number of specialized [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] were developed to fulfill this role, including various [[fighter-bomber]]s.  During the [[Korean War]] tactical bombing missions were sometimes carried out by older [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-powered [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s such as the [[Vought F4U Corsair]]. In the [[Vietnam War]], missions were frequently directed by [[Forward air control|forward air controller]]s ([[Forward air controllers in the Vietnam War|FAC]]s) flying small [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]]-driven planes. The [[Forward air controllers in the Vietnam War|FAC]] would mark targets with smoke, often in coordination with [[infantry]] on the ground.  [[Bomber]]s [[Loiter (aeronautics)|orbit]]ing overhead would then fly in to hit the target.  

In the modern era, [[precision-guided munition]]s ("smart bombs") can be directed with extreme accuracy.

The translation is being done by the Polish-Israeli linguist Avraham Ahuvya. The translation is copyrighted by the RAM-Publishing House Ltd. and by Miskal Ltd. The word '''Ram''' is an [[Acronyms in the Philippines|acronym]] of the name of Rafi Moses, the books' editor and President of the RAM-Publishing House.

== Publications ==
[[File:Tanakh ram torah.jpg|thumbnail|Tanakh Ram, volume I (the Torah).|264x264px]]

Up to October 2014 there have been published two volumes corresponding to the [[Torah]] or Moses' Law, and to the [[Nevi'im|former prophets]]. The Torah,  of dark red hardcovers and 760 pages, includes the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy; the second volume, dark blue and with 621 pages, includes Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings.

The first volume, the Torah, was published in 2010, and the second one in 2011. Two more volumes, corresponding to the [[Nevi'im|latter prophets]] and to the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], are currently being prepared.

Just like any book written in Hebrew or other languages of [[Right-to-left|right-to-left writing]], the front cover of each volume is in the place of the back cover, so that it can be read in the opposite direction than of a book that is written in a Western language. The text of each one of the books of the Bible is presented in Ancient Hebrew on the right and on the left there is a parallel column, in a different font type, with the Modern Hebrew text. At the end of each volume there is a section with tables of measures and weights aimed to be a reference to the reader.

The books are officially sold by the bookstore Yediot Books in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ybook.co.il/%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%9A_%D7%A8%D7%9D Volume I] and [http://www.ybook.co.il/%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%9A_%D7%A8%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D volume II] in Yediot Books webpage (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[File:Tanakh ram neviim rishonim.jpg|thumbnail|Tanakh Ram Volume II (former prophets).|268x268px]]

Being a new translation from the one phase to another of the same language, its publication caused diverse opinions among the Jewish community in Israel. Some sectors argue that it is inconvenient for the reading of the sacred text in that it deviates from the traditional reading established by the [[masorete]]s, while other sectors consider that this new translation will allow the new generations to get closer to the Old Hebrew text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2012/02/28/israeli-life-translating-bible-hebrew/ Israeli life: translating the Bible into Hebrew] (2012) in Hadassah magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/literature/1.1223084 Five questions for Abraham Ahuvya: Tanakh Hebrew-Hebrew] (2010) in Haaretz (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;. Linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] supported the idea behind the Tanakh Ram since, in his own words, "The bottom line is that Israelis misunderstand the Hebrew Bible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://novaojs.newcastle.edu.au/ojsbct/index.php/bct/article/view/290/273 Do Israelis understand the Hebrew Bible?] By Ghil'ad Zuckermann, in ''[[The Bible and Critical Theory]]'', Vol. 6 No. 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''corpus''' (plural ''corpora'') or '''text corpus''' is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). In [[corpus linguistics]], they are used to do statistical analysis and [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]], checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory.

==Overview==
A corpus may contain texts in a single language (''monolingual corpus'') or text data in multiple languages (''multilingual corpus'').

Multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side-by-side comparison are called ''aligned parallel corpora''. There are two main types of [[parallel corpora]] which contain texts in two languages. In a ''translation corpus'', the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language. In a ''comparable corpus'', the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content, but they are not translations of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | last2 = Marasek | first2 = K. | title = A Sentence Meaning Based Alignment Method for Parallel Text Corpora Preparation | url = | journal = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing | publisher = Springer | volume = 275 | pages = 107–114 | issn = 2194-5357 | isbn = 978-3-319-05950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exploit a parallel text, some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments (phrases or sentences) is a prerequisite for analysis. [[Machine translation]] algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus which is an element-for-element translation of the first language corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | last2 = Marasek | first2 = K. | title = Tuned and GPU-accelerated Parallel Data Mining from Comparable Corpora | url = | journal = Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence | publisher = Springer | pages = 32–40 | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-3-319-24032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as [[annotation]]. An example of annotating a corpus is [[part-of-speech tagging]], or ''POS-tagging'', in which information about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of ''tags''. Another example is indicating the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it, [[interlinear gloss]]ing is used to make the annotation bilingual.

Some corpora have further ''structured'' levels of analysis applied. In particular, a number of smaller corpora may be fully [[Parsing|parsed]]. Such corpora are usually called [[Treebank]]s or [[Treebank|Parsed Corpora]]. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]].

Corpora are the main knowledge base in [[corpus linguistics]]. The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in [[computational linguistics]], [[speech recognition]] and [[machine translation]], where they are often used to create [[hidden Markov model]]s for part of speech tagging and other purposes. Corpora and [[frequency list]]s derived from them are useful for [[language teaching]]. Corpora can be considered as a type of [[foreign language writing aid]] as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing.&lt;ref name=Yoon&gt;Yoon, H., &amp; Hirvela, A. (2004). [http://englishteachersplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/YoonHirvela_2004.pdf ESL Student Attitudes toward Corpus Use in L2 Writing]. ''Journal of Second Language Writing, 13''(4), 257–283. Retrieved 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological corpora==

Text corpora are also used in the study of [[historical document]]s, for example in attempts to [[decipherment|decipher]] ancient scripts, or in [[Biblical scholarship]]. Some archaeological corpora can be of such short duration that they provide a snapshot in time. One of the shortest corpora in time, may be the 15–30 year [[Amarna letters]] texts ([[1350 BC]]). The ''corpus'' of an ancient city, (for example the "[[Kültepe]] Texts" of Turkey), may go through a series of corpora, determined by their find site dates.

'''Tite Margwelaschwili''' ({{lang-ka|ტიტე მარგველაშვილი}}, [[German language|German]]: ''Titus von Margwelaschwili'') (1891–1946) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] philosopher and writer. He studied at the [[University of Leipzig]] and did a doctor's degree in history at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1914. His career in Georgia was interrupted by the [[Soviet invasion of Georgia|Soviet invasion]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] in 1921.

A member of the [[National Democratic Party (Georgia)|Georgian National Democratic Party]] and a staunch opponent of the [[Bolshevik]] regime, he emigrated to [[Germany]] and quickly emerged as one of the leaders of Georgian political emigration, being elected a chairman of a sizeable Georgian émigré colony in [[Berlin]]. He lectured philosophy and [[Oriental studies]] at the [[Frederick William University]] of Berlin and worked for the Georgian émigré newspaper ''The Caucasus''. He suffered a family tragedy in 1931, when his wife committed suicide because she was homesick. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaturfestival.com/bios1_3_6_460.html Giwi Margwelaschwili]. International Literature Festival, Berlin. Retrieved on April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of [[World War II]] he lived in [[Wilmersdorf|Berlin-Wilmersdorf]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] sector of Berlin. In December 1945 he was decoyed to [[East Berlin]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD]] agents who used the notable philosopher [[Shalva Nutsubidze]] as an enticement. Arrested during his visit to Nutsubidze, Margwelaschwili was detained in a prison in the eastern part of the city, interrogated and tortured, deported to [[Tbilisi]] and shot as a traitor in August 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Goethe Institut Tbilissi: [http://www.goethe.de/ins/ge/prj/dig/ssr/giwi/deindex.htm Giwi Margwelaschwili: ein deutsch-georgischer Schriftsteller und Philosoph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giwi Margwelaschwili according to Irene Langemann: [http://www.lichtfilm.de/download/19_giwi.pdf Zwischen hier und dort] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040729164707/http://www.lichtfilm.de/download/19_giwi.pdf |date=2004-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Giwi Margwelaschwili|Giwi]], subsequently a conspicuous German-Georgian writer, was placed in a Soviet [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Special Camp at Sachsenhausen]] for 18 months.

[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]]
'''Urban sprawl''' or '''suburban sprawl''' describes the expansion of human populations away from central [[urban area]]s into low-density, monofunctional and usually [[car dependency|car-dependent]] communities, in a process called [[suburbanization]]. In addition to describing a particular form of [[urbanization]], the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In [[Continental Europe]] the term "[[peri-urbanisation]]" is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the [[European Environment Agency]]. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it.  For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with [[decentralization]] (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined [[#Low-density|below]]), segregation of uses, and so forth.

The term urban sprawl is highly politicized, and almost always has negative connotations. It is criticized for causing [[environmental degradation]], and intensifying [[Housing segregation|segregation]] and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas and attacked on aesthetic grounds. Due to the pejorative meaning of the term, few openly support urban sprawl as such. The term has become a rallying cry for managing '''urban growth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Definitions of sprawl vary; researchers in the field acknowledge that the term lacks precision.&lt;ref name=Audirac90&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audirac|first1=Ivonne|last2=Shermyen|first2=Anne H.|last3=Smith|first3=Marc T.|title=Ideal Urban Form and Visions of the Good Life Florida's Growth Management Dilemma|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=December 31, 1990|volume=56|issue=4|pages=470–482|doi=10.1080/01944369008975450|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369008975450|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Batty et al. defined sprawl as "uncoordinated growth: the expansion of community without concern for its consequences, in short, unplanned, incremental urban growth which is often regarded unsustainable."&lt;ref name=Batty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batty|first1=Michael|last2=Besussi|first2=Elena|last3=Chin|first3=Nancy|title=Traffic, Urban Growth and Suburban Sprawl|journal=UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis Working Papers Series|date=November 2003|volume=70|url=https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/pdf/paper70.pdf|accessdate=May 17, 2015|issn=1467-1298|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926003140/https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/pdf/paper70.pdf|archive-date=September 26, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatta et al. wrote in 2010 that despite a dispute over the precise definition of sprawl there is a "general consensus that urban sprawl is characterized by [an] unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization."&lt;ref name=Bhatta&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatta|first1=B.|last2=Saraswati|first2=S.|last3=Bandyopadhyay|first3=D.|title=Urban sprawl measurement from remote sensing data|journal=Applied Geography|date=December 2010|volume=30|issue=4|pages=731–740|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BosWash-Night-Labeled.png|upright=1.25|thumb|This picture shows the [[metropolitan area]]s of the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] of the United States demonstrating urban sprawl, including far-flung [[suburb]]s and [[exurb]]s illuminated at night.]]

Reid Ewing has shown that sprawl has typically been characterized as [[urban development]]s exhibiting at least one of the following characteristics: low-density or single-use development, strip development, scattered development, and/or leapfrog development (areas of development interspersed with vacant land).&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; He argued that a better way to identify sprawl was to use indicators rather than characteristics because this was a more flexible and less arbitrary method.&lt;ref name=Ewing97&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ewing|first1=Reid|title=Is Los Angeles-Style Sprawl Desirable?|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=1997|volume=63|issue=1|pages=107–126|doi=10.1080/01944369708975728|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369708975728|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using "[[Accessibility (transport)|accessibility]]" and "functional open space" as indicators.&lt;ref name=Ewing97/&gt; Ewing's approach has been criticized for assuming that sprawl is defined by negative characteristics.&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chin|first1=Nancy|title=Unearthing the Roots of Urban Sprawl: A Critical Analysis of Form, Function and Methodology|journal=University College London Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis Working Papers Series|date=March 2002|volume=47|url=https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/pdf/paper47.pdf|accessdate=April 19, 2015|issn=1467-1298|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044026/https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/pdf/paper47.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What constitutes sprawl may be considered a matter of degree and will always be somewhat subjective under many definitions of the term.&lt;ref name=Ewing97/&gt; Ewing has also argued that suburban development does not, [[per se (terminology)|per se]] constitute sprawl depending on the form it takes,&lt;ref name=Ewing97/&gt; although Gordon &amp; Richardson have argued that the term is sometimes used synonymously with suburbanization in a pejorative way.&lt;ref name=G&amp;R&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Peter|last2=Richardson|first2=Harry|title=Are Compact Cities a Desirable Planning Goal?|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|date=1997|volume=63|issue=1|pages=95–106|doi=10.1080/01944369708975727|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369708975727|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Metropolitan Los Angeles]] for example, despite popular notions of being an sprawling city, is the densest metropolitan region in the US; Being denser than the [[New York metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area|San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/2010_census/cb12-50.html|title=Growth in Urban Population Outpaces Rest of Nation, Census Bureau Reports|publisher=US Census|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://la.curbed.com/2015/2/17/9991042/los-angeles-is-the-least-sprawling-big-city-in-the-us|title=Los Angeles is the Least Sprawling Big City in the US|last1=Barragan|first1=Bianca|website=Curbed|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2010/density-doesnt-tell-us-sprawl/|title=What Density Doesn’t Tell Us About Sprawl|last1=Eidlin|first1=Eric|website=ACCESS|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, most of metropolitan Los Angeles is built at more uniform low to moderate density, leading to a much higher overall density for the entire region. This is in contrast to cities such as New York, San Francisco or Chicago which have extremely compact, high density, cores but are surrounded by large areas of extremely low density.

The international cases of sprawl often draw into question the definition of the term and what conditions are necessary for urban growth to be considered sprawl. Metropolitan regions such [[Greater Mexico City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monkkonen|first=Paavo|year=2011|title=Do Mexican Cities Sprawl? Housing Finance Reform and Changing Patterns of Urban Growth|journal=Urban Geography|volume=32|issue=3|pages=406–423|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.32.3.406}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[National Capital Region (India)|Delhi National Capital Region]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2016/12/sprawl-will-cost-india-18-trillion-per-year-by-2050/509573/|title=India Can't Afford to Get Urbanization Wrong|work=CityLab|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Beijing]], are often regarded as sprawling despite being relatively dense and mixed use.

== Characteristics ==
Despite the lack of a clear agreed upon description of what defines sprawl most definitions often associate the following characteristics with sprawl.

[[File:Traffic jam Marginal Pinheiros 6122 SAO 07 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Traffic congestion]] in sprawling [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], which, according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, has the world's worst traffic jams.&lt;ref name=Times_SP&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1733872,00.html |title=The World's Worst Traffic Jams|work=Time|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2014|author= Andrew Downie}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Single-use development ===
{{Main|Single-use zoning}}
This refers to a situation where commercial, [[residential area|residential]], institutional and [[industrial region|industrial areas]] are separated from one another. Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers. As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require an automobile.&lt;ref name="cdcreport"&gt;Frumkin, Howard (May–June 2002). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/articles/Urban%20Sprawl%20and%20Public%20Health%20-%20PHR.pdf Urban Sprawl and Public Health]. ''[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]''. Retrieved on February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which different [[land use]]s are mixed together is often used as an indicator of sprawl in studies of the subject.&lt;ref name=Bhatta/&gt;

=== Job sprawl and spatial mismatch ===

[[Job sprawl]] is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and [[automobile dependency|car-dependent]] communities.  It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's [[central business district]] (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery.  It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. [[Spatial mismatch]] is related to job sprawl and economic [[environmental justice]].  Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a [[reverse commute]] to the suburbs.

Job sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways. It has been shown to be a growing trend in America's metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Residential Construction Trends in America's Metropolitan Regions |url=https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/residential-construction-trends-americas-metropolitan-regions |date=2016-07-27 |website=Smart Growth |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brookings Institution]] has published multiple articles on the topic. In 2005, author [[Michael Stoll]] defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 [[U.S. Census]] data.&lt;ref name=Stoll&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoll |first=Michael A. |title=Job Sprawl and the Spatial Mismatch between Blacks and Jobs |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution, Metropolitan Policy Program |date=2005 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2005/02metropolitanpolicy_stoll.aspx |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706103216/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2005/02metropolitanpolicy_stoll.aspx |archive-date=July 6, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser&lt;ref name=Glaeser&gt;{{cite book |last=Glaeser |first=Edward |date=2001 |title=Job Sprawl: Employment Location in U.S. Metropolitan Areas |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution, Metropolitan Policy Program. |url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2001/07_employment_glaeser.aspx |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515085220/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2001/07_employment_glaeser.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-15 |accessdate=January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs.&lt;ref name=Kneebone&gt;{{cite book |last=Kneebone |first=Elizabeth |title=Job Sprawl Revisited: The Changing Geography of Metropolitan Employment |location=Washington D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution |date=2009 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2009/0406_job_sprawl_kneebone.aspx |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222104135/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2009/0406_job_sprawl_kneebone.aspx |archive-date=February 22, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a {{convert|35|mi|km|adj=on}} radius around the CBD: {{convert|3|mi|km}} or less, 3 to {{convert|10|mi|km}}, and 10 to {{convert|35|mi|km}}.  Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3-10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10-35 mile ring.  This compares to the year 1998 - 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings.  The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings.

===Low-density===
Sprawl is often characterized as consisting of low-[[population density|density]] [[land development|development]].&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; The exact definition of "low density" is arguable, but a common example is that of [[Single-family home|single family homes]] on large lots. Buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by [[lawn]]s, [[landscaping]], [[road]]s or [[parking lot]]s. Specific measurements of what constitutes low-density is culturally relative; for example, in the United States 2-4 houses per acre might be considered low-density while in the UK 8-12 would still be considered low-density.&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; Because more automobiles are used much more land is designated for parking. The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or "urbanized" land is increasing at a faster rate than the population is growing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Overall density is often lowered by "leapfrog development". This term refers to the relationship, or lack thereof, between subdivisions. Such developments are typically separated by large [[green belt]]s, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an average density far lower even than the low density indicated by localized per-acre measurements. This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development.&lt;ref&gt;DeGrove, John and Robyne Turner (1991), "Local Government in Florida: Coping with Massive and Sustained Growth" in Huckshorn, R. (ed.) Government and Politics in Florida. University of Florida Press, Gainesville.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools. In the past, when a [[local government]] built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had [[eminent domain|condemnation power.]] Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location.

===Conversion of agricultural land to urban use===
Land for sprawl is often taken from [[soil fertility|fertile]] [[agricultural land]]s, which are often located immediately surrounding cities; the extent of modern sprawl has consumed a large amount of the most productive agricultural land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krannich|first1=Jess M.|title=Modern Disaster: Agricultural Land, Urban Growth, and the Need for a Federally Organized Comprehensive Land Use Planning Model|journal=Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy|date=2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=57|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&amp;context=cjlpp|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as forest, desert and other wilderness areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasse|first1=John E.|last2=Lathrop|first2=Richard G.|title=Land resource impact indicators of urban sprawl|journal=Applied Geography|date=2003|volume=23|pages=159–175|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2003.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the seller may [[tax avoidance|avoid tax]] on profit by using a [[tax break]] exempting [[like-kind exchange]]s from [[capital gains tax]]; proceeds from the sale are used to purchase agricultural land elsewhere and the transaction is treated as a "swap" or trade of like assets and no tax is due. Thus urban sprawl is subsidized by the tax code.&lt;ref name=NYT01613&gt;{{cite news|title=Major Companies Push the Limits of a Tax Break|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2013|author=David Kocieniewski|quote=With hundreds of thousands of transactions a year, it is hard to gauge the true cost of the tax break for so-called like-kind exchanges, like those used by Cendant, General Electric and Wells Fargo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, land has been converted from rural to urban use in advance of demand, leading to vacant rural land intended for future development, and eventual urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fang|first=Yiping|last2=Pal|first2=Anirban|date=2016-07-07|title=Drivers of urban sprawl in urbanizing China – a political ecology analysis|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247816647344|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=599–616|doi=10.1177/0956247816647344|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing subdivisions===
[[File:Derry and Thompson.JPG|thumb|right|Sprawl in [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]], [[Ontario]]. This photograph is an example of Canadian suburban development.]]
[[Housing subdivision]]s are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly built residences. [[New Urbanism|New Urbanist]] architectural firm [[Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company]] claim that housing subdivisions "are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential."&lt;ref name=duany2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duany|first1=Andres|last2=Plater-Zyberk|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Speck|first3=Jeff|title=Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream|date=2001|publisher=Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux,|location=New York|isbn=9780865476066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also referred to as developments.

Subdivisions often incorporate curved roads and [[cul-de-sac]]s. These subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets.

Because the advent of sprawl meant more land for lower costs, home owners had more land at their disposal, and the development of the residential [[lawn]] after the [[Second World War]] became commonplace in suburbs, notably, but not exclusively in North America.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Ted|title=American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn|date=2006|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0393329308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the rise of lawn culture in the United States.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Virginia Scott|title=The Lawn: A History of an American Obsession|date=1994|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington|isbn=978-1560984061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawns now take up a significant amount of land in suburban developments, contributing in no small part to sprawl.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

===Commercial characteristics===
In areas of sprawl, commercial use is generally segregated from other uses. In the U.S. and Canada, these often take the form of [[strip malls]], which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a "strip"). Similar developments in the UK are called Retail Parks. Strip malls consisting mostly of [[big box store]]s or [[category killer]]s are sometimes called "power centers" (U.S.). These developments tend to be low-density; the buildings are single-story and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles. This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments. Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into [[Lifestyle center (retail)|Lifestyle centers]]; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping.

[[File:Wal-Mart Supercenter, Luray, Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[Walmart]] Supercenter in Luray, Virginia.]]
Another prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by sprawl is the [[shopping mall]]. Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually "anchored" by one or more [[department store]]s (Gruen and Smith 1960). The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall. The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods. Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of a million square feet (ca. 100,000 m²). Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the [[Central business district|city centre]] (Crawford 1992). Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own (Frieden and Sagelyn 1989).

[[Fast food]] chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development. [[Eric Schlosser]], in his book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]'', argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65). [[Duany Plater Zyberk &amp; Company]] believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it.&lt;ref name=duany2001/&gt;

==Causes==

===Urbanization===
The density gradient of [[industrialization|industrialising]] cities has tended to follow a specific pattern: the density of the centre of the city would rise during [[urbanization]] and the population would remain heavily concentrated in the city centre with a rapid decline in settlement towards the periphery. Then, with continued economic growth and the expanding networks of [[public transport]], people (particularly the [[middle class]]) would then slowly migrate towards the suburbs, gradually softening the population density gradient. This point was generally reached when the city reached a certain stage of economic development. In London, this point was reached in the first half of the 19th century, in [[Paris]] toward the end of the century and in [[New York City]] at the turn of the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sprawl.html?id=HFjLm2BauZ8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sprawl: A Compact History|author=Bruegmann, Robert|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=November 9, 2013|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "urban sprawl" was first used in an article in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1955 as a negative comment on the state of [[London]]'s outskirts. However, London had been sprawling out of its medieval confines within the [[City of London|City]] since the 18th century, when the city experienced its first great urban surge. Areas to the west of [[Westminster]] were increasingly built up for the wealthy, to live in the suburbs of the city.

Below the painting the title "METRO-LAND" is in capitals and in smaller text is the price of two-pence.]]
A dramatic increase in the city's urban sprawl began in the 19th century, when labourers flocked from the countryside to work in the new factories that were then springing up. Large developments of small [[terraced house]]s began to appear and the new public transportation systems - ([[London Underground|the metro]], [[bus]]es and [[tram]]s) - allowed workers to commute into the city daily.&lt;ref name=Rybczynski&gt;{{cite web|title=Suburban Despair: Is urban sprawl really an American menace?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2005/11/suburban_despair.html|publisher=Slate.com|date=November 7, 2005|accessdate=May 9, 2015|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suburban districts also sprung up around the city centre to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial town.

By the mid-19th century, the first major suburban areas were springing up around [[London]] as the city (then the largest in the world) became more overcrowded and unsanitary. A major catalyst in the growth in urban sprawl came from the opening of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in the 1860s. The line joined the capital's financial heart in [[City of London|the City]] to what were to become the suburbs of [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Dennis|last2=Pigram|first2=Ron|year=1988|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]|title=The Golden Years of the Metropolitan Railway and the Metro-land Dream|isbn=1-870630-11-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harrow-on-the-Hill station|Harrow]] was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as {{stnlnk|Verney Junction}} in [[Buckinghamshire]], more than {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Baker Street and the centre of London.

Unlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, the Met was allowed to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use.{{efn|The Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 required railways to sell off surplus lands within ten years of the time given for completion of the work in the line's enabling Act.{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=134}}}} Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee,{{sfn|Jackson|1986|pp=134, 137}} and, from the 1880s, the land was developed and sold to domestic buyers in places like Willesden Park Estate, Cecil Park, near [[Pinner]] and at Wembley Park. In 1919, with the expectation of a postwar housing boom,{{sfn|Green|1987|p=43}} [[Metropolitan Railway Country Estates|Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited]] was formed and went on to develop estates at [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury Garden Village]] near [[Neasden]], [[Wembley Park]], Cecil Park and Grange Estate at [[Pinner]] and the Cedars Estate at [[Rickmansworth]] and create places such as [[Harrow Garden Village]].{{sfn|Green|1987|p=43}}{{sfn|Jackson|1986|pp=241–242}}

By the early twentieth century then, amid increasing [[middle-class]] affluence, large low-density suburbs of [[semi-detached house]]s had sprung up all around the city, doubling the area of built-up London in the [[interwar period]] alone, despite the population increase being just 10 percent. [[H.G Wells]] even predicted in 1902 that within a hundred years most of southern England would have been subsumed into one gigantic [[conurbation]] centred in London.

===Early attempts at combatting urban sprawl===
[[File:The Metropolitan Green Belt among the green belts of England.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] first proposed by the [[London County Council]] in 1935.]]
Starting in the early 20th century, environmentalist opposition to urban sprawl began to coalesce, with roots in the [[garden city movement]], as well as pressure from campaign groups such as the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]] (CPRE).

Under [[Herbert Morrison]]'s 1934 leadership of the [[London County Council]], the first formal proposal was made by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee "to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a [[green belt]] or girdle of open space". It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by [[Patrick Abercrombie]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/155499.pdf|title=Planning Policy Guidance 2: Green belts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609171722/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/155499.pdf|archivedate=June 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947|Town and Country Planning Act of 1947]] expressly incorporated green belts into all further national [[urban development]]s.

New provisions for compensation in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947|1947 Town and Country Planning Act]] allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first [[development plans]]. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts. The first [[urban growth boundary]] in the U.S. was in [[Fayette County, Kentucky]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Kolakowski, K., P. L. Machemer, J. Thomas, and R. Hamlin. 2000. Urban growth boundaries: a policy brief for the Michigan Legislature. Urban and Regional Planning Program, Department of Geography, Michigan State University, Lansing, Michigan, USA.

==Examples==
According to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 8,900 square kilometres (2.2 million acres) of land in the United States was developed between 1992 and 2002. Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of [[Kentucky]]) as developed than [[United States Census Bureau|the Census Bureau]] classifies as urban. The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be "urban" sprawl. Currently, according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]], approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban.&lt;ref&gt;Lubowski, Ruben N.; Marlow Vesterby, Shawn Bucholtz, Alba Baez, and Michael J. Roberts (May 31, 2006). [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/EIB14/ Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409092844/http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/EIB14/ |date=April 9, 2007 }}. ''[[Economic Research Service]]'', . Retrieved on February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation's land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population. In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demographia.com/db-ua2000pop.htm USA Urbanized Areas: 2000 Ranked by Population]. ''Demographia'', August 25, 2002. Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, some [[urban area]]s like [[Detroit]] have expanded geographically even while losing population. But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially. According to data in "Cities and Automobile Dependence" by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, the Netherlands]]; [[Brussels, Belgium]]; [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]; [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]], [[Germany]]; and [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], albeit without the dismantling of infrastructure that occurred in the United States.

==Effects==

=== Environmental ===
Urban sprawl is associated with a number of negative environmental outcomes.

One of the major environmental problems associated with sprawl is [[land loss]], [[habitat loss]] and subsequent reduction in [[biodiversity]]. A review by Czech and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czech |first1=Brian |last2=Krausman |first2=Paul R .|last3=Devers |first3=Patrick K. |title=Economic Associations among Causes of Species Endangerment in the United States |journal=BioScience |date=2000 |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=593 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0593:EAACOS]2.0.CO;2|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/7/593.full?ijkey=5738dd208118508de52ec01cdb0cc4c9e383c477&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that urbanization [[endangered species|endangers]] more species and is more geographically ubiquitous in the mainland United States than any other human activity. Urban sprawl is disruptive to native flora &amp; fauna and introduces [[invasive plants]] into their environments.&lt;ref name=mckinney&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinney |first1=Michael L.|title=Urbanization, Biodiversity, and Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2002 |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=883 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0883:UBAC]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/10/883.full |accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the effects can be mitigated through careful maintenance of native vegetation, the process of [[ecological succession]] and public education, sprawl represents one of the primary threats to biodiversity.&lt;ref name=mckinney/&gt;

Regions with high birth rates and immigration are therefore faced with environmental problems due to unplanned urban growth and emerging megacities such as Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;Fenger, J: 1999, "Urban air quality", Atmospheric Environment, vol.33, no.29, pp 4877-4900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems include:
* flooding, which results from increased impervious surfaces for roads and parking (''see'' [[urban runoff]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html |title=Surface Runoff - The Water Cycle |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-15 |website=Water Science School |publisher=United States Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increased temperatures from [[Urban Heat Island|heat islands]], which leads to a significantly increased risk of mortality in elderly populations.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:Melbourne2.jpg|thumb|left|The urban sprawl of [[Melbourne]].]]
At the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the [[United States]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Japan]] that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., "[[white flight]]", sustaining population losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldcore400.htm High-Income World Central City Population Losses]. ''Demographia''. Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living.

Due to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with [[impervious surfaces]] ([[concrete]] and [[asphalt]]) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref name="cdcreport" /&gt; This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies. Sprawl increases [[water pollution]] as rain water picks up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[heavy metals]], and other pollutants in [[surface runoff|runoff]] from parking lots and roads.

Gordon &amp; Richardson have argued that the conversion of agricultural land to urban use is not a problem due to the increasing efficiency of agricultural production; they argue that aggregate agricultural production is still more than sufficient to meet global food needs despite the expansion of urban land use.&lt;ref name=sprawldebate&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Peter |last2=Richardson |first2=Harry |title=The Sprawl Debate: Let Markets Plan |journal=Publius: The Journal of Federalism |date=Summer 2001 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=131–149 |url=http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/3/131.full.pdf |accessdate=June 11, 2015 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a004901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health ===
Sprawl leads to increased driving, and increased driving leads to vehicle emissions that contribute to [[air pollution]] and its attendant negative impacts on human [[health]]. In addition, the reduced physical activity implied by increased automobile use has negative health consequences. Sprawl significantly predicts chronic medical conditions and health-related quality of life, but not mental health disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sturm|first1=R.|last2=Cohen|first2=D.A.|title=Suburban sprawl and physical and mental health|journal=Public Health|date=October 2004|volume=118|issue=7|pages=488–496|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2004.02.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350604000526|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref name="obesity"&gt;McKee, Bradford.

=== Increased infrastructure/transportation costs ===
Living in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive. Since car usage becomes endemic and public transport often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build highway and parking [[infrastructure]], which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Providing services such as [[water supply|water]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, and [[electricity]] is also more expensive per household in less dense areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Ken|last2=Bird|first2=Lori|title=Paying the Costs of Sprawl: Using Fair-Share Costing to Control Sprawl|date=1998|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy's Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development|location=Washington|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/articles/sprawl.pdf|accessdate=May 20, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102819/http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/articles/sprawl.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ===
Urban sprawl may be partly responsible for the decline in [[social capital]] in the United States. Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers. Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards.&lt;ref name="csc06"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sightline.org/publications/books/CS2006/CS06/CS06-nomaps|title=Cascadia Scorecard 2006|author=Van Pelt, Julie (ed.)|format=PDF|series=Cascadia Scorecard|year=2006|publisher=Sightline Institute|location=Seattle, Washington|isbn=1-886093-16-4|accessdate=February 7, 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes [[quality of life]]. Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and [[convenience store]]s with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life. Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart.&lt;ref name=duany2001/&gt; [[James Howard Kunstler]] has argued that poor [[aesthetics]] in suburban environments make them "places not worth caring about", and that they lack a sense of history and identity. &lt;ref&gt;Kunstler, James Howard.

Urban sprawl has class and racial implications in many parts of the world; the relative homogeneity of many sprawl developments may reinforce class and racial divides through [[residential segregation]].

It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sennett, Richard (ed.)|title=Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities|date=June 1969|location=New York|pages=67–83|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Claude S. | last2 = Baldasarre | first2 = Mark | last3 = Ofshe | first3 = R.

According to Nancy Chin, a large number of effects of sprawl have been discussed in the academic literature in some detail; however, the most contentious issues can be reduced "to an older set of arguments, between those advocating a planning approach and those advocating the efficiency of the market."&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; Those who criticize sprawl tend to argue that sprawl creates more problems than it solves and should be more heavily regulated, while proponents argue that markets are producing the economically most efficient settlements possible in most situations, even if problems may exist.&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; However, some market oriented commentators believe that the current patterns of sprawl are in fact the result of distortions of the free market.&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt; Chin cautions that there is a lack of "reliable empirical evidence to support the arguments made either for or against sprawl." She mentions that the lack of a common definition, the need for more quantitative measures "a broader view both in time and space, and greater comparison with alternative urban forms" would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions and conduct more fruitful debates.&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt;

Arguments opposing urban sprawl include concrete effects such as health and environmental issues as well as abstract consequences including neighborhood vitality. [[United States|American]] [[public policy]] analyst [[Randal O'Toole]] of the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarian movement in the United States|libertarian]] [[think tank]], has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non-whites. He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Gridlock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Toole|first1=Randal|title=Gridlock : why we're stuck in traffic and what to do about it|date=2009|publisher=CATO Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1935308232|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups that oppose sprawl ===
The [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[American Planning Association]] recommend against sprawl and instead endorses [[Smart growth|smart]], [[mixed-use development]], including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well-designed neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities].

=== Consumer preference ===

One of the primary debates around suburban sprawl is the extent to which sprawl is the result of consumer preference. Some, such as Peter Gordon, a professor of planning and economics at the University of Southern California's School of Urban Planning and Development, argue that most households have shown a clear preference for low-density living and that this is a fact that should not be ignored by planners.&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Adrian|last2=Henderson|first2=Rick|title=Plan Obsolescence|url=http://reason.com/archives/1998/06/01/plan-obsolescence/|accessdate=May 30, 2015|publisher=Reason|date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon and his frequent collaborator, Harry Richardson have argued that "The principle of consumer sovereignty has played a powerful role in the increase in America’s wealth and in the welfare of its citizens. Producers (including developers) have responded rapidly to households’ demands. It is a giant step backward to interfere with this effective process unless the benefits of intervention substantially exceed its cost."&lt;ref name=prove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Peter|last2=Richardson|first2=Harry|title=Prove It: The costs and benefit of sprawl|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/1998/9/fall-metropolitanpolicy-gordon/gordon2.pdf|accessdate=June 11, 2015|work=Brookings Review|publisher=The Brookings Institution|date=Fall 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that sprawl generates enough benefits for consumers that they continue to choose it as a form of development over alternative forms, as demonstrated by the continued focus on sprawl type developments by most developers.&lt;ref name=sprawldebate /&gt; However, other academics such as Reid Ewing argue that while a large segment of people prefer suburban living that does not mean that sprawl itself is preferred by consumers, and that a large variety of suburban environments satisfy consumer demand, including areas that mitigate the worst effects of sprawl.&lt;ref name=Ewing97/&gt; Others, for example [[Kenneth T. Jackson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that since low-density housing is often (notably in the U.S.A.) subsidized in a variety of ways, consumers' professed preferences for this type of living may be over-stated.&lt;ref name=UCL/&gt;

===Automobile dependency===

[[File:Los Angeles - Echangeur autoroute 110 105.JPG|thumb|A majority of Californians live, commute, and work in the vast and extensive web of [[Southern California freeways]].]]
Whether urban sprawl does increase problems of [[automobile dependency]] and whether conversely, policies of [[smart growth]] can reduce them have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=N&amp;K89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newman |first1=Peter W.G. |last2=Kenworthy |first2=Jeffrey R. |title=Cities and automobile dependence: a sourcebook |date=1989 |publisher=Gower Technical |location=Aldershot, Hants., England |isbn=9780566070402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has been criticised for its methodology&lt;ref&gt;Mindali, O., Raveh, A. and Salomon, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Frank, L. and Pivo, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Cervero, R. and Gorham, R.. Commuting in Transit Versus Automobile Neighborhoods. Journal of the American Planning Association 61, 2: 210-225, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g910669635 Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)] was entirely devoted to this issue&lt;/ref&gt; people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and [[Accessibility (transport)|public transport accessibility]] can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient [[air pollution]] is lower. (See [http://www.demographia.com/dbx-intlair.htm demographia's] report.) [[Kansas City, Missouri]] is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and home prices below comparable Midwestern cities. [[Wendell Cox]] and Randal O'Toole are leading figures supporting lower density development.

Longitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-6995commute.htm US Commuting Travel Times Down Over Quarter Century]. PublicPurpose.com. Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest, however, that possible personal benefits from commute time savings have been at the expense of environmental costs in the form of longer average commute distances,&lt;ref&gt; Cervero, R. and Wu, K, (1997) K.

New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, CUPR, Transaction Press (2013 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradox of intensification===

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, [[smart growth]] and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of [[smart growth]] measures to counteract urban sprawl. Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:

''&lt;div style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em"&gt;[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.&lt;/div&gt;''

=== Risk of increased housing prices ===

There is also some concern that anti-sprawl policies will increase housing prices. Some research suggests Oregon has had the largest housing affordability loss in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demographia.com/db-usafford1970.htm Housing Affordability Trends: USA States]. ''Demographia''. Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but other research shows that Portland's price increases are comparable to other Western cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewyn, Michael (October 4, 2005).

In Australia, it is claimed by some that housing affordability has hit "crisis levels" due to "urban consolidation" policies implemented by state governments.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unisa.edu.au/news/2005/241005.asp Seeking solutions to the housing affordability crisis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830033549/http://unisa.edu.au/news/2005/241005.asp |date=August 30, 2007 }}", ''[[University of South Australia]]'', October 24, 2005.

Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed alternatives ===

Many critics concede that sprawl produces some negative externalities; however there is some dispute about the most effective way to reduce these negative effects. Gordon &amp; Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual environmental or economic benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl.&lt;ref name=sprawldebate/&gt; They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of [[market-based environmental policy instruments|market based fees]] (such as [[emissions trading|emission fees]], [[congestion charging]] or [[road pricing]]) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution.&lt;ref name=prove/&gt;

==Alternative development styles==
{{Main|Smart growth|Compact City|Transit-oriented development|New urbanism}}
The term 'smart growth' has been particularly used in North America.  The terms 'compact city' or 'urban intensification' are often used to describe similar concepts in Europe and particularly the UK where it has influenced government policy and planning practice in recent years.

The state of [[Oregon]] enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries. As a result, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the state's largest urban area, has become a leader in [[smart growth]] policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies). After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the [[urbanized area]] increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demographia.com/dm-uad.htm |title=US Urbanized Areas: 1950-1990: Data |work=demographia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1,290 per km² in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demographia.com/db-ua2000pop.htm |title=USA Urbanized Areas: 2000 Ranked by Population(465 Areas) |work=demographia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). While the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and [[farmland preservation|farmland]] around the metro area.

Many parts of the San Francisco Bay Area have also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries. Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of [[Greenbelt Alliance]], a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization.

In other areas, the design principles of [[District Regionalism]] and [[New Urbanism]] have been employed to combat urban sprawl. The concept of [[Circular flow land use management]] has been developed in Europe to reduce land take by urban sprawl through promoting inner-city and brownfield development.

While cities such as [[Los Angeles]] are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing. Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops is encouraging more compact development in certain areas-particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems.

Bicycles are the preferred means of travel in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldometers.info/bicycles/ |title=Bicycles produced this year |accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, bicycles are permitted in [[public transit]]. Businesses in areas of some towns where bicycle use is high are thriving. Bicycles and transit are contributing in two important ways toward the success of businesses:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://columbus-ite.com/2008/04/07/bicycle-oriented-development/|title=Bicycle Oriented Development |date=April 7, 2008 |website=Columbusite |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303210604/http://columbus-ite.com/2008/04/07/bicycle-oriented-development/ |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First, is that on average the people living the closest to these business districts have more money to spend locally because they don't spend as much on their cars.
* Second, because these people rely more on bicycling, walking and transit than on driving, they tend to focus more of their commerce on locally owned neighborhood businesses that are convenient for them to reach.

[[Walkability]] is a measure of how friendly an area is to [[walking]]. Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits.  However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atypon-link.com/TELF/doi/abs/10.1680/ensu.2008.161.2.105 S.

'''Victor Doblas Heringer''' (March 27, 1988 – March 7, 2018) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[Prêmio Jabuti]]-winning novelist, translator and poet, famous for his novels ''Glória'' (2012) and ''O Amor dos Homens Avulsos'' (2016).

==Biography==
Victor Doblas Heringer was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], in the ''[[bairro]]'' (neighborhood) of [[Imperial de São Cristóvão|São Cristóvão]], on March 27, 1988, but was raised in [[Nova Friburgo]].&lt;ref name="VictorHeringer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/livros/aos-29-anos-morre-no-rio-escritor-victor-heringer-22466251|title=Aos 29 anos, morre no Rio o escritor Victor Heringer|work=[[O Globo]]|date=March 7, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in [[Literature]] from the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] and before publishing his first books he worked at the [[Instituto Moreira Salles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogdoims.com.br/sobre-victor-heringer/|title=Sobre Victor Heringer|work=Blog do IMS|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heringer's debut work, the poetry anthology ''Automatógrafo'', was released through 7Letras in 2011. The following year, he published the critically acclaimed novel ''Glória'', about a "[[Plastic arts|plastic artist]] searching for an impossible woman", for which he received the prestigious [[Prêmio Jabuti]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/diversao-e-arte/2018/03/08/interna_diversao_arte,664698/morre-o-escritor-victor-heringer.shtml|title=Escritor Victor Heringer, finalista do Prêmio Jabuti, morre aos 29 anos|work=[[Correio Braziliense]]|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heringer's second novel, ''O Amor dos Homens Avulsos'', came out in 2016 through [[Companhia das Letras]], and tells the story "of two boys who fall in love with each other, but have their passion interrupted by a tragedy";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/03/morre-o-escritor-carioca-victor-heringer.shtml|title=Morre o escritor carioca Victor Heringer|work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=March 7, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was nominated for the [[Prêmio Rio de Literatura]], the [[São Paulo Prize for Literature]] and the [[Oceanos-Prêmio de Literatura em Língua Portuguesa|Prêmio Oceanos]]. He claims that the fictional neighborhood in which the novel takes place was inspired by the real-life neighborhood of [[Del Castilho]] in Rio de Janeiro, where he used to visit his grandmother when he was a kid.

Heringer's final published work was a translation to Portuguese of [[Loung Ung]]'s 2000 memoir ''[[First They Killed My Father]]'', which came out in Brazil in 2017 through [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omelete.com.br/quadrinhos/primeiro-mataram-meu-pai-livro-que-inspirou-filme-de-angelina-jolie-chega-ao-brasil|title=''Primeiro Mataram Meu Pai'', livro que inspirou filme de Angelina Jolie, chega ao Brasil|work=[[Omelete]]|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blahcultural.com/resenha-primeiro-mataram-meu-pai-livro-que-inspirou-filme-de-angelina-jolie/|title=Resenha: ''Primeiro Mataram Meu Pai'', livro que inspirou filme de Angelina Jolie|work=Blah Cultural|date=October 20, 2017|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2018, three weeks prior to his 30th birthday, Heringer was found dead near the building in which he lived, in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]].&lt;ref name="VictorHeringer"/&gt; The cause of death was undisclosed, but the police and firemen came to speculate he accidentally fell from the window of his apartment. On June 9, 2018, his publisher Companhia das Letras announced that, as a tribute to him, they were planning to release a complete anthology of his works; they had already re-issued his first novel ''Glória'' some months prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mauricio-meireles/2018/06/vendas-de-livro-de-victor-heringer-disparam-e-editora-vai-reunir-obra-do-autor.shtml|title=Vendas de livro de Victor Heringer disparam e editora vai reunir obra do autor|work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018|language=Portuguese|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his final interviews, from October 2017, he stated that he was working on a third novel, scheduled to be published in 2018 and inspired by his travels across [[South America]], [[India]] and [[Indonesia]], but it is unknown if he was able to finish it prior to his death.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; From 2014 to 2017 he also had a weekly [[Column (periodical)|column]] in the magazine ''[[Pessoa (magazine)|Pessoa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revistapessoa.com/colunas/102/victor-heringer Revista Pessoa – Colunas: Victor Heringer] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Samuel Jones''' (28 May 1920&amp;nbsp;– 15 November 2007), generally known as '''W.&amp;nbsp;S. Jones''' or '''Wil Sam''', was a [[Welsh-language]] author, playwright and scriptwriter.  

Jones was born in [[Llanystumdwy]], and lived in the [[Eifionydd]] region in north [[Wales]] for his entire life. He worked as a mechanic before opening his own garage in the village of Llanystumdwy. He registered as a [[conscientious objector]] during the [[Second World War]], working in food distribution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/w-s-jones-758763.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began writing as a young man and, from 1963 onwards, wrote plays to be performed at the Theatr y Gegin in [[Cricieth]], Gwynedd. In the mid-1970s Jones began writing for television and radio and later becoming a full-time writer writing for television and national newspapers as well as for the stage.

Jones was known for the use of comedy and dialect in his work. Many of his plays contained elements of absurdity and symbolism, leading critics to make connections with the works of Beckett, N.&amp;nbsp;F. Simpson and Ionesco.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/w-s-jones-758763.html&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous character, Ifas y Tryc ('Evans the Truck'), was played by Stewart Jones, a Bafta-Cymru winning actor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14293316&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most famous works are his plays, Dinas Barhaus (''"Abiding City"'') (1969), Bobi a Sami (''"Bobi and Sami"'') and Y Sul Hwnnw (''"That Sunday"'') (1981). Other writings include his lecture on the state of Welsh theatre, Y Toblaron (''"The Toblarone"'') (1975), a selection of stories, Dyn y Mwnci (''"The Monkey Man"'') (1979) and a selection of his comic verse, Rhigymau Wil Sam (''"The Rhymes of Wil Sam"'') (2005).

Jones's last work was a Welsh translation and adaptation of ''The Weir'' by Conor McPherson which was performed by Cardiff-based company Sherman Cymru in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/246357-yr-argae-loses-nothing-in-translation&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''William Aaron Woods''' (born June 17, 1942), generally known as '''Bill Woods''', is a researcher in [[natural language processing]], [[speech recognition|continuous speech understanding]], [[knowledge representation]], and knowledge-based [[search engine technology|search technology]]. He is currently interested in using technology to help people organize and use information in organizations.&lt;ref name="dblp"&gt;{{DBLP|name=William A. Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;{{AcademicSearch|1385604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Woods received a Bachelor's degree from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] (1964) and a Master's (1965) and Ph.D. (1968) in Applied Mathematics from [[Harvard University]], where he then served as an Assistant Professor and later as a Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science.

==Research==
Woods built one of the first natural language [[question answering system]]s (LUNAR) to answer questions about the [[Apollo 11]] moon rocks for the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA Manned Spacecraft Center]] while he was at [[Bolt Beranek and Newman]] (BBN)&lt;ref name="bbn"/&gt; in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At BBN, he was a Principal Scientist and manager of the Artificial Intelligence Department in the '70's and early '80's. He was the principal investigator for BBN's early work in natural language processing and knowledge representation and for its first project in continuous speech understanding. Subsequently, he was Chief Scientist for Applied Expert Systems and Principal Technologist for [[ON Technology]], Cambridge start-ups. In 1991, he joined [[Sun Microsystems]] Laboratories as a Principal Scientist and Distinguished Engineer, and in 2007, he joined [[ITA Software]] as a Distinguished Software Engineer.  ITA was acquired by [[Google]] in 2011, where he now works.

Woods' 1975 paper "What's in a Link"&lt;ref&gt;William A. Woods, "What's in a Link: Foundations for Semantic Networks". In D. Bobrow and A. Collins (eds.), ''Representation and Understanding: Studies in Cognitive Science'', New York: Academic Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; is a widely cited&lt;ref name="microsoft"/&gt; critical review of early work in [[semantic network]]s.  This paper has been cited in the context of querying and natural language processing approaches that make use of Semantic Networks and general knowledge modeling. The paper attempts to clarify notions of meaning and semantics in computational systems. Woods further elaborated on the issues and how they relate to contemporary systems in "Meaning and Links" (2007).

==Awards==
Woods has received many honors:
* 1978, [[Fulbright Fellowship]]
* 1990, Fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]]
* 1992, Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
* 2010, [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] Lifetime Achievement Award&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclweb.org/portal/node/2503 The announcement of Bill Woods as the recipient of the 2010 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yemsa''' is the language of the [[Yem people|Yem]] people of the former Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Janjero|Yamma]], known as [[Kingdom of Janjero]] to the [[Amhara people|Amhara]]. It is a member of the [[Omotic]] group of languages, most closely related to [[Kafa language|Kafa]]. It is distinctive in having different systems of vocabulary depending on social status, rather like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. The estimated number of speakers varies wildly from about 1000 (Bender,1976) to half a million (Aklilu, 1993).

Yemsa is the main language spoken in [[Yem special woreda]], [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region|SNNPR]].

The Fuga dialect is distinct enough to perhaps be a different language.
