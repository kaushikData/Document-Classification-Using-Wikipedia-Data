== Universal denominator ==
The main concept in Abramov's algorithm is a universal denominator. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero. The ''dispersion'' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{dis} (p,q)&lt;/math&gt; of two polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p, q \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{dis} (p,q) =\max \{ k \in \N \, : \, \deg (\gcd (p(n), q(n+k) )) \geq 1 \} \cup \{ -1 \},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of non-negative integers. Therefore the dispersion is the maximum &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k \in \N&lt;/math&gt; such that the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times shifted polynomial &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; have a common factor. It is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; if such a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; does not exist. The dispersion can be computed as the largest non-negative integer root of the [[resultant]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{res}_n (p(n), q(n+k) ) \in \mathbb{K}[k]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Man|first=Yiu-Kwong|last2=Wright|first2=Francis J.|date=1994|title=Fast polynomial dispersion computation and its application to indefinite summation|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=190347.190413|journal=ISSAC '94 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation|volume=|pages=175–180|doi=10.1145/190347.190413|isbn=978-0897916387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jürgen|date=2005|title=Modular Algorithms in Symbolic Summation and Symbolic Integration|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/b104035|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=3218|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/b104035|issn=0302-9743|isbn=978-3-540-24061-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \, y (n+k) = f(n)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[P-recursive equation|recurrence equation]] of order &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with polynomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;p_k \in \mathbb{K} [n]&lt;/math&gt;, polynomial right-hand side &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; and rational sequence solution  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) \in \mathbb{K}(n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible to write &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) = p(n)/q(n)&lt;/math&gt; for two relatively prime polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p, q \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D=\operatorname{dis} (p_r(n-r), p_0 (n) )&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math display="block"&gt;u(n) = \gcd ([p_0 (n+D)]^{\underline{D+1}}, [p_r (n-r)]^{\underline{D+1}})&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;[p(n)]^{\underline{k}}=p(n)p(n-1)\cdots p(n-k+1)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Falling and rising factorials|falling factorial]] of a function. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(n)&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n)&lt;/math&gt;. So the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a denominator for all rational solutions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n)&lt;/math&gt; and hence it is called a universal denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Chen|first=William Y.

In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.

For example, a [[Geosynchronous orbit|geostationary]] satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator, or 360 degrees per 24 hours, and has angular velocity ''&amp;omega;'' = 360 / 24 = 15 degrees per hour, or 2&amp;pi; / 24 &amp;asymp; 0.26 radians per hour. If angle is measured in [[radians]], the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, &lt;math&gt;v = r\omega&lt;/math&gt;. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth's center, the satellite's speed through space is thus ''v'' = 42,000 &amp;times; 0.26 &amp;asymp; 11,000 km/hr. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the Earth's rotation (counter-clockwise from above the north pole.)

In three dimensions, angular velocity is a [[pseudovector]], with its magnitude measuring the rate of rotation, and its direction pointing along the axis of rotation (perpendicular to the radius and velocity vectors). The up-or-down orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the [[right-hand rule]].&lt;ref name= EM1&gt;{{cite book

== Angular velocity of a particle ==

=== Particle in two dimensions ===
[[Image:Angular velocity1.svg|right|256 px|thumb|The angular velocity of the particle at ''P'' with respect to the origin ''O'' is determined by the [[perpendicular component]] of the velocity vector '''v'''.]]

In the simplest case of circular motion at radius ''r'', with position given by the angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; from the x-axis, the angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \tfrac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is measured in [[radian]]s, the distance from the x-axis around the circle to the particle is &lt;math&gt;\ell=r\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and the linear velocity is &lt;math&gt;v(t)=\tfrac{d\ell}{dt}=r\omega(t)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\omega=\tfrac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.  

In the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the angular velocity is measured relative to a chosen center point, called the origin. The diagram shows the radius vector '''r''' from the origin ''O'' to the particle ''P'', with its [[polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;. (All variables are functions of time ''t''.) The particle has linear velocity splitting as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_\|+\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;,  with the radial component &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\|&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the radius, and the  cross-radial (or tangential or circular) component &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.

The angular velocity ''ω'' is the rate of change of angle with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{d\phi}{dt} = \frac{v_\perp}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the cross-radial speed &lt;math&gt;v_\perp&lt;/math&gt; is the signed magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_\perp&lt;/math&gt;, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity '''v''' gives magnitude ''v'' (linear speed) and angle ''&amp;theta;'' relative to the radius vector; in these terms, &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = v\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, so that 

: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{v\sin(\theta)}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas may be derived from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=(x(t),y(t))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(x'(t),y'(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan(y(t)/x(t))&lt;/math&gt;, together with the projection formula &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = \tfrac{\mathbf{r}^\perp\!\!}{r}\cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^\perp = (-y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity may be termed a [[pseudoscalar]], a numerical quantity which changes sign under a [[parity (physics)|parity inversion]], such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.

=== Particle in three dimensions ===
[[Image:Angular velocity.svg|thumb|250px|The angular velocity describes the rate of change of angular position, and the instantaneous axis of rotation. In this case (counter-clockwise rotation) the vector points up.]]

In  [[three-dimensional space]], we again have the position vector '''r''' of a moving particle, its radius vector from the origin. Angular velocity is a vector (or [[pseudovector]]) whose magnitude measures the rate at which the radius sweeps out angle, and whose direction shows the principal axis of rotation. Its up-or-down direction is given by the [[right-hand rule]].

Let the axial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; be the unit-length vector perpendicular to the plane of rotation spanned by the radius and velocity vectors, so that the direction of rotation is counter-clockwise looking from the top of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in the plane of rotation, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the angular velocity vector as: 

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega =\omega \mathbf u = \tfrac{d\phi}{dt}\mathbf u=\frac{v \sin(\theta)}{r}\mathbf u,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''&amp;theta;'' is the angle between '''r''' and '''v'''. In terms of the cross product, this is:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega
=\frac{\mathbf r\times\mathbf v}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this, one can recover the tangential velocity as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{\perp} =\boldsymbol{\omega} \times\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Addition of angular velocity vectors ====
[[image:gimbaleuler.svg|thumb|Schematic construction for addition of angular velocity vectors for rotating frames]]

If a point rotates with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; in a [[Frame of a vector space|coordinate frame]] &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; which itself rotates with an angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an external frame &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;, we can define &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2&lt;/math&gt; to be the composite angular velocity vector of the point with respect to &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;. This operation coincides with usual addition of vectors, and it gives angular velocity the algebraic structure of a true [[Vector space#Definition|vector]], rather than just a pseudo-vector.

The only non-obvious property of the above addition is commutativity. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor ''W'' (see below) is skew-symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;R=e^{Wt}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix which can be expanded as &lt;math&gt;R = I + W\cdot dt + \tfrac 12 (W \cdot dt)^2 + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;. The composition of rotations is not commutative, but &lt;math&gt;(I+W_1\cdot dt)(I+W_2 \cdot dt)=(I+W_2 \cdot dt)(I+W_1\cdot dt)&lt;/math&gt; is commutative to first order, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that this also defines the substraction as the addition of a negative vector.

== Angular velocity vector for a frame ==

Given a rotating frame of three unit coordinate vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed at each instant. In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.

The rotating frame appears in the context of [[rigid body|rigid bodies]], and special tools have been developed for it: the angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a tensor. 

Consistent with the general definition, the angular velocity of a frame is defined as the angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all). The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a [[gimbal]]. Components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1&lt;/math&gt;.

By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], any rotating frame possesses an [[instantaneous axis of rotation]], which is the direction of the angular velocity vector, and the magnitude of the angular velocity is consistent with the two dimensional case.

=== Components from the vectors of the frame ===

Considering a coordinate vector of the frame as a particle, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{e}_i|=1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the angular velocity vector:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}
= \mathbf{e}_1\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_1 =\mathbf{e}_2\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_2 = \mathbf{e}_3\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the columns of the matrix of the frame, and  &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; their time derivatives.

=== Components from Euler angles ===

[[Image:Eulerframe.svg|thumb|Diagram showing Euler frame in green]]

The components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by [[Leonhard Euler]] using his [[Euler angles]] and the use of an intermediate frame:
* One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)
* The line of nodes of the moving frame with respect to the reference frame (nutation axis)
* One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)

Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous [[Euler rotations]]). Therefore:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/ntp/rad2007/3-07/hedr/hedr.pdf K.S.HEDRIH: Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and rigid body dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = \dot\alpha\mathbf u_1+\dot\beta\mathbf u_2+\dot\gamma \mathbf u_3&lt;/math&gt;

This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = (\dot\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma+\dot\beta\cos\gamma)\mathbf i+(\dot\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma-\dot\beta\sin\gamma)\mathbf j +(\dot\alpha\cos\beta+\dot\gamma)\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf i,\mathbf j,\mathbf k&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroengineering.info/angspeedconventions.html |title=online tool to calculate angular speed vectors |publisher=Aeroengineering.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Angular velocity tensor ==
{{see also|Skew-symmetric matrix}}

The angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=(\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)&lt;/math&gt; defined above may be equivalently expressed as an '''angular velocity tensor''', the matrix (or linear mapping) ''W'' = ''W''(''t'') defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;

W =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\omega_z &amp; \omega_y \\
\omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x \\
-\omega_y &amp; \omega_x &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[Angular displacement#Infinitesimal rotation matrices|infinitesimal rotation matrix]]. The linear mapping ''W'' acts as &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol\omega \times)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf{r} = W \cdot\mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Calculation from the orientation matrix===

A vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; undergoing uniform circular motion around an axis satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \mathbf r} {dt} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times\mathbf{r} = W \cdot \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Given the orientation matrix ''A''(''t'') of a frame, whose columns are the moving orthonormal coordinate vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_1,\mathbf e_2,\mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt;, we can obtain its angular velocity tensor ''W''(''t'') as follows. Angular velocity must be the same for the three vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;, so arranging the three vector equations into columns of a matrix, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt} = W \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

(This holds even if ''A''(''t'') does not rotate uniformly.) Therefore the angular velocity tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dA} {dt} \cdot A^{-1} = \frac {dA} {dt} \cdot A^{\mathrm{T}},&lt;/math&gt;

since the inverse of the orthogonal matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is its transpose &lt;math&gt;A^{\mathrm{T}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties of angular velocity tensors ==
{{see also|Infinitesimal rotation}}

In general, the angular velocity in an ''n''-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor, which is a second rank [[skew-symmetric tensor]].

This tensor ''W'' will have {{nowrap|''n''(''n''−1)/2}} independent components, which is the dimension of the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]] of [[rotations]] of an ''n''-dimensional inner product space.&lt;ref name="baez"&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/classical/galilei2.pdf Rotations and Angular Momentum] on the Classical Mechanics page of [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html the website of John Baez], especially Questions 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duality with respect to the velocity vector ===

In three dimensions, angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are [[dual space|dual]] to pseudovectors in three dimensions. Since the angular velocity tensor ''W'' = ''W''(''t'') is a [[skew-symmetric matrix]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
W =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; \omega_z &amp; -\omega_y \\
-\omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; \omega_x \\
\omega_y &amp; -\omega_x &amp; 0\\
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

its [[Hodge dual]] is a vector, which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exponential of ''W'' ===

If we know an initial frame ''A''(0) and we are given a ''constant'' angular velocity tensor ''W'', we can obtain ''A''(''t'') for any given ''t''. Recall the matrix differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA} {dt} = W \cdot A .&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be integrated to give:

: &lt;math&gt;A(t) = e^{Wt}A(0) ,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows a connection with the [[Lie group]] of rotations.

=== ''W'' is skew-symmetric ===
We prove that angular velocity tensor is [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dA(t)}{dt} \cdot A^\text{T} &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;W^\text{T} = -W&lt;/math&gt;.

A rotation matrix ''A'' is orthogonal, inverse to its transpose, so we have &lt;math&gt;I=A\cdot A^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;A=A(t)&lt;/math&gt; a frame matrix, taking the time derivative of the equation gives:

: &lt;math&gt;0=\frac{dA}{dt}A^\text{T}+A\frac{dA^\text{T}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the formula &lt;math&gt;(A B)^\text{T}=B^\text{T}A^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{dA}{dt}A^\text{T}+\left(\frac{dA}{dt} A^\text{T}\right)^\text{T} = W + W^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''W'' is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is skew symmetric.

=== Coordinate-free description ===
At any instant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the velocity vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; of a point on a rigid body rotating around the origin:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = W\mathbf{r} .&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between this linear map and the angular velocity [[pseudovector]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the following.

Because ''W'' is the derivative of an [[orthogonal transformation]], the bilinear form

: &lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s}) = (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;

is [[Bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]]. Thus we can apply the fact of [[exterior algebra]] that there is a unique [[linear form]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2 V &lt;/math&gt; that

: &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) = B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s} \in \Lambda^2 V &lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the [[Musical isomorphism|sharp]] ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}} of ''L'' we get

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r})\cdot \mathbf{s} = L^\sharp \cdot (\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing &lt;math&gt; \omega := {\star} (L^\sharp) &lt;/math&gt;, as the [[Hodge dual]] of ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}}, and applying the definition of the Hodge dual twice supposing that the preferred unit 3-vector is &lt;math&gt; \star 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} = {\star} ( {\star} ( L^\sharp ) \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s}) = {\star} (\omega \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s}) = {\star} ( \omega \wedge \mathbf{r} ) \cdot \mathbf{s} = ( \omega \times \mathbf{r} ) \cdot \mathbf{s} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\omega \times \mathbf{r} := {\star} (\omega \wedge \mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

by definition.

Because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary vector, from nondegeneracy of [[scalar product]] follows

: &lt;math&gt; W\mathbf{r} = \omega \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Angular velocity as a vector field ===
For angular velocity tensor maps positions to velocities, it is a [[vector field]]. In particular, this vector field is a [[Killing vector field]] belonging to an element of the [[Lie algebra]] so(3) of the 3-dimensional [[rotation group SO(3)]]. This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector.

== Rigid body considerations ==
{{see also|axes conventions}}

[[Image:AngularVelocity02.svg|right|320 px|thumb|Position of point P located in the rigid body (shown in blue). '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the lab frame, centered at ''O'' and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the rigid body frame, centered at {{′|''O''}}. The origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position '''R''' from the lab frame.]]

The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating [[rigid body]]. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity ''V''(''t'') in each instant.

To obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed "laboratory" system.

As shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point ''O'', the rigid body system origin is at {{′|''O''}} and the vector from ''O'' to {{′|''O''}} is '''R'''. A particle (''i'') in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in the lab frame, and at position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

The defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is unchanging. By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], we may replace the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}. This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; that is changing in time and not the reference vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;, as the rigid body rotates about point {{′|''O''}}. Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three [[versor]]s of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and '''V''' is the velocity of {{′|''O''}} (the origin of the rigid body frame). Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose. So we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{I}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+W\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W = \frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the previous [[angular velocity tensor]].

It can be [[#W is skew-symmetric|proved]] that this is a [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrix]], so we can take its [[dual space|dual]] to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ''ω'' for ''W'' into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the "spin" angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point {{′|''O''}} about the origin ''O''.

=== Consistency ===
We have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.

[[image:AngularVelocity03.svg|right|320 px| thumb| Proving the independence of angular velocity from choice of origin]]

See the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is ''O'', while ''O''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to ''O''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since point ''P'' and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have only one velocity,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_2\times\mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

The above two yields that

: &lt;math&gt; (\boldsymbol{\omega}_1-\boldsymbol{\omega}_2) \times \mathbf{r}_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the point ''P'' (and thus &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;) is arbitrary, it follows that

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_1 = \boldsymbol{\omega}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

If the reference point is the [[instantaneous axis of rotation]] the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.

The '''Aresti Catalog''' is the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) [[International standard|standards document]] enumerating the [[aerobatic maneuvers|aerobatic manoeuvers]] permitted in [[Competition aerobatics|aerobatic competition]]. Designed by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[aviator]] Colonel [[José Luis Aresti Aguirre]] (1919–2003), each figure in the catalog is represented by lines, arrows, geometric shapes and numbers representing the precise form of a manoeuver to be flown.

The catalog broadly classifies manoeuvers into numbered families.  Families 1 through 8 depict basic figures, such as turns, loops and vertical lines; family 9 depicts rotational elements that can be added to basic figures to increase difficulty, change the direction of flight or invert the g-loading of the aircraft.

==Notation==
In Aresti notation, solid lines represent upright or positive-g manoeuvers and dashed lines represent inverted or negative-g manoeuvers; these are sometimes depicted in red. Thick dot represents the beginning of the manoeuver, while a short perpendicular line represents the end. Stalled wing manoeuvers such as [[spin (flight)|spin]]s and snap (flick) rolls are represented by triangles. Arrows represent rolling manoeuvers with numbers representing the extent and number of segments of the roll.

The catalog assigns each manoeuver a [[unique identifier]], called a ''catalog number'', and difficulty factor, represented by the symbol ''K''. When a basic figure is combined with one or more rolling elements, the resultant figure ''K'' is the sum of all component ''K''s.  During an aerobatics competition, judges grade the execution of each manoeuver with a value between 10 (perfect) and 0 (highly flawed). Each figure's grades are multiplied by its ''K'' and summed to yield a total raw score for the flight.

Notational systems for aerobatic manoeuvers have been used since the 1920s.&lt;ref name="BA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Szurovy|first=Geza|author2=Mike Goulian|title=Basic Aerobatics|editor=Bob Ostrander and Norval G. Kennedy|publisher=TAB Books|year=1994|pages=178|isbn=0-07-062926-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-04-09--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The first system accepted worldwide was published by [[French people|French]] aviator François d'Huc Dressler in 1955 and 1956.  It was used for international competitions through 1962.&lt;ref name=WAChist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wac2009.com/history.html|title=History of WAC|publisher=Flying Aces Ltd.|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

José Aresti's development of a notation for aerobatic figures began while serving as an instructor in the Jerez Pilot Training School in the 1940s.  By the end of 1961 Aresti published a dictionary of some 3,000 aerobatic manoeuvers, the ''Sistema Aerocryptographica Aresti''.  Then employed throughout Spain, the Spanish Aero Club urged its adoption internationally.  The FAI's Aerobatics Commission, [http://www.fai.org/aerobatics CIVA], elected to use the catalog beginning at the World Aerobatic Championships held in [[Bilbao, Spain]] in 1964; it has been in use worldwide and evolved continually since then.  Though the catalog had grown at one time to some 15,000 manoeuvers, a CIVA working group substantially streamlined it in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=WAChist/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iac.org/news/2003%20-%2011_20%20-%20Aerobatic%20Community%20Mourns%20Loss%20of%20Jose%20Aresti.html|title=Aerobatic community mourns loss of José Aresti|publisher=International Aerobatic Club|date=November 2003|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Aresti's death, a court fight ensued between his heirs and FAI, which once provided a free catalog online.  The catalog is now only available in printed form for a fee from [https://web.archive.org/web/20090628093726/http://www.arestisystem.com/english/catalogue/ Aresti System S.L.]

'''Behavior management''' is similar to [[behavior modification]]. It is a less intensive version of [[behavior therapy]]. In behavior modification, the focus is on changing behavior, while in behavior management the focus is on maintaining order. Behavior management skills are of particular importance to teachers in the educational system. Behavior management include all of the actions and conscious in actions to enhance the probability people, individually and in groups, choose behaviors which are personally fulfilling, productive, and socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin J.D. and Baldwinn J.I. (1986). Behavior principals in everyday life (2nd Edition), Engle Wood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of research related to "behavior change" and "behavior management". Student Davidson does, in actuality, misinterpret the origination of the theory in connection to England's Industrial Revolution. B.F. Skinner and Carl Rogers have given two distinctly different approaches for addressing the behavior. Skinner's approach says that anyone can [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] behavior by first identifying what the individual finds rewarding. Once the rewards of an individual are known, then those rewards can be selected that the manager is willing to give in exchange for good behavior. Skinner calls this "Positive Reinforcement Psychology". Rogers proposes that in order to effectively address behavior problems, an individual must be persuaded to want to behave appropriately. This is done by teaching the individual the difference between right and wrong including why he or she should do what is right. Rogers believes that the individual must have an internal awareness of right and wrong.

==Uses of behavior management==
Many of the principles and techniques used are the same as behavior modification yet delivered in a less intensively and consistent fashion. Usually, behavior management is applied at the group level by a classroom teacher as a form of [[behavioral engineering]] to produce high rates of student work completion and minimize classroom disruption. In addition, greater focus has been placed on building self-control. Brophy (1986) writes: 
{{quote|"Contemporary behavior modification approaches involve students more actively in planning and shaping their own behavior through participation in the negotiation of contracts with their teachers and through exposure to training designed to help them to monitor and evaluate their behavior more actively, to learn techniques of self-control and problem solving, and to set goals and reinforce themselves for meeting these meetings." (p.&amp;nbsp;191)&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, J. (1986). "Classroom Management Techniques." Education and Urban Society 18/2, 182–194&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In general behavior management strategies have been very effective in reducing classroom disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, J.E. (1983) "Classroom Organization and Management." The Elementary School Journal 83/4, 265–285.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, recent efforts have focused on incorporating principles of functional assessment into the process.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Waguespack, Terrence Vaccaro &amp; Lauren Continere (2006). Functional Behavioral Assessment and Intervention with Emotional/Behaviorally Disordered Students: In Pursuit of State of the Art. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 2 (4), 463–474. [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

While such programs can come from a variety of [[behavioral change theories]], the most common practices rely on the use of [[applied behavior analysis]] principles such as [[positive reinforcement]] and mild punishments (such as [[response cost]] and [[child time-out]]). Behavioral practices such as differential reinforcement are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie Daddario, Karla Anhalt &amp; Lyle E. Barton (2007). Differential Reinforcement of Other Behavior Applied Classwide in a Child Care Setting. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3 (3), 342–348. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, these are delivered in a [[token economy]] or a level system.,&lt;ref&gt;Cancio, E. &amp; Johnson, J.W. (2007). Level Systems Revisited: An Impact Tool For Educating Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3 (4), 512–527 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the reward component is considered effective. For example, Cotton (1988) reviewed 37 studies on tokens, praise, and other reward systems and found them to be highly effective in managing student classroom behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, K. (1988). Instructional Reinforcement. Close-Up No. 3. Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive review of token procedures to match to children's level of behavioral severity was Walker's text "The acting out child."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H. (1990). The Acting Out Child. Soper's West.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main parts to behavior management systems: Whole group, table group, and individual.  These can be things such as marble jars for the class, prize charts for the tables, and a grid chart with 25 spaces for individual students.  There are many different types of charts you can find to use for each part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Part Classroom Management System|url=http://www.superteacherworksheets.com/classroom-behavior-cont.html|website=SuperTeacherWorksheets.com|publisher=Maryann|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building prosocial behavior==
{{Main|Behavior analysis of child development}}
Over the years, behavioral management principles such as reinforcement, modeling and even the use of punishment have been explored in the building of [[prosocial behavior]]. This area is sometimes referred to as "Behavioral Development" or [[Behavior analysis of child development]]. Midlarsky and colleagues (1973) used a combination of modeling and reinforcement to build altruistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Midlarsky, E., Bryan, J.H., &amp; Brickman, P. (1973). Aversive approval: Interactive effects of modeling and reinforcement on altruistic behavior.

Effects of cooperative response acquisition on social behavior during free play. ''Journal of Experimental Ch Psychology'', 12, 387–395&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research indicates that behavioral "interventions" produce the most valuable results when "applied" during early childhood and "early adolescence."&lt;ref&gt;Januaw.nasponline.org/publications/spr/40-2/spr402january.pdf "A meta-analysis of classroom-wide interventions to build social skills: do they work?", ''School Psychology Review'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial has been the role of punishment in forming prosocial behavior. One study found that donation rates of children could be increased by punishing episodes of failure to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, D.P., Gelfand, D.M., Smith, C.L., Paul, S.C., Cromer, C.C., Page, B.C. &amp; Lebenta, D.V. (1976). Factors affecting the acquisition and elimination of children's donating behavior. ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 21, 328–338&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialization process continues by peers with reinforcement and punishment playing major roles. Peers are more likely to punish cross-gender play and reinforce play specific to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fagot, B.I., &amp; Patterson, G.R. (1969). An in vivo analysis of reinforcing contingencies for sex role behaviors in the preschool child. ''Developmental Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, M.E. &amp; Roopnarine, J.L. (1979).

Reinforcement and punishment among preschoolers: Characteristcorrelates. ''Child Development'', 51, 1230–1236&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior management is used when an individual tries to stop problem behavior from another individual. Behavior modification and behavior therapy are two ways to help with behavior management. Behavior therapy is used when an individual is trying to find the course of the behavior, why the individual is behaving the way they are. Behavior modification is a technique to increase or decrease behavior. Using these techniques, one can achieve behavior management. (Goal: Making audience more informed on the topics and using proper grammar and neutral language)

Positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive and negative punishment are all forms of Operant Conditioning. Reinforcements are when you try to increase behavior, either positively or negatively. If you use positive reinforcement, you add a wanted stimulus for desired behavior (e.g. awarding good behavior with a treat). Negative reinforcement is when you increase behavior by removing something unwanted. (e.g., The child’s room is messy and his mom nags him to clean it up, he eventually keeps it clean to remove his mom’s nagging.) Punishment is trying to decrease behavior, either by using negative or positive. [[Positive punishment]] is when you add an unwanted stimulus to decrease the target’s behavior. (e.g., spanking a child when he behaves badly.) Here, spanking is being added to decrease his bad behavior. Negative punishment is when you remove something the target enjoys or likes to remove his or her bad behavior. (e.g. your child comes home past curfew every weekend, you remove watching TV when he is past curfew, therefore, your child’s behavior of coming past curfew will decrease.) This is negative punishment because your child likes to watch TV, so when you take that away from him for being late, he doesn’t like it, therefore, wanting to come home in time to not get that privilege taken away. (Goal: to elaborate and give more background to help reinforce the theory.) 
 
[[Abraham Maslow]] is a very well-known humanist psychologist with his work on hierarchy needs, in which he states that humans have basic needs, and if they are not satisfied, those individuals will not desire anything else. Maslow also claims that humans are never really satisfied, in that our needs are never fully fulfilled, therefore, this can affect how we can behave (e.g., if our needs are never fully fulfilled, then we might not always behave well, even if we do get a treat for good behavior.) A related concept, "Hawthorne Effect" involves the manipulation of behavior of somebody being observed. For example, if you’re being studied in an experiment, you might perform better or work harder because you are aware of the attention you are getting. It is this effect of observation that is called the "Hawthorne Effect". This is interesting because if we take a child who is behaving very poorly, no matter what, and they were put in an experiment, they might increase their good behavior because they are getting attention from the researcher. The point of operant conditioning in behavior modification is to regulate the behavior. It is a method to use different techniques and tie them all together to monitor how one behaves. It can cause a problem when talking about Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs because in this model Maslow goes on to explain how no one’s needs are fully met. The highest point on Maslow’s pyramid is self-actualization which Maslow argues is the goal in which we do not reach. This can pose a problem when it comes to behavior modification because one might think if that individual can not reach that ultimate goal, why try at all. Self-actualization is the goal in which humans have this sense of belonging or accomplishment. Humans have needs, just like any other breed of animal and when one type of animal does not attain those goals or needs, there is this feeling of dissatisfaction. When a person does not meet that top goal there is a void and that person might feel depressed that he or she can not get to that ultimate step. Using these behavioral modifications or techniques one can train or teach oneself how to better attain these goals.

'''''Centrum voor Gelijkheid van Kansen en voor Racismebestrijding v Firma Feryn NV''''' (2008) C-54/07 is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the [[free movement of goods]] in the European Union.

==Facts==
Mr Pascal Feryn, one of the directors of a door installation company called Firma Feryn NV, said it would not employ immigrants from Morocco in customers' houses, because allegedly his customers were opposed. In an interview he said 'people often say: ‘no immigrants’.... I must comply with my customers’ requirements.’&lt;ref&gt;'Customers do not want Moroccans' (28 April 2005) De Standaard&lt;/ref&gt; The CGKR (Centre for equal opportunities and opposition to racism) contended that this policy was a breach of the [[Racial Equality Directive]] 2000/43/EC, as it constituted direct discrimination.

The President of the Arbeidsrechtbank [[Brussels]] held that the public statements did not count as discrimination. They were merely evidence of potential discrimination. The CGKR did not show that anyone was ever actually turned down.

==Judgment==

===Advocate General Opinion===
[[Advocate General Maduro]] advised that it was direct discrimination.

{{Cquote|17. It would lead to awkward results if discrimination of this type were for some reason to be excluded altogether from the scope of the Directive, because by implication Member States would be permitted, under the Directive, to allow employers to differentiate very effectively between candidates on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, simply by publicising the discriminatory character of their recruitment policy as overtly as possible beforehand. Thus, the most blatant strategy of employment discrimination might also turn out to be the most 'rewarding'. That would clearly undermine rather than promote conditions for a socially inclusive labour market. In short, it would defeat the very purpose of the Directive if public statements made by an employer in the context of a recruitment drive, to the effect that applications from persons of a certain ethnic origin would be turned down, were held to fall outside the concept of direct discrimination.

18. The contention made by Mr Feryn that customers would be unfavourably disposed towards employees of a certain ethnic origin is wholly irrelevant to the question whether the Directive applies. Even if that contention were true, it would only illustrate that 'markets will not cure discrimination'&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, C., 'Why markets don't stop discrimination', in: Free markets and social justice, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; and that regulatory intervention is essential. Moreover, the adoption of regulatory measures at Community level helps to solve a collective action problem for employers by preventing the distortion of competition that precisely because of that market failure could arise if different standards of protection against discrimination existed at national level.

19. I therefore suggest that the Court give the following answer to the first and second questions referred by the national court: a public statement made by an employer in the context of a recruitment drive, to the effect that applications from persons of a certain ethnic origin will be turned down, constitutes direct discrimination within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the Directive.

[...]

25. I accordingly propose that the Court give the following answer to the third, fourth and fifth questions referred by the national court: once a prima facie case of discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin has been established, it is for the respondent to prove that the principle of equal treatment has not been infringed.

[...]

28.  It is for the referring court to determine, in accordance with the relevant rules of domestic law, which remedy would be appropriate in the circumstances of the present case. However, in the main, purely token sanctions are not sufficiently dissuasive to enforce the prohibition of discrimination. Therefore, it would seem that a court order prohibiting such behaviour would constitute a more appropriate remedy.}}

===Court of Justice===
The European Court of Justice held that an advertisement would dissuade applicants for employment and constituted direct discrimination. It was unnecessary to show there was actually a dissuasive effect, but the company was entitled to bring evidence to show its practices were not discriminatory.

{{Cquote|22. It is true that, as those two Member States contend, Article 2(2) of Directive 2000/43 defines direct discrimination as a situation in which one person 'is treated' less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin. Likewise, Article 7 of that directive requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to 'all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them' and to public interest bodies bringing judicial proceedings 'on behalf or in support of the complainant'.

23. Nevertheless, it cannot be inferred from this that the lack of an identifiable complainant leads to the conclusion that there is no direct discrimination within the meaning of Directive 2000/43. The aim of that directive, as stated in recital 8 of its preamble, is 'to foster conditions for a socially inclusive labour market'. For that purpose, Article 3(1)(a) states that the directive covers, inter alia, selection criteria and recruitment conditions.

24. The objective of fostering conditions for a socially inclusive labour market would be hard to achieve if the scope of Directive 2000/43 were to be limited to only those cases in which an unsuccessful candidate for a post, considering himself to be the victim of direct discrimination, brought legal proceedings against the employer.

25. The fact that an employer declares publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin, something which is clearly likely to strongly dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market, constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Directive 2000/43. The existence of such direct discrimination is not dependant on the identification of a complainant who claims to have been the victim.

[...]

31. Statements by which an employer publicly lets it be known that, under its recruitment policy, it will not recruit any employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin may constitute facts of such a nature as to give rise to a presumption of a discriminatory recruitment policy.

32. It is, thus, for that employer to adduce evidence that it has not breached the principle of equal treatment, which it can do, inter alia, by showing that the actual recruitment practice of the undertaking does not correspond to those statements.

33. It is for the national court to verify that the facts alleged against that employer are established and to assess the sufficiency of the evidence which the employer adduces in support of its contentions that it has not breached the principle of equal treatment.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9798">According to Rieh (2005), "Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the '''cognitive authority''' theory from [[social epistemology]] in his book, ''Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority''. The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position." (Rieh, 2005).

==Philosophical issues==
Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.

The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be [[skeptical]] towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information [[:wikt:source|source]]s. In other words: It forces us to consider [[epistemological]] issues.

Different "movements", "paradigms", "positions" or "schools" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. 
 
"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted [[Cyril Burt]]'s research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that [[IQ]] was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field ([[Leon Kamin]]) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world.  
 
The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from "experts" while on the other hand, "commonsensism" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.

==Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians==
In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and [[source criticism]]. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant "paradigm" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider "cognitive authority".

However, inside history, the "paradigm" shifted to "the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before".&lt;ref&gt;(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: "[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations
of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the
knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned
by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.
Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no
more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical
novel." &lt;ref&gt;(Iggers, 2001, 6772)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered "cognitive authority" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the "paradigm" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded "cognitive authority" is in the end an epistemological argument.

==Implications for library and information science==
The concept of cognitive authority was developed in [[library and information science]] and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.

"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought" (Pierce, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

[[File:Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin (2018-05-18) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in [[Sochi]], Russia, 18 May 2018]]
'''Courtesy''' (from the word ''courteis'', from the [[12th century]]) is [[gentleness|gentle]] [[politeness]] and [[court (royal)|courtly]] [[manners]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in [[courtesy book]]s.

==History==
The apex of European courtly culture was reached in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Baroque period]] (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). 
The oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, the most influential of them being ''[[The Book of the Courtier|Il Cortegiano]]'' (1508), which not only covered basic [[etiquette]] and [[decorum]] but also provided models of sophisticated [[conversation]] and [[intellectual]] skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQINrHtwNU0C&amp;pg=PA249 |title=The Cambridge guide to literature in English |author=Dominic Head |chapter=courtesy book}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The royal courts of Europe did, of course, persist well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the  notion of ''courtesy'' was replaced by that of ''[[galant|gallantry]]'', referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected [[Sensitive style|sensitivity]] in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. 
During the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the emergence of a [[middle class]] with its own set of [[bourgeois]] etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of [[Marxism]] as ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''.

The analogue concept in the court culture of [[medieval India]] was known by the [[Sanskrit]] term ''dakṣiṇya'', literally meaning "right-handedness", but as in English ''dexterity'' having a figurative meaning of "apt, clever, appropriate", glossed as  "[[kindness]] and consideration expressed in a [[sophistication|sophisticated]] and [[elegance|elegant]] way".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BKW65Yt65wC&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Courtly culture and political life in early medieval India |author=Daud Ali |chapter=The spirit of courtesy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic violence within lesbian relationships''' is the pattern of violent and [[coercive]] behavior in a female [[same-sex relationship]] wherein a [[lesbian]] or other [[non-heterosexual]] woman seeks to control the thoughts, beliefs, or conduct of her female intimate partner.&lt;ref name="bornstein"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = Danica R. | last2 = Fawcett | first2 = Jake | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = Marianne | last4 = Senturia | first4 = Kirsten D.  | last5 = Shiu-Thornton | first5 = Sharyne | title = Understanding the experiences of lesbian, bisexual and trans survivors of domestic violence: a qualitative study | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–181 | publisher = Taylor and Francis| doi = 10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | date = June 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of multiple forms of domestic partner abuse, it is also referred to as '''lesbian battering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violent Betrayal: Partner Abuse in Lesbian Relationships|last=Renzetti|first=Claire|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=|location=Newbury Park|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
{{further information|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships}}
The issue of domestic violence among lesbians has become a serious social concern,&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Carolyn M. | title = Lesbian intimate partner violence: prevalence and dynamics | journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies, special issue: lesbian love and relationships | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | date = March 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the topic has often been ignored, both in academic analyses and in the establishment of social services for battered women.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between [[gay]] male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P. Lab| title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1| publisher =[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year = 2010|page=312|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 1412960479 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8kHrWPLLX54C&amp;pg=PA312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"&gt;{{cite book| author=Andrew Karmen| title = Crime Victims: An Introduction to Victimology| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2010|page=255|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0495599298 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=yb4Nkeks15AC&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and [[bisexual]] individuals might be higher than that among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Robert L. Hampton, Thomas P. Gullotta| title = Interpersonal Violence in the African-American Community: Evidence-Based Prevention and Treatment Practices| publisher =[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year = 2010|page=49|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0387295984 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IAG1R-ZMmkYC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

The issue of domestic violence among lesbian couples may be underreported due to the social construction of [[gender role]]s that women are expected to play in society; violence perpetrated by women may be ignored due to beliefs that the male social construction itself is a primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="terrance"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Little | first1 = Betsi | last2 = Terrance | first2 = Cheryl | title = Perceptions of domestic violence in lesbian relationships: stereotypes and gender role expectations | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–440 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/00918360903543170 | date = March 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918360903543170 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social construction of women is characterized as passive, dependent, nurturing, and highly emotional, and the social construction of men is characterized as competitive, aggressive, strong, and even prone to violence. Due to forms of [[discrimination]], [[homophobia]], and [[heterosexism]], and the belief that heterosexuality is normative within society, domestic violence has been characterized as being between the male perpetrator and the female victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; This contributes to the invisibility of all domestic violence perpetrated by women. Further, the fear of reinforcing negative [[stereotype]]s could lead some community members, activists, and victims to deny the extent of violence among lesbians.&lt;ref name="groscup"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Michael J. | last2 = Groscup | first2 = Jennifer | title = Perceptions of same-sex domestic violence among crisis center staff | journal = Journal of Family Violence | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–93 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social service agencies are often unwilling to assist victims of domestic violence perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name="groscup"/&gt; Victims of domestic violence in lesbian relationships are less likely to have the case prosecuted within a legal system.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Diane Helene | last2 = Greene | first2 = Kathryn | last3 = Causby | first3 = Vickie | last4 = White | first4 = Barbara W. | last5 = Lockhart | first5 = Lettie L. | title = Domestic violence in lesbian relationships | journal = [[Women &amp; Therapy]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | date = October 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to overcome the denial of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, advocates for abused women often concentrate on similarities between homosexual and heterosexual domestic violence. The main goal of activists is to legitimize lesbian domestic violence as real abuse and validate the experience of its victims.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

=== Other factors of unreliability ===
Literature and research regarding domestic violence in lesbian relationships is relatively limited, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Many different factors play into this, such as "different definitions of domestic violence, non-random, self selected and opportunistic sampling methods (often organisation or agency based, or advertising for participants who have experienced violence) and different methods and types of data collected".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Jude|date=2008|title=(Dis)counted Stories: Domestic Violence and Lesbians|url=http://0-qsw.sagepub.com.helin.uri.edu/content/7/2/199.full.pdf+html?|journal=Qualitative Social Work 7.2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes results to be unreliable, thus making it difficult to make general assumptions about the rates of lesbian domestic violence. This has caused rates of violence in lesbian relationships to range from 17 to 73 percent as of the 1990s, being too large of a scale to accurately determine the pervasiveness of lesbian abuse in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since not all lesbians are open about their sexuality, large random samples are difficult to obtain and therefore are unable to show trends in the general lesbian community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research samples tend to be smaller, causing report rates of violence to be lower than they may be. This is "a consequence of the invisibility of such violence and fear of homophobic reactions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theoretical analysis of domestic violence in lesbian relationships is heavily debated. Popular approaches mainly discuss "the comparability of violence in lesbian and gay male relationships (same sex violence,) or draw on feminist theories of gendered power relations, comparing domestic violence between lesbians and heterosexual women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some theorists also study same sex violence by defining gender as anatomy, and claim that gender is not relevant in any case of domestic violence due to its prevalence in same-sex relationships that is perpetrated as a form of homophobic behavior and occurs without consequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other theorists argue that gay men and lesbians still internalize feminine and masculine behaviors, causing lesbians to "mimic traditional heterosexual relationships" and create blatant power dynamics between dominant and submissive partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Forms ==

The scope of domestic violence among lesbian relationships displays the pattern of intimidation, coercion, terrorism, or violence that achieves enhanced power and control for the perpetrator over her partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The forms of domestic violence in lesbian relationships include physical abuse, such as hitting, choking, using weapons, or restraining, often referred to as "battering"; emotional abuse, such as lying, neglecting, and degrading; intimidation threats, such as threats to harm the victim, their family, or their pets; sexual abuse, such as forcing sex or refusing safe sex; destruction of property, such as vandalizing the home and damaging furniture, clothing, or personal objects; economic, such as controlling the victim's money and forcing financial dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bimbi | first1 = David S. | last2 = Palmadessa | first2 = Nancy A. | last3 = Parsons | first3 = Jeffrey T. | title = Substance use and domestic violence among urban gays, lesbians and bisexuals | journal = Journal of LGBT Health Research | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–7 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | ref= harv | postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychological abuse was found to be common among lesbian victims. Findings from studies have shown that slapping was most the commonly reported form of abuse, while beatings and assaults with weapons were less frequent.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Sexual violence within lesbian relationships was found to be as high as 55%. The most frequent type included forced kissing, breast, and genital fondling, and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. Eighty percent of victims reported psychological abuse and verbal abuse. Lesbians are also less likely to use physical force or threats than gay men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women-Identified Women|last=Darty|first=Trudy|last2=Potter|first2=Sandee|publisher=Mayfield|year=1984|isbn=|location=Palo Alto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

===General===
Factors that contribute to domestic violence include the belief that abuse (physical or verbal) is acceptable, substance abuse, unemployment, mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence? (What causes domestic violence?) | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Willis C. | editor-last2 = Newman | editor-first2 = Esmeralda | title = Domestic violence: causes and cures and anger management | page = 11 | publisher = Newman International LLC | location = Tacoma, Washington | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781452843230 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA11 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151022142356/https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA11 | archivedate = 2015-10-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors specific to lesbian relationships such as emotional isolation and lack of community ties due to heterosexism and homophobia, [[minority stress]], and the re-victimization of women who have previously suffered abuse also provoke the causes of domestic violence in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; The political context of homophobia and heterosexism is essential for understanding the experience of lesbian victims of domestic violence. Also homophobia is an important factor in shaping the experience of domestic violence in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; For instance, mental health agencies still contain homophobic and heterosexual beliefs which limit the extent of the services provided to the victims.&lt;ref name="groscup" /&gt; These victims experience violence within the context of a world that is not only misogynistic but is also homophobic.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt;

=== Stigma towards lesbians ===
Lesbian couples frequently experience [[Sexual stigma|social stigma]] against them, including experiences of discrimination and bias against them, as well as other minority stress factors which can include the fear of [[outing]], [[internalized homophobia]], the butch/femme identity, and relationship quality.&lt;ref name="balsam"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balsam | first1 = Kimberly F. | last2 = Szymanski | first2 = Dawn M. | title = Relationship quality and domestic violence in women's same-sex relationships: the role of minority stress | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 258–269 | publisher = Sage | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Internalized homophobia  ===
A perpetrator may use her partner's internalized homophobia to justify her own violence. This may cause a general distaste or negative conception of the lesbian identity, both of oneself and others. This behavior is described as horizontal hostility, or minority groups becoming hostile or violent toward each other.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobia: A Weapon of Sexism|last=Pharr|first=Suzanne|publisher=Chardon|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from both finding it easier to direct hatred toward other oppressed groups and internalized homophobia and misogyny. In the case of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, this hostility is perpetuated in the form of intimate partner abuse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In some cases, the lesbian community can dismiss cases of domestic violence in lesbian relationships or shame victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming the Violence: Speaking Out About Lesbian Battering|last=Lobel|first=Kerry|publisher=Seal|year=1986|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, denial of group membership, and difficulty being in committed and trusting relationships. These negative feelings are then acted out in the form of lesbian battering. Also women fear that they might suffer from isolation, risk of losing their job, housing or family as consequences to homophobia and internalized homophobia.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; A woman who abuses her female partner can use homophobic control as a method of psychological abuse, which further isolates the victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; For example, an abuser may out her partner without permission by revealing her sexual orientation to others, including relatives, employers, and landlords, and in child custody cases. This form of abuse could result in a variety of negative consequences for the victim, such as being shunned by family members and the loss of children, a job, and housing. In fearing isolation due to homophobia, lesbians also experience the phenomenon of living in the "second closet", or that they must keep both their sexualities and experiences with domestic violence hidden from others due to fear of negative repercussions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These homophobic roots also integrate themselves into how lesbians raise their children.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lesbian Couples: Creating Healthy Relationships for the '90's|last=Clunis|first=Merilee|last2=Green|first2=Dorsey|publisher=Seal|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past experiences with domestic violence and abuse ===
Many lesbians who are either battered or batter have had experience with domestic violence and sexual assault, often familial or as a child, including beatings, incest, molestation, and verbal abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In growing up in living situations where violence is "normalized", the partner often does not label the problem or recognize that the violence within the relationship is an issue. This can also translate into how the couple raise potential children and implement discipline.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Power and control ===
{{See also|Abusive power and control}}
Domestic violence in lesbian relationships happens for many reasons. Domestic violence can occur due to control. Violence is most frequently employed as a tactic for achieving interpersonal power or control over their partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; Also perceived loss of power or control may also lead to increased violence within the relationship. The alienation and isolation imposed by internalized and external oppression may construct loss of control, and the need to reclaim it becomes the central concern for lesbians. Lesbians may be denied control over numerous aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, if she remains in the closet, she is also denied control, subjected to continuous self-monitoring, and forced to deal with stress so that she could hide her identity and her intimate relationship from the eyes of others. The perpetrator of violence in an intimate relationship can also threaten their partner to abduct their children if only one has legal custody of their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the contrary, there have also been cases of lesbians and lesbian couples that become ''guardian ad litems'' and households that have been licensed to provide temporary foster care for children that are vulnerable to domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Power and control take advantage the most intimate parts of lesbian relationships, including sex life and the individual agency of the victim in the relationship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dependency and self-esteem factors ===
Another reason why domestic violence can occur is dependency.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The need to achieve balance between separateness and connection has been identified as the primary task in relationships, and is a specifically frequent problem in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The degree of dependence on a relationship and on one's intimate partner causes abuse. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflict with their partner will report a higher level of dependency as a personality trait.

Dependency in lesbian relationships is also a result of female-specific socialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since women have been socialized for "togetherness" and cooperative living, women often struggle with balancing social life and being alone. A study found that lesbians are more likely to spend free time at home than homosexual men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In lesbian relationships, women often find it difficult to spend time apart because they feel pressured to take care of one another. Women may assume that spending time away from their partner would make them upset or angry. Without proper communication, improper management of time may lead to unhealthy discourse within a relationship, and partner equality remains difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Self-esteem]] is another underlying factor of domestic abuse. Low self-esteem and a negative self-image are qualities that characterize both perpetrators and victims of heterosexual domestic violence. The jealousy and the possessiveness that are frequently linked to battering behavior are associated with problems of low self-esteem and negative self-concept. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflicts with their partners will report a lower level of self-esteem as a personality trait.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

== Erasure of homosexuality in domestic violence shelters ==
Domestic violence shelters also provide heterocentric services for battered women, which further isolates battered lesbians and silences the pervasiveness of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. The perpetrator of violence in an abusive relationship is often assumed to be male, while the victim of the violence is assumed to be straight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These services can be improved by ensuring that the case statement of an agency unit is LGBTQ friendly, providing training services for faculty and staff at shelters, making sure that all services does not have heterosexist language, and providing opportunities for lesbians to take leadership positions in these endeavors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Other uses|Dualism (disambiguation)}}
{{God}}
'''Dualism in cosmology''' is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.

Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In [[theology]], dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of [[Taoism]]. It is also discussed in [[Confucianism]].

Many [[Mythology|myths]] and creation [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] with dualistic cosmologies have been described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two [[demiurge]]s, [[culture hero]]es, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 42&lt;/ref&gt; They may be often [[Twin (mythology)|believed to be twins]] or at least brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966: 71, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society ([[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral dualism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of [[Monism|monist]] or [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.

For example, Mazdaism (Mazdean [[Zoroastrianism]]) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the [[antithesis]]&lt;!-- Mazdaism's core tenet is truth/[[asha]] vs falsehood. --&gt;—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mandaeism]] are representative of dualistic ''and'' [[monism|monist]] philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religions, such as [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Catharism]], and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in [[Hermeticism]], where ''[[Nous]]'' "thought"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] is considered a logical fallacy.

===History===
Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [[Set (deity)|Set]] (disorder, death) and [[Osiris]] (order, life).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172631/dualism/38186/Egypt-and-Mesopotamia "Egypt and Mesopotamia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [[Ahura Mazda]] is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from ''[[druj]]'', which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give ''druj'' power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the [[good and evil|beliefs]] of later religions.

The religious dualism of [[Christianity]] between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy [[Satan]] (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Knight | first = Kevin | title = Soul | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | edition = Online | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm | accessdate = 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism==
When used with regards to multiple gods, ''dualism'' may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply ''[[theism]]'' ([[god (word)|theos = god]]) at all.

Both bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. [[theodicy]]). In the original conception of [[Zoroastrianism]], for example, [[Ahura Mazda]] was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]) was the spirit of ultimate evil.

In a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism{{clarify|reason=where would one go to [[Cf.|confer]]?|date=December 2016}}). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a [[Wiccan views of divinity|divine couple]], the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of "good" and "evil" but are aspects of the natural world, much like [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]].)

===Radical and mitigated dualism===
* '''Radical Dualism''' – or absolute Dualism which posits two co-equal divine forces. [[Manichaeism]] conceives of two previously coexistent realms of light and darkness which become embroiled in conflict, owing to the chaotic actions of the latter. Subsequently, certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness; the purpose of material creation is to enact the slow process of extraction of these individual elements, at the end of which the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism likely inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zoroastrianism]], in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]; the two are engaged in a cosmic struggle, the conclusion of which will likewise see Ahura Mazda triumphant. '[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]' included the belief that the material world corresponds to some sort of malevolent intoxication brought about by the powers of darkness to keep elements of the light trapped inside it in a state of drunken distraction.
* '''Mitigated Dualism''' – is where one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. Such classical Gnostic movements as the Sethians conceived of the material world as being created by a lesser divinity than the true God that was the object of their devotion. The spiritual world is conceived of as being radically different from the material world, co-extensive with the true God, and the true home of certain enlightened members of humanity; thus, these systems were expressive of a feeling of acute alienation within the world, and their resultant aim was to allow the soul to escape the constraints presented by the physical realm.

However, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of [[Persephone]]). [[Marcionism]], an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Riparelli, ''Il volto del Cristo dualista. Da Marcione ai catari'', Peter Lang, Bern - Berlin - Bruxelles - Frankfurt am Main - New York - Oxford - Wien 2008, 368 pp.  {{ISBN|978-3-03911-490-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theistic dualism ==
In theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt;

===In Christianity===
[[Image:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209. The Cathars were denounced as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church for their dualist beliefs.]]
The dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including [[Marcionism]], [[Catharism]], [[Paulicianism]], and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0680-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that [[Free will in theology|free will]] separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the [[Samkhya]] tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Rouner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rouner|first=Leroy|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|year=1983|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22748-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey|title=A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00684-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes that, in the Catholic Church, "the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected" by the thirteenth century, but [[mind–body dualism]] was not.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[problem of evil]] is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by [[Constantine-Silvanus]], argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Janet |last2=Hamilton|first2=Bernard |last3=Stoyanov|first3=Yuri |title=Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4765-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catharism|Cathars]], a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1208 to remove the Cathars from [[Languedoc]] in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which began in 1233 under [[Pope Gregory IX]], also targeted the Cathars.&lt;ref name="Chidester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chidester|first=David|title=Christianity: A Global History|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-251770-8|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
[[Gnosticism]] is a diverse, [[syncretistic]] [[religious movement]] consisting of various [[belief systems]] generally united in the teaching that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in a [[Nature|material world]] created by an imperfect god, the [[demiurge]], who is frequently identified with the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable [[God|supreme being]] that embodies good.

[[Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] and [[Cathar]]s are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective [[Salvation|salvific]] force.

===In Hinduism===
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA59 A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism]. iUniverse Inc. P. 59-60. {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D.

==Ontological dualism==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|right|100px|thumb|The yin and yang symbolizes the duality in nature and all things in the Taoist religion.]]

Alternatively, ''dualism'' can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching [[categorization|categories]]. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="Girardot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardot|first=N.J.|title=Myth and Meaning in Early Taoism: The Theme of Chaos (hun-tun)|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06460-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditions such as classical Hinduism, [[Zen]] Buddhism or [[Islam]]ic [[Sufi]]sm, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with [[monism]] or [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]].

===In Chinese philosophy===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of [[Chinese philosophy]], and is an important feature of [[Taoism]], both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jeremy|title=Yin and Yang|url=http://online.infobase.com/HRC/Search/Details/239492?q=yin%20and%20yang|website=Ancient and Medieval History|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in [[Confucianism]], but to a lesser extent.

Some of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, [[light]] and [[darkness|dark]], active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"/&gt; The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.

The complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a [[feedback loop]], where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to [[homeostasis]]. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.

== In traditional religions ==

=== Uralic peoples ===
In a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] myth, Num and [[Nga (god)|Nga]] collaborate and compete with each other, creating land,&lt;ref name=land&gt;Vértes 1990: 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt; there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative studies of Uralic peoples and Kets ===
Among others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] compared the [[mythology]] of [[Ket people]] with those of [[Uralic peoples]], assuming in the studies, that there are modelling [[Semiotics|semiotic]] systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov &amp; Toporov 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hoppál&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 225, 227, 229&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoyedic peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229, 230&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society&lt;ref name=noket2org&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 39&lt;/ref&gt; nor cosmological dualism&lt;ref name=ket2cosm&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 48&lt;/ref&gt; has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered;&lt;ref name=noket2org/&gt; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,&lt;ref&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 37&lt;/ref&gt; folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land:&lt;ref name=ket2cosm/&gt; the diving of the water fowl.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229&lt;/ref&gt; If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov"&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chukchi ===
A [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings ([[bird]]s, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the [[raven]], collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).&lt;ref&gt;"Zolotarjov 1980: 40–41"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anyiszimov 1981: 92 – 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuegians ===
{{see also|Fuegians#Spiritual culture}}
All three [[Fuegians|Fuegian]] tribes had dualistic myths about [[culture hero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yámana]] have dualistic myths about the two {{IPA-xx|joalox|}} brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the [[Selk'nam]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:181&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] necessarily.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov" /&gt;

[[Image:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louise Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]], a Swiss eccentric, with her characteristic [[ear trumpet]] and hat]]
'''Eccentricity''' (also called '''quirkiness''') is unusual or odd [[behavior]] on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary, without being demonstrably [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]]. Eccentricity is contrasted with [[normality (behavior)|normal]] behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and pursue certain priorities in everyday life. People who consistently display benignly eccentric behavior are labeled as "eccentrics".

==Etymology==
From Medieval Latin ''eccentricus'', derived from Greek ''ekkentros'', "out of the center", from ''ek''-, ''ex''- "out of" + ''kentron'', "center". ''Eccentric'' first appeared in English essays as a [[neologism]] in 1551 as an astronomical term meaning "a circle in which the earth, sun, etc. deviates from its center." Five years later, in 1556, an adjective form of the word was used. In 1685, the definition evolved from the literal to the figurative, and ''eccentric'' is noted to have begun being used to describe unconventional or odd behavior. A noun form of the word – a person who possesses and exhibits these unconventional or odd qualities and behaviors – appeared by 1832.

==Depictions==
Eccentricity is often associated with [[genius]], [[intellectual giftedness]], or [[creativity]]. People may perceive the individual's eccentric behavior as the outward expression of their unique [[intelligence]] or creative impulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1502358/Einstein-eccentric-genius-smoked-butts-picked-up-off-street.html |title=Einstein, eccentric genius, smoked butts picked up off street |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2006-09-27 |location=London |first=Justin |last=Stares |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208203922/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1502358/Einstein-eccentric-genius-smoked-butts-picked-up-off-street.html |archivedate=2009-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, the eccentric's [[habit (psychology)|habits]] are incomprehensible not because they are illogical or the result of madness, but because they stem from a mind so original that it cannot be conformed to societal norms. English [[utilitarian]] thinker [[John Stuart Mill]] ({{nowrap|b. 1806}}) wrote that "the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quotationsbook.com/quote/11729/ |title=Mill, John Stuart quote – Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character |publisher=Quotationsbook.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201053404/http://quotationsbook.com/quote/11729/ |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1859 |title= On Liberty |publisher=John W.Parker &amp; Son |place=London |edition= 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjpGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AHMraC_Owoi8C&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |pages=120–121|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mourned a lack of eccentricity as "the chief danger of the time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyparadise.com/quotes/mill.html |title=Famous John Stuart Mill Quotes |publisher=Philosophy Paradise |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404015825/http://www.philosophyparadise.com/quotes/mill.html |archivedate=2010-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Sitwell]] ({{nowrap|b. 1887}}) wrote that eccentricity is "often a kind of innocent pride", also saying that geniuses and aristocrats are called eccentrics because "they are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/93314 |title=Quote by Edith Sitwell: Eccentricity is not, as some would believe... |publisher=Goodreads |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentricity is also associated with great wealth. What would be considered signs of insanity in a poor person, some may accept as eccentricity in wealthy people.&lt;ref name="Battaglia1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Battaglia |first=Debbora |title=Rhetorics of self-making |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNL6_YSNv74C&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=10 November 2010 |date=1995-02-03 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-08799-6 |pages=48–49 |chapter=On Eccentricity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to considerations of normality==
A person who is simply in a "[[wikt:fish out of water|fish out of water]]" situation is not, by the strictest definition, an eccentric since (presumably) he or she may be ordinary by the conventions of his or her native environment.

Eccentrics may or may not comprehend the standards for normal behavior in their culture. They are simply unconcerned by society's disapproval of their habits or beliefs. Many of history's most brilliant minds have displayed some unusual behaviors and habits.

Some eccentrics are pejoratively considered "[[Crank (person)|cranks]]" rather than geniuses. Eccentric behavior is often considered whimsical or quirky, although it can also be strange and disturbing. Many individuals previously considered merely eccentric, such as [[aviation]] [[business magnate|magnate]] [[Howard Hughes]], have recently been retrospectively diagnosed as actually having had [[mental disorder]]s ([[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] in Hughes' case).

Other people may have an eccentric taste in [[clothes]], or eccentric [[hobbies]] or collections they pursue with great vigor. They may have a pedantic and precise manner of speaking, intermingled with inventive wordplay.

Many individuals may even manifest eccentricities consciously and deliberately in an attempt to differentiate themselves from societal norms or enhance a sense of inimitable identity. Given the overwhelmingly positive stereotypes (at least in [[popular culture]] and especially with [[fictional characters]]) often associated with eccentricity, as detailed above, certain individuals seek to be associated with this sort of character type. However, this is not always successful as eccentric individuals are not necessarily charismatic and the individual in question may simply be dismissed by others as just [[Attention seeking|seeking attention]].

''Extravagance'' is a kind of eccentricity, related to abundance and wastefulness; refer to description in ''[[hyperbole]]''.

===Characteristics===
[[Psychologist]] David Weeks believes people with a mental illness "suffer" from their behavior while eccentrics are quite happy.&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;Weeks, David and James, Jamie (1995) ''Eccentrics: A study of Sanity and Strangeness'', Villiard, {{ISBN|0-394-56565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0876/is_n75/ai_18356303/ |title=Interview with David Weeks – "Nutrition Health Review", Winter, 1996 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even states eccentrics are ''less'' prone to mental illness than everyone else.

According to Weeks' study, there are several distinctive characteristics that often differentiate a healthy eccentric person from a regular person or someone who has a mental illness. The first five characteristics on Weeks' list are found in most people regarded as eccentric:&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;&lt;!-- The list keeps being changed, but it should conform to this source which is available online and refers to the study, which is not readily available to check: http://www.gnomesondope.com/stuff/on-being-eccentric/ --&gt;&lt;!-- Elsewhere Weeks claims 25:  Rather than paraphrase a long list, I quoted the central part and added a ref.--&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Eckmann–Hilton argument''' (or '''Eckmann–Hilton principle''' or '''Eckmann–Hilton theorem''') is an [[argument]] about two [[monoid]] [[structure (category theory)|structure]]s on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] where one is a [[homomorphism]] for the other. Given this, the structures can be shown to coincide, and the resulting [[monoid]] demonstrated to be [[commutative]]. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher [[homotopy group]]s. The principle is named after [[Beno Eckmann]] and [[Peter Hilton]], who used it in a 1962 paper.

==The Eckmann–Hilton result==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set equipped with two [[Binary operation|binary operations]], which we will write &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose:

# &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; are both [[unital algebra|unital]].&lt;br /&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(a \otimes b) \circ (c \otimes d) = (a \circ c) \otimes (b \circ d)&lt;/math&gt; for all  &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; are the same and in fact commutative and associative.

===Remarks===
The operations &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; are often referred to as multiplications, but this might imply they are associative, a property which is not required for the proof. In fact, associativity follows. Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.

==Proof==
First, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:
&lt;math&gt; 1_\circ = 1_\circ \circ 1_\circ
               = (1_{\otimes} \otimes 1_\circ) \circ (1_\circ \otimes 1_\otimes)
               = (1_\otimes \circ 1_\circ) \otimes (1_\circ \circ 1_\otimes)
               = 1_\otimes \otimes 1_\otimes
               = 1_\otimes&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Now, let &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;a \circ b = (1 \otimes a) \circ (b \otimes 1)
                     = (1 \circ b) \otimes (a \circ 1)
                     = b \otimes a
                     = (b \circ 1) \otimes (1 \circ a)
                     = (b \otimes 1) \circ (1 \otimes a)
                     = b \circ a&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.

For associativity, &lt;math&gt;(a \otimes b) \otimes c = (a \otimes b) \otimes (1 \otimes c) = (a \otimes 1) \otimes (b \otimes c) = a \otimes (b \otimes c)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Remarks ==
If the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid homomorphism &lt;math&gt;(X,\circ)\times(X,\circ)\to(X,\circ)&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monoid object]] in the [[category of monoids]], then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a commutative monoid.

It is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a triviality result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of [[groupoid]]s turns out to be equivalent to the notion of [[crossed module]]. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. 

More generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the [[interchange law]] in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) [[double category]] is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written &lt;math&gt;\circ, \otimes&lt;/math&gt; then the interchange law reads 
:&lt;math&gt; (a \circ b) \otimes (c \circ d) = (a \otimes c) \circ (b \otimes d)&lt;/math&gt;
whenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. 

The history in relation to [[homotopy group]]s is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian [[fundamental group]] was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]] could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group [[Abelianisation|made abelian]]. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. 

In 1932, [[Eduard Čech]] submitted a paper on higher [[Homotopy group|homotopy groups]] to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zurich. However, [[Pavel Alexandrov|Pavel Alexandroff]] and [[Heinz Hopf]] quickly proved these groups were abelian for &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, and on these grounds persuaded Cech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the ''Proceedings''. It is said that [[Witold Hurewicz]] attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935.{{cn|date=May 2013}} Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage.{{cn|date=May 2013}} 

Cubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed  for filtered spaces in the book ''[http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html Nonabelian algebraic topology]'' cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem|Seifert-van Kampen theorem]], without using [[singular homology]] or simplicial approximation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3379">The '''epistemic virtues,''' as identified by [[virtue epistemology|virtue epistemologists]], reflect their contention that belief is an ethical process, and thus susceptible to the intellectual [[virtue]] or [[vice]] of one's own life and personal experiences. Some epistemic virtues have been identified by [[W. Jay Wood]], based on research into the [[medieval]] tradition. 

==Overview==
Being an epistemically virtuous person is often equated with being a [[critical thinking|critical thinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, M., &amp; Trout, J. D.  2004.  ''Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the human agent and the kind of practices that make it possible to arrive at the best accessible approximation of the truth.{{R|"Pigliucci"}}

Epistemic virtues include [[conscientiousness]]&lt;ref&gt;Greco, John. 2011. {{cite SEP |url-id=epistemology-virtue |title=Virtue Epistemology}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the following:{{R|"Pigliucci"}}
* attentiveness
* benevolence (principle of charity)
* [[creativity]]
* [[curiosity]] [see below]
* [[discernment]]
* [[honesty]]
* [[humility]]
* [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]
* [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]
* studiousness
* [[understanding]]
* warranty
* [[wisdom]]

These can be contrasted to the ''epistemic vices'' such as:
* closed-mindedness
* curiosity [see below]
* [[dogma]]tism
* epistemic blindness
* [[folly (disambiguation)|folly]]
* [[gullibility]]
* [[intellectual dishonesty]]
* obtuseness
* self-deception
* [[superficiality]] of thought
* [[superstition]]
* willful naïveté
* [[wishful thinking]]

Note that in this context ''curiosity'' bears the medieval connotation of attraction to unwholesome things, in contrast to the positive ''studious'' (or perhaps ''inquisitive'').

'''Erikson's stages of psychosocial development''', as articulated in the second half of the 20th century by [[Erik Erikson]] in collaboration with [[Joan Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mcg. Thomas Jr., "Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles," ''New York Times'' obituary, August 8, 1997. Online at https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html.&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory that identifies a series of eight [[developmental stage theories|stage]]s that a healthy developing individual should pass through from [[Infant|infancy]] to late [[adulthood]].

Erikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating his or her biological and sociocultural forces. Each stage is characterized by a psychosocial crisis of these two conflicting forces. If an individual does indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned attribute in the crisis), he or she emerges from the stage with the corresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage (autonomy vs. shame and doubt) with more trust than mistrust, he or she carries the virtue of hope into the remaining life stages.&lt;ref name=Crain&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crain|first1=William|title=Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications|edition=6th |year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-205-81046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be expected to return as problems in the future. However, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage. The outcome of one stage is not permanent and can be modified by later experiences.

===Hope: Trust vs. Mistrust (oral-sensory, Infancy, under 2 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Trust the World?

The first stage of Erik Erikson's theory centers around the infant's basic needs being met by the parents and how this interaction leads to trust or mistrust. Trust as defined by Erikson is "an essential trustfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one's own trustworthiness."&lt;ref name=Muskigum&gt;http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/erikson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The infant depends on the parents, especially the mother, for sustenance and comfort. The child's relative understanding of world and society comes from the parents and their interaction with the child. A child's first trust is always with the parent or caregiver; whoever that might be, however, the caregiver is secondary whereas the parents are primary in the eyes of the child. If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularity, and dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. Should parents fail to provide a secure environment and to meet the child's basic needs; a sense of mistrust will result.&lt;ref name=Bee&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bee |first1=Helen |last2=Boyd |first2=Denise |title=The Developing Child |edition=12th |date=March 2009 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-205-68593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of mistrust can lead to feelings of frustration, suspicion, withdrawal, and a lack of confidence.&lt;ref name=Muskigum /&gt;

According to Erik Erikson, the major developmental task in infancy is to learn whether or not other people, especially primary caregivers, regularly satisfy basic needs. If caregivers are consistent sources of food, comfort, and affection, an infant learns trust — that others are dependable and reliable. If they are neglectful, or perhaps even abusive, the infant instead learns mistrust — that the world is an undependable, unpredictable, and possibly a dangerous place. While negative, having some experience with mistrust allows the infant to gain an understanding of what constitutes dangerous situations later in life; yet being at the stage of infant or toddler, it is a good idea not to put them in prolonged situations of mistrust: the child's number one needs are to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

===Will: Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt (muscular-anal, Toddlerhood, 2–4 years)===
*Existential Question: Is It Okay to Be Me?
As the child gains control over eliminative functions and [[Motor skill|motor abilities]], they begin to explore their surroundings. Parents still provide a strong base of security from which the child can venture out to assert their will. The parents' patience and encouragement helps foster autonomy in the child. Children at this age like to explore the world around them and they are constantly learning about their environment. Caution must be taken at this age while children may explore things that are dangerous to their health and safety. 

At this age children develop their first interests. For example, a child who enjoys music may like to play with the radio. Children who enjoy the outdoors may be interested in animals and plants. Highly restrictive parents, however, are more likely to instill in the child a sense of doubt, and reluctance to attempt new challenges. As they gain increased muscular coordination and mobility, toddlers become capable of satisfying some of their own needs. They begin to feed themselves, wash and dress themselves, and use the bathroom.

If caregivers encourage self-sufficient behavior, toddlers develop a sense of autonomy—a sense of being able to handle many problems on their own. But if caregivers demand too much too soon, or refuse to let children perform tasks of which they are capable, or ridicule early attempts at self-sufficiency, children may instead develop shame and doubt about their ability to handle problems.

===Purpose: Initiative vs. Guilt (locomotor-genital, Early Childhood, 5–8 years)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay for Me to Do, Move, and Act? 
Initiative adds to autonomy the quality of planning, undertaking and attacking a task for the sake of just being active and on the move.  The child is learning to master the world around them, learning basic skills and principles of physics. Things fall down, not up. Round things roll. They learn how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease. At this stage, the child wants to begin and complete their own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a confusing new emotion. They may feel guilty over things that logically should not cause guilt. They may feel guilt when this initiative does not produce desired results.

The development of courage and independence are what set preschoolers, ages three to six years of age, apart from other age groups. Young children in this category face the challenge of initiative versus guilt. As described in Bee and Boyd (2004),&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; the child during this stage faces the complexities of planning and developing a sense of judgment. During this stage, the child learns to take initiative and prepare for leadership and goal achievement roles. Activities sought out by a child in this stage may include risk-taking behaviors, such as crossing a street alone or riding a bike without a helmet; both these examples involve self-limits. 

Within instances requiring initiative, the child may also develop negative behaviors. These negative behaviors are a result of the child developing a sense of frustration for not being able to achieve a goal as planned and may engage in negative behaviors that seem aggressive, ruthless, and overly assertive to parents. Aggressive behaviors, such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling, are examples of observable behaviors during this stage.

Preschoolers are increasingly able to accomplish tasks on their own, and can start new things. With this growing independence comes many choices about activities to be pursued. Sometimes children take on projects they can readily accomplish, but at other times they undertake projects that are beyond their capabilities or that interfere with other people's plans and activities. If parents and preschool teachers encourage and support children's efforts, while also helping them make realistic and appropriate choices, children develop initiative—independence in planning and undertaking activities. But if, instead, adults discourage the pursuit of independent activities or dismiss them as silly and bothersome, children develop guilt about their needs and desires.&lt;ref&gt;Axia College Materials (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competence: Industry vs. Inferiority (latency, Middle Childhood, 9-12 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make it in the World of People and Things?
The aim to bring a productive situation to completion gradually supersedes the whims and wishes of [[Play (activity)|play]].
The fundamentals of technology are developed. The failure to master trust, autonomy, and industrious skills may cause the child to doubt his or her future, leading to shame, guilt, and the experience of defeat and inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stages of Social-Emotional Development – Erik Erikson | website = childdevelopmentinfo.com | publisher = Child Development Institute | url = http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/child-development/erickson/#ixzz3ZaBI7RQf | accessdate = 8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The child must deal with demands to learn new skills or risk a sense of inferiority, failure, and incompetence.

"Children at this age are becoming more aware of themselves as individuals." They work hard at "being responsible, being good and doing it right." They are now more reasonable to share and cooperate. Allen and Marotz (2003)&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Eileen |last2=Marotz |first2=Lynn |title=Developmental Profiles Pre-Birth Through Twelve |edition=4th |year=2003 |publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning |location=Albany, NY |isbn=978-0-7668-3765-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also list some perceptual cognitive developmental traits specific for this age group. Children grasp the concepts of [[space]] and time in more logical, practical ways. They gain a better understanding of cause and effect, and of calendar time. At this stage, children are eager to [[learn]] and accomplish more complex skills: reading, writing, telling time. They also get to form [[moral values]], recognize cultural and individual differences and are able to manage most of their personal needs and grooming with minimal assistance.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; At this stage, children might express their independence by talking back and being disobedient and rebellious.

Erikson viewed the [[elementary school]] years as critical for the development of [[self-confidence]]. Ideally, elementary school provides many opportunities to achieve the recognition of teachers, parents and peers by producing things—drawing pictures, solving addition problems, writing sentences, and so on. If children are encouraged to make and do things and are then praised for their accomplishments, they begin to demonstrate industry by being diligent, persevering at tasks until completed, and putting work before pleasure. If children are instead ridiculed or punished for their efforts or if they find they are incapable of meeting their teachers' and parents' expectations, they develop feelings of [[inferiority]] about their capabilities.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

At this age, children start recognizing their special talents and continue to discover interests as their education improves.  They may begin to choose to do more 
activities to pursue that interest, such as joining a sport if they know they have athletic ability, or joining the band if they are good at music.  If not allowed to discover their own talents in their own time, they will develop a sense of lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and lethargy.  They may become "couch potatoes" if they are not allowed to develop interests.

===Fidelity: Identity vs. Role Confusion (Adolescence, 13–19 years)===
*Existential Question: Who Am I and What Can I Be?
The adolescent is newly concerned with how they appear to others. Superego identity is the accrued confidence that the outer sameness and continuity prepared in the future are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for oneself, as evidenced in the promise of a career. The ability to settle on a school or occupational identity is pleasant. In later stages of adolescence, the child develops a sense of [[sexual identity]]. As they make the transition from childhood to adulthood, adolescents ponder the roles they will play in the adult world. Initially, they are apt to experience some role confusion—mixed ideas and feelings about the specific ways in which they will fit into society—and may experiment with a variety of behaviors and activities (e.g. tinkering with cars, baby-sitting for neighbors, affiliating with certain political or religious groups). Eventually, Erikson proposed, most adolescents achieve a sense of identity regarding who they are and where their lives are headed.

The teenager must achieve identity in occupation, gender roles, politics, and, in some cultures, religion.

Erikson is credited with coining the term "[[identity crisis]]".&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Each stage that came before and that follows has its own 'crisis', but even more so now, for this marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. This passage is necessary because "Throughout infancy and childhood, a person forms many identifications. But the need for identity in youth is not met by these."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright, Jr |first1=J. Eugene |title=Erikson: Identity and Religion |year=1982 |publisher=Seabury Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8164-2362-8 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turning point in human development seems to be the reconciliation between 'the person one has come to be' and 'the person society expects one to become'. This emerging sense of self will be established by 'forging' past experiences with anticipations of the future. In relation to the eight life stages as a whole, the fifth stage corresponds to the crossroads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is unique about the stage of Identity is that it is a special sort of synthesis of earlier stages and a special sort of anticipation of later ones. Youth has a certain unique quality in a person's life; it is a bridge between childhood and adulthood. Youth is a time of radical change—the great body changes accompanying puberty, the ability of the mind to search one's own intentions and the intentions of others, the suddenly sharpened awareness of the roles society has offered for later life.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Francis L. |title=Introducing Erik Erikson: An Invitation to his Thinking|year=1987 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=0-8191-5788-0 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adolescents "are confronted by the need to re-establish [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] for themselves and to do this in the face of an often potentially hostile world".&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=Richard |title=Erik Erikson: An Introduction |year=1983 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-312-25812-2 |pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often challenging since commitments are being asked for before particular identity roles have formed. At this point, one is in a state of 'identity confusion', but society normally makes allowances for youth to "find themselves", and this state is called 'the moratorium':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem of adolescence is one of role confusion—a reluctance to commit which may haunt a person into his mature years. Given the right conditions—and Erikson believes these are essentially having enough space and time, a psychosocial moratorium, when a person can freely experiment and explore—what may emerge is a firm sense of identity, an emotional and deep awareness of who he or she is.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in other stages, bio-psycho-social forces are at work. No matter how one has been raised, one's personal ideologies are now chosen for oneself. Often, this leads to conflict with adults over religious and political orientations. Another area where teenagers are deciding for themselves is their career choice, and often parents want to have a decisive say in that role. If society is too insistent, the teenager will acquiesce to external wishes, effectively forcing him or her to ‘foreclose' on experimentation and, therefore, true self-discovery. Once someone settles on a worldview and vocation, will he or she be able to integrate this aspect of self-definition into a diverse society? According to Erikson, when an adolescent has balanced both perspectives of "What have I got?" and "What am I going to do with it?" he or she has established their identity:&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dependent on this stage is the ego quality of ''fidelity—the ability to sustain loyalties freely pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions and confusions of value systems''. (Italics in original)&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given that the next stage (Intimacy) is often characterized by marriage, many are tempted to cap off the fifth stage at 20 years of age. However, these age ranges are actually quite fluid, especially for the achievement of identity, since it may take many years to become grounded, to identify the object of one's fidelity, to feel that one has "come of age". In the biographies ''[[Young Man Luther]]'' and ''[[Gandhi's Truth]]'', Erikson determined that their crises ended at ages 25 and 30, respectively:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Erikson does note that the time of Identity crisis for persons of genius is frequently prolonged. He further notes that in our industrial society, identity formation tends to be long, because it takes us so long to gain the skills needed for adulthood's tasks in our technological world. So… we do not have an exact time span in which to find ourselves. It doesn't happen automatically at eighteen or at twenty-one. A ''very'' approximate rule of thumb for our society would put the end somewhere in one's twenties.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Love: Intimacy vs. Isolation (Early Adulthood, 20-39 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Love?
The Intimacy vs. Isolation conflict is emphasized around the age of 30.  At the start of this stage, identity vs. role confusion is coming to an end, though it still lingers at the foundation of the stage (Erikson, 1950).  Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with friends.  They want to fit in.
Erikson believes we are sometimes isolated due to intimacy.  We are afraid of rejections such as being turned down or our partners breaking up with us.  We are familiar with pain and to some of us rejection is so painful that our egos cannot bear it. Erikson also argues that "Intimacy has a counterpart: Distantiation: the readiness to isolate and if necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose essence seems dangerous to our own, and whose territory seems to encroach on the extent of one's intimate relations" (1950).

Once people have established their identities, they are ready to make long-term commitments to others. They become capable of forming intimate, reciprocal relationships (e.g. through close friendships or marriage) and willingly make the sacrifices and compromises that such relationships require. If people cannot form these intimate relationships—perhaps because of their own needs—a sense of isolation may result; arousing feelings of darkness and angst.

===Care: Generativity vs. Stagnation (Middle Adulthood, 40–59 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make My Life Count?
[[Generativity]] is the concern of guiding the next generation. Socially-valued work and disciplines are expressions of generativity. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The adult stage of generativity has broad application to family, relationships, work, and society. "Generativity, then is primarily the concern in establishing and guiding the next generation... the concept is meant to include... productivity and creativity."&lt;ref name=Slater2003&gt;{{Citation

During middle age the primary developmental task is one of contributing to society and helping to guide future generations. When a person makes a contribution during this period, perhaps by raising a family or working toward the betterment of society, a sense of generativity—a sense of productivity and accomplishment—results. In contrast, a person who is self-centered and unable or unwilling to help society move forward develops a feeling of stagnation—a dissatisfaction with the relative lack of productivity.

:Central tasks of middle adulthood
* Express love through more than sexual contacts.
* Maintain healthy life patterns.
* Develop a sense of unity with mate.
* Help growing and grown children to be responsible adults.
* Relinquish central role in lives of grown children.
* Accept children's mates and friends.
* Create a comfortable home.
* Be proud of accomplishments of self and mate/spouse.
* Reverse roles with aging parents.
* Achieve mature, civic and social responsibility.
* Adjust to physical changes of middle age.
* Use leisure time creatively.

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair (Late Adulthood, 60 years and above)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay to Have Been Me?
As we grow older and become senior citizens we tend to slow down our productivity and explore life as a retired person. It is during this time that we contemplate our accomplishments and are able to develop [[ego integrity|integrity]] if we see ourselves as leading a successful life. If we see our life as unproductive, or feel that we did not accomplish our life goals, we become dissatisfied with life and develop [[despair]], often leading to depression and hopelessness.

The final developmental task is retrospection: people look back on their lives and accomplishments. They develop feelings of contentment and integrity if they believe that they have led a happy, productive life. They may instead develop a sense of despair if they look back on a life of disappointments and unachieved goals.

This stage can occur out of the sequence when an individual feels they are near the end of their life (such as when receiving a terminal disease diagnosis).

===Ninth stage===
*Psychosocial Crises: All first eight stages in reverse quotient order
[[Joan Erikson|Joan M. Erikson]], who married and collaborated with Erik Erikson, added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Living in the ninth stage, she wrote, "old age in one's eighties and nineties brings with it new demands, reevaluations, and daily difficulties". Addressing these new challenges requires "designating a new ninth stage". Erikson was ninety-three years old when she wrote about the ninth stage.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 4, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Erikson showed that all the eight stages "are relevant and recurring in the ninth stage".&lt;ref&gt;James Mooney, "Erik Erikson" in  Joe L. Kincheloe, Raymond A. Horn, editors, ''The Praeger Handbook of Education and Psychology, Volume 1'' (Praeger, 2007), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth stage, the psychosocial crises of the eight stages are faced again, but with the quotient order reversed. For example, in the first stage (infancy), the psychosocial crisis was "Trust vs. Mistrust" with Trust being the "syntonic quotient" and Mistrust being the "dystonic".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Erikson applies the earlier psychosocial crises to the ninth stage as follows:

'''"Basic Mistrust vs. Trust: Hope"'''&lt;br/&gt;
In the ninth stage, "elders are forced to mistrust their own capabilities" because one's "body inevitably weakens". Yet, Joan Erikson asserts that "while there is light, there is hope" for a "bright light and revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Shame and Doubt vs. Autonomy: Will"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Ninth stage elders face the "shame of lost control" and doubt "their autonomy over their own bodies". So it is that "shame and doubt challenge cherished autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Inferiority vs. Industry: Competence"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Industry as a "driving force" that elders once had is gone in the ninth stage. Being incompetent "because of aging is belittling" and makes elders "like unhappy small children of great age".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Identity confusion vs. Identity: Fidelity"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Elders experience confusion about their "existential identity" in the ninth stage and "a real uncertainty about status and role".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Isolation vs. Intimacy: Love"'''&lt;br/&gt;
In the ninth stage, the "years of intimacy and love" are often replaced by "isolation and deprivation". Relationships become "overshadowed by new incapacities and dependencies".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Stagnation vs. Generativity: Care"'''&lt;br/&gt;
The generativity in the seventh stage of "work and family relationships", if it goes satisfactorily, is "a wonderful time to be alive". In one's eighties and nineties, there is less energy for generativity or caretaking. Thus, "a sense of stagnation may well take over".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Despair and Disgust vs. Integrity: Wisdom"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Integrity imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders". Wisdom requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have". The eighth stage includes retrospection that can evoke a "degree of disgust and despair". In the ninth stage, introspection is replaced by the attention demanded to one's "loss of capacities and disintegration".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in the ninth stage, Joan Erikson expressed confidence that the psychosocial crisis of the ninth stage can be met as in the first stage with the "basic trust" with which "we are blessed".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112-113. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of post-Freudian theory==
Erikson was a student of [[Anna Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrightsman |first=Lawrence S. |title=Adult Personality Development |year=1994 |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=0-8039-4400-4 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Sigmund Freud]], whose psychoanalytic theory and [[psychosexual stages]] contributed to the basic outline of the eight stages, at least those concerned with childhood. Namely, the first four of Erikson's life stages correspond to Freud's oral, anal, phallic, and latency phases, respectively. Also, the fifth stage of adolescence is said to parallel the genital stage in psychosexual development:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the first three phases are linked to those of the Freudian theory, it can be seen that they are conceived along very different lines. Emphasis is not so much on sexual modes and their consequences as on the ego qualities which emerge from each stages. There is an attempt also to link the sequence of individual development to the broader context of society.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erikson saw a dynamic at work throughout life, one that did not stop at adolescence. He also viewed the life stages as a cycle: the end of one generation was the beginning of the next. Seen in its social context, the life stages were linear for an individual but circular for societal development:&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;{{cite book |last=Erikson |first=Erik H. |title=Childhood and Society |year=1993 |origyear=1950 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-393-31068-9 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Freud's view, development is largely complete by adolescence. In contrast, one of Freud's students, Erik Erikson (1902–1994) believed that development continues throughout life. Erikson took the foundation laid by Freud and extended it through adulthood and into late life.&lt;ref name=Kail&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Robert V. |last2=Cavanaugh |first2=John C. |title=Human development: A life-span view |year=2004 |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location=Belmont, CA |isbn=978-0-534-59751-1 |page=16 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==
{{POV section|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- surely there are some critical experimental results? This theory doesn't have consensus support, does it? --&gt;
Erikson's theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential, and only occurring within the age ranges he suggests.  There is debate{{Citation needed|reason=Where are the references to debate|date=July 2018}} as to whether people only search for identity during the adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed. However, Erikson states that each of these processes occur throughout the lifetime in one form or another, and he emphasizes these "phases" only because it is at these times that the conflicts become most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association |year=1956 |volume=4 |pages=56–121 |title=The problem of ego identity |last=Erikson |first=Erik |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=apa.004.0056a |format=pdf |accessdate=2012-01-28 |doi=10.1177/000306515600400104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most empirical research into Erikson has related to his views on adolescence and attempts to establish identity. His theoretical approach was studied and supported, particularly regarding adolescence, by [[James Marcia|James E. Marcia]].&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  |year=1966 |volume=3 |pages=551–558 |title=Development and validation of ego identity status |last=Marcia |first=James E. |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1984/A1984TR91100001.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-28|doi=10.1037/h0023281 |pmid=5939604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia's work has distinguished different forms of identity, and there is some empirical evidence that those people who form the most coherent self-concept in adolescence are those who are most able to make intimate attachments in early adulthood. This supports the part of Eriksonian theory, that suggests that those best equipped to resolve the crisis of early adulthood are those who have most successfully resolved the crisis of adolescence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1759">In mathematics, and especially [[general topology]], the '''Euclidean topology''' is the [[natural topology]] induced on [[Euclidean space|Euclidean n-space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]].

In any [[metric space]], the [[Ball_(mathematics)|open balls]] form a [[Base (topology)|base]] for a topology on that space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metric space|Metric space#Open and closed sets.2C topology and convergence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is then simply the topology ''generated'' by these balls. In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are given by (arbitrary) unions of the open balls &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p)&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p) := \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid d(p,x) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean metric.

An '''excursus''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''excurrere'', "to run out of") is a short episode or anecdote in a work of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excursus |title=excursus - definition of excursus |work=the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often excursuses have nothing to do with the matter being discussed by the work, and are used to lighten the atmosphere in a tragic story, a similar function to that of [[satyr play]]s in Greek theatre. Sometimes they are used to provide [[backstory]] to the matter being discussed at hand, as in [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]' ''[[Bibliotheke]]''. In the Middle Ages, the excursus is a favourite rhetorical devise to allow the narrator to comment or to suspend the action for reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1018284482|title=Exkurse im höfischen Roman|last=Linden|first=Sandra|publisher=Reichert|year=2017|isbn=9783954902330|location=Wiesbaden|pages=1|oclc=1018284482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an excursus is often applied to a piece of academic writing to provide digressive information, which does not contribute directly to the line of argument, but can still be linked with the overall topic of the text.

== Etymologies as excursuses ==
Sometimes detailed or fanciful [[Etymology|etymologies]] are used as excursuses. This was used as early as the 5th Century BC by the poet [[Pindar]]. The most famous case of etymologies being used as excursuses is in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (''ca.'' 1260) of [[Jacobus de Voragine]], in which the life of each saint is proceeded by an etymology about the origin of the saint's name.

In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]], '''filial piety''' ({{zh|c=孝}}, ''xiào'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors. The Confucian ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book, a purported dialogue between [[Confucius]] and his student [[Zengzi]], is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. The term can also be applied to general [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Filial piety is central to Confucian [[role ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, filial [[piety]] means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'' (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:二十四孝|二十四孝]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Filial piety is illustrated by the [[Chinese character]] ''xiao'' (孝).&lt;ref name=ikels2&gt;{{cite book|last=Ikels|first=Charlotte|title=Filial piety: Practice and discourse in contemporary East Asia|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4791-2|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is a combination of the character ''lao'' (old) above the character ''zi'' (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son.&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; In [[Korean Confucianism]], the character {{linktext|孝}} is pronounced ''hyo'' (효). In Vietnamese, the character {{linktext|孝}} is written in [[Vietnamese alphabet|Quoc Ngu]] as ''hiếu''.  In Japanese, the term is generally used in spoken and written language as 親孝行, "''oyakōkō''," adding characters for ''parent'' and ''conduct'' to make the word more specific.

According to the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', Confucius once said: "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity."&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; For Confucius, filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents. More important than the norms of ''xiào'' were the norms of ''rén'' (仁; [[Ren (Confucianism)|benevolence]]) and ''yì'' (義; [[Yi (Confucianism)|righteousness]]). For Confucius and [[Mencius]], ''xiào'' was a display of ''rén'' which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders, thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations. However, in practice, ''xiào'' was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents, and from time to time, was elevated above the notions of ''rén'' and ''yì''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Filial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Analects 1:2, Xiao Jing chap.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Buddhism stressed ''individual'' salvation, and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China, which stressed the good of the ''community'' more than the good of the ''individual''. In India, Buddhism also advocated [[celibacy]] among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view, given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line.&lt;ref&gt;Traylor, Kenneth L. ''Chinese Filial Piety.'' Bloomington: Eastern Press, 1988. pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduction of Buddhism in China====
When Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' (牟子理惑論), a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese, presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents, by closely reading the works of Confucius himself. The ''[[Guiyangtu]]'' (跪羊图)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=跪羊图高清大字版|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xo5KwtW1M|website=Youtube|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vimalakirti]] Nirdesa Sutra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert|first1=Thurman|title=Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Vimalakirti.htm|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation.

=====Mouzi Lihuolun=====
The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's life would have been lost in the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, John P. (1994). ''How master Mou removes our doubts: a reader-response study and translation of the'' Mou-tzu Li-huo lun'', SUNY Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar.  While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation. The ''Mouzi Lihuolun'' also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of [[asceticism|ascetic]] sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius.  The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent’s soul is the most important one. The same essential argument was made later by [[Sun Chuo]], who argued that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, E.  ''The Buddhist Conquest of China.'' Leiden: E. J. Brill., 1959a, pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] continued in this reasoning, arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk, then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives.

=====Adaptation =====
These philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct, and so less subtle methods were employed.  To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. ''The story of Shanzi'' 睒子 ("Syama" in [[Sanskrit]], Sama in [[Pali|Pāli]], from the "[[Jataka tales|Sama Jātaka]]"), is an example of this.

=====''Story of Shanzi''=====
Shanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents, until he was accidentally killed.  But, because of his life of filial devotion, he was miraculously revived.  This story was often mentioned in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese canon]] of Buddhist texts, and was included in a number of different anthologies (such as the ''Liudu Jijing'' and referred to by other [[Chinese Buddhist]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'en, Kenneth. ''The Chinese Transformation of Buddhism.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973. pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; While it is clearly of [[Buddhism in India|Indian]] origin based on the story of [[Shravan]], this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales. While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings, philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=====The story of Moggallāna=====
{{Main|Mulian Rescues His Mother}}
Another story advocating filial piety is that of [[Moggallana|Moggallāna]], a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life. This story appeared in the ''[[Ullambana Sutra|Ullambana Sūtra]]'' and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tzǔ, though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism. In China, however, these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture, but also popular tales which were even told among non-Buddhists. While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berezkin|first1=Rostislav|title=Pictorial Versions of the Mulian Story in East Asia (Tenth–Seventeenth Centuries): On the Connections of Religious Painting and Storytelling|journal=Fudan Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences|date=21 February 2015|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s40647-015-0060-4 |others=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Williams|editor-first1=Paul|editor-last2=Ladwig|editor-first2=Patrice|editorlink1=Paul Williams (philosopher)|author-last1=Ladwig|author-first1=Patrice|encyclopedia=Buddhist funeral cultures of Southeast Asia and China|title=Feeding the dead: ghosts, materiality and merit|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=1-107-00388-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3zdJ1kHIkxEC |p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other texts=====
Another tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the Buddha rising to heaven for three months after his [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy.  This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents, in that he cared for their immortal souls.

A number of [[Apocryphal Buddhist sutra|apocryphal texts]] were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent-child relationship.  The most important of these, the ''[[Sutra of Filial Piety]]'', was written early in the [[Tang dynasty]]. This [[Sutra|text (''sūtra'')]] has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child.  In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect.  Despite being a forgery, the ''sūtra'' was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners, and it played an important role in the development of a [[Chinese Buddhism|fully Chinese variation of Buddhism]]. Other documents discussing the Buddha’s views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries.  The ''[[Sutra on a Filial Son]]'', for instance, also sounds far more Chinese than Indian, and shows Confucian influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Criticism ===
Lu Xun in his collection "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk" (朝花夕拾) criticized the stories "He Buried His Son for His Mother" and "Wang Xiang: He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp". The latter story is about Wang Xiang, a very young boy, who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Aristotle]]'s Four Causes illustrated for a table: material (wood), formal (design), efficient (carpentry), final (dining).]]
The "'''four causes'''" are elements of an influential principle in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian thought]] whereby explanations of change or movement are classified into four fundamental types of answer to the question "why?". [[Aristotle]] wrote that "we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 194 b17–20; see also: {{nowrap|''Posterior Analytics'' 71 b9–11; 94 a20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"&gt; "[F]or a full range of cases, an explanation which fails to invoke all four causes is no explanation at all."—[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FouCau "Four Causes"]. Falcon, Andrea. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/ Aristotle on Causality]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are cases where identifying a "cause" is difficult, or in which "causes" might merge, Aristotle held that his four "causes" provided an analytical scheme of general applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' (1992). p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aitia''''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, was the word that Aristotle used to refer to the causal explanation that has traditionally been translated as "cause", but this specialized, technical, philosophical usage of the word "cause" does not correspond exactly to its most usual applications in everyday English language.{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92}} The translation of Aristotle's {{lang|grc|αἰτία}} that is nearest to current ordinary language could be "question" or "causal explanation",&lt;ref name="Hankison1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"/&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pages=91–92}} although any such terms may mask the fact that Aristotelians consider the four causes to be more fundamental in nature than mere explanations. In this article, the peculiar philosophical usage of the word "cause" will be employed, for tradition's sake, but the reader should not be misled by confusing this technical usage with current ordinary language.

Aristotle held that there were four kinds of answers to "why" questions (in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' II, 3, and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' V, 2):&lt;ref name="SEP Four Causes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1013a |title=Metaphysics |chapter=Book 5, section 1013a |others=Translated by Hugh Tredennick |author=Aristotle}} Aristotle in 23 Volumes, Vols. 17, 18, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1933, 1989; (hosted at perseus.tufts.edu.)

* '''Matter''': a change or movement's '''material cause''', is the aspect of the change or movement which is determined by the material that composes the moving or changing things. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble.
* '''Form''': a change or movement's '''formal cause''', is a change or movement caused by the arrangement, shape or appearance of the thing changing or moving. Aristotle says for example that the ratio 2:1, and number in general, is the cause of the [[octave]].
* '''Agent''': a change or movement's '''efficient''' or '''moving cause''', consists of things apart from the thing being changed or moved, which interact so as to be an agency of the change or movement. For example, the efficient cause of a table is a carpenter, or a person working as one, and according to Aristotle the efficient cause of a boy is a father.
* '''End''' or '''purpose''': a change or movement's '''final cause''', is that for the sake of which a thing is what it is. For a seed, it might be an adult plant. For a sailboat, it might be sailing. For a ball at the top of a ramp, it might be coming to rest at the bottom.
The four "causes" are not mutually exclusive. For Aristotle, several answers to the question "why" have to be given to explain a phenomenon and especially the actual configuration of an object.&lt;ref&gt;According to Reece (2018): "Aristotle thinks that human action is a species of animal self-movement, and animal self-movement is a species of natural change. Natural changes, although they are not substances and do not have causes in precisely the same way that substances do, are to be explained in terms of the four causes, or as many of them as a given natural change has: The material cause is that out of which something comes to be, or what undergoes change from one state to another; the formal cause, what differentiates something from other things, and serves as a paradigm for its coming to be that thing; the efficient cause, the starting-point of change; the final cause, that for the sake of which something comes about."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if asking why a table is such and such, a complete explanation, taking into account the four causes, would sound like this: This table is solid and brown because it is made of wood (matter), it does not collapse because it has four legs of equal length (form), it is as such because a carpenter made it starting from a tree (agent), it has these dimensions because it is to be used by men and women (end).

==Meaning of "cause"==

In his philosophical writings, Aristotle used the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word [[wikt:αἴτιος|αἴτιον]], ''aition'', a neuter singular form of an adjective. The Greek word had meant, perhaps originally in a [[Ancient Greek law | "legal"]] context, what or who is "[[Personal responsibility|responsible]]", mostly but not always in a bad sense of "guilt" or "blame"; alternatively it could mean "to the credit of" someone or something. The appropriation of this word by Aristotle and other philosophers reflects how the Greek experience of legal practice influenced the concern in Greek thought to determine ''what'' is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G.

=== {{anchor|Material cause}} Matter ===

Aristotle considers the '''material "cause"''' (''hyle'')&lt;ref name=preus&gt;{{cite dictionary |author=Preus, Anthony |year=2015 |title=Material cause |work=Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy |edition=2nd |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=wjW_BgAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0810854871}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an object as equivalent to the nature of the raw material out of which the object is composed. (The word "nature" for Aristotle applies to both its potential in the raw material and its ultimate finished form. In a sense this form already existed in the material: see [[potentiality and actuality]].)

Whereas modern physics looks to simple bodies, Aristotle's physics instead treated living things as exemplary. However, he felt that simple natural bodies such as earth, fire, air, and water also showed signs of having their own innate sources of motion, change, and rest. Fire, for example, carries things upwards, unless stopped from doing so. Things like beds and cloaks, formed by human artifice, have no innate tendency to become beds or cloaks.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192b&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotelian terminology, material is not the same as [[Substance theory|substance]]. Matter has parallels with substance in so far as primary matter serves as the substratum for simple bodies which are not substance: sand and rock (mostly earth), rivers and seas (mostly water), atmosphere and wind (mostly air and then mostly fire below the moon). Only individuals are said to be substance (subjects) in the primary sense. Secondary substance, in a different sense, also applies to man-made artifacts.

=== {{anchor|Formal cause}} Form ===
{{see|Platonic realism}}

Aristotle considers the '''formal "cause"''' (''eidos'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; as describing the pattern or form which when present makes matter into a particular type of thing, which we recognize as being of that particular type.

By Aristotle's own account, this is a difficult and controversial [[concept]].{{citation needed|date= September 2016}} It links with [[theory of forms|theories of forms]] such as those of Aristotle's teacher, [[Plato]], but in Aristotle's own account (see his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''), he takes into account many previous writers who had expressed opinions about forms and ideas, but he shows how his own views differ from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G. E. R. | author-link=G. E. R. Lloyd | date=1968 | title=Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of His Thought | chapter=The critic of Plato | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | pages=43–47 | isbn=0-521-09456-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Efficient cause}} Agent ===

Aristotle defines the '''agent''' or '''efficient "cause"''' (''kinoun'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; of an object as that which causes change and motion to start or stop (such as a painter painting a house) (see Aristotle, Physics II 3, 194b29). In many cases, this is simply the thing that brings something about. For example, in the case of a statue, it is the person chiseling away which transforms a block of marble into a statue. Only this one of the four causes is like what an ordinary English-speaker would regard as a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last=Lloyd | first=G. E. R. | author-link=G. E. R. Lloyd | date=1996 | title=Adversaries and authorities: Investigations into ancient Greek and Chinese science | chapter=Causes and correlations | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | page=96 | isbn=0-521-55695-3 | quote=It is clear that of these four, only the efficient cause looks like a ''cause'' in any ordinary English sense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Final cause}} End ===
{{Main article|Teleology}}

Aristotle defines the '''end''', '''purpose''', or '''final "cause"''' (''telos'')&lt;ref name=preus/&gt; as that for the sake of which a thing is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Aristotle | author-link=Aristotle | title=Physics | at=II.3. 194 &lt;sup&gt;b 32&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the form, this is a controversial type of explanation in science; some have argued for its survival in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Lennox | first=James G. | author-link=James G. Lennox | date=1993 | title=Darwin ''was'' a teleologist | journal=Biology and Philosophy | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=409–421 | doi=10.1007/BF00857687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ernst Mayr]] denied that it continued to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last=Mayr | first=Ernst | author-link=Ernst Mayr | date=10 November 1961 | title=Cause and Effect in Biology | volume=134 | issue=3489 | pages=1501–1506 | quote= The development or behavior of an individual is purposive, natural selection is definitely not…. Darwin 'has swept out such finalistic teleology by the front door.' }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly claimed{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that Aristotle's conception of nature is teleological in the sense that [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] has goals apart from those that humans have. On the other hand, as discussed further below, it has also been claimed that Aristotle thought that a ''telos'' can be present without any form of deliberation, consciousness or intelligence. An example of a relevant passage occurs in ''Physics'' II.8, where he writes:

{{quote|This is most obvious in the animals other than man: they make things neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation. That is why people wonder whether it is by intelligence or by some other faculty that these creatures work, – spiders, ants, and the like... It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'' Vol. I. The Revised Oxford Translation, ed. Jonathan Barnes).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, according to Aristotle, a seed has the eventual adult plant as its end (i.e., as its ''telos'') if and only if the seed would become the adult plant under normal circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle gives this example in ''Parts of Animals'' I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Physics'' II.9, Aristotle hazards a few arguments that a determination of the end (cause) of a phenomenon is more important than the others. He argues that the end is that which brings it about, so for example "if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.9. 200b4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, once a final "cause" is in place, the material, efficient and formal "causes" follow by necessity. However, he recommends that the student of nature determine the other "causes" as well,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that not all phenomena have an end, e.g., chance events.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' II.5 where chance is opposed to nature, which he has already said acts for ends.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle saw that [[Aristotle's biology|his biological investigations]] provided insights into the causes of things, especially into the final cause.
{{quote|We should approach the investigation of every kind of animal without being ashamed, since in each one of them there is something natural and something beautiful.  The absence of chance and the serving of ends are found in the works of nature especially. And the end, for the sake of which a thing has been constructed or has come to be, belongs to what is beautiful. |source=Aristotle, ''On the Parts of Animals'' 645&lt;sup&gt;a 21-26&lt;/sup&gt;, Book I, Part 5.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G. E. R. (1970). ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', New York: W. W. Norton, p. 105. ISBN 978-0-393-00583-7 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Holmes Howison]], in ''The Limits of Evolution'' (1901), highlights "final causation" in presenting his theory of metaphysics, which he terms "personal idealism", and to which he invites not only man, but all (ideal) life; at p.&amp;nbsp;39: 

{{quote|Here, in seeing that Final Cause &amp;ndash; causation at the call of self-posited aim or end – is the only full and genuine cause, we further see that Nature, the cosmic aggregate of phenomena and the cosmic bond of their law which in the mood of vague and inaccurate abstraction we call Force, is after all only an effect... Thus teleology, or the Reign of Final Cause, the reign of ideality, is not only an element in the notion of Evolution, but is the very vital cord in the notion. The conception of evolution is founded at last and essentially in the conception of Progress: but this conception has no meaning at all except in the light of a goal; there can be no goal unless there is a Beyond for everything actual; and there is no such Beyond except through a spontaneous ideal. The presupposition of Nature, as a system undergoing evolution, is therefore the causal activity of our Pure Ideals. These are our three organic and organizing conceptions called the True, the Beautiful, and the Good.}}

However, [[Edward Feser]] argues, in line with the Aristotelian and [[Thomism|Thomistic]] tradition, that finality has been greatly misunderstood. Indeed, without finality, efficient causality becomes inexplicable. Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end towards which a thing is ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book | last1=Feser | first1=Edward | orig-year=2009 | title=Aquinas: A Beginner's Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2qhHE-6Mn4C | series=Beginner's Guides | edition=Reprint | location=Oxford | publisher=Oneworld Publications | publication-date=2011 | page=| isbn=9781780740065 | access-date=2018-03-12 | quote=[...] three principles are central to Aquinas's general metaphysics [...] the principle of finality is in a sense the most fundamental of them, given that the final cause is 'the cause of causes': for, again in Aquinas's' view an efficient cause can bring an effect in to being only if it is 'directed towards' that effect; and it is ultimately in that sense that the effect is 'contained in' the efficient cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a match is rubbed against the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect is not arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire&lt;ref&gt;Compare:The match is 'directed towards' the production of fire and heat [...]&lt;/ref&gt; which is realized through efficient causes.

==In modern science==
{{See also|Teleology#Teleology and science}}

[[Francis Bacon]] wrote in his ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' (1605) that natural science "doth make inquiry, and take consideration of the same natures : but how? Only as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms." According to the demands of Bacon, apart from the "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]" themselves, the causes relevant to natural [[science]] are only [[efficient cause]]s and [[material cause]]s in terms of Aristotle's classification, or to use the formulation which became famous later, all nature visible to human science is matter and motion. Using the terminology of Aristotle, he divided knowledge into physics and metaphysics in ''[[The New Organon]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;From the two kinds of axioms which have been spoken of arises a just division of philosophy and the sciences, taking the received terms (which come nearest to express the thing) in a sense agreeable to my own views. Thus, let the investigation of forms, which are (in the eye of reason at least, and in their essential law) eternal and immutable, constitute [[Metaphysics]]; and let the investigation of the efficient cause, and of matter, and of the latent process, and the latent configuration (all of which have reference to the common and ordinary course of nature, not to her eternal and fundamental laws) constitute [[Physics]]. And to these let there be subordinate two practical divisions: to Physics, Mechanics; to Metaphysics, what (in a purer sense of the word) I call Magic, on account of the broadness of the ways it moves in, and its greater command over nature. Francis Bacon ''The New Organon'', Book II, Aphorism 9, 1620&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bacon's position became the standard one for modern science.

===Biology===
{{main article|Teleology in biology}}

Explanations in terms of final causes remain common [[Teleology in biology|in evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco J. Ayala]] has claimed that teleology is indispensable to biology since the concept of [[adaptation]] is inherently teleological.&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998" /&gt; In an appreciation of [[Charles Darwin]] published in ''Nature'' in 1874, [[Asa Gray]] noted "Darwin's great service to Natural Science" lies in bringing back Teleology "so that, instead of Morphology ''versus'' Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology". Darwin quickly responded, "What you say about Teleology pleases me especially and I do not think anyone else has ever noticed the point."&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt; [[Francis Darwin]] and [[T. H. Huxley]] reiterate this sentiment. The latter wrote that "..the most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which his view offers."&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt; [[James G. Lennox]] states that Darwin uses the term 'Final Cause' consistently in his ''Species Notebook'', ''Origin of Species'' and after.&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993"/&gt;

Contrary to the position described by [[Francisco J. Ayala]], [[Ernst Mayr]] states that "adaptedness... is ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an a priori goal-seeking."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst W.]] (1992). "The idea of teleology" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 53, 117–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Madrell SHP (1998) "Why are there no insects in the open sea?" ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''201''':2461–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lennox states that in evolution as conceived by Darwin, it is true both that evolution is the result of mutations arising by chance and that evolution is teleological in nature.&lt;ref name="Lennox 1993" /&gt;

Statements that a species does something "in order to" achieve survival are teleological. The validity or invalidity of such statements depends on the species and the intention of the writer as to the meaning of the phrase "in order to". Sometimes it is possible or useful to rewrite such sentences so as to avoid teleology.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book |author=Reiss, John O. |date=2009 |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |publisher=University of California Press |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention.

==Heidegger on technology==

In ''[[The Question Concerning Technology]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]] describes the four causes as follows:

#''causa materialis'' is the material or matter
# ''causa formalis'' is the form or shape the material or matter enters
# ''causa finalis'' is the end
# ''causa efficiens'' is the effect that brings about the finished result.{{sfn|Heidegger|1977|pp=289-290}}

Heidegger explains it thus:

{{quote|Whoever builds a house or a ship or forges a sacrificial chalice reveals what is to be brought forth, according to the terms of the four modes of occasioning.{{sfn|Heidegger|1977|p=295}}}}

The educationist David Waddington comments that although the efficient cause, which he identifies as "the craftsman", might be thought the most significant of the four, in his view each of Heidegger's four causes is "equally co-responsible" for producing a craft item, in Heidegger's terms "bringing forth" the thing into existence. Waddington cites Lovitt's description of this bringing forth as "a unified process".&lt;ref name="Waddington2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington, David |title=A Field Guide to Heidegger Understanding {{!}} ''The Question Concerning Technology'' |journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory |date=2005 |volume=37 |issue=4 |page=568 |url=https://www.academia.edu/540032/A_Field_Guide_to_Heidegger_Understanding_The_Question_concerning_Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovitt1972&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovitt, W. |date=1972 |title=A Gesprach with Heidegger on Technology, Man and World |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=44–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tinbergen's four questions==
{{main|Tinbergen's four questions}}

[[Tinbergen's four questions]], named after the [[ethologist]] [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and based on Aristotle's four causes, are complementary categories of explanations for [[animal behaviour]]. They are also commonly referred to as levels of analysis. The four questions are on [[function (biology)|function]], what an [[adaptation]] does that is [[natural selection|selected for]] in [[evolution]]; [[phylogeny]], the evolutionary history of an [[organism]], revealing its relationships to other species; [[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]], namely the proximate cause of a behaviour, such as the role of [[testosterone]] in [[aggression]]; and [[ontogeny]], the [[developmental biology|development]] of an organism from egg to embryo to adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacDougall-Shackleton |first=Scott A. |date=2011-07-27 |title=The levels of analysis revisited |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2076–2085 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0363 |pmc=3130367 |pmid=21690126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&amp;h&gt;Hladký, V. &amp; Havlíček, J.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
The '''Golden Rule''' is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] that is found in many religions and [[culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}} This dictionary of philosophy contains the following quote under the entry for "golden rule": "The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

Various expressions of the rule exist in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability." (end quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule was much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. Instead, he posits, it "express[es] the essence of a universal [[morality]]." The rationale for this crucial distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). See:
 {{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can be considered an '''ethic of reciprocity''' in some [[religion]]s, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative [[injunction]] governing conduct:

* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
* One should ''not'' treat others in ways that one would ''not'' like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;
* What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;

The idea dates at least to the early [[Confucian]] times (551–479 BCE) according to [[Rushworth Kidder]], who identifies that this concept appears prominently in [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]],  [[Zoroastrianism]], and "the rest of the world's major religions".&lt;ref name="W.A. Spooner 1914 pp. 310"&gt;W.A. Spooner, "The Golden Rule," in James Hastings, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'', Vol. 6 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1914) pp. 310–12, quoted in Rushworth M. Kidder, ''How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living'', Harper, New York, 2003. {{ISBN|0-688-17590-2}}. p. 159. [[Simon Blackburn]] also notes the connection between Confucious and the Golden Rule. {{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Rule is codified in the [[Code of Hammurabi]] stele and tablets, 1754-1790 BCE. 143 leaders encompassing the world's major faiths endorsed the Golden Rule as part of the 1993 "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic", including the Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian.&lt;ref name="globalethic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/_includes/FCKcontent/File/TowardsAGlobalEthic.pdf |title=Parliament of the World's Religions – Towards a Global Ethic |format=PDF |accessdate=12 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411195746/http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/_includes/FCKcontent/File/TowardsAGlobalEthic.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Greg M.

== Ancient history ==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Possibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], appears in the story of [[The Eloquent Peasant]], which dates to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040–1650 BC): "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "Now this is the command: do to the doer to make him do"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Albert Wilson p. 121"&gt;''"The Culture of Ancient Egypt"'', John Albert Wilson, p. 121, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1956, {{ISBN|0-226-90152-1}} "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to cause that he do"&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb embodies the ''[[do ut des]]'' principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "The peasant quotes a proverb that embodies the do ut des principle"&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: "That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another."&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc52.pdf A Late Period Hieratic Wisdom Text: P. Brooklyn 47.218.135"]'', Richard Jasnow, p. 95, University of Chicago Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-918986-85-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient India ===

==== Sanskrit tradition ====
In ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'', the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira
{{quote|Listening to wise scriptures, austerity, sacrifice, respectful faith, social welfare, forgiveness, purity of intent, compassion, truth and self-control—are the ten wealth of character (self). O king aim for these, may you be steadfast in these qualities. These are the basis of prosperity and rightful living. These are highest attainable things. All worlds are balanced on ''dharma'', ''dharma'' encompasses ways to prosperity as well. O King, ''dharma'' is the best quality to have, wealth the medium and desire (''kāma'') the lowest. Hence, (keeping these in mind), by self-control and by making ''dharma'' (right conduct) your main focus, treat others as you treat yourself.| ''Mahābhārata Shānti-Parva'' 167:9}}

==== Tamil tradition ====
In Chapter 32 in the [[Aram (Kural book)|Part on Virtue]] of the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), [[Tiruvalluvar]] says: "Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself" (K. 316.); "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)

=== Ancient Greece ===
The Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Examples of the general concept include:
* "Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing."&amp;nbsp;– [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers", I:36&lt;/ref&gt;  (c. 624 BC – c. 546 BC)
* "What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either. "&amp;nbsp;– [[Sentences of Sextus|Sextus the Pythagorean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/sent.html|title=The Sentences of Sextus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant reference to Sextus is by Origen in the third century of the common era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sentences of Sextus|''The Sentences of Sextus Article'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you."&amp;nbsp;– [[Isocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, ''Nicocles or the Cyprians''&lt;!--not to be confused with the work ''To Nicocles''--&gt;, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D61 Isoc 3.61] ([https://archive.org/stream/2139247.0001.001.umich.edu#page/70/mode/2up original text in Greek]); cf.

=== Ancient Persia ===
The [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi Texts]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] (c. 300 BC–1000 AD) were an early source for the Golden Rule: "That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself." Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and "Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others." Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://www.amazon.com/Pahlavi-Texts-Zoroastrianism-Part-Dadistan-i/dp/1606201999 Pahlavi Texts of Zoroastrianism, Part 2 of 5: The Dadistan-i Dinik and the Epistles of Manuskihar"]'', Thomas Firminger Thiselton-Dyer (1843–1928), Forgotten Books (May 7, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-60620-199-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger]] (c. 4 BC–65 AD), a practitioner of [[Stoicism]] (c. 300 BC–200 AD) expressed the Golden Rule in his essay regarding the treatment of slaves: "Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you."&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Philosophy-Seneca-Essays-Letters/dp/0393004597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461574923&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+stoic+philosophy+of+seneca 41.

According to [[Simon Blackburn]], the Golden Rule "can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Judaism|Jewish ethics}}
A rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ואהבת לרעך כמוך}}):
{{quote|You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}}}

[[Hillel the Elder]] (c. 110 BC – 10 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=730&amp;letter=H Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel]: "His activity of forty years is perhaps historical; and since it began, according to a trustworthy tradition (Shab. 15a), one hundred years before the destruction of Jerusalem, it must have covered the period 30 BC–10 AD&lt;!--B.C. in the original--&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; used this verse as a most important message of the [[Torah]] for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for [[conversion to Judaism]] but, drawing on {{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}, briefed the man:
{{quote|What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.|{{sourcetext|source=Babylonian Talmud|version=|book=Shabbath|chapter=folio|verse=31a}}|[[Babylonian Talmud]]}}

Hillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. [[Rabbi Akiva]] agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God ([[Sifra]], Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; [[Genesis Rabba]] 24).&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; According to [[Adam in rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]], the first man [[Adam]] represents the ''unity of mankind''. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Preamble|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4?lang=en|title=Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 4.5|publisher=sefaria.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toseftaonline.org/Tractate-Sanhedrin-chapter-8-tosefta-4|title=Tosefta on Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 8.4–9 (Erfurt Manuscript)|publisher=toseftaonline.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=758&amp;letter=A&amp;search=adam#1 |title=ADAM |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jewish Publication Society's edition of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Torah|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|page=19:17|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/jps/lev019.htm|chapter=Leviticus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the ''Golden Rule'', which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.&lt;ref name="Plaut p. 892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;– A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:

{{quote|The [[Ger toshav|stranger who resides with you]] shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I the LORD am your God.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:34|JP}}}}

Commentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.

On the verse, "Love your fellow as yourself," the classic commentator [[Rashi]] quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: "Love your fellow as yourself&amp;nbsp;– Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;Kedoshim 19:18, Toras Kohanim, ibid. See also Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4; Bereishis Rabbah 24:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postage stamps and postal history of Israel|Israel's postal service]] quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] on a 1958 [[postage stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407164111/http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archivedate=7 April 2008 |title=Sol Singer Collection of Philatelic Judaica |publisher= [[Emory University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Golden Rule" was given by [[Jesus of Nazareth]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A12&amp;version=NCV Matthew 7:12 NCV], see also [[s:Bible (King James)/Luke#6:31|Luke 6:31]]). The common English phrasing is "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".

Scroll up slightly to see a section saying: "The sum of the ten Commandments does consist in the love towards god, and our neighbor (Ephe. 4., Matt. 7.). In the first Table be three Commandments: which take away and forbid sin and vice against the worshipping of God. They forbid idolatry, apostasy, heresy, superstition, perjury, blasphemy, and move us to the pure and true worshipping of God in heart, word and deed. In the Second table be seven Commandments, which command us to give reverence and honor to every man in his degree, to profit all, and hurt none: to do unto others, as we would be done to ourselves.")

The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the [[Old Testament]]:  {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}} ("Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD."; see also [[Great Commandment]]) and {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=34}} ("But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.").

The [[Old Testament]] [[Deuterocanonical]] books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Sirach]], accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:

{{quote|"Do to no one what you yourself dislike."|Tobit 4:15}}
{{quote|"Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own dislikes."|Sirach 31:15}}

Two passages in the [[New Testament]] quote [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:

[[Matthew 7:12]]
{{quote|Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.}}

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=6|verse=31}}
{{quote|Do to others what you would want them to do to you.}}

A similar passage, a parallel to the [[Great Commandment]], is {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=New International Readers Version|book=Luke|chapter=10|verse=25|range=-28}}

{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?"
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.’(Deuteronomy 6:5) And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ "
&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".}}

The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, "Who is my neighbor?", by telling the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]], indicating that "your neighbor" is anyone in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?b=42&amp;c=10&amp;com=wes |title=John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on Luke 10 |publisher=Christnotes.org |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.

Jesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.&lt;ref&gt;Moore: Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era; Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927–1930; Vol. 2, p. 87, Vol. 3, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one passage of the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to the golden rule:

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Galatians|chapter=5|verse=14 | Galatians 5:14 }}
{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.}}

==== Islam ====
{{See also|Islamic ethics}}

The Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam.  "Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance"{{according to whom|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

However, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:
{{quote|Fakir al-Din al-Razi and several other Qur'anic commentators have pointed out that Qur'an 83:1-6 is an implicit statement of the Golden Rule, which is explicitly stated in the tradition, "Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

{{quote|Similar examples of the golden rule are found in the hadith of the prophet Muhammad.

From the [[hadith]], the collected oral and written accounts of Muhammad and his teachings during his lifetime:
{{quote|A Bedouin came to the prophet, grabbed the stirrup of his camel and said: O the messenger of God! Teach me something to go to heaven with it. Prophet said: "As you would have people do to you, do to them; and what you dislike to be done to you, don't do to them. Now let the stirrup go!"

==== Jainism ====
{{See also|Jainism|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

The Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]] and [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]]. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.

The following quotation from the [[Acaranga Sutra]] sums up the philosophy of Jainism:
{{Quote|Nothing which breathes, which exists, which lives, or which has essence or potential of life, should be destroyed or ruled over, or subjugated, or harmed, or denied of its essence or potential.

In support of this Truth, I ask you a question – ''"Is sorrow or pain desirable to you ?"'' If you say ''"yes it is"'', it would be a lie. If you say, ''"No, It is not"'' you will be expressing the truth. '''Just as sorrow or pain is not desirable to you, so it is to all which breathe, exist, live or have any essence of life.''' To you and all, it is undesirable, and painful, and repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | title =Ācāranga Sūtra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22. | year= 1884 | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm}} Sutra 155–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated. | [[Sutrakritanga]] |''1.11.33''}}

{{Quote|In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self.|Lord Mahavira|24th Tirthankara}}

Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year= 1993 | location =New Delhi }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives further insight into this precept:-

{{Quote|Just as pain is not agreeable to you, it is so with others. Knowing this principle of equality treat other with respect and compassion.|Suman Suttam|''verse 150''}}

{{Quote|Killing a living being is killing one's own self; showing compassion to a living being is showing compassion to oneself. He who desires his own good, should avoid causing any harm to a living being. |Suman Suttam|''verse 151''}}

The same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the ''[[Analects]]'' (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online [[Chinese Text Project]]. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.

Mozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged [[egalitarianism]] and selflessness in relationships.

In the view of [[Greg M. Epstein]], a [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[chaplain]] at [[Harvard University]], " 'do unto others'&amp;nbsp;... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely. ''But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a God''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 115}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist principle:&lt;ref name="Thinkhumanism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkhumanism.com/the-golden-rule.html |title=Thinkhumanism.com |publisher=Thinkhumanism.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.ubc.ca/Clubs/humanist/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914042919/http://www.ams.ubc.ca/clubs/humanist/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2002 |title=UBC.ca |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Trying to live according to the Golden Rule means trying to empathise with other people, including those who may be very different from us. Empathy is at the root of kindness, compassion, understanding and respect&amp;nbsp;– qualities that we all appreciate being shown, whoever we are, whatever we think and wherever we come from. And although it isn’t possible to know what it really feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and have different life experiences, it isn’t difficult for most of us to imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering to others. For this reason many people find the Golden Rule’s corollary&amp;nbsp;– "do not treat people in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself"&amp;nbsp;– more pragmatic.&lt;ref name="Thinkhumanism.com" /&gt;|sign=Maria MacLachlan|source=Think Humanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkhumanism.com/ |title=Think Humanism |publisher=Think Humanism |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you. ''[is] (…)'' the single greatest, simplest, and most important moral axiom humanity has ever invented, one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture and religion throughout history, the one we know as the Golden Rule.

Moral directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile, and in fact, it is precisely this rule's simplicity which makes it great. It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it. It is the basic and fundamental human trait of empathy, the ability to vicariously experience how another is feeling, that makes this possible, and it is the principle of empathy by which we should live our lives.|sign=Adam Lee|source=Ebon Musings, "A decalogue for the modern world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/new10c.html |title=A decalogue for the modern world |publisher=Ebonmusings.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{See also|Existentialism}}

{{quote|When we say that man chooses for himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men. For in effect, of all the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be. To choose between this or that is at the same time to affirm the value of that which is chosen; for we are unable ever to choose the worse. What we choose is always the better; and nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all. |[[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Existentialism and Humanism|Existentialism is a Humanism]], pp. 291–292&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Existentialism Is a Humanism|last= Sartre|first= Jean-Paul |year= 2007|publisher= Yale University Press|location= |isbn= 0-300-11546-6|pages= 291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Other contexts ==

=== Human rights ===
According to [[Marc H. Bornstein]], and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of [[human rights]], in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.&lt;ref&gt;Defined another way, it "''refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one's rights are the other's obligation.''"{{cite book|last=Bornstein |first=Marc H.|title=Handbook of Parenting|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2002|page=5|isbn=978-0-8058-3782-7}} See also: {{cite book|last=Paden |first=William E.|title=Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2003|pages=131–132|isbn=978-0-8070-7705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Leo Damrosch]] argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to "rights" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human "rights" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to "inalienable rights" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Science and economics ==
{{further information|Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocal altruism}}

There has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] and [[Neuroethics|neuroethical]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, Donald W., "The Neuroscience of Fair Play: Why We (Usually) Follow the Golden Rule", Dana Press, The Dana Foundation, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-932594-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as "I" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologically, "love your neighbor as yourself" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.  In evolution, "[[reciprocal altruism]]" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel| first1=Gretchen|title=The Evolution of the Golden Rule|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=Feb 2004|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Golden Rule#Economics|economics]], Richard Swift, referring to ideas from [[David Graeber]], suggests that "without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Richard|title=Pathways &amp; possibilites|journal=New Internationalist|volume=484|issue=July/August 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Philosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/the_golden_rule.html |title=Only a Game: The Golden Rule |publisher=Onlyagame.typepad.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.

=== Differences in values or interests ===
[[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote, "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|title=Man and Superman|date=1903|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.|page=227|url=https://archive.org/stream/mansupermancomed00shawrich#page/226/mode/2up|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of "do unto others" is "dangerous in the wrong hands,"&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', [[Iain King]], 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to philosopher [[Iain King]], because "some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in situations ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others.&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Kant, Immanuel ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', footnote 13. Cambridge University Press (28 April 1998). {{ISBN|978-0-521-62695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ''[[Categorical imperative|Categorical Imperative]]'', introduced in ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', is often [[Categorical imperative#The Golden Rule|confused with the Golden Rule.]]

=== Cannot be a sole guide to action ===
In his book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] has argued that "(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 110 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be "incendiary",&lt;ref name="Source 2008"&gt;Source: p. 112 of ''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; since it "can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity," unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Source 2008" /&gt; Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 114 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms&lt;!--linked from [[The Platinum Rule]]; [[Platinum Rule (principle)]] redirects here--&gt; ===
[[Walter Terence Stace]], in ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937), wrote:

{{quote|Mr. Bernard Shaw's remark "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different" is no doubt a smart saying. But it seems to overlook the fact that "doing as you would be done by" includes taking into account your neighbor's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account. Thus the "golden rule" might still express the essence of a universal morality ''even if no two men in the world had any needs or tastes in common''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Marcus George Singer]] observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1)&amp;nbsp;that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2)&amp;nbsp;that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.

In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;Wattles, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Jouni Reinikainen, "The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability." Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155–168, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of "doing unto others, wherever possible, as ''they'' would be done by..." has sometimes been termed the [[platinum rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Vol. 2 (1966 [1945]), p. 386. Dubbed "the platinum rule" in business books such as Charles J. Jacobus, Thomas E. Gillett, ''Georgia Real Estate: An Introduction to the Profession'', Cengage Learning, 2007, p. 409 and Jeremy Comfort, Peter Franklin, ''The Mindful International Manager: How to Work Effectively Across Cultures'', Kogan Page, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kashmir]] has been a disputed and divided territory with human rights abuses in both the section administered by India ([[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and that administered by Pakistan ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]). 
[[Kashmir conflict|The dispute]] began in 1947 with [[partition of India|the partition of the British Indian Empire]] into India and Pakistan.

===Line of Control===
The [[Line of Control]] (LOC) is a military control line between Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. The line does not constitute a legally international boundary but it is a [[de facto]] border, designated in 1948 as a cease-fire line, it divided Kashmir into two parts and closed the Jehlum valley route, the only entrance of the [[Kashmir Valley]]. This territorial division which, to this day still exists severed many villages and separated family members from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjan Kumar Singh, '''Sarhad: Zero Mile''', (Hindi), ''Parijat Prakashan'', {{ISBN|81-903561-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc kashmir"&gt;{{cite book | author=Women in Security, Conflict Management, a Peace (Program) | title=Closer to ourselves: stories from the journ towards peace in South Asia | url=https://books.google.com/books?q=line+of+control+separated+villages+families+relatives+in+kashmir&amp;btnG=Search+Books | accessdate=27 December 2012 |year=2008 | publisher=WISCOMP, Foundation for Universal Responsibility of His Holiness the Dalai Lam 2008 | isbn= | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[landmines]] planted by the [[Army]] alongsides of the line have killed scores of innocent people and left thousands as disabled.

Since 1991, reports of rape by Islamic militants have increased, and there have been many cases of the militants threatening to kill the family unless a woman is handed over to the militants. According to the HRW, the rape victims of militants suffer ostracism and there is a "code of silence and fear" that prevents people from reporting such abuse. According to the HRW, the investigation of case of rape by militants is difficult because many Kashmiris are reluctant to discuss it for the fear of violent reprisals.&lt;ref name="HumanRightsCrisis"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA937.PDF The Human Rights Crisis in Kashmir].

According to a report published by ''Asia Watch'': {{quote|In Kashmir, the militant forces do not control territory and their military operations are generally characterised by ambushes of government forces and hit-and-run attacks for which they rely on weapons such as AK-47s, grenades, mines and other small arms.

The '''IS–LM model''', or '''Hicks–Hansen model''', is a [[macroeconomic]] tool that shows the relationship between [[interest rates]] ([[ordinate]]) and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market, as [[abscissa]]). The intersection of the "[[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]]–[[saving]]" (IS) and "[[liquidity preference]]–[[money supply]]" (LM) curves models "general equilibrium" where supposed simultaneous equilibrium occurs in both interest and assets markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert J. Gordon |first=Robert J. |last=Gordon |title=Macroeconomics |edition=Eleventh |year=2009 |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Addison Wesley |isbn=9780321552075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS–LM model explains changes in [[national income]] when price level is fixed short-run; second, the IS–LM model shows why an [[aggregate demand curve]] can shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=N. Gregory Mankiw |first=N. Gregory |last=Mankiw |title=Macroeconomics |edition=Eighth |year=2012 |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=9781429240024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=John Soman |authorlink2=Alison Wride |first1=John |last1=Sloman |first2=Alison |last2=Wride |title=Economics |edition=Seventh |year=2009 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=9780273715627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was developed by [[John Hicks]] in 1937,&lt;ref name="Hicks1937" /&gt; and later extended by [[Alvin Hansen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=A. H. |year=1953 |title=A Guide to Keynes |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mathematical representation of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomic theory]]. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentolila |first=Samuel |chapter=Hicks–Hansen model |title=An Eponymous Dictionary of Economics: A Guide to Laws and Theorems Named after Economists |location= |publisher=Edward Elgar |edition= |year=2005 |isbn=1-84376-029-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been largely absent from macroeconomic research ever since, it is still a backbone conceptual introductory tool in many macroeconomics textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Colander |authorlink=David Colander |title=The Strange Persistence of the IS-LM Model |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=36 |issue=Annual Supplement |year=2004 |pages=305–322 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_of_political_economy/v036/36.5colander.pdf |doi=10.1215/00182702-36-suppl_1-305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IS–LM model was first introduced at a conference of the [[Econometric Society]] held in Oxford during September 1936. [[Roy Harrod]], [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]], and [[James Meade]] all presented papers
describing [[mathematical model]]s attempting to summarize [[John Maynard Keynes]]' ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''.&lt;ref name="Hicks1937" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meade |first=J. E. |title=A Simplified Model of Mr. Keynes' System |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=98–107 |year=1937 |jstor=2967607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod's paper, invented the IS–LM model (originally using the [[abbreviation]] "LL", not "LM"). He later presented it in
"Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation".&lt;ref name="Hicks1937"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=J. R. |year=1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the ‘Classics’: A Suggested Interpretation |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=147–159 |jstor= |doi=10.2307/1907242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks later agreed that the model missed important points of Keynesian theory, criticizing it as having very limited use beyond "a classroom gadget", and criticizing equilibrium methods generally: "When one turns to questions of policy, looking towards the future instead of the past, the use of equilibrium methods is still more suspect."&lt;ref name=h1980&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=John |title=‘IS-LM’: An Explanation |journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=1981 |pages=139–154 |jstor=4537583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first problem was that it presents the real and monetary sectors as separate, something Keynes attempted to transcend. In addition, an equilibrium model ignores uncertainty—and that [[liquidity preference]] only makes sense in the presence of uncertainty "For there is no sense in liquidity, unless expectations are uncertain."&lt;ref name=h1980/&gt; A shift in one of the IS or LM curves will cause a change in expectations, which shifts the other curve.

Although generally accepted as being imperfect, the model is seen as a useful pedagogical tool for imparting an understanding of the questions that macroeconomists today attempt to answer through more nuanced approaches. As such, it is included in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks, but omitted from most graduate texts due to the current dominance of [[real business cycle]] and [[new Keynesian]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Formation==
The model is presented as a graph of two intersecting lines in the first quadrant.

The horizontal axis represents [[national income]] or [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] [[gross domestic product]] and is labelled ''Y.'' The vertical axis represents the [[real interest rate]], ''r.'' Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between the [[nominal interest rate]] and the real interest rate (the former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is [[exogeny|exogenous]] in the short run); therefore variables such as [[money demand]] which actually depend on the nominal interest rate can equivalently be expressed as depending on the real interest rate.

The point where these schedules intersect represents a short-run [[General equilibrium|equilibrium]] in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and [[real GDP]].

===IS curve===
For the investment-saving curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income.  (Note that scientific graphs typically place the independent variable—interest rate, in this example—on the vertical axis while the dependent variable is measured with the horizontal axis.)&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/supply-and-demand-and-qwerty/ Supply and Demand and QWERTY]. February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The IS curve is drawn as downward-[[slope|sloping]] with the interest rate (i) on the vertical axis and GDP (gross domestic product: Y) on the horizontal axis. The initials IS stand for "Investment and Saving equilibrium" but since 1937 have been used to represent the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all equilibria where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals an economy's total output (equivalent to real income, Y, or GDP). To keep the link with the historical meaning, the IS curve can be said to represent the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, where the latter equals consumer saving ''plus'' government saving (the budget surplus) ''plus'' foreign saving (the trade surplus). In equilibrium, all spending is desired or planned; there is no unplanned inventory accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Gonçalo L. | last = Fonseca | url = http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/essays/classic/glut.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030726214851/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/essays/classic/glut.htm | archivedate = 2003-07-26 | title = The General Glut Controversy | publisher = [[The New School]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of real GDP (Y) is determined along this line for each [[interest rate]].

Thus the IS curve is a [[locus of points]] of equilibrium in the "real" (non-financial) economy. Each point on the curve represents the equilibrium between the Savings and Investment (S=I).

Given expectations about returns on fixed investment, every level of the real interest rate (i) will generate a certain level of planned fixed [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] and other interest-sensitive spending: lower interest rates encourage higher fixed investment and the like. Income is at the equilibrium level for a given interest rate when the saving that [[consumer]]s and other economic participants choose to do out of this income equals investment (or, equivalently, when "leakages" from the [[circular flow]] equal "injections").  The [[multiplier effect]] of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, this line represents the causation from falling interest rates to rising planned fixed investment (etc.) to rising national income and output.

The IS curve is defined by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;Y = C \left({Y}-{T(Y)}\right) + I \left({r}\right) + G + NX(Y),&lt;/math&gt;
where Y represents income, &lt;math&gt;C(Y-T(Y))&lt;/math&gt; represents consumer spending as an increasing function of disposable income (income, Y, minus taxes, T(Y), which themselves depend positively on income), &lt;math&gt;I(r)&lt;/math&gt; represents investment as a decreasing function of the real interest rate, G represents government spending, and NX(Y) represents net exports (exports minus imports) as a decreasing function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income).

In this model, the level of C (consumption), G (government spending), EX (exports), IM (imports), and R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (real interest rate) are considered to be [[exogenous]], meaning that they are taken as a given, because they are determined by factors outside of this model. Their equations are as follows: C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , G&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; Ỹ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , EX&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , and IM&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. I (investment) is [[Endogenous (economics)|endogenous]], meaning that it is explained by our model, and has the equation I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) − b (R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; − ṝ) Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; , where ṝ is the marginal product of capital, R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the real interest rate, ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the share of potential output that goes toward investment, and b is a constant. A few equations are necessary in order to derive the IS curve: ā = ā&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + ā&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; - ā&lt;sub&gt;im&lt;/sub&gt; - 1, and Ỹ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) - (Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) = (Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / Ȳ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) - 1. When you plug in all the equations into the original Y&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; + EX&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - IM&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and solve, you will get the short run output, which is Ỹ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = ā - b (R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - ṝ).{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}{{Elucidate|date=August 2014}}

===LM curve===

[[File:Money Market diagram.svg|thumb|270px|The money market equilibrium diagram.]]

For the liquidity preference and money supply curve, the independent variable is "income" and the dependent variable is "the interest rate."  The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium.  It is an upward-sloping curve representing the role of finance and money.

The LM function is the set of equilibrium points between the [[liquidity preference]] (or demand for money) function and the [[money supply]] function (as determined by [[bank]]s and [[central bank]]s).

Each point on the LM curve reflects a particular equilibrium situation in the money market equilibrium diagram, based on a particular level of income. In the money market equilibrium diagram, the liquidity preference function is simply the willingness to hold cash balances instead of [[Security (finance)|securities]]. For this function, the nominal interest rate (on the vertical axis) is plotted against the quantity of cash balances (or liquidity), on the horizontal. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping. Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded (liquidity preference) and therefore the position and slope of the function:
* 1) [[Transactions demand]] for money: this includes both (a) the willingness to hold cash for everyday transactions and (b) a precautionary measure (money demand in case of emergencies). Transactions demand is positively related to real GDP (represented by Y, and also referred to as income). This is simply explained – as GDP increases, so does spending and therefore transactions. As GDP is considered exogenous to the liquidity preference function, changes in GDP shift the curve. For example, an increase in GDP will increase transactions which will increase the demand for money for given interest rates, and cause the Liquidity preference curve to shift to the right.
* 2) [[Speculative demand]] for money: this is the willingness to hold cash instead of securities as an asset for investment purposes. Speculative demand is inversely related to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the [[opportunity cost]] of investing in securities increases, because the increased interest rate payments on savings are lost. In addition, as interest rates rise, the required rate of return for investors to make a profit on speculative investments rises, decreasing demand for these investments. So, as interest rates rise, speculative demand falls. 

The money supply function for this situation is plotted on the same graph as the liquidity preference function. The money supply is determined by the central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Though the money supply is related indirectly to interest rates in the very short run, the money supply in effect is perfectly [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] with respect to nominal interest rates (assuming the central bank chooses to control the money supply rather than focusing directly on the interest rate). Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line – money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;M/P=L(i,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, where the supply of money is represented as the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the [[price level]], and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate i and the level Y of real income. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which money supply equals money demand—that is, for which the money market is in equilibrium.

For a given level of income, the intersection point between the liquidity preference and money supply functions implies a single point on the LM curve: specifically, the point giving the level of the interest rate which equilibrate the money market at the given level of income. Recalling that for the LM curve, the interest rate is plotted against real GDP (whereas the liquidity preference and money supply functions plot interest rates against the quantity of cash balances), an increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence increases the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped.

==Shifts==
One hypothesis is that a government's [[deficit spending]] ("[[fiscal policy]]") has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the IS curve to the right.  This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and national income (from Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as shown in the graph above.  The equilibrium level of national income in the IS-LM diagram is referred to as [[aggregate demand]].

Keynesians argue spending may actually "crowd in" (encourage) private fixed investment via the [[accelerator effect]], which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that spending directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily more (or less) than the lost private investment might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve.  A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, an rightward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the "[[treasury view]]").

Rightward shifts of the IS curve also result from [[exogeny|exogenous]] increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports.  Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate.  Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction.

The IS–LM model also allows for the role of [[monetary policy]]. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the LM curve downward or to the right, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income.  Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction.

==Incorporation into larger models==
By itself, the IS–LM model is used to study the short run when [[price level|prices]] are fixed or sticky and no [[inflation]] is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a sub-model of larger models (especially the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model – the [[AD–AS model]]) which allow for a flexible [[price level]]. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS–LM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level.  Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS–LM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS–LM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">In [[engineering]], '''interoperation''' is the setup of ad hoc components and [[Methodology|methods]] to make two or more [[systems]] work together as a combined [[system]] with some partial functionality during a certain time, possibly requiring human [[Supervisor|supervision]] to perform necessary adjustments and [[corrections]].

This contrasts to [[interoperability]], which theoretically permits any number of [[systems]] [[Regulatory compliance|compliant]] to a given [[technical standard|standard]] to work together a long time smoothly and unattended as a combined [[system]] with the full functionality by the standard.

Another definition of interoperation: "services effectively combining multiple resources and domains...; requires interoperability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/gio/1996/glossat.ps Glossary] Gio Wiederhold, "Glossary"; in Intelligent Integration of Information, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston MA, July 1996, pages 193--203; reprinted from the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, Vol.6 Nos.2/3, June 1996, pages 281-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Interoperation is usually performed when the [[systems]] having to be combined were [[designed]] before [[standardization]] (for example [[legacy systems]]), or when standard [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] is too expensive, too difficult, or immature.

Interoperation may use following [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]], components and methods:
* [[electrical connector|Connectors]]
* [[Adapter]]s
* [[Electric power conversion|Converters]]
* [[Simulators]]
* [[Protocol bridge|Bridges]]

In the area of [[data processing]], interoperation may also use following components and methods:
* [[Callback (computer programming)|Handlers]]
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-in]]s
* [[Translators]]

'''James Haughton Jr.''' (1929-2016) was a prominent American [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist, labor leader, [[Community organizing|community organizer]], and social worker. Haughton is most widely known for advocating for racial equality within the construction industry.

== Personal Life ==
James Haughton was born on October 1929 in Brooklyn, New York to James Haughton Sr. and Mary Miller, both immigrants from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haughton received a BSS from the [[City College of New York]] in 1951 and an [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] from [[New York University]] in 1960. From 1951 to 1953 Haughton fought in the [[Korean War]] as a US Army lieutenant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20945|title=archives.nypl.org -- James Haughton Papers|website=archives.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1960, Haughton worked with gangs in Los Angeles and New York City as a youth counselor and social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Haughton married prominent anthropologist, social theorist, and feminist [[Eleanor Leacock|Elanor Leacock]] and remained with her until her death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56014756|title=Notable American women : a biographical dictionary completing the twentieth century|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Belknap Press|others=Ware, Susan, 1950-, Braukman, Stacy Lorraine., Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.|year=|isbn=067401488X|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=374|oclc=56014756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
In 1960, Haughton joined the newly formed Negro American Labor Council (NALC), remaining involved with the organization until his 1962 departure. Following his involvement with NALC, Haughton served as chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee of the New York Branch of the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Frustrated with a perceived passivity within established civil rights organizations, Haughton, in 1964, established the Harlem Unemployment Center. The organization, renamed Fight Back in 1969, employed more aggressive tactics in advocating for minority hiring in the construction industry, equal employment opportunities, and minority—particularly Black and Puerto Rican— inclusion in unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7038/|title=James Haughton on Racism in the House of Labor|last=Jackson|first=Janine|date=1999|website=George Mason University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2016/may/12/james-haughton-crusader-against-construction-indus/|title=James Haughton, crusader against the construction industry|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haughton was involved in a number of other causes including the [[anti-war movement]], [[anti-nuclear movement]], [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-Apartheid movement]], and Puerto Rico solidarity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/436872248|title=James Haughton papers, 1924-1984 (bulk 1959-1982)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jon Kabat-Zinn''' (born '''Jon Kabat''', June 5, 1944) is an [[United States|American]] professor emeritus of medicine and the creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Kabat-Zinn was a student of [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachers such as [[Philip Kapleau]], [[Nhat Hanh|Thich Nhat Hanh]] and [[Seung Sahn]] and a founding member of [[Cambridge Zen Center]]. His practice of [[yoga]] and studies with Buddhist teachers led him to integrate their teachings with scientific findings. He teaches [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], which he says can help people cope with stress, anxiety, pain, and illness. The stress reduction program created by Kabat-Zinn, [[mindfulness-based stress reduction|mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)]], is offered by medical centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horstman |first=Judith |title=The Scientific American Brave New Brain  |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=San Francisco, Calif. |isbn=0470376244 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Kabat-Zinn was born in New York City in 1944 as the youngest of nine children to [[Elvin Kabat]], a biomedical scientist, and Sally Kabat, a painter. He graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1964 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in [[molecular biology]] in 1971 from [[MIT]], where he studied under [[Salvador Luria]], [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] in medicine.

While at MIT, Kabat-Zinn was a leading campaigner against military research at the university as well as a campaigner against the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tech'', [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N34.pdf 7/10/69 p2-3] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N42.pdf 5/11/69 p1,3,4] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N43.pdf 7/11/69 p1,3,5] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V90/PDF/V90-N11.pdf 17/3/70 p1] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V90/PDF/V90-N23.pdf 5/5/70 p6 and 6/5/70 p1]; [http://mitscienceforthepeople.weebly.com/uploads/4/0/9/8/40982869/review_panel_on_speciallaboratories_-_final_report_-_oct_1969.pdf ''MIT Review Panel on Special Laboratories Final Report'']; J. Kabat-Zinn, ''Coming to Our Senses'' p556-9.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he pondered his life's purpose, which he called his "karmic assignment."&lt;ref name=origins&gt;https://www.umassmed.edu/uploadedFiles/cfm2/training/JKZ_paper_Contemporary_Buddhism_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Kabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by [[Philip Kapleau]], a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Buddhist teachers such as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] and [[Seungsahn]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Wilson |title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and eventually taught there.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1979 he founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]], where he adapted the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness and developed the Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program. He subsequently renamed the structured eight-week course [[Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR). He removed the Buddhist framework and any connection between mindfulness and Buddhism, instead putting MBSR in a scientific context.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; He subsequently also founded the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His secular technique, which combines meditation and [[Hatha yoga]], has since spread worldwide.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The course aims to help patients cope with stress, pain, and illness by using what is called "moment-to-moment awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx |title=What is the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Course? |publisher=Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2012/0410/1224314560853.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Sylvia | last=Thompson | title=The Father of Mindfulness | date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kabat-Zinn's MBSR began to get increasing notice with the publication of his first book, ''Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness'' (Delta, 1991), which gave detailed instructions for the practice. Then, in 1993, his work in the Stress Reduction Clinic was featured in [[Bill Moyers]]'s PBS special ''Healing and the Mind'', spurring wide interest in MBSR and helping to make Kabat-Zinn nationally famous.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1994 Kabat-Zinn's second book, titled ''Wherever You Go, There You Are'', became a national bestseller.&lt;ref name=Shambhala&gt;{{cite journal |first=Barry |last=Boyce |title=Jon Kabat-Zinn: The Man Who Prescribes the Medicine of the Moment |magazine=Shambhala Sun |date=May 2005 |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/jon-kabat-zinn-the-man-who-prescribes-the-medicine-of-the-moment/ |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of the 1990s, many MBSR clinics were opened, either as standalone centers or as part of a hospital's holistic medicine program.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Research by Kabat-Zinn includes the effect of MBSR on [[psoriasis]], pain, anxiety, brain function, and immune function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jon Kabat-Zinn: Selected Publications |publisher=UMass Profiles |url=http://profiles.umassmed.edu/profiles/display/130749 |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a board member of the [[Mind and Life Institute]], a group that organizes dialogues between the [[Dalai Lama]] and Western scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/dialogue-participants/3/#kabat-zinn|title=Jon Kabat-Zinn bio|publisher=Mind and Life Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227160559/http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/dialogue-participants/3/#kabat-zinn|archivedate=2010-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MBSR has been adapted for use by the US military to improve combatants' "operational effectiveness," apparently with Kabat-Zinn's approval, which has provoked some controversy among mindfulness practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Titmuss, [http://christophertitmussblog.org/are-buddhist-mindfulness-practices-used-to-support-international-war-crimes 'Are Buddhist Mindfulness Practices used to support International War Crimes?']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Purser, [http://www.inquiringmind.com/Articles/MilitarizationOfMindfulness.html 'The Militarization of Mindfulness'], ''Inquiring Mind'', Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/92410/Dr__Kabat__Zinn_talks_about_Mindfulness_Program_in_Camp_Zama/ 'Dr. Kabat- Zinn talks about Mindfulness Program in Camp Zama'].&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the integration of narratives into mindfulness practice, Kabat-Zinn has said, "''the map... can occlude... the territory.''' &lt;ref name=origins/&gt;{{explain|date=July 2017}}

Kabat-Zinn is Professor of Medicine Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.&lt;ref name=Cochran/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kabat-Zinn is married to Myla Zinn, the daughter of Roslyn and [[Howard Zinn]]. They have three grown children.&lt;ref&gt;''Gesund durch Meditation'' p330 and 331 the German translation of ''Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Illness''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabat-Zinn grew up in a non-practicing Jewish family.&lt;ref name="Booth-2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Robert|title=Master of mindfulness, Jon Kabat-Zinn: ‘People are losing their minds.

In [[Hinduism]], there are eight ''aśtopāyas'', or eight ways of attaining [[moksha]], and ''Mārdava'' is one of them, the other seven being – ''[[Yajna]]'' (यज्ञ) (sacrifices), ''[[Dāna]]'' (दान) (charity), ''Vedadhyayana'' (the study of the Vedas), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (तप) (penance, deep meditation), ''[[Uparati|Dama]]'' (दम)  (subduing the senses by restraining the sense-organs), ''[[Satya]]'' (सत्य) (truth in speech and act), and ''[[Tyāga]]'' (त्याग) (renunciation of desire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.3|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=744|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0U2QRpDv2KMC&amp;pg=PA744&amp;lpg=PA744&amp;dq=mardava++hinduism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k1KkDvZVz4&amp;sig=JrPZW-iyRWPazoaz1S0oL9iE_3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VsECVdrPLc-VuASym4GQCA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20hinduism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Jainism]], ''mārdava'' or compassion or supreme tenderness or humility, which is part of Right Belief, is a means to destroy vanity or egotism which gives rise to many evils which defile the virtues of our soul; it is held that humility is the foundation of compassion and the basis for salvation. With the eight kinds of pride totally avoided, knowledge brings humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uttama Mardava Dharma|publisher=Jain Heritage Centres|url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114511/http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tattvārthasūtra]] (IX.6) lists ''mārdava'' (modesty) as one of the ten aspects of the highest '' [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5WHHJ6O7b-IC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=coQBVdy-C4-0uATY9ICoAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bhagavad Gita]] (XVI.1-3) also classifies ''mārdava'' as a divine quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.1|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=124|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zp3n--MlL9wC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CoUBVd-wHc3iuQSJp4GoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Buddhist]]s consider ''mārdava'' as the realization of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-pratipatti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism|author=Bibhuti Barua|publisher=Sarup &amp; sons|page=13|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=s1PZAMD13SMC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=mardava+++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UoMCVYqnAczauQSZzoK4DA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] mentions ''mārdava'' as a low pitch along with ''anvavavasarga'' and ''udutā khasya''; he explains this word as ''svarasya mridutā'' or ''snigdhatā'' (smoothness of sound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EmW96v4gvycC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4MBVYDnM9C1uQSeyIGwAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[general relativity]], the '''metric tensor''' (in this context often abbreviated to simply the '''metric''') is the fundamental object of study. It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the [[gravitational potential]] of [[gravity|Newtonian gravitation]].{{clarify|reason=This seems to be pulled out of the air and is difficult to interpret (i.e., is it even a valid analogy, and how is the analogy useful?).|date=August 2017}} The metric captures all the geometric and [[Causal spacetime structure|causal structure]] of [[spacetime]], being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separating the future and the past.

==Notation and conventions==

Throughout this article we work with a [[metric signature]] that is mostly positive ({{nowrap|− + + +}}); see [[sign convention]]. The [[gravitation constant]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; will be kept explicit. The [[Einstein summation convention]], where repeated indices are automatically summed over, is employed.

==Definition==

Mathematically, spacetime is represented by a four-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the metric tensor is given as a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]], second-[[Tensor degree|degree]], [[symmetric tensor]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, conventionally denoted by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the metric is required to be [[nondegenerate]] with [[Lorentz signature|signature]] {{nowrap|(− + + +)}}. A manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; equipped with such a metric is a type of [[Lorentzian manifold]].

Explicitly, the metric tensor is a [[symmetric bilinear form]] on each [[tangent space]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that varies in a smooth (or differentiable) manner from point to point. Given two tangent vectors &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the metric can be evaluated on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to give a real number:
:&lt;math&gt;g_x(u,v) = g_x(v,u) \in \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a generalization of the [[dot product]] of ordinary [[Euclidean space]]. Unlike Euclidean space &amp;ndash; where the dot product is [[positive definite]] &amp;ndash; the metric is indefinite and gives each tangent space the structure of [[Minkowski space]].

==Local coordinates and matrix representations==

Physicists usually work in [[local coordinates]] (i.e. coordinates defined on some [[atlas (topology)|local patch]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;). In local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is an index that runs from 0 to 3) the metric can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;g = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu .&lt;/math&gt;
The factors &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; are [[one-form]] [[gradient]]s of the scalar coordinate fields &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The metric is thus a linear combination of [[tensor product]]s of one-form gradients of coordinates.  The coefficients &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are a set of 16 real-valued functions (since the tensor &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[tensor field]]'', which is defined at all points of a [[spacetime]] manifold). In order for the metric to be symmetric we must have
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\nu\mu} ,&lt;/math&gt;
giving 10 independent coefficients.

If the local coordinates are specified, or understood from context, the metric can be written as a {{nowrap|4 × 4}} [[symmetric matrix]] with entries &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The nondegeneracy of &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; means that this matrix is [[non-singular matrix|non-singular]] (i.e. has non-vanishing determinant), while the Lorentzian signature of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; implies that the matrix has one negative and three positive [[eigenvalues]]. Note that physicists often refer to this matrix or the coordinates &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; themselves as the metric (see, however, [[abstract index notation]]).

With the quantities &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; being regarded as the components of an infinitesimal coordinate displacement [[four-vector]] (not to be confused with the one-forms of the same notation above), the metric determines the invariant square of an infinitesimal [[line element]], often referred to as an ''interval''. The interval is often denoted
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu .&lt;/math&gt;

The interval &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; imparts information about the [[Causal spacetime structure|causal structure of spacetime]].  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] and the square root of the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; is an incremental [[proper time]].  Only timelike intervals can be physically traversed by a massive object.  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is lightlike, and can only be traversed by light.  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is spacelike and the square root of &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; acts as an incremental [[proper length]].  &lt;!--(In special relativity, the spacelike interval between a pair of events is the square of the distance between the spatial positions of the two events as measured in a Lorentz frame in which the two events are simultaneous.)--&gt;  Spacelike intervals cannot be traversed, since they connect events that are outside each other's [[light cone]]s.  [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|Event]]s can be causally related only if they are within each other's light cones.

The components of the metric depend on the choice of local coordinate system. Under a change of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \to x^{\bar \mu}&lt;/math&gt;, the metric components transform as
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\bar \mu \bar \nu} = \frac{\partial x^\rho}{\partial x^{\bar \mu}}\frac{\partial x^\sigma}{\partial x^{\bar \nu}} g_{\rho\sigma} = \Lambda^\rho {}_{\bar \mu} \, \Lambda^\sigma {}_{\bar \nu} \, g_{\rho \sigma} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Flat spacetime===

The simplest example of a Lorentzian manifold{{clarify|why is the focus on Lorentzian manifolds when describing metrics?|date=May 2017}} is [[flat spacetime]], which can be given as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with coordinates{{clarify|is this in Cartesian coordinates?|date=May 2017}} &lt;math&gt;(t,x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and the metric
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these coordinates actually cover all of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The flat space metric (or [[Minkowski metric]]) is often denoted by the symbol ''η'' and is the metric used in [[special relativity]]. In the above coordinates, the matrix representation of ''η'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \begin{pmatrix}-c^2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
(An alternative convention replaces coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;ct&lt;/math&gt;, and defines &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; as in {{section link|Minkowski space|Standard basis}}.)

In [[spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the flat space metric takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;
is the standard metric on the [[2-sphere]]{{clarify|what does standard metric on the 2-sphere mean?|date=May 2017}}.

===Black hole metrics===

The Schwarzschild metric describes an uncharged, non-rotating black hole.  There are also metrics that describe rotating and charged metrics for black holes.

====Schwarzschild metric====

Besides the flat space metric the most important metric in general relativity is the [[Schwarzschild metric]] which can be given in one set of local coordinates by 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^{2} = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
where, again, &lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt; is the standard metric on the [[2-sphere]]. Here, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitation constant]] and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with the dimensions of [[mass]]. Its derivation can be found [[Deriving the Schwarzschild solution|here]]. The Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric as &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero (except at the origin where it is undefined). Similarly, when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity, the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric.

With coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right)=(ct, r, \theta, \varphi) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
we can write the metric as

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix} -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \left(1-\frac{2GM}{r c^2}\right)^{-1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r^2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r^2 \sin^2 \theta \end{bmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Several other systems of coordinates have been devised for the Schwarzschild metric: [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates]], [[Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates]], [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]], and [[Lemaître coordinates]].

====Rotating and charged black holes====

Rotating and charged black holes are described by the [[Kerr metric]], the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], and the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}

===Other metrics===

Other notable metrics are:

*[[Alcubierre metric#Alcubierre metric|Alcubierre metric]], 
*[[de Sitter space|de Sitter]]/[[anti-de Sitter space|anti-de Sitter]] metrics,
*[[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], 
*[[Isotropic coordinates]], 
*[[Lemaître–Tolman metric]] (aka [[Lemaître–Tolman metric|Bondi metric]]{{clarify|why is this alias here? wouldn't it make more sense in the linked Lemaitre-Tolman article?|date=May 2017}}),
*[[Peres metric]],
*[[Rindler coordinates]],
*[[Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates]],
*[[Gödel metric]].

Some of them are without the [[event horizon]] or can be without the [[gravitational singularity]].

== Volume ==

The metric ''g'' induces a natural [[volume form]] (up to a sign), which can be used to integrate over a [[Region (mathematics)|region]] of a manifold. Given local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; for the manifold, the volume form can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol}_g = \pm\sqrt{|\det [g_{\mu\nu}]|}\,dx^0\wedge dx^1\wedge dx^2\wedge dx^3 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\det[g_{\mu\nu}]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] of the matrix of components of the metric tensor for the given coordinate system.

==Curvature==

The metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; completely determines the [[curvature]] of spacetime. According to the [[fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry]], there is a unique [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] ∇ on any [[semi-Riemannian manifold]] that is compatible with the metric and [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]-free. This connection is called the [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Christoffel symbols]] of this connection are given in terms of partial derivatives of the metric in local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu\nu} = {1 \over 2} g^{\lambda\rho} \left( {\partial g_{\rho\mu} \over \partial x^\nu} + {\partial g_{\rho\nu} \over \partial x^\mu} - {\partial g_{\mu\nu} \over \partial x^\rho} \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The curvature of spacetime is then given by the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] which is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection ∇. In local coordinates this tensor is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;{R^\rho}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho {}_{\nu\sigma}
 - \partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho {}_{\mu\sigma}
 + \Gamma^\rho {}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\nu\sigma}
 - \Gamma^\rho {}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu\sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

The curvature is then expressible purely in terms of the metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and its derivatives.

==Einstein's equations==

One of the core ideas of general relativity is that the metric (and the associated geometry of spacetime) is determined by the [[matter]] and [[energy]] content of [[spacetime]]. [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2}R g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \,T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Ricci curvature tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\nu \rho} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {R^{\mu}}_{\nu\mu \rho} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[scalar curvature]]
:&lt;math&gt; R \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ g^{\mu \nu}R_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt;
relate the metric (and the associated curvature tensors) to the [[stress–energy tensor]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[tensor]] equation is a complicated set of nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s for the metric components. [[Exact solutions]] of Einstein's field equations are very difficult to find.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20912">A '''modeling language''' is any [[artificial language]] that can be used to express [[information]] or [[knowledge]] or [[system]]s in a [[structure]] that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure.

== Overview ==
A modeling language can be graphical or textual.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao He (2007). "A metamodel for the notation of graphical modeling languages". In: ''Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2007. COMPSAC 2007 - Vol. 1. 31st Annual International'', Volume 1, Issue , 24–27 July 2007, pp 219-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Graphical'' modeling languages use a [[diagramming technique|diagram technique]] with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and represent relationships and various other graphical notation to represent constraints.
* ''Textual'' modeling languages may use standardized keywords accompanied by parameters or natural language terms and phrases to make computer-interpretable expressions.

An example of a graphical modeling language and a corresponding textual modeling language is [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]].

Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, the use of them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer required. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more challenging problems, such as [[parallel computing]] and [[distributed system]]s.

A large number of modeling languages appear in the literature.

== Type of modeling languages ==

=== Graphical types ===
Example of graphical modeling languages in the field of computer science, project management and systems engineering:
* [[Behavior Trees]] are a formal, graphical modeling language used primarily in [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]]. Commonly used to unambiguously represent the hundreds or even thousands of [[natural language]] requirements that are typically used to express the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] needs for a large-scale software-integrated system.
* [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN, and the [[XML]] form BPML) is an example of a [[Process Modeling]] language.
* [[C-K theory]] consists of a modeling language for design processes.
* [[DRAKON]] is a [[general-purpose modeling|general-purpose algorithmic modeling]] language for specifying software-intensive systems, a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process, and a family of [[programming language]]s.
* [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]] and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose [[data modeling]] language.
* [[Extended Enterprise Modeling Language]] (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across a number of layers.
* [[Flowchart]] is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process.
* [[Fundamental Modeling Concepts]] (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems.
* [[IDEF]] is a family of modeling languages, which include [[IDEF0]] for functional modeling, [[IDEF1X]] for information modeling, [[IDEF3]] for business process modeling, [[IDEF4]] for Object-Oriented Design and [[IDEF5]] for modeling ontologies.
* [[Jackson Structured Programming]] (JSP) is a method for structured programming based on correspondences between data stream structure and program structure.
* [[Lepus3|LePUS3]] is an [[object-oriented]] visual Design Description Language and a [[formal specification]] language that is suitable primarily for modeling large object-oriented ([[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) programs and [[design patterns]].
* [[Object-Role Modeling]] (ORM) in the field of software engineering is a method for conceptual modeling, and can be used as a tool for information and rules analysis.
* [[Petri net]]s use variations on exactly one diagramming technique and topology, namely the [[bipartite graph]].  The simplicity of its basic user interface easily enabled extensive tool support over the years, particularly in the areas of model checking, graphically oriented simulation, and software verification.
* [[Southbeach Notation]] is a visual modeling language used to describe situations in terms of agents that are considered useful or harmful from the modeler's perspective. The notation shows how the agents interact with each other and whether this interaction improves or worsens the situation.
* [[Specification and Description Language]] (SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behavior of reactive and distributed systems.
* [[SysML]] is a [[Domain-Specific Modeling]] language for [[systems engineering]] that is defined as a UML profile (customization).
* [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) is a [[general-purpose modeling]] language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques, and has widespread tool support.
* [[service-oriented modeling#Service-oriented modeling framework|Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF)]] is a holistic language for designing enterprise and application level architecture models in the space of enterprise architecture, virtualization, service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and more.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Michael|title=Service-Oriented Modeling: Service Analysis, Design, and Architecture|year= 2008 |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-14111-3 |chapter=Introduction to Service-Oriented Modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Architecture description language]] (ADL) is a language used to describe and represent the [[systems architecture]] of a [[system]].
* [[Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language|AADL]] (AADL) is a modeling language that supports early and repeated analyses of a system's architecture with respect to performance-critical properties through an exetendable notation, a tool framework, and precisely defined semantics.

Examples of graphical modeling languages in other fields of science.
* [[EAST-ADL]] is a  [[Domain-Specific Modeling]] language dedicated to automotive system design.
* [[Energy Systems Language]] (ESL), a language that aims to model ecological energetics &amp; global economics.

=== Textual types ===
Information models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish.&lt;ref&gt;* Andries van Renssen, [http://www.gellish.net/downloads/file/10-phd-gellish-a-generic-extensible-ontological-language.html Gellish, A Generic Extensible Ontological Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130015036/http://www.gellish.net/downloads/file/10-phd-gellish-a-generic-extensible-ontological-language.html |date=2012-11-30 }}, Delft University of Technology, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Gellish has natural language variants such as [[Gellish English|Gellish Formal English]] and Gellish Formal Dutch ([[:nl:Gellish Nederlands|Gellish Formeel Nederlands]]), etc. Gellish Formal English is an information representation language or semantic modeling language that is defined in the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has the form of a Taxonomy-Ontology (similarly for Dutch). Gellish Formal English is not only suitable to express knowledge, requirements and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies, but also information about individual things. All that information is expressed in one language and therefore it can all be integrated, independent of the question whether it is stored in central or distributed or in federated databases. Information models in Gellish Formal English consists of collections of Gellish Formal English expressions, that use natural language terms and formalized phrases. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as:

 - the Eiffel tower &lt;is located in&gt; Paris
 - Paris &lt;is classified as a&gt; city

whereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows:

 - tower &lt;shall be located in a&gt; geographical area
 - city &lt;is a kind of&gt; geographical area

Such Gellish Formal English expressions use names of concepts (such as 'city') and phrases that represent relation types (such as &lt;is located in&gt; and &lt;is classified as a&gt;) that should be selected from the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy (or of your own domain dictionary). The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models, because the dictionary contains more than 600 standard relation types and contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts. An information model in Gellish can express facts or make statements, queries and answers.

=== More specific types ===
In the field of [[computer science]] recently more specific types of modeling languages have emerged.

==== Algebraic ====
[[Algebraic modeling language|Algebraic Modeling Languages]] (AML) are high-level programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation (i.e. large scale optimization type problems). One particular advantage of AMLs like [[AIMMS]], [[AMPL]], [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]], [[Linear Programming Language|LPL]], [[FICO Xpress|Mosel]], MPL, [[OPL Development Studio|OPL]] and [[OptimJ]] is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it.

==== Behavioral ====

Behavioral languages are designed to describe the observable behavior of complex systems consisting of components that
execute concurrently. These languages focus on the description of key concepts such as: concurrency, nondeterminism, synchronization, and communication. The semantic foundations of Behavioral languages are [[process calculus]] or [[process algebra]].

==== Discipline-Specific ====
A [[Service-oriented modeling#Discipline-specific modeling|discipline-specific modeling (DspM)]] language is focused on deliverables affiliated with a specific software development life cycle stage. Therefore, such language offers a distinct vocabulary, syntax, and notation for each stage, such as discovery, analysis, design, architecture, contraction, etc. For example, for the analysis phase of a project, the modeler employs specific analysis notation to deliver an analysis proposition diagram. During the design phase, however, logical design notation is used to depict relationship between software entities. In addition, the discipline-specific modeling language best practices does not preclude practitioners from combining the various notations in a single diagram.

==== Domain-specific ====
[[Domain-specific modeling]] (DSM) is a software engineering methodology for designing and developing systems, most often IT systems such as computer software. It involves systematic use of a graphical [[domain-specific language]] (DSL) to represent the various facets of a system. DSM languages tend to support higher-level abstractions than General-purpose modeling languages, so they require less effort and fewer low-level details to specify a given system.

==== Framework-specific ====
A [[framework-specific modeling language]] (FSML) is a kind of domain-specific modeling language which is designed for an object-oriented application framework. FSMLs define framework-provided abstractions as FSML concepts and decompose the abstractions into features. The features represent implementation steps or choices.

A FSML concept can be configured by selecting features and providing values for features. Such a concept configuration represents how the concept should be implemented in the code. In other words, concept configuration describes how the framework should be completed in order to create the implementation of the concept.

==== Information and knowledge modelling ====
[[Linked data]] and [[ontology engineering]] require 'host languages' to represent [[Entity–relationship model|entities and the relations between them]], [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] between the properties of entities and relations, and [[metadata]] [[attribute (computing)| attributes]]. [[JSON-LD]] and [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] are two major (and semantically almost equivalent) languages in this context, primarily because they support [[Resource_Description_Framework#Statement_reification_and_context|statement reification and contextualisation]] which are essential properties to support the [[Higher-order logic|higher-order logic]] needed to reason about models. [[Model transformation]] is a common example of such reasoning.

==== Object-oriented ====
[[Object modeling language]] are modeling languages based on a standardized set of symbols and ways of arranging them to model (part of) an object oriented software design or system design.

Some organizations use them extensively in combination with a software development methodology to progress from initial specification to an implementation plan and to communicate that plan to an entire team of developers and stakeholders. Because a modeling language is visual and at a higher-level of abstraction than code, using models encourages the generation of a shared vision that may prevent problems of differing interpretation later in development. Often software modeling tools are used to construct these models, which may then be capable of automatic translation to code.

==== Virtual reality ====
[[VRML|Virtual Reality Modeling Language]] (VRML), before 1995 known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind.

==== Others ====
* [[Architecture Description Language]]
* [[Face Modeling Language]]
* [[Generative Modelling Language]]
* [[Java Modeling Language]]
* [[Promela]]
* [[Rebeca Modeling Language]]
* [[Service Modeling Language]]
* [[Web Services Modeling Language]]
* [[X3D]]

== Applications ==
Various kinds of modeling languages are applied in different disciplines, including [[computer science]], [[information management]], [[business process modeling]], [[software engineering]], and [[systems engineering]]. Modeling languages can be used to specify:
* system requirements,
* structures and
* behaviors.
Modeling languages are intended to be used to precisely specify systems so that stakeholders (e.g., customers, operators, analysts, designers) can better understand the system being modeled.

The more mature modeling languages are precise, consistent and executable. Informal diagramming techniques applied with drawing tools are expected to produce useful pictorial representations of system requirements, structures and behaviors, but not much else. Executable modeling languages applied with proper tool support, however, are expected to automate system [[verification and validation]], [[simulation]] and [[Automatic programming|code generation]] from the same representations.

== Quality ==
A review of modelling languages is essential to be able to assign which languages are appropriate for different modelling settings. In the term settings we include stakeholders, domain and the knowledge connected. Assessing the '''language quality''' is a means that aims to achieve better models.

=== Framework for evaluation ===
Here language quality is stated in accordance with the [[SEQUAL framework]] for quality of models developed by Krogstie, Sindre and Lindland (2003), since this is a framework that connects the language quality to a framework for general model quality. Five areas are used in this framework to describe language quality and these are supposed to express both the [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] as well as the visual notation of the language. We will not go into a thoroughly explanation of the underlying quality framework of models but concentrate on the areas used to explain the language quality framework.

==== Domain appropriateness ====
The framework states the ability to represent the domain as domain appropriateness. The statement ''appropriateness'' can be a bit vague, but in this particular context it means ''able to express''. You should ideally only be able to express things that are in the domain but be powerful enough to include everything that is in the domain. This requirement might seem a bit strict, but the aim is to get a visually expressed model which includes everything relevant to the domain and excludes everything not appropriate for the domain. To achieve this, the language has to have a good distinction of which notations and [[syntax]]es that are advantageous to present.

==== Participant appropriateness ====
To evaluate the participant appropriateness we try to identify how well the language expresses the knowledge held by the stakeholders. This involves challenges since a stakeholder's knowledge is subjective. The knowledge of the stakeholder is both tacit and explicit. Both types of knowledge are of dynamic character. In this framework only the explicit type of knowledge is taken into account. The language should to a large extent express all the explicit knowledge of the stakeholders relevant to the domain.

==== Modeller appropriateness ====
Last paragraph stated that knowledge of the stakeholders should be presented in a good way. In addition it is imperative that the language should be able to express all possible explicit knowledge of the stakeholders. No knowledge should be left unexpressed due to lacks in the language.

==== Comprehensibility appropriateness ====
Comprehensibility appropriateness makes sure that the social actors understand the model due to a consistent use of the language. To achieve this the framework includes a set of criteria. The general importance that these express is that the language should be flexible, easy to organize and easy to distinguish different parts of the language internally as well as from other languages. In addition to this, the goal should be as simple as possible and that each symbol in the language has a unique representation.

==== Tool appropriateness ====
To ensure that the domain actually modelled is usable for analyzing and further processing, the language has to ensure that it is possible to reason in an automatic way. To achieve this it has to include formal syntax and semantics. Another advantage by formalizing is the ability to discover errors in an early stage. It is not always that the language best fitted for the technical actors is the same as for the social actors.

==== Organizational appropriateness ====
The language used is appropriate for the organizational context, e.g. that the language is standardized within the organization, or that it is supported by tools that are chosen as standard in the organization.

'''Nicholas Joseph Fuentes''' (born August 18, 1998) is an American YouTube personality and political commentator. He regularly hosts the ''America First'' podcast and formerly hosted ''Nationalist Review'', with co-host [[James Allsup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nicholasjfuentes.com/|title=Nicholas J. Fuentes|last=|first=|date=|website=Nicholas J. Fuentes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[alt-right]], terms he rejects. He previously worked as a host on the [[Right Side Broadcasting Network]], but was removed after calling for violence against journalists. He later left [[Boston University]] after allegedly receiving several death threats and stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], though he has yet to confirm enrollment.

== Early life and education ==
Fuentes graduated from [[Lyons Township High School]], and was the school's student council president. He initially attended [[Boston University]], but later dropped out to attend the [[Unite the Right rally]] rally in Charlottevile, Virginia. Fuentes has stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], as it is within a staunch [[Alabama|red state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/alt-right_figure_says_hes_been.html|title=Alt-right figure says he's been admitted to Auburn|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/western-springs/news/ct-dlg-lt-grad-death-threats-tl-0824-20170818-story.html|title=Area teen rallied in Charlottesville, got death threats, now planning move to 'solidly red' Alabama|last=Mannion|first=Annemarie|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being admitted for the fall 2017 semester, he failed to confirm his enrollment and must apply for the spring semester by the deadline of October 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/08/if_alt-rights_nicholas_fuentes.html|title=Nicholas Fuentes was admitted to Auburn in May for 2017 fall semester, school says; he must reapply for spring|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
On April 25, 2017, while a host on [[Right Side Broadcasting Network]], Fuentes said he wanted "the people that run [[CNN]] to be arrested, and deported or hanged" for their "malicious intent" toward the American people.&lt;ref name="Vice1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nick-fuentes-kill-globalists-at-cnn_us_58fe7e95e4b00fa7de16ed9e |title=Right-Wing Broadcaster Calls For Killing Of 'Globalists At CNN' |publisher=[[Huffpost]] |date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuentes had also stated, "the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was not written for [[Muslim]]s". They later issued an apology claiming what he said had been "in jest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/04/24/right-side-broadcasting-unofficial-version-trump-tv-forced-apologize-contributor-s-call-kill/216156|title=Right Side Broadcasting, The "Unofficial Version Of Trump TV," Forced To Apologize For Contributor's Call To "Kill The Globalists" At CNN|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Media Matters]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo /&gt; As a result of hidden video footage of him saying that interracial sex was "degenerate", [[Right Side Broadcasting Network|Right Side Broadcasting]] removed Fuentes as a host on their network.&lt;ref name="Vice1" /&gt;

On August 12, 2017, Fuentes flew from Chicago to attend the second day of the [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/wing-us-provocateur-emboldened-charlottesville-173338763.html |title=Right-wing US provocateur emboldened by Charlottesville |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' covered his appearance and quoted his denouncing of violence, as well as his claim that the "vast majority" of protestors were neither [[KKK]] members nor Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/15/citing-death-threats-year-old-who-attended-violent-rally-won-return/CJU7GioWLClGjIHZ2YqshM/story.html |title=18-year-old who attended rally won’t return to BU |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuentes was quoted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying that "the rootless transnational elite knows that a tidal wave of white identity is coming and they know that once the word gets out, they will not be able to stop us. The fire rises!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/19/us/charlottesville-quotes.html |title=‘The Fight for the White Race’: What Some of the Charlottesville Rally Participants Stand For |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2018 his ''Nationalist Review'' podcast co-host [[James Allsup]] said that the two had separated due to administrative disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://angrywhitemen.org/2018/01/15/america-first-media-dissolves-amid-a-feud-between-nick-fuentes-and-james-allsup/|title=America First Media Dissolves Amid A Feud Between Nick Fuentes And James Allsup|date=2018-01-16|work=Angry White Men|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018|reason=Source is a blog but specific claim is non-controversial}}

On April 11, 2018, [[Heavy.com]] reported that Fuentes's YouTube channel had 11,000 subscribers, referring to him as an "America First nationalist", while covering his public disavowing of [[Paul Nehlen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/04/nehlen-twitter-banned-antisemitic-white-supremacist/ |title=Paul Nehlen Controversies: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |publisher=[[Heavy.com]] |date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a knife through one of Nehlen's campaign posters live on a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/not-even-white-nationalists-like-paul-nehlen-anymore/ |title=Not Even White Nationalists Like Paul Nehlen Anymore  |publisher=[[Right Wing Watch]] |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Complex perceptions''' like [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] or [[discrimination]] of similar sound sequences need experience and can generally be trained.
Complex perceptions are often multi-[[sensory perception]]s.
Example: To distinguish between a real apple and fake the subject needs to touch or to smell it, because [[visual inspection]] may be insufficient.

Depending on previous experience with similar situations the subject will decide which [[strategy]] to use. Vision-Motor-Perception Program is based on the assumption that vision is the most important sensory mechanism. This program, to help children gain superior perception abilities, was developed based on theory and research in how they develop. &lt;ref&gt; Gould, L. (1997). Visual Perception Training. The Elementary School Journal, 67(7), 381-389. &lt;/ref&gt;

The basic [[principle]]s of ''perception training'' are similar to [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The perception of a simple [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (like a sound of a given intensity) can normally not be trained to function below its [[intensity threshold]].

[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|300px|What does it take for a person to persist from moment to moment—for the same person to exist at different moments?]]

In [[philosophy]], the matter of '''personal identity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/person-i/|title=Personal Identity - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903032724/http://www.iep.utm.edu/person-i/|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with such questions as, "What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?" or "What kinds of things are we persons?" Generally, personal identity is the unique [[numerical identity]] of a [[person]] in the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/ Personal Identity] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/ Identity] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the {{em|same}} person, persisting through time.{{efn|or, the essence of a self-conscious person, that which enables the person to be uniquely what him- or herself, and which further persists over time, despite superficial modifications, making him or her same person at different times.}}

In contemporary [[metaphysics]], the matter of personal identity is referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] problem'' of personal identity.{{efn|{{lang-el|Διαχρονικός|Diachronikos}}}}&lt;ref&gt;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding; Volumes 1–3. By [[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] problem'' concerns the question of what features and traits characterize a person at a given time. In [[continental philosophy]] and in [[analytic philosophy]], enquiry to the nature of Identity is common. Continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity when confronted by different philosophic [[proposition]]s, [[postulate]]s, and [[presupposition]]s about the world and its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Self and Subjectivity; "Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance". Edited by [[Kim Atkins]]. p257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Theory: An Anthology. Edited by [[Imre Szeman]], [[Timothy Kaposy]]. p481.

One concept of personal persistence over time is simply to have continuous bodily existence.&lt;ref&gt;The Human Animal: Personal Identity Without Psychology. By [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]] Lecturer Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[Ship of Theseus]] problem illustrates, even for inanimate objects there are difficulties in determining whether one physical body at one time is the same thing as a physical body at another time. With humans, over time our bodies age and grow, losing and gaining matter, and over sufficient years will not consist of most of the matter they once consisted of. It is thus problematic to ground persistence of personal identity over time in the continuous existence of our bodies. Nevertheless, this approach has its supporters which define humans as a biological organism and [[Logical assertion|asserts]] the [[proposition]] that a [[Property (philosophy)|psychological relation]] is not necessary for personal continuity.{{efn|See also: [[Disjunctive syllogism]], [[Affirming a disjunct]], [[Proof by assertion]].}} This personal identity [[ontology]] assumes the [[relational theory]]&lt;ref&gt;What Are We? : A Study in Personal Ontology: A Study in Personal Ontology.

The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an organ (the [[human brain]]) possessing electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause [[neuron]]s of the brain to fire and muscles to contract in the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].

===Continuity of consciousness===
====Locke's conception====
[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumbnail|[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] in four books (1690) by [[John Locke]] (1632–1704)]]
[[John Locke]] considered personal identity&lt;ref&gt;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding; Volumes 1–3. By John Locke&lt;/ref&gt; (or the [[self (philosophy)|self]]) to be founded on [[consciousness]] (viz. [[memory]]), and not on the [[substance theory|substance]] of either the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or the [[Human body|body]]. Book II Chapter XXVII entitled "[[On Identity and Diversity]]" in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualizations of consciousness as the repeated self-identification of [[self (philosophy)|oneself]]. Through this identification, [[moral responsibility]] could be attributed to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] and punishment and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] could be justified, as critics such as [[Nietzsche]] would point out.

According to Locke, personal identity (the self) "depends on consciousness, not on substance" nor on the soul. We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of the past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this "thought" which "goes along with the substance&amp;nbsp;[...] which makes the same person", then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: "This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but&amp;nbsp;[...] in the identity of consciousness". For example, one may claim to be a [[reincarnation]] of Plato, therefore having the same soul substance. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.

Neither is self-identity founded on the body substance, argues Locke, as the body may change while the person remains the same. Even the identity of animals is not founded on their body: "animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance", as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life. On the other hand, identity of humans is based on their consciousness.{{efn|Take for example a prince's mind which enters the body of a cobbler: to all exterior eyes, the cobbler would remain a cobbler. But to the prince himself, the cobbler would be himself, as he would be conscious of the prince's thoughts and acts, and not those of the cobbler. A prince's consciousness in a cobbler's body: thus the cobbler is, in fact, a prince.}}

But this interesting border-case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging—and punishing—the same person, or simply the same body. In other words, Locke argues that may be judged only for the acts of the body, as this is what is apparent to all but God; however, are in truth only responsible for the acts for which are conscious. This forms the basis of the [[insanity defense]]: one cannot be held accountable for acts from which one was [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]—and therefore leads to interesting philosophical questions:

{{quote|personal identity consists [not in the identity of substance] but in the identity of consciousness, wherein if Socrates and the present mayor of Queenborough agree, they are the same person: if the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same consciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person. And to punish Socrates waking for what sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates was never conscious of, would be no more right, than to punish one twin for what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because their outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such twins have been seen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=205&amp;fk_files=3276103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or again:

{{quote|PERSON, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a man finds what he calls himself, there, I think, another may say is the same person. It is a forensic term, appropriating actions and their merit; and so belong only to intelligent agents, capable of a law, and happiness, and misery. This personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness,—whereby it becomes concerned and accountable; owns and imputes to itself past actions, just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of pleasure and pain, desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or APPROPRIATE to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in it than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action, is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all. For, supposing a MAN punished now for what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and being CREATED miserable? And therefore, conformable to this, the apostle tells us, that, at the great day, when every one shall 'receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.' The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all person shall have, that THEY THEMSELVES, in what bodies soever they appear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the SAME that committed those actions, and deserve that punishment for them.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3276103&amp;pageno=209&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Henceforth, Locke's conception of personal identity founds it not on the substance or the body, but in the "same continued consciousness", which is also distinct from the soul since the soul may have no consciousness of itself (as in [[reincarnation]]). He creates a third term between the soul and the body—and Locke's thought may certainly be meditated by those who, following a [[scientist]] [[ideology]],{{efn|Not to be confused with [[scientism]].}} would identify too quickly the brain to consciousness. For the brain, as the body and as any substance, may change, while consciousness remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Volume 18.

====Philosophical intuition====
[[Bernard Williams]] presents a thought experiment appealing to the [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] about what it is to be the same person in the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, The Self and the Future, in Philosophical Review 79. No. 2. (Apr., 1970), p. 161–180&lt;/ref&gt;  The thought experiment consists of two approaches to the same experiment.

For the ''first approach'' Williams suggests that suppose that there is some process by which subjecting two persons to it can result in the two persons have "[[Body swap|exchanged]]" bodies. The process has put into the body of person B the [[memories]], [[Dispositional affect|behavioral dispositions]], and [[Big Five personality traits|psychological characteristics]] of the person who prior to undergoing the process belonged to [[Research subject|person A]]; and conversely with [[Research subject|person B]]. To show this one is to suppose that before undergoing the process person A and B are asked to which resulting person, A-Body-Person or B-Body-Person, they wish to receive a punishment and which a reward. Upon undergoing the process and receiving either the punishment or reward, it appears to that A-Body-Person expresses the memories of choosing who gets which treatment as if that person was person B; conversely with B-Body-Person.

This sort of approach to the thought experiment appears to show that since the person who expresses the psychological characteristics of person A to be person A, then intuition is that ''psychological continuity'' is the criterion for personal identity.

The ''second approach'' is to suppose that someone is told that one will have [[Memory erasure|memories erase]]d and then one will be [[torture]]d. Does one need to be [[Fear|afraid]] of being tortured? The intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured, since it will still be one despite not having one's memories. Next, Williams asked one to consider several similar [[scenarios]].{{efn|The synoptical collage of an event or series of actions and events are: 
* One has memories erased, and are given new [[False memory|"fake" memories]] ([[counterfeit]]), and then one is to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given copies of another's memories, and then are to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given another's genuine memories, and then one is to be tortured; 
* have one's memories erased, are given another's genuine memories, that person is given one's memories, and then one is to be tortured.}}
Intuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured, that it is still one's self despite having one's memories erased and receiving new memories. However, the last scenario is an [[Law of identity|identical]] scenario to the one in the first scenario.{{efn|With the supposed superfluous information included in the last scenario.}}

In the first approach, intuition is to show that one's ''psychological continuity'' is the criterion for personal identity, but in second approach, intuition is that it is one's ''bodily continuity'' that is the criterion for personal identity. To resolve this conflict Williams feels one's intuition in the second approach is stronger and if he was given the choice of distributing a punishment and a reward he would want his body-person to receive the reward and the other body-person to receive the punishment, even if that other body-person has his memories.

====Psychological continuity====
In [[psychology]], personal continuity, also called ''personal persistence'' or ''self-continuity'', is the uninterrupted connection concerning a particular person of his or her private life and [[personality psychology|personality]]. Personal continuity is the union affecting the facets arising from personality in order to avoid [[:wikt:discontinuity|discontinuities]] from one moment of [[time]] to another time.{{efn|For more, see: [[consciousness]].}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mar2009/identity-self-image.html Identity and self-image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827233126/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mar2009/identity-self-image.html |date=2013-08-27 }}. martinfrost.ws.

Associations can result from [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], similarity, or contrast. Through contiguity, one associates ideas or events that usually happen to occur at the same time. Some of these events form an [[autobiographical memory]] in which each is a personal representation of the general or specific events and personal facts.

===Bundle theory of the self===
[[File:A Treatise of Human Nature by David Hume.jpg|thumbnail|A Treatise Of Human Nature: Being An Attempt To Introduce The Experimental Method Of Reasoning Into Moral Subjects. For John Noon, 1739]]
[[David Hume]] undertook looking at the [[mind–body problem]]. Hume also investigated a person's character, the relationship between human and animal nature, and the nature of agency. Hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we've changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, "we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a [[bundle theory|bundle]] or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise of Human Nature'', I, IV, vi&lt;/ref&gt;

It is plain that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.&lt;ref name="bond-of-union"&gt;''A Treatise of Human Nature'', 4.1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note in particular that, in Hume's view, these perceptions do not ''belong to'' anything. Hume, similar to the [[Buddha]],&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism: Way of Life &amp; Thought. By [[Nancy Wilson Ross]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqdbDZaW1QAC&amp;pg=PA29 p29].&lt;/ref&gt; compares the soul to a [[Commonwealth#Etymology|commonwealth]], which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet [[System dynamics|constantly changing elements]]. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the [[Cohesion (computer science)|loose cohesion]]{{efn|See also: [[structural cohesion]]}} of one's [[personal experience]].{{efn|In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume stated that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, yet he never returned to the issue.}}

In short, what matters for Hume is not that 'identity' exists but that the relations of causation, contiguity, and resemblances obtain among the perceptions. [[Bundle theory#Compresence objection|Critics]] of Hume state in order for the various states and processes of the mind to seem unified, there must be something which perceives their unity, the existence of which would be no less mysterious than a personal identity. Hume solves this by considering substance as engendered by the ''togetherness'' of its properties.

===No-self theory===
The "no-self theory"{{efn|See also: [[Nihilism]], [[Post-left anarchy#Self-theory|Post-left anarchy theory of self]]&lt;br /&gt;''Not to be confused with [[Anatta]]''.}} holds that the self [[Irreducible|cannot be reduced]] to a bundle because the concept of a self is incompatible with the idea of a [[Bundle theory|bundle]]. [[Propositional]]ly, the idea of a bundle implies the notion of bodily or psychological relations that do not in fact exist. [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], a principal exponent of this view, argues that the ''no-self'' or ''eliminativist theory'' and the bundle or [[reductionist]] theory agree about the non-existence of a [[substantive]] self. The reductionist theory, according to Giles, mistakenly [[dict:revival|resurrects the idea]]{{efn|And, presumably, [[resurrection]].}} of the self&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20No-Self%20Theory%20-%20Hume,%20Buddhism,%20and%20Personal%20Identity%20-%20James%20Giles.pdf The No-Self Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051956/https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20No-Self%20Theory%20-%20Hume,%20Buddhism,%20and%20Personal%20Identity%20-%20James%20Giles.pdf |date=2014-08-08 }}: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity. James Giles&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of various accounts about [[Object relations theory|psychological relations]].{{efn|See also: [[Psychological entropy]].}} The no-self theory, on the other hand, "lets the self lie where it has fallen".&lt;ref&gt;
James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity'', University Press of America, 1997, p. 10
&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the no-self theory rejects all theories of the self, even the bundle theory. On Giles' reading, Hume is actually a no-self theorist and it is a mistake to attribute to him a reductionist view like the bundle theory. Hume's [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|assertion]] that personal identity is a [[fiction]] supports this reading, according to Giles.

The Buddhist view of personal identity is also a no-self theory rather than a reductionist theory, because [[the Buddha]] rejects attempts to [[Anatta#Developing the self|reconstructions in terms of consciousness, feelings, or the body in notions of an eternal/permanent, unchanging Self]]&lt;ref&gt;
James Giles, 'The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity, ''Philosophy East and West'', 42, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; since our thoughts, personalities&lt;!--,environments/externals?--&gt; and bodies are never the same from moment to moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wrasman|first1=Andy|title=Contradict: They Can't All Be True|publisher=WestBowPress|isbn=9781490829814|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dYkNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=15 January 2017|language=en|date=2014-01-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116191138/https://books.google.de/books?id=dYkNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|archivedate=16 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this line of criticism, the [[Agency (philosophy)|sense of self]] is an [[Biocultural evolution|evolutionary artifact]],{{efn|See also: [[Phenotypic trait]]s, [[Society]] ([[Social artifact]]), [[Culture]] ([[Cultural artifact]]), [[evolutionary psychology]] ([[criticism of evolutionary psychology]]).}} which saves time in the circumstances it evolved for. But sense of self breaks down when considering some events such as [[memory loss]],{{efn|See also: [[Alzheimer]]}} [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality disorder]], [[brain damage]], [[brainwashing]], and various [[thought experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophersnet.com/games/identity.htm "Staying alive game - Examples of thought experiments on personal identity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024327/http://www.philosophersnet.com/games/identity.htm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When presented with [[Information|imperfection]]s in the intuitive sense of self and the consequences to this concept which rely on the [[Strictly positive measure|strict concept]] of self, a tendency to [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|mend the concept]] occurs, possibly because of [[cognitive dissonance]].{{efn|Though, this does not address the ''loose cohesion of self'' and other similar [[Epistemology|epistemological]] views.}}

'''Private browsing''', '''privacy mode''' or '''incognito mode''' is a privacy feature in some [[web browser]]s to disable [[Web browsing history|browsing history]] and the [[web cache]]. This allows a person to browse the [[World Wide Web|Web]] without storing local data that could be retrieved at a later date. Privacy mode will also disable{{dubious|Disabling cookies?| reason=Not only until you close the browser?|date=October 2018}} the storage of data in [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] and [[Local shared object|Flash cookies]]. This privacy protection is only within the browser application as it may leave traces on the hard drive and memory of the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Verger |first1=Rob |title=Your private browsing isn’t as incognito as you want it to be |url=https://www.popsci.com/private-browsing |accessdate=15 September 2018 |date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via websites by associating the [[IP address]] at the [[web server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/117776/htg-explains-how-private-browsing-works-and-why-it-doesnt-offer-complete-privacy/|title=HTG Explains: How Private Browsing Works and Why It Doesn't Offer Complete Privacy|publisher=How-To Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest reference to private browsing was in May 2005, and was used to discuss the privacy features in the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser bundled with [[Mac OS X Tiger]].&lt;ref name="lifehack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/software/mac-os-x/safaris-private-porn-browsing-mode-102146.php|title=Safari's private (porn) browsing mode|last=Trapani|first=Gina|authorlink=Gina Trapani|date=May 4, 2005|publisher=[[Lifehacker]]|accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature has since been adopted in other browsers, and led to popularization of the term in 2008 by mainstream news outlets and computing websites when discussing [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] versions of [[Internet Explorer 8]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1550|title=Microsoft to roll out more granular 'porn mode' with IE 8|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/24763|title=Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 Goes 'Porn Mode'|first=Lalee|last=Sadighi|publisher=[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]|accessdate=2008-10-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912040417/http://www.redherring.com/Home/24763|archivedate=2008-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcmag.com/microsoft_releases_ie8_beta_2.htm|title=Microsoft releases IE8 beta 2: MS porn mode included|first=Angus|last=Kidman|publisher=[[APC (magazine)|APC]]|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, privacy modes operate as shields because browsers typically do not remove all data from the cache after the session. [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-ins]], like [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]], are able to set cookies that will not be removed after the session.

The common web browser plugin [[Adobe Flash Player]] began supporting privacy mode in [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer,]] and Safari with the release of version 10.1 in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Jimson|last2=Nguyen|first2=Tom|title=Private browsing in Flash Player 10.1 |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/privacy_mode_fp10_1.html|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Some browsers (like Internet Explorer 8) allow users to select the privacy mode for single [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]], whereas others create a more [[Interface segregation principle|isolated]] environment protected by [[password]] and [[cryptography]].

==Uses==
Private browsing has multiple uses, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/7-situations-where-you-should-use-private-browsing-mode-179175|title=7 Great Uses for Your Browser's Private Browsing Mode|first=Taryn|last=Fiol|date=23 October 2012|publisher=Apartment Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/5-great-reasons-why-you-should-use-private-browsing-online-0140619/|title=5 Great Reasons Why You Should Use Private Browsing Online|first=Osas|last=Obaiza|publisher=Null Byte}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5620502/nine-great-uses-for-private-browsing-that-dont-involve-porn|title=Nine Great Uses for Private Browsing that Don't Involve Porn|first=Adam|last=Pash|publisher=Lifehacker|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reducing history, including [[autofill]], browsing, and personal information.
*Performing "pure searches" that are not influenced by prior browsing history or networks or friends' recommendations, which may weight and more highly rank certain results than others.
*Preventing accidental saving of [[login]] credentials to [[User (computing)#User account|accounts]].
*Signing into multiple accounts simultaneously, via multiple [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]].
*Testing websites.
*Preventing other users of the computer from finding one's search history.
*Viewing explicit material without outside knowledge.

The [[Mozilla Foundation]] performed a study about the user behavior when the feature is switched on and how long the session lasts. The results were that most sessions last only about 10 minutes, though there are periods where activation increases; usually around 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 2&amp;nbsp;p.m., 5&amp;nbsp;p.m., between 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 10&amp;nbsp;p.m., and a minor peak about an hour or two after midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulmer|first=Hamilton|title=Understanding Private Browsing|url=http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/08/23/understanding-private-browsing/|work=Blog of Metrics|publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]]|accessdate=24 August 2010|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Brazil|Brazilian]] researchers published the results of a research project&lt;ref&gt;R. Ruiz, F. P. Amatte, K. J. B. Park, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258491690_Making_the_In_Private_Navigation_as_Public_%28Tornando_Pblica_a_Navegao_In_Private%29_Portuguese Tornando Pública a Navegação “In Private”]. Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Forensic Computer Science – ICoFCS 2012, Available online Sep 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; where they applied [[Computer forensics|forensic]] techniques (namely the Foremost data carving tool and Strings program) to extract information about the users browsing activities on Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers with their private mode enabled. They were able to collect enough data to identify pages visited and even partially reconstruct them.

This research was later extended&lt;ref&gt;R. Ruiz, F. P. Amatte, K. J. B. Park, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271497300_Opening_the__Private_Browsing__Data__Acquiring_Evidence_of_Browsing_Activities Opening the “Private Browsing” Data – Acquiring Evidence of Browsing Activities]. Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Security and Cyber Forensics (InfoSec2014), Available online Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to include Chrome and Safari browsers. The gathered data proved that browsers' private mode implementations are not able to fully hide users' browsing activities and that browsers in private mode leave traces of activities in caching structures and files related to the [[paging]] process of the [[operating system]].

Another independent security analysis, performed by a group of researchers at [[Newcastle University]] in 2014, shows a range of security vulnerabilities in the implementation of the private mode across four major browsers ([[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]).&lt;ref&gt;K. Satvat, M. Forshaw, F. Hao, E. Toreini, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2014.02.002 On the privacy of private browsing – A forensic approach]. Journal of Information Security and Applications, In Press, Available online 3 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The results are summarized below.
# [[Browser extension|Browser extensions]] are potential threats to the user privacy. By design, existing browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari) commonly choose to enable extensions in the private mode by default. This however allows an installed extension to secretly record the visited websites without the user's awareness. Newer versions of Chrome disable extensions in the private mode by default, but allow the private and the normal modes to run in parallel. This makes it possible for an installed extension in the normal mode to learn the user activities in the private mode by measuring the usage of shared computing resources.  
# Data erasure by the browser alone is found to be insufficient. For example, the records of visited websites during the private session can be retained in memory for a long time even after the private session is closed. In addition, the visited website records are usually kept by the operating system in the local [[Domain Name System|DNS]] cache. Furthermore, the modified timestamps of certain profile files saved on the disk may reveal if the private mode was previously turned on and when it was turned on.
# [[Software bug|Software bugs]] present in some browsers are found to seriously degrade the security of the private mode. For example, in some earlier versions of Safari, the browser retained private browsing history records if the browser program was not closed normally (e.g., as a result of program crash), or if the user acted to add a [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmark]] within the private mode. 
# Depending on whether the session is in the private or the normal mode, web browsers typically exhibit different [[User interface|user interfaces]] and traffic characteristics. This allows a remote website to tell if the user is currently in the private mode, for example, by checking the color of the hyperlinks or measuring the time of writing cookies. (The fact that the user is using the private mode should be considered protected information as well.)

In 2010, professors at [[Stanford University]] found that while Firefox won't record your history during a private browsing session, it still records the sites on which you've installed [[Public key certificate#TLS/SSL client certificate|SSL certificates]] (which enable secure, encrypted information exchange indicated by the "[[HTTPS|https]]" in front of the [[URL]]) and allows specific permissions. If you download an SSL certificate from a website or told that site specifically to stop displaying [[Modal window|pop-ups]] and downloading cookies, all of that information is still stored on Firefox.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 2015, researchers from [[Pennsylvania State University]] found that a considerable amount of extensions on Firefox violated the private browsing policy based on an investigation of the top 2,000 extensions.&lt;ref&gt;B. Zhao, P. Liu, [http://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/DSN_CameraReady-Bin-Zhao-PBM-18March2015.pdf Private Browsing Mode Not Really That Private: Dealing with Privacy Breaches Caused by Browser Extensions]. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2015), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Available online June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many extensions maintain their own profile folders on the local machine, and most of them will not wipe the browsing data after the private browsing session ends. This violation even happens on some most popular extensions with millions of users on Firefox.

--&gt;'''Reverse computation''' is a [[computer software|software]] application of the concept of [[reversible computing]].

Because it offers a possible solution to the heat problem faced by chip manufacturers, reversible computing has been extensively studied in the area of computer architecture.  The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors.&lt;ref&gt;

The concept of reverse computation is somewhat simpler than reversible computing in that reverse computation is only required to restore the ''equivalent'' state of a software application, rather than support the reversibility of the set of all possible instructions.  Reversible computing concepts have been successfully applied as ''reverse computation'' in software application areas such as database design,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the application of reverse computation to reduce state saving overheads
in ''parallel discrete event simulation'' (PDES). They define an approach based on reverse event codes (which can be automatically generated), and
demonstrate performance advantages of this approach over
traditional state saving for fine-grained applications (those
with a small amount of computation per event).
The key property that reverse computation
exploits is that a majority of the operations that modify the
state variables are “constructive” in nature. That is, the [[undo]]
operation for such operations requires no history. Only the
most current values of the variables are required to undo the
operation. For example, operators such as ++, ––, +=, -=, *=
and /= belong to this category. Note, that the *= and /= operators
require special treatment in the case of multiply or divide
by zero, and overflow / underflow conditions. More complex
operations such as circular shift (swap being a special case),
and certain classes of random number generation also belong
here.

Operations of the form a = b, modulo and bit-wise computations
that result in the loss of data, are termed to be destructive.
Typically these operations can only be restored using
conventional state-saving techniques. However, we observe
that many of these destructive operations are a consequence
of the arrival of data contained within the event being
processed. For example, in the work of Yaun, Carothers, et al., with large-scale TCP simulation,&lt;ref&gt;

the time stamp of the last packet forwarded on a router logical process.
The swap operation makes this operation reversible.

==History of Reverse Computation as applied to Parallel Discrete Event Simulation==

[[File:Simulation-taxonomy.png|thumb|right|Taxonomy of digital simulation.]]

In 1985 Jefferson introduced the optimistic synchronization protocol, which was utilized in parallel discrete event simulations, known as Time Warp.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, the technique known as ''Reverse Computation'' has only been applied in software for optimistically synchronized, parallel discrete event simulation.

In December 1999, Michael Frank graduated from the [[University of Florida]].  His [[doctoral thesis]] focused on reverse computation at the hardware level, but included descriptions of both an instruction set architecture and a high level programming language (R) for a processor based on reverse computation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Dr. Frank maintains two websites of his publications on [http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/writing.html reverse computation to 2004] and [http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~mpf/pubs.htm later].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Carothers and Perumalla published a paper for the Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation workshop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pads-workshop.org/ PADS]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their graduate studies under Richard Fujimoto, introducing technique of Reverse Computation as an alternative rollback mechanism in optimistically synchronized parallel discrete event simulations (Time Warp).  In 1998, Carothers became an associate professor at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].   Working with graduate students David Bauer and Shawn Pearce, Carothers integrated the Georgia Tech Time Warp design into Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS), which supported only reverse computation as the rollback mechanism.   Carothers also constructed RC models for BitTorrent at General Electric, as well as numerous network protocols with students (BGP4, TCP Tahoe, Multicast).  Carothers created a course on Parallel and Distributed Simulation in which students were required to construct RC models in ROSS.

Around the same time, Perumalla graduated from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] and went to work at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL).  There he built the uSik simulator, which was a combined optimistic / conservative protocol PDES.  The system was capable of dynamically determining the best protocol for LPs and remapping them during execution in response to model dynamics.  In 2007 Perumalla tested uSik on [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/L|Blue Gene/L]] and found that, while scalability is limited to 8K processors for pure Time Warp implementation, the conservative implementation scales to 16K available processors.  Note that benchmarking was performed using PHOLD with a constrained remote event rate of 10%, where the timestamp of events was determined by an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.0, and an additional lookahead of 1.0 added to each event.  This was the first implementation of PDES on Blue Gene using reverse computation.

From 1998 to 2005 Bauer performed graduate work at RPI under Carothers, focusing solely on reverse computation.  He developed the first PDES system solely based on reverse computation, called Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for combined shared and distributed memory systems.  From 2006 to 2009 Bauer worked under E.H. Page at [[Mitre Corporation]], and in collaboration with Carothers and Pearce pushed the ROSS simulator to the 131,072 processor [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] (Intrepid).  This implementation was stable for remote event rates of 100% (every event sent over the network).  During his time at RPI and MITRE, Bauer developed the network simulation system ROSS.Net&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that supports semi-automated experiment design for black-box optimization of network protocol models executing in ROSS.  A primary goal of the system was to optimize multiple network protocol models for execution in ROSS.  For example, creating an LP layering structure to eliminate events being passed between network protocol LPs on the same simulated machine optimizes simulation of TCP/IP network nodes by eliminating zero-offset timestamps between TCP and IP protocols.  Bauer also constructed RC agent-based models for social contact networks to study the effects of infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza, that scale to hundreds of millions of agents; as well as RC models for Mobile ad-hoc networks implementing functionality of mobility (proximity detection) and highly accurate physical layer electromagnetic wave propagation (Transmission Line Matrix model).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have implemented an RC model of particle-in-cell and demonstrated excellent speedup over continuous simulation for models of light as a particle.  Bauer and Page demonstrated excellent speedup for an RC Transmission Line Matrix model (P.B. Johns, 1971), modeling light as a wave at microwave frequencies.  Bauer also created an RC variant of [[Compartmental models in epidemiology|SEIR]] that generates enormous improvement over continuous models in the area of infectious disease spread.  In addition, the RC SEIR model is capable of modeling multiple diseases efficiently, whereas the continuous model explodes exponentially with respect to the number of combinations of diseases possible throughout the population.

{{Theosophy}}
'''Root races''' are stages in human [[evolution]] in the [[esoteric cosmology]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], as described in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888). These races existed mainly on [[Lost lands|now-lost continents]]. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably [[William Scott-Elliot]] in ''The Story of Atlantis'' (1896) and ''The Lost Lemuria'' (1904). [[Annie Besant]] further developed the model in [[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: Whence, How and Whither'']] (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] obtained by "astral clairvoyance". Further elaboration was provided by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in ''Atlantis and Lemuria'' (1904).&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantis and Lemuria, The Submerged Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Cosmic Memory (Prehistory of Earth and Man), Aus der Akasha-Chronik.'' Rudolf Steiner (Written 1904; GA 11 / Bn 11)[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/] English Edition, trans. Max Gysi [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/English/TPS1911/GA011_cover.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races, '''Epochs''' (Steiner felt that the term "race" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).

==Sources==
According to historian [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]], the [[occult]] concept of succeeding [[prehistory|prehistoric]] races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]] in his ''Histoire philosophique du genre humain'' (1824).&lt;ref&gt;James Webb, ''The Occult Underground'', Open Court, La Salle 1974, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book [[Oera Linda]], which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, Goffe (November 2007), "How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science. The Oera Linda Book as a New Age Bible", Fabula 48 (3–4): 229–249&lt;/ref&gt; Also prior to Blavatsky, the root races were described by the English theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

==Locations of the proposed former continents==
Some post-theosophical writers, attempting to reconcile current geological science with some earlier theosophical teachings, have equated [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with the former [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], but this is not theosophy. Early theosophical teachings agree with the original statements of [[Eduard Suess]], who argued that Gondwanaland consisted of parts of the present continents in their present positions, but joined to one another by other lands that have since been submerged. This is also the position of Master [[Samael Aun Weor]].

[[Atlantis]], in the Theosophical cosmology, was a continent that covered a significant part of what is now the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;See L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature'', Dover Publications, 1970 for a scientific analysis of the concept of lost continents.&lt;/ref&gt; The large continent of Atlantis is said to have "first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas and islands". When the main part of Atlantis began to sink, Atlantean settlers migrated to the new lands which were rising to the east, west, and south. These new lands became the Americas, Africa, parts of Asia, and the present European countries, stretching from the [[Ural Mountains]] of Russia, westward to include the islands of Ireland and Britain, and even farther westward than that in former times. Some emigrants from the remaining islands in the Atlantic settled on new islands to the east which later consolidated into what is now the district of the Abyssinian highlands and lands somewhat to the north. Atlantis perished through flooding and submergence in 9,564 BC,&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt; and its destruction is explained by claiming successive disturbances in the axial rotation of Earth which caused [[earthquake]]s, which led to the sudden sinking of Atlantis.

==Root races, epochs and sub-races==

According to Blavatsky's writings, there will be seven root races assembled for our Earth; each root race is divided into seven subraces.  Only five root races have appeared so far;{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} the sixth is expected to emerge in the 28th century. [[Francis Bacon]] (whom theosophy considers to be the legendary [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Count of St. Germain]]) in his work ''The New Atlantis'' (1627) describes a potential future civilisation which lives on a land called Bensalem.

===The first root race (Polarian)===

The first root race was "[[Etheric plane|ethereal]]", i.e. they were composed of etheric matter.  They reproduced by dividing like an [[amoeba]].  Earth was still cooling at that time. The first mountain to arise out of the stormy primeval ocean was [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref name="Powell-31"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 188-192. (Ch. 31. "The Earth: The first root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second root race (Hyperborean)===
The second root race lived in [[Hyperborea]]. The second root race was colored golden yellow.  Hyperborea included what is now Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Northern Asia and [[Kamchatka]].  The climate was [[Tropical climate|tropical]] because Earth had not yet developed an axial tilt.  The esoteric name of their continent is ''Plaksha'';&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; they called themselves the ''Kimpurshas''.  They reproduced by [[budding]].&lt;ref name="Powell-32"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-196. (Ch. 32. "The Earth: The second root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The third root race (Lemurian)===
[[File:Map of Lemuria.jpg|thumb|Map of Lemuria superimposed over the modern continents from William Scott-Elliot, ''The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria''.]]
The third root race, the Lemurian lived in [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].  The esoteric name of Lemuria is ''Shalmali''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; Lemuria, according to Theosophists, existed in a large part of what is now the Indian Ocean including Australia and extending into the South Pacific Ocean; its last remnants are the Australian continent, the island of [[New Guinea]], and the island of [[Madagascar]].  Lemuria sank gradually and was eventually destroyed by incessantly erupting volcanoes.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-215. (Ch. 33. "The Earth: The third root-race: Lemurian.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was thought by geologists that the [[Age of the Earth|age of the earth]] was only about 200 million years (because [[radioactive dating]] had not yet come into use), so the [[geological epoch]]s were believed to have occurred at a much later time than is thought to be the case today.  According to traditional Theosophy, the Lemurian root race began 34½ million years ago, in the middle of what was then believed to be the [[Jurassic]]; thus, the people of Lemuria coexisted with the [[dinosaur]]s. The Lemurian race was much taller and bigger than our current race.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} The first three subraces of the Lemurians reproduced by laying eggs, but the fourth subrace, beginning 16½ million years ago, began to reproduce like modern humans.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"/&gt; As Lemuria was slowly submerged due to volcanic eruptions, the Lemurians colonized the areas surrounding Lemuria, i.e. Africa, Southern India and the East Indies. The descendants of the Lemurian root race, according to traditional Theosophy, include the [[Capoid race]], the [[Bantu people|Congoid race]], the [[Dravidians]], and the [[Australoid race]].

===The fourth root race (Atlantean)===
This race inhabited Atlantis.

====Subraces of the Atlantean root race====

The fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 219-224. Ch. 35. "The fourth (Atlantean) root-race: The Rmoahal".&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace, [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Chankshusha Manu]], which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north.  The esoteric name of [[Atlantis]] is ''Kusha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 55-59. (Ch. 11. "Races and Sub-races".)&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantean root race had [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the [[Color terminology for race|red]] [[American Indian race|American Indian]], [[Color terminology for race|brown]] [[Malayan race|Malayan]], and [[Color terminology for race|yellow]] [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were
#the Rmoahal
#the Tlavati ([[Cro-Magnon]]s)
#the [[Toltec]] (a term which Theosophists use as a synonym for the Atlantean ancestors of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]])
#the [[Turanian]]
#the original [[Semites]] (i.e. [[Phoenicians]])
#the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]]s, and
#the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]], which migrated to and colonized [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]].

The descendants of the Atlanteans according to traditional Theosophy include those of the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]], the [[Malayan race]], and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian race]] as well as some people of what in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was called the "[[Olive skin|olive-skinned]]" [[Mediterranean race]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-36"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 25-26. (Ch. 36. "The second Atlantean sub-race: the Tlavatli".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-39"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 252-263. (Ch. 39. "Ancient Peru: A Toltec remnant".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-40"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 264-265. (Ch. 40. "The fourth Atlantean sub-race: the Turanian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-41"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 266-276. (Ch. 41. "A Turanian : Chaldae, B.C. 19,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-42"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 276-278. (Ch. 42. "The fifth Atlantean sub-race: the original Semites".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-43"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 279-280. (Ch. 43. "The sixth Atlantean sub-race: the Akkadian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-44"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 281. (Ch. 44. "The seventh Atlantean sub-race: the Mongolian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-45"/&gt;

====The civilization of Atlantis====
{{anchor|civil-atl}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maitreya (Theosophy)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Atlantis}}

During the long period of time when Atlantis was ruled by the Toltecs (the ancestors of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Amerindians]]), the civilization of Atlantis was at its height. This was the period between about 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, called the ''[[Golden Age]] of Atlantis''. The Atlanteans had many luxuries and conveniences. Their capital city was called ''The City of the Golden Gates''. At its height, it had two million inhabitants. There were extensive [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s leading to the city from a mountain lake. The Atlanteans had [[airship]]s powered by the [[vril]] that could seat two to eight people. The [[economic system]] was [[Socialism|socialist]] like that of the [[Incas]]. Atlanteans were the first to develop organized warfare. The military deployed vril-powered air battleships that contained 50 to 100 fighting men. These air battleships deployed [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] bombs. The [[infantry]] fired fire-tipped arrows. The Toltecs on Atlantis worshipped the [[Sun worship|Sun]] in temples as grand as those of [[ancient Egypt]] that were decorated in bright colors. The sacred word used in [[meditation]] was [[Tau]] (this was the equivalent of the Aryan sacred word [[Om]]). As noted above, the Toltecs colonized all of North America and South America and thus became the people we know as the Amerindians.&lt;ref name=Powell-37&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 227-236. (Ch. 37. "The Third Atlantean Subrace: The Toltec".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell-38&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 237-251. (Ch. 38. "The Civilization of Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The downfall of Atlantis started when some of the Toltecs began to practice [[black magic]] about 850,000 BC, corrupted by the dragon "Thevetat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations | first=Joscelyn | last=Godwin | publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co | year=2010 | isbn=1594772622 | page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remembered as [[Devadatta]], the opponent of [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Five Years of Theosophy | editor=George Robert Snow Mead | publisher=Echo Library | year=2007 | isbn=1406815284 | page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people began to become selfish and [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. Soon thereafter, the Turanians (the ancestors of the people we now know as the [[Turkic peoples]]) became dominant in much of Atlantis. The Turanians continued the practice of black magic which reached its height about 250,000 BC and continued until the final sinking of Atlantis, although they were opposed by [[Magic (paranormal)|white magic]]ians. The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] incarnated as the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC to oppose the black magicians.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 127-137. (Ch. 9 "Black Magic in Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The black magicians used [[magical spell]]s to breed human-animal [[Chimera (genetics)#Chimeras in research|chimeras]] to use as [[sex slave]]s. They also had an army composed of chimeras that were composites composed of a human body with the heads of fierce predators such as lions, tigers and bears, that ate enemy corpses on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"/&gt; The war between the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians continued until the end of Atlantis. The [[Ascended master|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] [[telepathy|telepathically]] warned their disciples (the white magicians) to flee Atlantis in ships while there was still time to get out before the final [[wiktionary:Cataclysm|cataclysm]]. As noted above, the final sudden submergence of Atlantis due to earthquakes occurred in 9,564 BC .&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt;

==={{anchor|aryas}}The fifth root race (Aryan)&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] [[Aryan]] --&gt;===

====Early beginnings of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky asserted humanity was in the fifth root race, the [[Aryan race]], which Theosophists believe to have emerged from the previous fourth root race (Atlantean root race) beginning about 100,000 years ago in Atlantis.  (According to Powell, when Madame Blavatsky stated the Aryan root race was 1,000,000 years old, she meant that the [[soul]]s of the people that later physically incarnated as the first Aryans about 100,000 years ago began to incarnate in the bodies of Atlanteans 1,000,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Powell-37/&gt; However, another way of interpreting this is that Nature began to create the Aryan race before the final cataclysms.) Theosophists believe the Aryan root race was physically progenerated by the [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Vaivasvatu Manu]], one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].  The present-day ethnic group most closely related to the new race is the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]].  The small band of only 9,000 people constituting the then small Aryan root race migrated out of Atlantis in 79,797 BC. The [[bard]]s of the new [[White people|white]] root-race poetically referred to the new race as being ''moon-colored''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. and Besant, Annie ''Main: Whence, How, and Whither?'' Wheaton, Illinois:1913 Theosophical Press Pages 249-254&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of these Aryan migrants from Atlantis split from the main body of migrants and went south to the shore of an inland sea in what was then a verdant and lush [[Sahara]] where they founded the "City of the Sun". The main body of migrants continued onwards to an island called the "white island" in the middle of what was then an inland sea in what is now the [[Gobi desert]], where they established the "City of the Bridge".&lt;ref name="Powell-45"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 282-286. (Ch. 45. "The Beginnings of the Fifth (Aryan) Root Race".)&lt;/ref&gt; (The "City of the Bridge" was constructed directly below the [[Etheric plane|etheric]] city called [[Shamballa]] where Theosophists believe the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells; thus, the ongoing evolution of the Aryan root race has been divinely guided by the being Theosophists call "The Lord of the World".)

The esoteric name of the whole of the present land surface of Earth, i.e. the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]], the Americas, the Australian continent and Antarctica taken as a whole is ''Krauncha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

Generally speaking, a large percentage of the people who live in the time of the period of the fifth root race are part of the fifth root race. However Blavatsky also opines that some [[Semitic peoples]] have become "degenerate in spirituality".  She asserted that some peoples descended from the Lemurians are "semi-animal creatures".  These latter include "the [[Tasmanian Aborigines|Tasmanians]], a portion of the [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]] and a mountain tribe in China." There are also "considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the [[Veddhas]] of [[Ceylon]], most of the remaining [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]], [[Bushmen]], [[Negritos]], [[Andaman Islanders]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. 2, p. 195f.&lt;/ref&gt; All these aforementioned groups mentioned by Blavatsky except the purported "wild men of Borneo" (not to be confused with the famous circus duo, the [[Wild Men of Borneo]]) are part of what was in the late 19th and most of the 20th century was called the [[Australoid race]] (except for the [[Bushmen]], part of the [[Capoid race]]), both of which races, as noted above, were believed by traditional Theosophists to have been descended from the Lemurians.

====Subraces of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky described the fifth root race with the following words: ''"The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock&amp;nbsp;– the Fifth Root-Race&amp;nbsp;– and spring from one single progenitor'',&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', vol. 2, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; which Hindus call [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]. Theosophists believe that each root race has a separate and distinct progenitor.

The subraces of the Aryan Fifth Root Race include the first subrace, the [[Indo-Aryans|Hindu]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" on the white island in the middle of the Gobi inland sea to [[India]] in 60,000 BC; the second subrace, the [[Arabs|Arabian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Arabia]] in 40,000 BC; the third subrace, the [[Iranian peoples|Persian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Persia]] in 30,000 BC; the fourth subrace, the [[Celts]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Western Europe]] beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Mycenaeans|Mycenaean Greeks]] are regarded as an offshoot of the Celtic subrace that colonized Southeast Europe); and the fifth subrace, the [[Teutons|Teutonic]], which also migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to what is now Germany beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Slav]]s are regarded as an offshoot of the Teutonic subrace that colonized Russia and surrounding areas).&lt;ref name="Powell-50"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 308-316. (Ch. 50. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Keltic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-46"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 287-289. (Ch. 46. "The City of the Bridge".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-47"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 290-294. (Ch. 47. "The first Aryan sub-race: The Hindu, B.C. 60,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-48"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 295-301. (Ch. 48. "The second Aryan sub-race: The Arabian, B.C. 40,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-49"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 302-307. (Ch. 49. "The third Aryan sub-race: The Iranian, B.C. 30,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-51"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 317-320. (Ch. 51. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Teutonic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The emergence of the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race====

According to Blavatsky the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will begin to evolve in the area of the United States in the early 21st century.  This sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will be called the ''Australo-American subrace'' and is believed by Theosophists to be now arising from the Teutonic subrace of the Aryan root race in Australia and in the Western United States (many individuals of the new subrace will be born in [[California]]) and its surrounding nearby areas (i.e., the Australo-American subrace is in arising from the [[European Americans|Anglo-American]], [[English Canadians|Anglo-Canadian]], [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Australian]] and presumably also the [[New Zealand European|Anglo-New Zealander]] [[ethnic group]]s).&lt;ref name="Powell-52"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 326-330. (Ch. 52 "The Aryan Sixth Sub-Race").&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth or Australo-American sub-race will "possess certain [[psychic powers]], and for this the [[pituitary body]] will be developed, thus giving an additional sense, that of cognising [[Aura (paranormal)|astral emotions]] in the ordinary waking consciousness. We may say that in general the sixth sub-race will bring in wisdom and intuition, blending all that is best in the intelligence of the fifth subrace and the emotion of the fourth."&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

===The sixth root race===

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], a colony will be established in [[Baja California]] by the [[Theosophical Society]] under the guidance of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the 28th century for the intensive selective [[Eugenics|eugenic]] breeding of the sixth root race.  The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] will physically incarnate in order to be the [[Manu (Theosophy)|Manu]] ("progenitor") of this new root race.&lt;ref name="Besant-353"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 353-495.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the world will be powered by [[nuclear power]] and there will be a single [[world government]] led by a person who will be the reincarnation of [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="Besant-353"/&gt; Tens of thousands of years in the future, a new continent will arise in the Pacific Ocean that will be the future home of the sixth root race.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 330-347. (Ch. 54. "The sixth and seventh root-races.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]] west of the [[San Andreas Fault]] will break off from the mainland of North America and become the [[Island of California]] off the eastern coast of the new continent.&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

====Subraces of the sixth root race====

[[Victor Skumin]] proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), the sixth root race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V.

The seventh root race will arise from the seventh subrace of the sixth root race on the future continent that the sixth root race will be living on that will arise from the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt; The continent they will inhabit is esoterically called ''[[Pushkara]]''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

==Migration to Mercury==

It is believed by some [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]] that after the present [[Round (Theosophy)|round]] of human spiritual evolution by reincarnation of [[soul]]s in root races is completed several dozen million years from now, the human race will migrate to the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to continue its spiritual and physical evolution.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophical belief in the brotherhood of humanity==

Modern writers within theosophy or influenced by theosophy defend Blavatsky's use of the terms Aryan race and root race as "not connected to demagogic ideas".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They say{{who|date=September 2014}} that the classification of humanity into races is still practiced today and that Blavatsky and subsequent [[esoteric]] philosophers who expressed similar lines of thought intended a Universal Brotherhood of humanity. Yet root race philosophy is not void of directly biologically racial elements.

Blavatsky promulgated her ideology in a layered, multidimensional style and way, and paradoxical truth was key to her metaphysics. Seemingly paradoxical statements underpin root race theoretic philosophy existing beyond bifurcations of "liberal" or "illiberal" notions. Blavatsky wrote that, while "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence"&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy'', Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;—nevertheless, in ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky posits: "Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence." The interrelationship between spirituality and root race developmental history is nonlinear and complex. Thus: "Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (The Chinese, Africans, etc.,.) gradually brought the worship back." &lt;ref name="doctrine"&gt;Blavatsky, Helena, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol. 2, Page  294. [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd2-1-17.htm Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is "To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=Section 3}}

Cranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind.{{sfn|Cranston|1995|p=400}} {{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|loc=Stanza IX}}

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}
{{clear}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

===Traction===
Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}
{{clear}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

==In fiction and legend==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

[[Image:Sabling the Champagne bottle.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Sabrage: Sabering the champagne bottle]]
'''Sabrage''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|ʒ}} is a technique for opening a champagne bottle with a [[saber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2010/10/27/wine-101-the-art-of-sabering/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amy | last=Ma | title=Wine 101: The Art of Sabering | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for ceremonial occasions. The wielder slides the saber along the body of the bottle to break the top of the neck away, leaving the neck of the bottle open and ready to pour. The force of the blunt side of the blade hitting the lip breaks the glass to separate the collar from the neck of the bottle. One does not use the sharp side of the blade. The cork and collar remain together after separating from the neck.

== History==
The technique became popular in France when the army of [[Napoleon]] visited many of the aristocratic domains. It was just after the [[French Revolution]] and the saber was the weapon of choice of Napoleon's light cavalry (the [[Hussar#Hussars of the Napoleonic Wars|Hussar]]s). Napoleon's spectacular victories across all Europe gave them plenty of reason to celebrate. During these parties the cavalry would open the champagne with their sabers. Napoleon, who was known to have said, "Champagne! In victory one deserves it; in defeat one needs it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wineintro.com/champagne/quotes.html|title=Lisa Shea's WineIntro – Basic Wine Tips, FAQS, Information|work=''wineintro.com''|accessdate=23 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922095844/http://www.wineintro.com/champagne/quotes.html|archivedate=22 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have encouraged this.

There are many stories about this tradition. One of the more spirited tales is that of [[Madame Clicquot]], who had inherited her husband's small champagne house at the age of 27. She used to entertain Napoleon's officers in her vineyard, and as they rode off in the early morning with their complimentary bottle of champagne, they would open it with their saber to impress the rich young widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Sabrage|url=http://www.theartofsabrage.com/|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US| number = US8376161| status = patent| title = Novelty associated with beverages| gdate = 19 February 2013| fdate = 2010-08-09| invent1 = Golden, Andrew P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Champagne sword==
[[Image:Champagne sword.jpg|thumb|250px|A champagne sword]]
A champagne sword (''sabre à champagne'') is an instrument specially made for sabrage. Some swords have short blades, around {{convert|30|cm|in|0}} long&lt;ref name="sabreachampagne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabreachampagne.com/products.html |title=Sabre à Champagne Selection |publisher=SabreaChampagne.Com |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resemble large knives, although others have longer blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champagner-saebel.de/english/index.html |title=WKC Champagne Sword |publisher=WKC|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side of the blade used should be blunt—a sharpened edge is unnecessary because in sabrage it is the impact that is important.&lt;ref name="sabreachampagne" /&gt; If using a sword with a sharp blade then the flat blunt back of the blade is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.champagnesword.co.uk |title=www.champagnesword.co.uk |author=The Champagne Lounge Ltd |year=2014 |accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A champagne [[bottle]] can be opened with a spatula using the same method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

The bottle neck is held at an angle of approximately 20 degrees and the [[sword]] is cast down on it. The experienced ''[[sommelier]]'' can open the bottle with little loss of champagne. However, it is advised to allow a small flow in order to wash away any loose shards of glass that may be adhering to the neck. The first glass poured should also be checked for small glass shards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

==Physics==
A champagne bottle holds a considerable amount of pressure. With early designs, bottles tended to explode and the manufacturers kept making them thicker until they could contain the pressure caused by the release of [[carbon dioxide]] during the secondary fermentation. The inside pressure of a typical champagne bottle is around {{convert|620|kPa}}. The diameter of the opening is {{convert|18|mm}}, so there is a force of about {{convert|160|N}} trying to push the cork out of the bottle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the opening of the bottle, there is a lip that creates a [[stress concentration]]. On the vertical seam of the bottle there is a thin, faintly visible, prepared seam, which creates a second stress concentration. At the intersection of the seam and the lip, both stress concentrations combine and the strength of the glass is reduced by more than fifty percent. The impact of the saber on this weak point creates a crack that rapidly propagates through the glass, fueled by the momentum of the saber and the pressure in the bottle. Once the crack has severed the top from the bottle, the pressure inside the bottle and the transferred momentum from the saber will send the top flying, typically for a distance of {{convert|5|-|10|m}}.

==Records==
The greatest number of champagne bottles sabered in one minute to be officially recognized by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] is 66 and was achieved by Ashrita Furman (USA) at the Sri Chinmoy Centre, [[Jamaica, Queens]], on 2 August 2015.{{fact|date=February 2018}} Ashrita used an "Arabian sabre" with a 13-inch blade. He beat the previous record of 47 held by Mirko Rainer, who managed this feat on 6 September 2014 in [[Mendrisio, Switzerland]].{{fact|date=February 2018}} 

The greatest number of champagne bottles sabered simultaneously was 630. It was officially recognised a world record by an occasion of the Sciabolata del Santero in Santo Stefano Belbo in Italy on June 2016.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Accidia).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Acedia in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].]]

'''Sloth''' is one of the [[seven capital sins]]. It is the most difficult sin to define, and to credit as sin, since it refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-930390-81-4|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One definition is: a habitual disinclination to exertion or laziness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sloth?s=t|title=the definition of sloth|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning the virtue of work to support society and further God's plan suggest that on the contrary, through inactivity, one invites sin. "For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do." ("Against Idleness and Mischief" by [[Isaac Watts]]).

== Definition ==
The word "sloth" is a translation of the Latin term ''[[acedia]]'' (Middle English, ''accidie'') and means "without care". Spiritually, ''acedia'' first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to [[God]]. Mentally, ''acedia'', has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, ''acedia'' is fundamentally  with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in [[laziness]], idleness, and indolence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two commentators consider the most accurate translation of ''acedia'' to be "self-pity," for it "conveys both the melancholy of the condition and self-centeredness upon which it is founded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kurtz |first1=Ernest |last2=Ketcham |first2=Katherine |title=Experiencing Spirituality: Finding Meaning Through Storytelling |accessdate=May 15, 2014|publisher=Tarcher Perigee |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholicism ===
In his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] defined sloth as "sorrow about spiritual good" and as "sluggishness of the mind which neglects to begin good... [it] is evil in its effect, if it so oppresses man as to draw him away entirely from good deeds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3035.htm |title=The Summa Theologica II-II.Q35.A1 (Sloth) |publisher=New Advent |edition=1920, Second and Revised |author=Thomas Aquinas}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', "acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness."&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2094|long=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth includes ignoring the seven gifts of grace given by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]] ([[wisdom]], [[understanding]], [[counsel]], [[knowledge]], [[piety]], [[Courage|fortitude]], and [[fear of the Lord]]);  such disregard may lead to the slowing of  spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of [[charity (practice)|charity]] towards the [[neighbourhood|neighbour]], and to animosity towards those who love God.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sin and Its Consequences|last=Manning|first=Henry Edward|author-link=Henry Edward Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khsTAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Burns and Oates|year=1874|isbn=|location=London|pages=40,103–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other capital sins,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in which the sinner commits immoral acts,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} sloth is a sin of omission of desire and/or performance. It may arise from any of the other [[capital vices]]; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a [[mortal sin]], the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Orthodoxy ===
In the [[Philokalia]], the word ''[[depression (mood)|dejection]]'' is used instead of ''sloth,'' for the person who falls into dejection will lose interest in life.

=== Buddhism ===
It is also one of the [[five hindrances]] in [[Buddhism]].

=== Others ===
Sloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do, though the understanding of the sin in antiquity was that this laziness or lack of work was simply a symptom of the vice of apathy or indifference, particularly an apathy or boredom with God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desiringgod.org/messages/lazy-busy&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}

Emotionally and cognitively, the evil of ''acedia'' finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. ''Acedia'' takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From ''tristitia'', asserted Gregory the Great, "there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair..." [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], too, dealt with this attribute of ''acedia'', counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and ''wrawnesse'', the last variously translated as "anger" or better as "peevishness". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. ''Acedia''  in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1989|isbn=9780930390815|location=|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders man in his righteous undertakings and becomes a path to ruin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to [[Peter Binsfeld]]'s ''Binsfeld's Classification of Demons'', [[Belphegor]] is the chief demon of the sin Sloth.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, By Rosemary Guiley, p. 28-29, Facts on File, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Statute of the Jewry''' was a [[statute]] issued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1275. It placed a number of restrictions on [[Jews]] of [[England]], most notably outlawing the practice of [[usury]].&lt;ref name="Prestwich"&gt;Prestwich, Michael. Edward I p 345 (1997) Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Since the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by [[Christian]]s was banned by the [[Catholic Church]] at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as [[moneylenders]] and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace,&lt;ref&gt; Rubenstein, W.D. A History of the Jews p 36 (1996) Macmillan Press. {{ISBN|0-333-55833-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which added to the increasing [[antisemitic]] sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the [[gentile]] population.

When Edward returned from the [[Crusades]] in 1274, two years after his accession as [[King of England]], he found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders.

As special direct subjects of the [[King of England|monarch]], Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in [[Wales]], which commenced in 1277. One theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275.&lt;ref name="Prestwich" /&gt;

==Provisions==
* Usury was outlawed in every form.
* Debtors of Jews were no longer liable for certain debts.
* Jews were not allowed to live outside certain cities and towns.
* Any Jew above the age of seven had to wear a [[yellow badge]] of felt on his or her outer clothing, six inches by three inches.
* All Jews from the age of 12 on had to pay a special tax of three pence annually.
* Christians were forbidden to live among Jews.
* Jews were licensed to buy farmland to make their living for the next 15 years.
* Jews could thenceforth make a living in England only as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers.

The licence to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many.&lt;ref&gt; Glassman, David. Anti-Semitic Stereotypes p 17 (1975) Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0-8143-1545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen years had passed, it was discovered that Jews widely but secretly continued to practise usury, leading Edward I to issue the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, James. The Jew in the Medieval Community p 394 (1976) Hermon Press. {{ISBN|0-87203-059-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steve Sabella''' ({{lang-ar|ستيف سابيلا}}), born (May 19, 1975) in [[Jerusalem]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is a [[Berlin]]-based artist who uses [[photography]] and photographic installation as his principle modes of expression, and author of the award-winning memoir, ''[[the parachute paradox|The Parachute Paradox]]'', published by Kerber Verlag in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parachute Paradox|url=https://www.kerberverlag.com/en/the-parachute-paradox.html|website=Kerber Verlag|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sabella Wikipedia page, Awards section&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabella has shown his work internationally, at institutions and exhibitions such as [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]], [[Rencontres d'Arles]], Houston FotoFest, [[Arab World Institute]], The Bumiller Collection Berlin, and the International Center for Photography Scavi Scaligeri, which hosted his first institutional retrospective in 2014. As a winner of the 2008 Ellen Auerbach prize, his first artist monograph ''Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014'' was published by [[Hatje Cantz Verlag|Hatje Cantz]] and the [[Akademie der Künste]], Berlin in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014|url=http://www.hatjecantz.de/steve-sabella-6142-1.html|website=Hatje Cantz|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and education==
Sabella first began studying at the [[Naggar School of Photography]] in Jerusalem, receiving a degree in Art Photography in 1997. In 2007, he received a BA in Visual Arts from the [[State University of New York]].

While living in Jerusalem, Sabella worked as both an artist and commissioned photographer. Hired by the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNRWA]] and many other aid organizations, he was one of the few photographers with complete access to the [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and Jerusalem during the [[Second Intifada]], which had drastically limited the mobility of Palestinians. In 2005, he was listed as one of Pillars Magazine’s most established brands in Palestine. The same year, Sabella and one of his colleagues were taken hostage in Gaza, abducted by the family of a Palestinian security officer kidnapped by the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. He was released unharmed, after several hours of holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Australian, Palestinian kidnapped in Gaza"|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/australian-palestinian-kidnapped-in-gaza-1.1180664|website=Irish Times|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Sabella established the Palestine Photo Bank, an online image archive formed with the mission of promoting and supporting a positive picture of Palestine and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Palestine Image &amp; Photo Bank Mission Statement"|url=https://archive.palestinephotobank.com/page1|website=The Palestine Photo Bank|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabella moved from Palestine to [[London]] in 2007, and began to focus solely on his art career. He completed an MA in Photographic Studies from the [[University of Westminster]] in 2008, and an MA in Art Business from [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]] in 2009. In 2010, he moved to Berlin, where he is currently based.

==Visual Art==
Sabella has utilized large-scale photography, photographic collage, and mixed media in his visual practice. Irrespective of the method or medium, he considers his visual works as a form of research into the genealogy of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Unlocking Visual Codes"|url=http://stevesabella.com/Unlocking-Visual-Codes-Steve-Sabella-Palestine-Art-Talk-2015.pdf|website=Steve Sabella Artist Website|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than something that bears an indexical reference to the world, Sabella sees the photographic image as containing and producing its own form of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sabella |first=Steve |editor-last=von Roques |editor-first=Karin Adrian |title=Archaeology of the Future |publisher=Maretti Editore |date= 2014 |pages=43–51 |chapter="Archaeology of the Future"|isbn=978-8-898-85510-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that the creation of these alternate realities can be utilized politically, both as a means to foreclose or liberate the collective imagination—specifically in regards to [[Israeli-occupied territories|
Israel’s occupation of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Unlocking Visual Codes"|url=http://stevesabella.com/Unlocking-Visual-Codes-Steve-Sabella-Palestine-Art-Talk-2015.pdf|website=Steve Sabella Artist Website|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring themes in Sabella's work==

=== Archaeology ===

[[File:Steve Sabella - Till The End.jpg|thumb|left|''Till the End'' (2004)]]

Throughout his artistic practice, Sabella has created works concerned with the construction of visual history, investigating the role of the image in this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yale Preston |first=Madeline |editor-last=Faruqi |editor-first=Samar |title=Steve Sabella: Independence |publisher=Meem Editions |date= 2014 |pages=1–7 |chapter="Free-Falling Into the Future: In Conversation with Steve Sabella" |isbn=978-1-907-05138-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has often drawn parallels between his artwork and the field of [[archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sabella |first=Steve |editor-last=von Roques |editor-first=Karin Adrian |title=Archaeology of the Future |publisher=Maretti Editore |date= 2014 |pages=43–51 |chapter="Archaeology of the Future"|isbn=978-8-898-85510-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in practice and theory: some of his photo-collages are partly composed by continuously removing layers of photographic visuals; other artworks have been printed on stones and paint fragments, appearing as ancient artifacts. Regarding the ''38 Days of Re-Collection'' series, consisting of photographs printed on fragments of paint scraped from the walls of Jerusalem’s [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], the scholar [[Ella Shohat]] wrote, “Scraping thus becomes both an act of excavation of the buried substrata of forgotten lives, as well as a means to visualise lives once again intermingled.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shohat |first=Ella |editor-last=Bruckstein Çoruh |editor-first=A.S.  |title=Fragments From Our Beautiful Future |publisher=Kerber Verlag |date= 2017 |pages=62–64 |chapter=“An Aesthetics of Dis/Placement: Steve Sabella’s 38 Days of Re-Collection”|isbn=978-3-735-60375-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exile, the Palestinian experience &amp; the colonization of the imagination ===

Critics of Sabella's work have often noted and discussed the themes of exile and the Palestinian experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halasa|first1=Malu|title=Layers|date=September 2014|publisher=Contemporary Art Practices (CAP)|url=http://stevesabella.com/Beyond-Palestine-Malu-Halasa-Layers-Catalogue-2014.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks like ''Settlement - Six Israelis &amp; One Palestinian'' and ''38 Days of Re-Collection'' bear more explicit connotations of Sabella’s birthplace in their content and media, but the themes of diaspora and occupation are also suggested by the titles of his series such as ''In Exile'' and ''Independence''.

In 2014 Sabella stated, "All we need is the imagination to find who we are and what we are searching for. It is the responsibility of the individual to stand up and free him or herself from the new form of colonization that people are affected by yet are unaware of, the colonization of the imagination. Palestinians do not need the UN, the EU, the United States or any other country in the world, and especially not Israel, to declare to them that they are free. We are all born free. Every Palestinian should wake up today and say –– I am a free person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sabella|first1=Steve|title=A Declaration of Independence|url=http://stevesabella.com/Declaration-of-Independence-August-18-2014.pdf|website=Steve Sabella|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:38 Days of Re-Collection, Steve Sabella (2014) (kitchen).jpg|thumb|''38 Days of Re-Collection'' (2014)]]

In the artist’s monograph, [[Hubertus von Amelunxen]] wrote, ”Steve Sabella is a Palestinian, born in Jerusalem in 1975 … Although he still has the privilege of being able to return, he chose exile, and art teaches him to grasp exile in its distorting and destructive consequences, which leads to an existence that is marked by a driven search and borders on disintegration. His art is an art of understanding; it is poetic and suppresses neither expulsion nor salvation. It keeps to the path and forms a bridge — it is the bridge.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amelunxen|first1=Hubertus von|title=Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014 |date=2014 |publisher=Hatje Cantz |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-7757-3767-8 |page=36 |edition=1 |url=http://stevesabella.com/monograph.html |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of his artistic career, Sabella has experimented and played upon the traditions of the photographic medium: his 1997 series ''Search'' was shot on infrared film; ''Kan Yama Kan'' (2005) and ''Settlement - Six Israelis &amp; One Palestinian'' (2008-2010) both reconfigure photographs to be viewed through installation; photographs in his works ''Till the End'' (1997) and ''38 Days of Re-Collection'' (2014) are printed on stones and fragments of paint, respectively. Sabella’s photo-collages such as ''Euphoria'' (2010) and ''Metamorphosis'' (2012) have elicited comparisons to the medium of painting; in this respect, the artist and historian [[Kamal Boullata]] has written, “Over the last decade [Sabella] has been using his camera as a painter uses his brush... A few decades ago, that is, long before globalization permeated all fields of cultural expression in our world, I wrote on the evolution of Palestinian painting following the country's national catastrophe in 1948. I documented how painters living at home or as refugees in the proximity of the homeland have universally employed a representational language of expression. The further away they lived, the more they engaged in abstraction. At the time, I never imagined such a phenomenon could possibly manifest itself in the field of photography.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boullata|first1=Kamal von|title=Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014|date=2014|publisher=Hatje Cantz|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-7757-3767-8 |page=6 |edition=1 |url=http://stevesabella.com/monograph.html |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Musicality ===

[[File:Steve Sabella Sinopia Detail 2014.png|thumb|left|''Sinopia'' (detail) (2014) by Steve Sabella]]

The variation in formal rhythm and tone in many of Sabella’s photo-collages, as well as the theme running throughout his work of divergent voices being placed in dialogue, has prompted Hubertus von Amelunxen to relate musical concepts to his oeuvre. In ''Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014'', von Amelunxen draws connections to notions of [[counterpoint]], and writes specifically on Sabella’s work ''Sinopia'', which collages photographs of the skyline of [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]], “The city, photographed at dawn and during the day, is reflected along the central axis, the sea and sky indistinguishable from one another and the skyline, appearing out of the mist of dawn, retracting and then rising up again, reverberates at different pitches. Through visual reiteration, shadowy high-rises, a sound pattern emerges…”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amelunxen|first1=Hubertus von|title=Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014|date=2014|publisher=Hatje Cantz|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-7757-3767-8|page=201|edition=1|url=http://stevesabella.com/monograph.html|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabella has also collaborated with musicians. In 2014, he commissioned the jazz ensemble The Khoury Project to interpret the visual form of his ''Sinopia'' skyline collage as a waveform, and create an electroacoustic composition that also sampled audio from locations in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekhouryproject.com/album/sinopia/ |title="Sinopia.

The first monograph of the artist's work, ''Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014'', was published by [[Hatje Cantz Verlag|Hatje Cantz]] in collaboration with the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, in 2014. Its core texts are written by Hubertus von Amelunxen, with a foreword by Kamal Boullata. Hatje Cantz states that the book, "reads time and history out of the photographs and thus describes the genesis of Sabella’s photographic oeuvre under the aspects of exile, identity, migration, and the divided topologies of the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014|url=http://www.hatjecantz.de/steve-sabella-6142-1.html|website=Hatje Cantz|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was granted the best memoir prize of the 2017 Eric Hoffer Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Hoffer Award|url=http://www.hofferaward.com/Eric-Hoffer-Award-winners.html#.WSwoUcaB3XQ|publisher=Eric Hoffer Award|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 [[Nautilus Book Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nautilus Book Award|url=http://www.nautilusbookawards.com|publisher=Nautilus Book Award|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a finalist for the 2017 International Book Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Book Awards|url=http://www.internationalbookawards.com|publisher=The International Book Awards|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Artist's Curse'' ===

On September 21, 2017, Sabella began publishing his new book project, The Artist’s Curse.

'''Tarring and feathering''' is a form of public torture and humiliation used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in [[early modern Europe|feudal Europe]] and [[European colonialism|its colonies]] in the [[early modern period]], as well as the early [[American frontier]], mostly as a type of [[Lynching|mob vengeance]]. Awareness of [[tarring and feathering in popular culture]] remains.

The victim would be stripped naked, or stripped to the waist. Hot [[Wood tar|tar]] was then either poured or painted onto the person while they were immobilized. Then the victim either had [[feathers]] thrown on them or was rolled around on a pile of feathers so that they stuck to the tar.

The image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a [[metaphor]] for severe public criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tar%20and%20feather |title=Tar and Feather. The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1997-05-26 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}
{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tars |title=Tars. The Free Online Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}} "To criticize severely and devastatingly; excoriate." ("[[:wikt:excoriate|to excoriate]]" [i.e. "to flay"] being itself a similar type of metaphor).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of the punishment appears in orders that [[Richard I of England]] issued to his navy on starting for the [[Holy Land]] in 1189. "Concerning the lawes and ordinances appointed by King Richard for his navie the forme thereof was this ... item, a thiefe or felon that hath stolen, being lawfully convicted, shal have his head shorne, and boyling pitch poured upon his head, and feathers or downe strawed upon the same whereby he may be knowen, and so at the first landing-place they shall come to, there to be cast up" (transcript of original statute in ''[[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s Voyages'', ii. 21).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/richard.asp Tha Avalon Project documents] Accessed on 23rd June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A later instance of this penalty appears in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' (series 4, vol. v), which quotes [[James Howell]] writing in Madrid in 1623 of the "boisterous [[Bishop of Halberstadt]] ... having taken a place where there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers feather beds to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} (The Bishop was apparently [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick]].)

In 1696, a London [[bailiff]] attempted to serve process on a [[debtor]] who had taken refuge within the precincts of the [[Liberties of the Savoy|Savoy]]. The bailiff was tarred and feathered and taken in a wheelbarrow to [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he was tied to a [[maypole]] that stood by what is now [[Somerset House]] as an improvised [[pillory]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Coming of the American Revolution===
In 1766, Captain William Smith was tarred, feathered, and dumped into the harbor of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] by a mob that included the town's mayor. A vessel picked him out of the water just as his strength was giving out. He survived and was later quoted as saying that they "dawbed my body and face all over with tar and afterwards threw feathers on me." Smith was suspected of informing on smugglers to the British customs agents, as was the case with most other tar-and-feathers victims in the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author="Letters of Governor Francis Fauquier"|title= ''The William and Mary Quarterly''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vikjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|volume=21|year=1912|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice appeared in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1767, when mobs attacked low-level employees of the customs service with tar and feathers. In October 1769, a mob in Boston attacked a customs service sailor the same way, and a few similar attacks followed through 1774. The tarring and feathering of customs worker [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] received particular attention in 1774. Such acts associated the punishment with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] side of the [[American Revolution]]. An exception occurred in March 1775 when a British regiment inflicted the same treatment on Thomas Ditson, a [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] man who attempted to buy a musket from one of the regiment's soldiers. There is no known case of a person dying from being tarred and feathered in this period. During the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], local farmers inflicted the punishment on federal tax agents.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Irvin, "Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776." ''New England Quarterly'' (2003): 197-238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
Beginning on September 11, 1791, western Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against the federal government's taxation on western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. Their first victim was reportedly a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson. He was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Other officials who attempted to serve court warrants on Johnson's attackers were whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Slaughter | first = Thomas P. | title = The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1986 | isbn = 0195051912 }} pages 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], was dragged from his home during the night of March 24, 1832 by a group of men who stripped and beat him before tarring and feathering him. His wife and infant child were knocked from their bed by the attackers and were forced from the home and threatened. (The infant died several days later from exposure.) Smith was left for dead, but limped back to the home of friends. They spent much of the night scraping the tar from his body, leaving his skin raw and bloody. The following day, Smith spoke at a church devotional meeting and was reported to have been covered with raw wounds and still weak from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Life of Joseph Smith from 1831 to 1834#Life in Kirtland, Ohio]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, a [[Know-Nothing]] mob in [[Ellsworth, Maine]] tarred and feathered Swiss-born [[Jesuit]] priest Father [[John Bapst]] in the midst of a local controversy over religious education in grammar schools. Bapst fled Ellsworth to settle in nearby [[Bangor, Maine]], where there was a large [[Irish-Catholic]] community, and a local high school there is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|id=02258a|title=John Bapst|first=Thomas|last=Campbell|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The tarring and feathering of Mrs Lowry.png|thumb|Image accompanying story of "Female Whitecaps Chastise Woman" from Ada Evening News November 27, 1906. The article describes an incident in East Sandy, Pennsylvania where four married women tarred and feathered Mrs. Hattie Lowry.]]
Tarring and feathering was not restricted to men. The November 27, 1906 Ada, Oklahoma ''Evening News'' reports that a vigilance committee consisting of four young married women from East Sandy, Pennsylvania corrected the alleged evil conduct of their neighbor Mrs. Hattie Lowry in [[Whitecapping|whitecap style]]. One of the women was a sister-in-law of the victim. The women appeared at Mrs. Lowry's home in open day and announced that she had not heeded the spokeswoman and leader. Two women held Mrs. Lowry to the floor while the other two smeared her face with stove polish until it was completely covered. They then poured thick molasses upon her head and emptied the contents of a feather pillow over the molasses. The women then marched the victim to a railroad camp, tied by the wrists, where two hundred workmen stopped work to watch the spectacle. After parading Mrs. Lowry through the camp, the women tied her to a large box where she remained until a man released her. Three of the women involved were arrested, pleaded guilty and each paid a $10.00 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026853/1906-11-21/ed-1/seq-7/#date1=11%2F01%2F1906&amp;index=2&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Hattie+Lowry&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=11%2F31%2F1906&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Hattie+Lowry&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 The Abbeville press and banner., November 21, 1906, Image 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
A group of black-robed Knights of Liberty (a faction of the [[KKK]]) tarred and feathered seventeen members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in Oklahoma in 1917, during an incident known as the [[Tulsa Outrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chapman |first=Lee Roy |url=http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/ |title=The Nightmare of Dreamland This Land |date=September 2011 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, vigilantes were opposed to [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] organizers at California's harbor of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]]. They kidnapped at least one organizer, subjected him to tarring and feathering, and left him in a remote location.

The Wednesday, May 28, 1930 edition of the ''Miami Daily News-Record'' contains on its front page the arrests of five brothers (Isaac, Newton, Henry, Gordon and Charles Starns) from Louisiana accused of tarring and feathering Dr. S. L. Newsome, who was a prominent dentist. This was in retaliation for the dentist having an affair with one of the brother's wives.

There were several examples of tarring and feathering of African-Americans in the lead-up to [[World War I]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; According to William Harris, this was a relatively rare form of mob punishment to Republican African-Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal was typically pain and humiliation rather than death.&lt;ref name=harris&gt;Harris, William J. "Etiquette, Lynching, and Racial Boundaries in Southern History: A Mississippi Example". ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. Vol. 100, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 387–410&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, [[anti-German sentiment]] was widespread and many German-Americans were attacked. For example, in August 1918 a German-American farmer, John Meints of Luverne, Minnesota (pictured above), was captured by a group of men, taken to the nearby South Dakota border and tarred and feathered – for allegedly not supporting [[war bond]]s. Meints sued his assailants and lost, but on appeal to a federal court he won, and  in 1922 settled out of court for $6,000.&lt;ref name="startribune.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/blogs/70155507.html |title=Nov. 16, 1919: Tarred and feathered |publisher=StarTribune.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1922, a German-born Catholic priest in Slaton, Texas, Joseph M. Keller, who had been harassed by local residents during World War I due to his ethnicity, was accused of breaking the [[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|seal of confession]] and tarred and feathered. Thereafter Keller served a Catholic parish in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bills|first1=E.

Similar tactics were also used by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) during the early years of [[The Troubles]]. Many of the victims were women accused of sexual relationships with policemen or British soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 13, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/paul-theroux-this-was-england |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |title=This was England |first=Paul |last=Theroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August 2007, [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] groups in Northern Ireland were linked to the tarring and feathering of an individual accused of drug-dealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 28, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6966493.stm |publisher=BBC News Online |location=London |title=Belfast man tarred and feathered |accessdate=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''tensor decomposition''' is any scheme for expressing a [[tensor]] as a sequence of elementary operations acting on other, often simpler tensors. Many tensor decompositions generalize some [[matrix decomposition]]s.

The main tensor decompositions are:
* [[tensor rank decomposition]];
* [[higher-order singular value decomposition]];
* [[Tucker decomposition]];
* [[matrix product state]]s, or tensor trains;
* [[hierarchical Tucker decomposition]]; and
* [[block term decomposition]].

Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:

==Emanation body==
===Indian Buddhism===
One early [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]], the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'', lists the ability to create a “mind-made body” (''manomāyakāya'') as one of the "fruits of the contemplative life".&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiordallis|first1=David|title=Miracles and Superhuman Powers in South Asian Buddhist Literature|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61721/dvf_1.pdf|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=20 September 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423064934/https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61721/dvf_1.pdf|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} Commentarial texts such as the ''[[Patisambhidamagga]]'' and the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' state that this mind-made body is how [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[arhat]]s are able to travel into heavenly realms using the continuum of the mindstream ([[citta-santāna]]) and it is also used to explain the multiplication miracle of the Buddha as illustrated in the ''[[Divyavadana]]'', in which the Buddha multiplied his emanation body ("nirmita") into countless other bodies which filled the sky. A Buddha or other realized being is able to project many such "nirmitas" simultaneously in an infinite variety of forms in different realms simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|125–134}}

The Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th to 5th century CE) defined ''nirmita'' as a [[siddhi]] or psychic power (Pali: ''iddhi'', Skt: ''[[ṛddhi]]'') developed through Buddhist discipline, concentrated discipline (''[[samadhi]]'') and wisdom in his seminal work on Buddhist philosophy, the ''[[Abhidharma-kosa|Abhidharmakośa]]''. [[Asanga]]'s ''Bodhisattvabhūmi'' defines nirmāṇa as a magical illusion and "basically, something without a material basis".&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|130}} The [[Madhyamaka]] school of philosophy sees all reality as empty of essence; all reality is seen as a form of nirmita or magical illusion.&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|158}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
Emanation bodies—nirmanakaya, sprulsku, sprul-pa and so on—are connected to [[trikaya]], the Buddhist doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha. They are usually emanation bodies of celestial beings, though "unrealized beings" such as humans may have their own emanation bodies or even ''be'' emanation bodies.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt; For example, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] is considered by some followers to be an emanation-reincarnation or [[tulku]] of [[Chenrezig]], the Bodhisattva of Compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile|title=The Dalai Lama - Biography and Daily Life|section=Birth to Exile|publisher=The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama|accessdate=October 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019200618/https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile|archivedate=October 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th Dalai Lama mentioned in a public statement that his successor might appear via emanation while the current Dalai Lama is still alive.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt;

==Tulpa==
20th century [[theosophist]]s adapted the concepts of "emanation body"—nirmita, tulku, sprul-pa and others—into the concepts of "tulpa" and "thoughtform".&lt;ref name="Mikles"/&gt; The term “thoughtform” is used as early as 1927 in [[Evans-Wentz]]' translation of the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans-Wentz|first1=W.T.|title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead: Or The After-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane, according to Lāma Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198030517|pages=29-32, 103, 123, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Myrdhin Reynolds in a note to his English translation of the life story of [[Garab Dorje]] defines a ''tulpa'' as “an emanation or a manifestation.”&lt;ref name="Rinpoche"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Dza Patrul|title=The Golden Letters: The Three Statements of Garab Dorje, the First Teacher of Dzogchen|date=1996|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, New York|isbn=9781559390507|page=350|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Alexandra David-Néel===
{{primary|section|reason=Find additional secondary sources that evaluate the content in a critical way.|date=October 2017}}
Belgian-French explorer, spiritualist, and Buddhist [[Alexandra David-Néel]] claimed to have observed these mystical practices in 20th century Tibet.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; She reported tulpas are "magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David-Neel|first1=Alexandra|last2=DʼArsonval|first2=A.|title=Magic and Mystery in Tibet|date=2000|publisher=Book Tree|location=Escondido, California|isbn=1585090972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}} David-Néel wrote that "an accomplished [[Bodhisattva]] is capable of effecting ten kinds of magic creations. The power of producing magic formations, [[tulkus]] or less lasting and materialized tulpas, does not, however, belong exclusively to such mystic exalted beings. Any human, divine or demoniac being may be possessed of it. The only difference comes from the degree of power, and this depends on the strength of the concentration and the quality of the mind itself."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

David-Néel wrote of the tulpa's ability to develop a mind of its own: "Once the tulpa is endowed with enough vitality to be capable of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker's control. This, say Tibetan occultists, happens nearly mechanically, just as the child, when his body is completed and able to live apart, leaves its mother's womb."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|283}} David-Néel claimed to have created a tulpa in the image of a jolly [[Friar Tuck]]-like [[monk]] which later developed a life of its own and had to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Richard|last2=Davis|first2=Monte|last3=Moolman|first3=Valerie|last4=Zappler|first4=George|title=Mysteries of the Unexplained|date=1982|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|location=Pleasantville, NewYork|isbn=0895771462|page=176|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; David-Néel raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: "I may have created my own hallucination", though she reports that others could see the thoughtforms that have been created.&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

===Thoughtform===
[[File:Music of Gounod - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.jpg|thumb|Thought-form of the ''Music of [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'', according to [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]] in ''Thought Forms'' (1901).]]
The [[Western esotericism|Western occult]] understanding of the concept of "thoughtform" is believed by some to have originated as an interpretation of the Tibetan concept of "tulpa".&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; The concept is related to the Western philosophy and practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=David Michael|last2=Ellwood|first2=Taylor|last3=Wagener|first3=Amanda R.|title=Creating Magickal Entities: A Complete Guide to Entity Creation|date=2003|publisher=Egregore Publishing|location=Perrysburg, Ohio|isbn=9781932517446|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} Occultist [[William Walker Atkinson]] in his book ''The Human Aura'' described thought-forms as simple ethereal objects emanating from the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]s surrounding people, generating from their thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panchadsi|first1=Swami|authorlink=William Walker Atkinson|title=The Human Aura: Astral Colors and Thought Forms|date=1912|publisher=Yoga Publication Society|pages=47–54|url=https://borderlandsciences.org/project/aura/ref/panchadasi/ch6.html|accessdate=26 April 2017|chapter=Thought Form|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003151932/https://borderlandsciences.org/project/aura/ref/panchadasi/ch6.html|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further elaborated in ''Clairvoyance and Occult Powers'' how experienced practitioners of the occult can produce thoughtforms from their auras that serve as [[astral projection]]s which may or may not look like the person who is projecting them, or as illusions that can only be seen by those with "awakened astral senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panchadsi|first1=Swami|title=Clairvoyance and Occult Powers|date=1916|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12480/12480.txt|accessdate=26 April 2017|chapter=Strange astral phenomena|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626055033/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12480/12480.txt|archivedate=26 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] Annie Besant, in her book [[Thought-Forms (book)|''Thought-forms'']], divides them into three classes: forms in the shape of the person who creates them, forms that resemble objects or people and may become "ensouled" by "nature spirits" or by the dead, and forms that represent "inherent qualities" from the astral or mental planes, such as emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Besant|first1=Annie|authorlink=Annie Besant|last2=Leadbeater|first2=C.

==Tulpas in modern Western society==
The concept of tulpa was popularized and secularized in the Western world through fiction, gaining popularity on television in the late 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt; In 2009, anonymous posters on the discussion board [[4chan]] started experimenting with creating tulpas, and the community gained popularity through the emergence of the [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|''My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic'' fandom]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nathan|title=Meet the 'Tulpamancers': The Internet's Newest Subculture Is Incredibly Weird|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tulpamancy-internet-subculture-892|website=VICE|accessdate=2017-04-22|language=en-uk|date=2014-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215182444/http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tulpamancy-internet-subculture-892 |archivedate=2016-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist and cognitive scientist Samuel Veissiere wrote that on February 2015 the Reddit forum, which carries most of the tulpamancy conversations in English, had 7740 members, but less than 200 active posters.

These individuals, calling themselves "tulpamancers", treat the tulpas as a "real or somewhat-real person". The number of active participants in these online communities is in the low hundreds, and few meetings in person have taken place. They belong to "primarily urban, middle class, Euro-American adolescent and young adult demographics" and they "cite loneliness and social anxiety as an incentive to pick up the practice." 93.7% of respondents expressed that their involvement with the creation of tulpas has "made their condition better", and led to new unusual sensory experiences. Some practitioners have sexual and romantic interactions with their tulpas, though the practice is controversial and trending towards [[taboo]]. One survey found that 8.5% support a metaphysical explanation of tulpas, 76.5% support a neurological or psychological explanation, and 14% "other" explanations.&lt;ref name="Veissière"/&gt;

In a high-dimensional, human behavioural data set, such as [[Call detail record|mobile phone meta-data]], for each person, there exists potentially thousands of different records. In the case of mobile phone meta-data, [[Card Transaction Data|credit card transaction]] histories and many other types of personal data, this information includes the time and location of an individual. 

In research, unicity is widely used to illustrate the re-identifiability of anonymous data sets. In 2013&lt;ref name="uinc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; researchers from the [[MIT Media Lab]] showed that only 4 points needed to uniquely identify 95% of individual trajectories in a [[De-identification|de-identified]] data set of 1.5 million mobility trajectories. These ''points'' were location-time pairs that appeared with the resolution of 1 hour and 0.15km² to 15km². These results were shown to hold true for credit card transaction data as well&lt;ref name="uins"&gt;{{cite journal

==Measuring unicity==
Unicity (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;) is formally defined as the expected value of the fraction of uniquely identifiable trajectories, given ''p'' points selected from those trajectories uniformly at random. A full computation of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt; of a data set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; requires picking ''p'' points uniformly at random from each trajectory &lt;math&gt;T_i \in D&lt;/math&gt;, and then checking whether or not any other trajectory also contains those ''p'' points. Averaging over all possible sets of ''p'' points for each trajectory results in a value for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually prohibitively expensive&lt;ref name="smartphones"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as it requires considering every possible set of ''p'' points for each trajectory in the data set — trajectories that sometimes contain thousands of points&lt;ref name="uinc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uins"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Instead, unicity is usually estimated using sampling techniques. Specifically, given a data set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, the the estimated unicity is computed by sampling from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; a fraction of the trajectories &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and then checking whether each of the trajectories &lt;math&gt;T_j \in S&lt;/math&gt; are unique in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; given ''p'' randomly selected points from each &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;. The fraction of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that is uniquely identifiable is then the unicity estimate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">'''VERDE (Visualizing Energy Resources Dynamically on the Earth)''' is a visualization and analysis capability of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). The system, developed and maintained by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), provides wide-area situational understanding of the U.S. electric grid. Enabling grid monitoring, weather impacts prediction and analysis, VERDE supports preparedness and response to potentially large outage events. As a real-time geo-visualization capability, it characterizes the dynamic behavior of the grid over interconnects giving views into bulk transmission lines as well as county-level power distribution status. By correlating grid behaviors with cyber events, the platform also enables a method to link cyber-to-infrastructure dependencies.

VERDE integrates different data elements from other available on-line services, databases, and social media. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and other major utilities spanning multiple regions across the electric grid interconnection provide real-time status of their systems. Social media sources such as Twitter provide additional data-sources for visualization and analyses.

The VERDE software, which was developed by the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED) of ORNL, is used outside of the DOE for a number of related national security requirements.

'''Women in Shakespeare''' is a topic within the especially general discussion of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s dramatic and poetic works. Main characters such as [[The Dark Lady#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] have elicited a substantial amount of criticism, which received added impetus during the [[second-wave feminism]] of the 1960s. A considerable number of book-length studies and academic articles investigate the topic, and several [[moons of Uranus]] are named after women in Shakespeare.

In Shakespeare's tragedies and his plays in general, there are several types of female characters. They influence other characters, but are also often underestimated. Women in Shakespearean plays have always had important roles, sometimes the leading role. Whether they are there to change the story or stabilize it, they are there for a reason. Some women are stronger than others, and their effect on the play is different for each one. They often surpass the male heroes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Historiography ==

=== 19th-century criticism ===

[[File:Characteristics of Women – Lady Macbeth.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Lady Macbeth from Anna Jameson's 1832 ''Characteristics of Women'']]
Early criticism of female characters in Shakespeare's drama focused on the positive attributes the dramatist bestows on them and often claimed that Shakespeare realistically captured the "essence" of femininity. [[Helen Zimmern]], in the preface to the English translation of Louis Lewes's study ''The Women of Shakespeare'', argued in 1895 that "of Shakespeare's ''dramatis personae'', his women are perhaps the most attractive, and also, in a sense, his most original creations, so different are they, as a whole, from the ideals of the feminine type prevalent in the literature of his day."&lt;ref&gt;

Lewes himself strikes a similar tone of praise in his conclusion: "The poet's magic wand has laid open the depths of woman's nature, wherein, beside lovely and exquisite emotion, terrible passions play their dangerous and fatal part."&lt;ref&gt;Lewes, ''The Women of Shakespeare'', 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

This early period of women in Shakespeare, which ends in the beginning of the twentieth century, is characterised by a very conventional tone and treatment and the confirmation of [[female submission]]. The editors of a 1983 collection called ''The Woman's Part'', referencing three books by women authors from the 19th century (an authoritative book, ''Shakespeare's Heroines: Characteristics of Women'' by [[Anna Brownell Jameson|Anna Jameson]], originally published 1832, and two fictional biographies in novel form of two of Shakespeare's heroines from 1885) conclude that these early critics are "uneasy" when Shakespeare's heroines behave "unwomanly", and that adaptations of their stories "praise girlish sweetness and modesty in a style that today appears effusive." These are, they say, "culturally induced limitations" on the part of the female critics and authors studying and adapting Shakespeare's women.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern criticism ===

Recent critics take a variety of approaches to the topic. For feminist critics influenced by [[Feminism#French feminism|French feminism]], the analysis of the female body in Shakespeare's plays has proven fruitful. Carol Chillington Rutter, author of ''Enter the Body: Women and Representation on Shakespeare's Stage'' (2001), focuses for instance on the body of Cordelia, as her father, [[King Lear]], carries her on to the stage; on the body of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] in the grave; and on the bodies of the two women on the bed at the end of ''[[Othello]]'', "a play that destroys women."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;

wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;

     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
