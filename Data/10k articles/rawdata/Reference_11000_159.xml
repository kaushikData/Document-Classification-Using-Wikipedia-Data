'''African magic''' is the form, development, and performance of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] within the culture and society of [[Africa]].

==Meaning of the word magic==
The word magic might simply be understood as denoting management of forces, which, as an activity, is not weighted morally and is accordingly a neutral activity from the start of a magical practice, but by the will of the magician, is thought to become and to have an outcome which represents either [[Good and evil|good or bad (evil)]].&lt;ref name=" J. Ki-Zerbo "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNlt1AnERAIC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=African+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi56buZ0vjJAhVC3SwKHULwBNc4HhDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Magic&amp;f=false |author=J. Ki-Zerbo |title=Methodology and African Prehistory, Volume 92, Issues 3-102588 |publisher=James Currey Publishers |date=1990 |isbn=085255091X |page=63|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Molefi Kete Asanti "/&gt;

Ancient African culture was in the habit customarily of always discerning difference between magic, and a group of other things, which are not magic, these things were [[Traditional African medicine|medicine]], [[African divination|divination]], [[Witchcraft#Africa|witchcraft]] and sorcery.&lt;ref name=" M. Labahn "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPHTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=African+medicine+man+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20medicine%20man%20magic&amp;f=false |author=Dr. M. Labahn (Martin-Luther University) |title=A Kind of Magic: Understanding Magic in the New Testament and Its Religious Environment |publisher=A&amp;C Black |date=2007 |isbn=056703075X |page=28|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}''Volume 306 of European studies on Christian origins''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In relation to witchcraft===
E.K. Bongmba finds Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic among the Azande by [[Evans-Pritchard]] (published 1937 &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6L-ijgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Witchcraft,+Oracles,+and+Magic+among+the+Azande&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y Publication details] [Retrieved 2015-12-26]&lt;/ref&gt;) responsible for a reduction in appreciation of the value of magic as a definite subject of study.&lt;ref name=" J. Kiernan "/&gt; Peter Pels (1998) posits failing in thought similarly stemming from a mis-aligned focus on the negative aspect of [[witchcraft]] representing the ''totum'' of magic.&lt;ref name=" J. Kiernan "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wiwo5uwBzXAC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=African+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR4-DOzfjJAhUBrSwKHUU_Ctc4ChDoAQghMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Magic&amp;f=false |author=E.K.

Kiernan) |title=The Power of the Occult in Modern Africa: Continuity and Innovation in the Renewal of African Cosmologies |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |date= 2006 |isbn=3825887618 |page=19|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}''Volume 4 of Modernity and belonging''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to religion===
Opinion differs on how religion and magic are related to each other with respect development or to which developed from which, some thing they developed together from a shared origin, some think religion developed from magic, and some, magic from religion.&lt;ref name=" M. Konaté Deme "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQXHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=African+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Magic&amp;f=false |author=M. Konaté Deme ([[Western Michigan University]])|title=Heroism and the Supernatural in the African Epic |publisher=Routledge |date=2010-09-13 |isbn=113693264X |page=|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}''African Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two types of magic, good, or magic which is used to do well and enhance [[well-being]], and bad, which is magic used to do [[harm]] or wrong or [[evil]].&lt;ref name=" J.S. Mbiti "&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTUpo9lH-fYC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=African+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqqYvyv_jJAhWHvXIKHbTqBIw4ChDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Magic&amp;f=false |author=J.S.

==Roles==
The traditional roles related to and of magic in African society is [[medicine-man]], [[African divination|divinator]], [[Rainmaking|rain-maker]],&lt;ref name=" J.S. Mbiti "/&gt; and priest-magician.&lt;ref name=" Molefi Kete Asanti "/&gt;

===Medicine men===
{{Main|Medicine-man}}

These are at the simplest understanding people who function within a tribal setting as [[herbalists]].&lt;ref name=" J.S. Mbiti "/&gt;

===Divinator===
{{Main|African divination}}

===Rain-maker===
{{Main|Rain-making}}

Rain-makers are thought to possess magical powers, although they possess these powers because they (the powers) are given them by the sky God or the Great Spirit. Rain-making is something which requires both religion and magic.&lt;ref name=" T. Andrews "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=African+rain-maker+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsi8Tj2vjJAhWhj3IKHfMuDgwQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20rain-maker%20magic&amp;f=false |author=T.

===Priest-magician===
The priest-magician must grasp [[reality]] in many ways; understand the nature of [[climate]], the forms of [[energy]] of the [[universe]], the functions of material objects.&lt;ref name=" Molefi Kete Asanti "/&gt; The priest-magician controls forces of [[nature]], and in doing this therefore has to understand how control of forces impacts upon perception and the [[human consciousness]] and [[minds]] of people.&lt;ref name=" Molefi Kete Asanti "/&gt; He or she fulfills his or her role by exercising the [[intellect]] and discerning a way forward while under the possession or control of a [[spirit]] or force of a [[divinity]], to which he or she is a [[servant]].&lt;ref name=" Molefi Kete Asanti "&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMv0CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT548&amp;dq=African+Magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=African%20Magic&amp;f=false |author=[[Molefi Asante|Molefi Kete Asanti]] |title=Encyclopedia of African Religion |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=2008-11-26 |isbn=1506317863 |page=|accessdate=2015-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5354">An '''aircraft blueboook''' is a [[blue book|bluebook]] (value guide) for used aircraft.  There are four of these in common use within the aviation industry; ''Aircraft Bluebook Price Digest'', ''Aircraft Value Reference'' (VREF), and ''Airliner Price Guide'' are paid-subscription publications.  ''International Bluebook'' is an online free service.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
None of the aviation industry bluebooks may be expected to give the simple calculation accuracy typical of the US automotive industry books such as ''[[Automobile Blue Book]]'', or [[Kelley Blue Book]]. A number of issues contribute to the difficulty in presenting a clear figure for a make/model/year, such as lack of central reporting of aircraft sales for either tax or license requirements, the complexity of individual aircraft value calculations, the timing of sales (long timeframes from offer to closing during which time the market can go up or down substantially), multiple synchronous closings for jet aircraft in particular, international currency sales, and non-disclosure-of-price terms included in many transaction documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetliste.com/jet_sales_101.php |title=Jet Sales 101 |accessdate=2009-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921131334/http://www.jetliste.com/jet_sales_101.php |archivedate=2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most banks hire a professional broker/appraiser to allocate a value to an individual aircraft prior to funding. Appraisals usually include an onsite inspection and can be influenced by complex variables such as the year (manufactured year, delivery year, serial number sequence); time on airframe and engines (or until upcoming major inspection and maintenance events); damage (including where/how repaired); logbook and upgrades history; previous owners (number, type usage, and geographic location);  maintenance programs (specially approved maintenance schedules and/or [[Power by the Hour|power by the hour]] engine insurance type plans); avionics; options; current mechanical, interior and exterior condition etc.

==''Aircraft Bluebook Price Digest''==
The '''''Aircraft Bluebook Price Digest''''' is a quarterly print publication (also available on CD-ROM) that was established in the 1950s.  It identifies and prices more than 3,000 used [[general aviation]] aircraft and [[helicopter]] make and model-years available in the United States.  Prices reflect historical data and cannot, therefore, take into account current operating conditions, such as fuel prices, which have a big effect on commercial aircraft values.  Coverage also includes [[avionics]], [[airworthiness]], common conversions and overhaul usage limits.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluebook scale===
The '''Bluebook scale''' is an index published by the ''Price Digest'' that tabulates the condition of an aircraft.  The scale is widely used in the aviation industry.  The scale ranges from 10 for a new aircraft to 1 for an aircraft not fit for flight.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Aircraft Value Reference''==
'''''Aircraft Value Reference''''' (VREF), establihsed in 1991, is published twice a year by the Aircraft Value Analysis Company.  It is used by both aircraft brokers and a number of financial institutions to estimate the future value of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Airliner Price Guide''==
The '''''Airliner Price Guide''''', established in 1985, is published by ACI Aviation Consulting.  It provides prices for new and used commercial aircraft and other data such as engine values.  The print version of the guide is issued twice a year.  An online service is updated in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

==''International Bluebook''==
The '''International Bluebook''' is a free online service which offers general bluebook figures for jet aircraft models and conditions.  The site does not provide calculations for individual aircraft, but these may be obtained via dealer’s sites or on jet aircraft [[multiple listing service]] (MLS) sites which use the service.&lt;ref&gt;Vasigh, Taleghani &amp; Jenkins, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew William Mellon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|ə|n}}; March 24, 1855&amp;nbsp;– August 26, 1937), sometimes '''A.W.''', was an [[United States|American]] banker, businessman, industrialist, philanthropist, art collector, and politician. From the wealthy [[Mellon family]] of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], he established a vast business empire before transitioning into politics. He served as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] from March 9, 1921, to February 12, 1932, presiding over the boom years of the 1920s and the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]]. A conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Mellon favored policies that reduced taxation and the national debt in the aftermath of [[World War I]].

Mellon's father, [[Thomas Mellon]], rose to prominence in Pittsburgh as a banker and attorney. Andrew began working at his father's bank, T. Mellon &amp; Sons, in the early 1870s, eventually becoming the leading figure in the institution. He later renamed T. Mellon &amp; Sons as Mellon National Bank and established another financial institution, the Union Trust Company. By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the second-largest bank in the region was controlled by Union Trust. In the course of his business career, Mellon owned or helped finance [[Alcoa]], the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Old Overholt]] whiskey, [[Standard Steel Car Company]], [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], [[Koppers]], the [[Pittsburgh Coal Company]], the Carborundum Company, Union Steel Company, the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, [[Gulf Oil]], and numerous other businesses. He was also an influential donor to the Republican Party during the [[Gilded Age]] and the [[Progressive Era]].

In 1921, newly-elected President [[Warren G. Harding]] chose Mellon as his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. Mellon would remain in office until 1932, serving under Harding, [[Calvin Coolidge]], and [[Herbert Hoover]], all three of whom were members of the Republican Party. Mellon sought to reform federal taxation in the aftermath of World War I, cutting taxes on top earners but leaving in place a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]]. Some of Mellon's proposals were enacted by the [[Revenue Act of 1921]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], but it was not until the passage of [[Revenue Act of 1926]] that the "Mellon plan" was fully realized. He also presided over a reduction in the national debt, which dropped substantially in the 1920s. Mellon's influence in state and national politics reached its zenith during Coolidge's presidency; one observer noted that "it would be fair to call the [Coolidge] administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon."

Mellon's national reputation collapsed following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Mellon participated in various efforts by the Hoover administration to revive the economy and maintain the international economic order, but he opposed direct government intervention in the economy. After Congress began impeachment proceedings against Mellon, President Hoover shifted Mellon to the position of [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|United States ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Mellon returned to private life after Hoover's defeat in the 1932 presidential election by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Beginning in 1933, the federal government launched a tax fraud investigation on Mellon, leading to a high-profile case that ended with Mellon's exoneration. Shortly before his death in 1937, Mellon helped establish the [[National Gallery of Art]], a national art museum. His philanthropic efforts also played a major role in the later establishment of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].

==Early life and ancestry==
{{see also|Mellon family}}

Mellon's paternal grandparents, both of whom were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], migrated to the United States from [[County Tyrone]], [[Ireland]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; With their son, [[Thomas Mellon]], they settled in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mellon established a successful legal practice in [[Pittsburgh]], and in 1843 he married Sarah Jane Negley, an heiress descended from some of the first settlers of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 12, 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas became a wealthy landowner and real estate speculator, and he and his wife had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Andrew Mellon, the fourth son and sixth child of Thomas and Sarah, was born in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 20–28&lt;/ref&gt; Though he lacked strong convictions about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], Thomas Mellon became a prominent member of the local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and in 1859 he won election to a position on the [[Pennsylvania courts of common pleas|Pennsylvania court of common pleas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Because Thomas was suspicious of both private and public schools, he built a schoolhouse for his children and hired a teacher; Andrew attended this school beginning at age five.&lt;ref name="npsjtown"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew William Mellon (1855-1937) |url=https://www.nps.gov/jofl/learn/historyculture/andrew-william-mellon.htm |website=Johnstown Flood |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, after leaving his judicial position, Thomas Mellon established T. Mellon &amp; Sons, a bank located in Pittsburgh. Andrew joined his father at the bank, quickly becoming a valued employee despite being in his early teens. Andrew also attended Western University (which was later renamed the [[University of Pittsburgh]]), but he never graduated.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Western University, Andrew briefly worked at a lumber and coal business before joining T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a full-time employee in 1873. That same year, the [[Panic of 1873]] devastated the local and national economy, wiping out a portion of the Mellon fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 53–56&lt;/ref&gt; With Andrew taking a leading role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons, the bank quickly recovered, and by late 1874 the bank's deposits had reached the level they had been at prior to the onset of the Panic.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career, 1873–1920==
===Business career, 1873–1898===

Mellon's role at T. Mellon &amp; Sons continued to grow after 1873, and in 1876 he was given power of attorney to direct the operations of the bank. That same year, Thomas introduced his son to [[Henry Clay Frick]], a customer of the bank who would become one of Mellons's closest friends. In 1882, Thomas turned over full ownership of the bank to his son, but Thomas continued to be involved in the bank's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Mellon's younger brother, [[Richard B. Mellon]], joined T. Mellon &amp; Sons as a co-owner and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, Mellon began to expand the bank's activities. Along with Frick, Mellon gained control the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce, a [[National Bank Act|national bank]] that was authorized to print [[banknote]]s. Mellon also acquired or helped found the Union Insurance Company, City Deposit Bank, the Fidelity Title and Trust Company, and the Union Trust Company. He branched out into industrial concerns, becoming a director of the [[Pittsburgh Stock Exchange|Pittsburgh Petroleum Exchange]] and a co-founder of two [[natural gas]] companies that collectively controlled 35,000 acres of gas lands in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 79–80, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Thomas Mellon transferred his properties to Andrew, who would manage the properties on behalf of himself, his parents, and his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1894, Thomas transferred all of his remaining assets to Andrew.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large sums entrusted to Andrew, the businesses he ran were still fairly small in the 1890s; T. Mellon &amp; Sons employed seven individuals in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Mellon agreed to loan $25,000 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, a fledgling operation seeking to become the first successful industrial producer of [[aluminum]]. Mellon became a director of the company in 1891, and he and Richard played a major role in the establishment of aluminum factories in [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania]] and [[Niagara Falls, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The company would emerge as one of the most profitable ventures invested in by the Mellons, and in 1907 it was renamed as [[Alcoa]].&lt;ref name="Cannadine 2006, p. 184"&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the petroleum industry, the Mellon family also established the Crescent Oil Company, the Crescent Pipeline Company, and the Bear Creek refinery. By 1894, the Mellon family's [[Vertical integration|vertically-integrated]] companies produced ten percent of the oil exported by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 99–102&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the difficult economic conditions caused by the onset of the [[Panic of 1893]], in 1895 the Mellons sold their oil interests to [[Standard Oil]]. At roughly the same time they were selling their oil concerns, Andrew and Richard invested in the Carborundum Company, a producer of [[silicon carbide]]. The brothers gained majority ownership of the Carborundum Company in 1898, and replaced the company's founder and president, [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], with a Carnegie protege, Frank W. Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 117–120&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon also invested in mining concerns, becoming vice president of the Trade Dollar Consolidated Mining Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon and Henry Clay Frick enjoyed a long-lasting business and social relationship, and Frick frequently hosted Mellon, attorney [[Philander C. Knox]], inventor [[George Westinghouse]], and others for [[poker]] games. Frick and Mellon both joined the [[Duquesne Club]] and, after Frick established the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], Mellon became one of that club's first members.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 81, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club built the [[South Fork Dam]], which supported an artificial lake that the club used for boating and fishing. In 1889, the dam broke, causing the [[Johnstown Flood]], which killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1,600 homes. In the aftermath of the flood, Knox led a legal defense that successfully argued that the club bore no legal responsibility for the flood. Mellon did not publicly comment on the flood, though he did donate $1,000 to a relief fund.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career, 1898–1920===

By the late 1890s, Mellon had amassed a substantial fortune, but his wealth paled in comparison to better-known business leaders such as [[John D. Rockefeller]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1890s, the Union Trust Company emerged for the first time as one of Mellon's most important and profitable holdings after Mellon broadened the company's activities to include commercial banking. With an infusion of capital from Union Trust, Mellon underwrote the capitalization of National Glass and several other companies. He also became a co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company and established Crucible Steel Company, the [[Pittsburgh Coal Company]], and the [[Monongahela River Consolidated Coal and Coke Company|Monongahela River Coal Company]]; the two coal companies collectively contributed 11 percent of the coal production of the United States. With Frick, Richard Mellon, and [[William Donner]], Mellon co-founded Union Steel Company, which specialized in the production of nails and [[barbed wire]]. Though Frick had fallen out with steel magnate and long-time business partner [[Andrew Carnegie]], Mellon received Carnegie's consent to venture into the steel industry. Responding to the growing emphasis on naval power in the aftermath of the [[Spanish–American War]], Mellon and Frick also became major shareholders in the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 134–139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mellon National Bank Building Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|The [[Mellon National Bank Building]], which served as the headquarters of Mellon National Bank after it was completed in 1924]]

In 1902, Mellon reorganized T. Mellon &amp; Sons as the Mellon National Bank, a federally-chartered National Bank. Andrew Mellon, Richard Mellon, and Frick drew up a new business arrangement in which the three of them jointly controlled the Union Trust Company, which in turn controlled Mellon National Bank. They also established Union Savings Bank, which accepted deposits by mail, and the Mellon banks flourished in the first years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; While Mellon's financial empire prospered, his investments in other areas, including Pittsburgh's streetcar network, the Union Steel Company (which was bought out by [[U.S. Steel]]), and the Carborundum Company, also paid off handsomely.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful Mellon investment, the [[Standard Steel Car Company]], was created in partnership with three former U.S. Steel executives.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Texas oil boom]], the Mellons also helped J. M. Guffey establish the Guffey Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; The Mellons later removed Guffey as the head of his company, and in 1907 they reorganized the Guffey Company as [[Gulf Oil]] and installed [[William Larimer Mellon Sr.]] (a son of Andrew Mellon's older brother, James Ross Mellon) as the head of Gulf Oil.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 179, 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Mellon's financial empire and his varied investments made him, according to biographer David Cannadine, the "single most significant individual in the economic life and progress of western Pennsylvania" in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Panic of 1907]] devastated several companies based in Pittsburgh, ending a period of strong growth.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 216–217, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Mellon's investments experienced a sustained down period after 1907, but most experienced a quick recovery. Mellon also became an investor in [[George Westinghouse]]'s [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] after he helped prevent the company from going into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 225–228&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1913, Mellon National Bank held more money in deposits than any other bank in Pittsburgh, and the Farmer's Deposit National Bank, which held the second-largest amount of deposits, was controlled by Mellon's Union Trust Company.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Mellon became a co-owner of [[Koppers]], which produced a more sophisticated [[Coke (fuel)|coking]] oven than the one that had earlier been pioneered by Frick.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a director of various other companies, including the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[American Locomotive Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was deeply involved in the financing of [[World War I]], as the Union Trust Company and other Mellon institutions provided millions of dollars in loans to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]], and Mellon himself invested in [[Liberty bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Overholt whiskey===

In 1887, Frick, Andrew, and Richard Mellon jointly purchased [[Old Overholt]], a whiskey distillery located in  [[West Overton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wondrich-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of America's Oldest Whiskey|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/02/the-rise-fall-of-america-s-oldest-whiskey.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Old Overholt was one of the largest and most respected whiskey producers in the country.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, but retained ownership in the company.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wondrich|first1=David|title=How Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey Lost Its Way|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/12/how-pennsylvania-rye-whiskey-lost-its-way.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Mellon's connections in the Treasury Department are what allowed the company to secure a medicinal permit during Prohibition.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; This permit allowed Overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; When Frick died in December 1919, he left his share to Mellon.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt; In 1925, under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a New York grocer.&lt;ref name="Wondrich-2" /&gt;

===Early involvement in politics===
{{see also|Gilded Age|Progressive Era}}

Like his father, Mellon consistently supported the Republican Party, and he frequently donated to state and local party leaders. Through state party boss [[Matthew Quay]], Mellon influenced legislators to place high tariffs on aluminum products in the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 20th century, Mellon was dismayed by the rise of [[Progressive Era|progressivism]] and the [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] actions pursued by the presidential administrations of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. He especially opposed the Taft administration's investigations into Alcoa, which in 1912 signed a [[consent decree]] rather than going to trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 220–222&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of World War I, he provided financial support to [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and other Republicans in their successful campaign to prevent ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Mellon attended the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] as a nominal supporter of Pennsylvania Governor [[William Cameron Sproul]] (Mellon hoped Senator Philander Knox would win the nomination), but the convention chose Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio as the party's presidential nominee. Mellon strongly approved of the party's conservative platform, and he served as a key fundraiser for Harding during the presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career, 1921–1933==
[[File:Portrait photograph of A.W. Mellon.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of A.W. Mellon, 1924]]

===Harding administration===
{{see also|Presidency of Warren G. Harding}}

Following Harding's victory in the 1920 presidential election, Harding considered various candidates for Secretary of the Treasury, including [[Frank Lowden]], [[John W. Weeks]], [[Charles Dawes]], and, at the urging of Senator Knox, Andrew Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 513–514, 517&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, Mellon was little-known outside of banking circles, but his potential appointment to the cabinet received strong support from bankers and Pennsylvania Republican leaders like Knox, Senator [[Boies Penrose]], and Governor Sproul. Mellon was reluctant to enter public life due to concerns about privacy and a belief that his ownership of various businesses, including Old Overholt distillery, would be a political liability.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 517–519&lt;/ref&gt; But Mellon also wanted to retire from active participation in business, and he saw a cabinet position as a prestigious capstone to his career.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 525–526&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon agreed to accept appointment as Secretary of the Treasury in February 1921, and his nomination was quickly confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. Though Mellon's supporters believed that he was highly qualified to address the economic issues facing the country, critics of the Harding administration saw the Mellon appointment as a sign that Harding would "reseat the power of special privileged interests, the powers of avarice and greed, the powers that seek self-aggrandizement at the expense of the general public."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; Harding paired the nomination of Mellon with that of Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]], who was distrusted by many of the same Senate Republicans who favored Mellon's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), pp. 527–530&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the cabinet, Mellon sold his banking stock to his brother, Richard, but he continued to hold his non-banking stock.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973), p. 526&lt;/ref&gt; Through Richard and other business associates, Mellon continued to be involved with the major decisions of the Mellon business empire during his time in public service, and he occasionally lobbied congressmen on behalf of his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 296–298, 323&lt;/ref&gt; His fortune continued to grow, and at one point in the 1920s he paid more in federal income tax than any other individual save John Rockefeller and [[Henry Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

As Treasury Secretary, Mellon focused on balancing the budget and paying off World War I debts in the midst of the [[Depression of 1920–21]]; he was largely unconcerned with international affairs and economic matters such as the unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; To Mellon's chagrin, his department was charged with enforcing Prohibition; he did not believe in teetotaling himself and viewed the law as unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from balancing the budget, Mellon's top priority was an overhaul of the federal tax code.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; The income tax had become a major part of the federal government's revenue system with the passage of the [[Revenue Act of 1913]], and federal taxation on income had increased during [[World War I]] to provide funding for the war effort. According to M. Susan Murnane, major reforms to the federal income tax in the aftermath of World War I were "inevitable," but the exact nature of the tax system in the 1920s was debated by conservatives and progressives within the Republican Party. Unlike the progressives in his party, Mellon rejected the redistributive nature of the taxation system that had been left in place by the Wilson administration. Due in part to the high debts left over from the war, Mellon did not join with some conservatives in the party, who favored the virtual abolition of the income tax in favor of high tariff rates, excise taxes, a national sales tax, or some combination thereof.&lt;ref name="murnane820822"/&gt;

Mellon instead advocated for the retention of a progressive income tax that would serve as an important, but not primary, source of revenue for the federal government. His so-called "scientific taxation" was designed to maximize federal revenue while minimizing the impact on business and industry.&lt;ref name="murnane820822"/&gt; The central tenet of Mellon's tax plan was a reduction of the surtax, a progressive tax that only affected high-income earners. Mellon argued that such a reduction would minimize tax avoidance and would not affect federal revenue because it would lead to greater economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 825–826, 837–838&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped that tax reform would encourage high earners to move their savings from tax-exempt state and municipal bonds to taxable, higher yield industrial stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of the tax plan that he proposed had been developed by former Wilson administration officials [[Russell Cornell Leffingwell]] and [[Seymour Parker Gilbert]], the press generally referred to it as the "Mellon Plan."&lt;ref name="murnane820822"&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 820–822&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revenue Act of 1918]] had set a top marginal income tax rate of 73% and a corporate tax of approximately 10%. Due in part to the size of the U.S. public debt, which had grown from $1 billion before the war to $24 billion in 1921, the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 remained in place when Harding took office. In 1921, the Treasury Department and the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] jointly prepared a bill setting the top marginal rate at the level advocated by Mellon, but opposition in the Senate from progressives like Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] limited the size of the tax cuts. In November 1921, Congress passed and Harding signed the [[Revenue Act of 1921]], which raised personal [[tax exemption]]s and lowered the top marginal tax rate to 58%.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 824–829&lt;/ref&gt; Because it differed from his original proposals, Mellon was displeased by the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly disapproved of a "Bonus Bill" passed by Congress that would provide for additional compensation to veterans of World War I, partly because he feared it would interfere with his plans to reduce debt and taxes. With Mellon's support, Harding vetoed the bill, and Congress failed to override the veto.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coolidge administration===
{{see also|Presidency of Calvin Coolidge}}
[[File:Calvin Coolidge, bw head and shoulders photo portrait seated, 1919.jpg|thumb|President [[Calvin Coolidge]] favored Mellon's economic policies]]

As the economy recovered from recession and began to experience the prosperity of the [[Roaring Twenties]], Mellon emerged as one of the most renowned figures in the Harding administration. One admiring congressman referred to Mellon as the "greatest Secretary of the Treasury since [[Alexander Hamilton]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; Harding died after suffering a stroke in August 1923, and he was succeeded by Vice President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Mellon enjoyed closer relations with President Coolidge than he had with President Harding, and Coolidge and Mellon shared similar views on most major issues, including on the necessity for further tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 311–315&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Allen White]], a contemporary journalist, stated that "so completely did Andrew Mellon dominate the White House in the days when the Coolidge administration was at its zenith that it would be fair to call the administration the reign of Coolidge and Mellon."&lt;ref name="Keller 1982, p. 777"&gt;Keller (1982), p. 777&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolidge, Mellon, business organizations, and administration allies conducted a publicity campaign designed to convince wavering congressmen to support Mellon's tax plan.&lt;ref name="murnane833836840841"/&gt; Their efforts were opposed by the coalition of Democrats and progressive Republicans that exercised effective control over the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1924, the House Ways and Means Committee approved of a bill based on Mellon's plan, but an alliance of progressive Republicans and Democrats engineered passage of an alternative tax bill written by Democrat [[John Nance Garner]]; Garner's plan also reduced income taxes, but set the top marginal tax rate at 46% rather than Mellon's preferred 33%. In June 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Revenue Act of 1924]], which contained the income tax rates of Garner's bill and also increased the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]]. Coolidge signed the bill but simultaneously called for further tax cuts.&lt;ref name="murnane833836840841"&gt;Murnane (2004), pp. 833–836, 840–841&lt;/ref&gt; Congress also rejected Mellon's proposed constitutional amendment that would have barred the issuance of tax-exempt securities and, over Coolidge's veto, authorized a bonus to World War I veterans. Mellon did, however, win one legislative victory, as he convinced Congress to create the [[United States Tax Court|Board of Tax Appeals]] to adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon had originally planned to retire after one presidential term, but decided to remain in the cabinet in the hope of presiding over the full enactment of his taxation proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 presidential election]], the Republicans campaigned on further tax cuts, while both the Democrats and third party candidate Robert La Follette denounced Mellon's tax proposals as "a device to relieve multi-millionaires at the expense of other taxpayers."&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), p. 841&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by the strong economy, and overcoming the [[Presidency of Warren G. Harding#Administration scandals|scandals of the Harding years]], Mellon won re-election by a decisive margin.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge saw his own landslide re-election victory as a mandate to pursue his favored economic policies, including further tax cuts.&lt;ref name="Keller 1982, p. 777"/&gt;

When Congress reconvened after the 1924 elections, it immediately began working on another bill designed to reduce taxes on the highest earners.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane (2004), p. 851&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1926, Coolidge signed the [[Revenue Act of 1926]], which reduced the top marginal rate to 25%. Mellon was extremely pleased by the passage of the act, because, unlike the Revenue Act of 1921 and the Revenue Act of 1924, the Revenue Act of 1926 closely reflected Mellon's proposals. In addition to cutting taxes on top earners, the act also raised the personal exemption for federal income taxes, abolished the [[Gift tax in the United States|gift tax]], reduced the estate tax rate, and repealed a provision that had required the public disclosure of federal income tax returns. Meanwhile, the booming economy fostered a $400 million budget surplus in 1926, and the country's national debt dropped from $24 billion in early 1921 to $19.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;

With his top priority of tax reform accomplished, Mellon increasingly turned over management of the Treasury Department to his deputy, [[Ogden L. Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1926 elections, Mellon and Mills sought to cut the corporate tax and fully repeal the estate tax. The [[Revenue Act of 1928]] did indeed cut the corporate tax, but the estate tax was left unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 357–358&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon also focused on the construction of new federal buildings, and his efforts led to the construction of several buildings in the [[Federal Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 372–375&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Mellon stated that "in no other nation, and at no other time in the history of the world, have so many people enjoyed such a high degree of prosperity or maintained a standard of living comparable to that which prevails throughout this country today."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for foreign relations lay with the State Department rather than the Treasury Department, and the [[Benjamin Strong Jr.]] and other central bankers took the lead with regard to international monetary policy, but Mellon nonetheless exercised some influenced in foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly opposed the cancellation of European debts from World War I, but recognized that Britain and other countries would be unable to pay those debts without a renegotiation of terms. In 1923, Mellon and British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] negotiated an agreement in which Britain promised to pay off the debts over a 62-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; After the adoption of the [[Dawes Plan]], Mellon reached debt settlements with several other European countries. After protracted negotiations, the United States and France agreed to the [[Mellon-Berenger Agreement]], which reduced France's debt and set terms for repayment.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 319–321&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoover administration===

====1928 election====

Coolidge surprised many observers by announcing that he would not seek another term in August 1927. The decision left Hoover as the presumed front-runner for the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]], but many conservatives within the party opposed Hoover's candidacy. The conservative resistance to Hoover centered around Mellon, who controlled Pennsylvania's delegation at the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] and was influential with Republicans throughout the country. Though they had maintained an amicable relationship in public, Mellon privately distrusted Hoover, resented Hoover's engagement in the affairs of other cabinet departments, and feared that a President Hoover would move away from Mellon's tax policies. Several Republicans urged Mellon to run for president, but Mellon believed that he was too old to seek the presidency. Mellon attempted to convince Coolidge or Charles Evans Hughes to run, but neither heeded his appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Rusnak (1983), pp. 269–272&lt;/ref&gt; In the months before the 1928 Republican Convention, Mellon maintained his neutrality in the presidential race, but with no compelling alternative Republican candidate willing to run, Mellon finally threw his support behind Hoover. With Mellon's backing, Hoover won the Republican nomination on the first ballot of the convention, and he went on to defeat [[Al Smith]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Rusnak (1983), pp. 274–276&lt;/ref&gt; Defying widespread expectations that he would retire, Mellon chose to stay on as Secretary of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Secretary of Agriculture [[James Wilson (Secretary of Agriculture)|James Wilson]] and Secretary of Labor [[James J. Davis]], Mellon is one of only three cabinet members to serve in the same post under three consecutive presidents.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Great Depression====
[[File:Andrew W. Mellon Ogden Mills.jpg|thumb|Mellon and his successor as Secretary of the Treasury, [[Ogden L. Mills]]]]

Secretary Mellon had helped persuade the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates in 1921 and 1924; lower interest rates contributed to a booming economy, but they also encouraged stock market [[speculation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 286, 321&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, responding to increasing fears of the dangers of speculation and a booming stock market, the Federal Reserve Board began raising interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon favored another interest rate increase in 1929, and in August 1929 the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate to six percent. The higher rate failed to curb speculation, and the activity on the stock market continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 388–390&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] suffered the worst crash in its history in what was called "[[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]." As the vast majority of Americans did not own shares in the stock market, the crash did not immediately have disastrous effects on the U.S. economy as a whole. Mellon had little sympathy for the speculators who lost their money, and he was philosophically opposed to an interventionist economic policy designed to address the stock market crash. Nonetheless, Mellon immediately began calling for cuts to the discount rate, which would reach two percent in mid-1930, and successfully urged Congress to pass a bill providing for temporary, across-the-board tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 391–395&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1930, many, including Mellon, believed that the economy had already experienced the worst effects of the stock market crash. He did not object to the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]], which raised tariff rates to one of the highest levels in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 395–397&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the optimism of Hoover and Mellon, in late 1930 the economy went into a deep slump, as gross national product declined dramatically and numerous workers lost their jobs. While numerous banks failed, Democrats won control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 1930|1930 mid-term elections]]. As the economy declined, so did Mellon's popularity, which was further damaged by his opposition to another bonus bill for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 399–401&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1931, the country entered a deep depression and, at Hoover's request, Mellon negotiated a moratorium on German debt repayments. After Mellon returned to the United States in August 1931, he was confronted by another series of bank failures. Among the banks that failed was the Bank of Pittsburgh, the lone remaining major Pittsburgh bank not controlled by the Mellon family. Again following Hoover's lead, Mellon presided over the creation of the National Credit Association, a voluntary initiative among the larger banks that was designed to assist failing institutions. As the National Credit Association proved to be ineffective at stemming the tide of bank failures, Congress and the Hoover administration established the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] to provide federal loans to banks.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 437–443&lt;/ref&gt;

With the unemployment rate approaching twenty percent, Mellon became one of the most "loathed leaders" in the United States, second only to Hoover himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 442–444&lt;/ref&gt; Facing this unprecedented economic catastrophe, Mellon urged Hoover to refrain from using the government to intervene in the depression. Mellon believed that economic recessions, such as those that had occurred in 1873 and 1907, were a necessary part of the business cycle because they purged the economy, which in turn would lead to a situation in which "people will work harder, lead a more moral life."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a large deficit, Mellon and Mills called for a return to the tax rates set by the Revenue Act of 1924, and also sought new taxes on automobiles, gasoline, and other items. Congress responded by passing the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], which included many of Treasury Department's proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 448–449&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1932, Congressman [[Wright Patman]] of Texas initiated [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] proceedings against Mellon, contending that Mellon had violated numerous federal laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest. Though Mellon had defeated similar investigations in the past, his falling popularity left him unable to effectively counter Patman's charges. Hoover removed Mellon from Washington by offering him the position of [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Mellon accepted the post, and Mills replaced his former boss as Secretary of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 450–452&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon arrived in Britain in April 1932, receiving a friendly reception from a country he had often visited over the previous thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 455–456&lt;/ref&gt; From his post, he watched the collapse of the international economic order, including the debt accords that he had helped negotiate. He also convinced the British to allow Gulf Oil to operate in [[Kuwait]], a British protectorate in the oil-rich region of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Defying Mellon's expectations, Hoover was defeated by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 459–461, 463–464&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon left office when Hoover's term ended in March 1933, returning to private life after twelve years of government service.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania politics, 1921–1933===

Knox and Penrose both died in 1921, leaving a power vacuum in Pennsylvania Republican politics. Along with his nephew, William Larimer Mellon, Mellon became an influential player in Pennsylvania politics, and their support helped ensure the elections of Senator [[David A. Reed]] and Senator [[George W. Pepper]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 224–227&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was unable to assert the same level of control that Boies Penrose had had over state politics, and his leadership of the state party was challenged by [[William Scott Vare]] of Philadelphia and progressive leader [[Gifford Pinchot]], who won the 1922 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Mellon would continue to exert an important influence on Pennsylvania politics throughout the 1920s, especially in senatorial elections and in Allegheny County.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), pp. 231–233&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon's influence over state politics waned in the early 1930s, as the progressive allies of Governor Pinchot took control of the state Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1975), p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Numerous financial institutions failed in the months prior to Roosevelt's inauguration, but Mellon National Bank, the Union Trust Company, and another Mellon banking operation, Mellbank Corporation, were all able to avoid closure.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 466–468&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon strongly opposed Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies, especially the [[1933 Banking Act]], which required a separation between commercial and investment banking.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 478–480&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon believed that the various New Deal policies, including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]], undermined the free market system that had produced one of the largest economies in the world. Aside from banking reform, other New Deal policies, including regulations on utilities and coal mines and laws designed to promote labor unions, also affected Mellon's business empire. Additionally, the [[Revenue Act of 1934]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1935]] rescinded many of Mellon's tax policies and contained other provisions that were designed to increase taxation on top earners and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 518–522&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after leaving office, Mellon continued to be vilified by many in the public, and in 1933 [[Harvey O'Connor]] published a popular and unfavorable biography, ''Mellon's Millions''.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 485–486&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats won effective control of Allegheny County in the 1933 elections, and the following year Democrat [[Joseph F. Guffey]] won Pennsylvania's Senate election and [[George Howard Earle III]] won the state's gubernatorial election.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 487–489&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon endured numerous attacks during these campaigns, and his unpopularity in Pittsburgh led him to spend most of his final years in Washington rather than his home town.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 490–491&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration conducted several high-profile tax evasion prosecutions against individuals such as [[Thomas W. Lamont]] and [[Jimmy Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 514–515&lt;/ref&gt; In response to accusations levied by Republican Congressman [[Louis Thomas McFadden]] of Pennsylvania in early 1933, Attorney General [[Homer Cummings]] began an inquiry into Mellon's tax history.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 507–509&lt;/ref&gt; Between February 1935 and May 1936, the Board of Tax Appeals heard a widely covered case in which the federal government accused Mellon of tax fraud. During the proceedings, Mellon divulged numerous details of his business career that had previously been unknown to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 525–528&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon was diagnosed with cancer in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; His health declined in 1937, and he died on August 26, 1937. Newspapers across the country took note of his death. Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] stated that Mellon had lived through "an epoch in the economic history of the nation, and his passing takes one of the most important industrial and financial figures of our time."&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 573, 578–581&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon was buried at Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery, [[Upperville, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Months after Mellon's death, the Board of Tax appeals handed down a ruling exonerating Mellon of all tax fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In the early 1880s, Mellon had a serious relationship with Fannie Larimer Jones, but he broke off the relationship after learning that she was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. After this experience, Mellon refrained from courting women for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, while traveling with Frick and Frick's wife to Europe, Mellon met Nora McMullen, a nineteen-year-old Englishwoman of Ulster Scots ancestry. Mellon visited McMullen's home of [[Hertford Castle]] in 1898 and 1899, and, after a period of courtship, Nora married Mellon in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 142–148, 151&lt;/ref&gt; Nora gave birth to a daughter, [[Ailsa Mellon Bruce|Ailsa]], in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 155,&lt;/ref&gt; Nora disliked living in Pittsburgh, and she was unhappy in her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 152, 156&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1903, she had begun an affair with Alfred George Curphey, who would also later be involved with the wife of [[George Vivian, 4th Baron Vivian]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 168–172, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon and Nora eventually reconciled, and in 1907 she gave birth to a son, [[Paul Mellon|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Cannadine 2006, p. 184"/&gt; The reconciliation proved short-lived, as Nora took up with Curphey again in 1908 and requested a divorce the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 193, 196&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid a public scandal, Andrew reluctantly agreed to a separation in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to hold divorce proceedings privately before a judge rather than publicly before a jury, in 1911 Mellon convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to amend a law that had required a [[jury trial]] in divorce proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nora attacked Mellon in the press, and the divorce proceedings were widely covered by the media. In 1912, Mellon and Nora finally agreed on a divorce settlement, largely on Mellon's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 207–211&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon did not remarry. Nora lived in Pittsburgh for several years before eventually settling in the [[Hudson Valley]], and the two children alternated living with either parent.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 264, 304&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Nora married Harvey Arthur Lee, a British-born antiques dealer 14 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 June 1928 |title=Milestones: Jun. 11, 1928 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881064,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] }} ''www.time.com.''

In 1926, in the "greatest society event that the nation's capital had witnessed" since before World War I, Ailsa married [[David K. E. Bruce]], son of Democratic Senator [[William Cabell Bruce]] of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 330–332&lt;/ref&gt; After attending [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], Paul briefly worked at Mellon National Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 446–447&lt;/ref&gt; He later settled in Virginia, becoming a well-known philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 610, 617&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon's nephew, [[Richard King Mellon]], succeeded Andrew as the head of the Mellon financial empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 613–614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and art collection==
[[File:Mellon Institute 01.JPG|right|thumb|Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]]

Emulating his father, Mellon eschewed [[philanthropy]] for much of his life, but in the early 1900s he began donating to local organizations such as the [[YMCA]]. Mellon committed to his first large-scale act of philanthropy in 1913, when he and his brother, Richard, established the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]] as a department of the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 238–241&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the institute merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology to form [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Mellon also served as an alumni president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=1937e49702;didno=1937e49702;view=image;seq=0037 |title=The 1937 Owl |year=1937 |page=32 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and trustee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0067 |last=Alberts |first=Robert C. |title=Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787–1987 |page=47 |year=1986 |isbn=0-8229-1150-7 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Pittsburgh, and made several major donations to the school, including the land on which the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and [[Heinz Chapel]] were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Andrew%20W.%20Mellon;rgn=full%20text;idno=00afj8718m;didno=00afj8718m;view=image;seq=0314 |last=Starrett |first=Agnes Lynch |title=Through one hundred and fifty years: the University of Pittsburgh |page=256  |year=1937 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In total it is estimated that Mellon donated over $43 million to the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=201|last=Alberts |first=Robert C. |title=Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787–1987 |page=182 |year=1986 |isbn=0-8229-1150-7 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by Frick, and guided by [[Charles Carstairs]]. Mellon began collecting art in the mid-to-late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; Over the ensuing decades, his art collection continued to grow as he purchased pieces from [[Knoedler]] and [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Joseph Duveen]], and during the 1920s his personal collection was generally considered to be one of the finest art collections in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, he purchased, according to Cannadine, just under half of the "greatest paintings" from the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Hermitage Museum]] in the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 416–425&lt;/ref&gt;  [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|Twenty-one paintings]], of the highest quality, were later given to the National Gallery of Art.

Mellon decided to use his personal fortune and art collection to establish a national art museum in Washington modeled after the [[National Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Mellon presented President Roosevelt with an offer to establish a national art museum to which Mellon would donate his art collection as well as an endowment, while the federal government would pay for the institution's upkeep. He conditioned the offer on the establishment of a board of trustees, a majority of whom would be chosen by Mellon. Despite the ongoing tax case against Mellon, the Roosevelt administration accepted the offer, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the construction of the [[National Gallery of Art]] on Mellon's terms.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), pp. 559–566&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery of Art opened in 1941 and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; Mellon's friend and former employee, [[David E. Finley Jr.]], would later preside over the establishment of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]], which also hosts several paintings donated by Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon was initiated to the [[Scottish Rite]] Freemasonry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | url = https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information |  title = Famous men members of Masonic Lodges | website = American Canadian Grand Lodge ACGL | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181117142833/https://pub.acgl.eu/index.php/freemasonry/information | archive-date = Nov 17, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bavarialodge.org/freemasonry | title = Famous members of Masonic Lodges | language = en | website = Bavaria Lodge No. 935 A.F. &amp; A.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===
The [[Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain]] in Washington was created by [[Sidney Waugh]] and was dedicated in May 1952 by [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannadine (2006), p. 593&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, D.C. also hosts the [[Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium]] and the [[Andrew Mellon Building]]. The [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], the product of the merger of the Avalon Foundation and the Old Dominion Foundation (set up separately by his children), is named in his honor, as is the 378-foot [[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|US Coast Guard Cutter ''Mellon (WHEC-717)'']].

===In popular culture===
Andrew W. Mellon appears in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', in the fifth, eighth and twelfth episodes of the third season, in his capacity as Secretary of the Treasury.  His character is played by [[Carnegie Mellon]] alumnus [[James Cromwell]].

In the [[alternate history]]/[[time travel]] story "A Slip in Time" by [[S. M. Stirling]],&lt;ref&gt;Published in "Multiverse:Exploring [[Poul Anderson]]'s worlds, edited by [[Greg Bear]] and [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a history in which the [[First World War]] was avoided and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] survived, Andrew Mellon was the [[President of the United States]] in 1926.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to other files within them is the work of librarians and other information cataloguers. Accordingly, authority control is an example of [[controlled vocabulary]] and of [[bibliographic control]].

While in theory any piece of information is amenable to authority control such as personal and corporate names, [[uniform title]]s, series names, and subjects,&lt;ref name=tws2NovY111/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALT-for-dead-link-footnote"/&gt; library cataloguers typically focus on author names and titles of works. Subject headings from the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Library of Congress]] fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort to keep up with these changes and try to bring "structure and order" to the task of helping users find information.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY312 /&gt;

==Benefits of authority control==
* ''Better researching''. Authority control helps researchers get a handle on a specific subject with less wasted effort.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt; A well-designed digital catalog/database enables a researcher to query a few words of an entry to bring up the already established term or phrase, thus improving accuracy and saving time.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY323/&gt;

* ''Efficiency for cataloguers''. The process of authority control is not only of great help to researchers searching for a particular subject to study, but it can help cataloguers organize information as well. Cataloguers can use authority records when trying to categorize new items, since they can see which records have already been catalogued and can therefore avoid unnecessary work.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2NovY877/&gt;
* ''Maximises library resources''.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt;
* ''Easier to maintain the catalog''. It enables cataloguers to detect and correct errors. In some instances, software programs support workers tasked with maintaining the catalog to do ongoing tasks such as automated clean-up.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY434/&gt; It helps creators and users of metadata.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY323/&gt;
* ''Fewer errors''. It can help catch errors caused by typos or misspellings which can sometimes accumulate over time, sometimes known as ''quality drift''. For example, machines can catch misspellings such as "Elementary school techers" and "Pumpkilns" which can then be corrected by library staff.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY312&gt;{{cite news

==Examples==

===Differing names describe the same subject===
[[File:Diana, Princess of Wales 1997 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] is described in one authority file as "Windsor, Diana, Princess of Wales" which is an official heading.]]

Sometimes within a catalog there are different names or spellings for only one person or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt;&lt;ref name = tws2NovY909 /&gt;  This can bring confusion since researchers may miss some information. Authority control is used by cataloguers to [[collocation|collocate]] materials that logically belong together but which present themselves differently. Records are used to establish [[uniform title]]s which collocate all versions of a given work under one unique heading even when such versions are issued under different titles. With authority control, one unique preferred name represents all variations and will include different variations, spellings and misspellings, uppercase versus lowercase variants, differing dates, and so forth. For example, in Wikipedia, the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] is described by an article [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] as well as numerous other descriptors, e.g. [[Princess Diana]], but both ''Princess Diana'' and ''Diana, Princess of Wales'' describe the same person; an authority record would choose one title as the preferred one for consistency. In an online library catalog, various entries might look like the following:&lt;ref name=tws2NovY111 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALT-for-dead-link-footnote"/&gt;

::#Diana. (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales. (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961-1997 (13)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales 1961-1997 (1)
::#Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961-1997 (2)
::#DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES, 1961-1997. (1)

These different terms describe the same person. Accordingly, authority control reduces these entries to one unique entry or official authorized heading, sometimes termed an ''access point'':

Generally there are different authority file headings and identifiers used by different libraries in different countries, possibly inviting confusion, but there are different approaches internationally to try to lessen the confusion. One international effort to prevent such confusion is the [[Virtual International Authority File]] which is a collaborative attempt to provide a single heading for a particular subject. It is a way to standardize information from different authority files around the world such as the [[Integrated Authority File]] (GND) maintained and used cooperatively by many libraries in German-speaking countries and the United States [[Library of Congress]]. The idea is to create a single worldwide virtual authority file. For example, the ID for [[Princess Diana]] in the GND is ''118525123'' (preferred name: ''Diana &amp;lt;Wales, Prinzessin&amp;gt;'') while the United States Library of Congress uses the term ''Diana, Princess of Wales, 1961-1997'';  other authority files have other choices. The Virtual International Authority File choice for all of these variations is ''VIAF ID: 107032638'' — that is, a common number representing all of these variations.&lt;ref name=VIAF&gt;[http://viaf.org/viaf/107032638/ Virtual International Authority File] records for Princess Diana, retrieved March 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Wikipedia prefers the term "Diana, Princess of Wales", but at the bottom of the article about her, there are links to various international cataloguing efforts for reference purposes.

===Same name describes two different subjects===
Sometimes two different authors have been published under the same name.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt; This can happen if there is a title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title.&lt;ref name=tws2NovYfuf/&gt; This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918–1965 when the person [[Floruit|flourished]], or a brief descriptive epithet. When cataloguers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can [[Word-sense disambiguation|disambiguate]] them using authority control.

==Authority records and files==
A customary way of enforcing authority control in a bibliographic catalog is to set up a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings used in the main catalog. This separate index is often referred to as an "authority file." It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by cataloguers in a given library (or—as is increasingly the case—cataloguing consortium), which cataloguers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings.  As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.&lt;ref name =tws2NovY434 /&gt;

While authority files provide information about a particular subject, their primary function is not to provide information but to organize it.&lt;ref name=tws2NovY434&gt;{{cite news | first = Karen | last = Calhoun |title= A Bird's Eye View of Authority Control in Cataloging | newspaper = Cornell University Library |date= June 1998 |url= http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/informatics/taf/proceedings/Calhoun.html |accessdate= November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain enough information to establish that a given author or title is unique, but that is all; irrelevant but interesting information is generally excluded.  Although practices vary internationally, authority records in the English-speaking world generally contain the following information:

* ''Headings'' show the preferred title chosen as the official and authorized version. It is important that the heading be unique; if there is a conflict with an identical heading, then one of the two will have to be chosen:
{{Quote |Since the headings function as access points, making sure that they are distinct and not in conflict with existing entries is important. For example, the English novelist William Collins (1824–89), whose works include the Moonstone and The Woman in White is better known as Wilkie Collins. Cataloguers have to decide which name the public would most likely look under, and whether to use a see also reference to link alternative forms of an individual's name.|Moya K.

* ''Cross references'' are other forms of the name or title that might appear in the catalog and include:
#''see'' references are forms of the name or title that describe the subject but which have been passed over or ''deprecated'' in favor of the authorized heading form
#''see also'' references point to other forms of the name or title that are also authorized. These ''see also'' references generally point to earlier or later forms of a name or title.
* ''Statement(s) of justification'' is a brief account made by the cataloguer about particular information sources used to determine both authorized and deprecated forms. Sometimes this means citing the title and publication date of the source, the location of the name or title on that source, and the form in which it appears on that source.

[[File:An example of an authority record.png|thumb|right|300px]]
For example, the Irish writer [[Brian O'Nolan]], who lived from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many [[pen name]]s such as Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form—"O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966"—as the official heading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://authorities.loc.gov/ | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Authorities files | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}; the original record has been abbreviated for clarity.&lt;/ref&gt;  The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading ''O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966'' is the form of the name that the [[Library of Congress]] chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its author heading. What follows immediately below the heading beginning with ''Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966'' are the ''see'' references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: "See O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966." There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: "Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966" has an extra ''C'' inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized ''C'' shows the correct root word while the preceding ''g'' indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. ''See also'' references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with ''His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939.'' constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds'', whereas the author's other ''noms de plume'' appeared on later publications.

==Access control==
The act of choosing a single authorized heading to represent all forms of a name is quite often a difficult and complex task, considering that any given individual may have legally changed their name or used a variety of legal names in the course of their lifetime, as well as a variety of nicknames, pen names, stage names or other alternative names. It may be particularly difficult to choose a single authorized heading for individuals whose various names have controversial political or social connotations, when the choice of authorized heading may be seen as endorsement of the associated political or social ideology.

An alternative to using authorized headings is the idea of ''access control,'' where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.&lt;ref&gt;Note: See Linda Barnhart's [http://worldcat.org/arcviewer/1/OCC/2003/06/20/0000003520/viewer/file81.html ''Access Control Records: Prospects and Challenges''] from the 1996 OCLC conference entitled ;  "Authority Control in the 21st Century " For more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperative cataloging==
Before the advent of digital [[online public access catalog]]s and the Internet, creating and maintaining a library's authority files were generally carried out by individual cataloging departments within each library. Naturally, then, there was considerable difference in the authority files of the different libraries. For the early part of library history, it was generally accepted that, as long as a library's catalog was internally consistent, the differences between catalogs in different libraries did not matter greatly.

As libraries became more attuned to the needs of researchers and began interacting more with other libraries, the value of standard cataloging practices came to be recognized. With the advent of automated database technologies, catalogers began to establish cooperative consortia, such as [[OCLC]] and [[RLIN]] in the [[United States]], in which cataloging departments from libraries all over the world contributed their records to, and took their records from, a shared database. This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.

In the United States, the primary organization for maintaining cataloging standards with respect to authority work operates under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]], and is known as the Name Authority Cooperative Program, or NACO Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/ |title=NACO Home: NACO (Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
There are various standards using different acronyms.

'''Standards for authority metadata''':
* [[MARC standards]] for authority records in machine-readable format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office |url=https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ecadhome.html |title=MARC 21 Format for Authority Data: Table of Contents (Network Development and MARC Standards Office, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metadata Authority Description Schema]] (MADS), an XML schema for an authority element set that may be used to provide metadata about agents (people, organizations), events, and terms (topics, geographics, genres, etc.).

The '''Bellamy-Ferriday House and Garden''' (also known as the '''Joseph Bellamy House''') is a [[historic house museum]] at 9 Main Street North in [[Bethlehem, Connecticut]].  The main house was built between about 1754 and 1767 by the Rev. [[Joseph Bellamy]], a prominent Congregationalist minister who played an influential role in the [[First Great Awakening]].  The property,  the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;  The house and surrounding gardens are owned and operated by [[Connecticut Landmarks]]; admission is charged.   Another 81 acres of forest and fields adjacent to the museum property are maintained as Bellamy Preserve, the town of Bethlehem's "Central Park," by the [[Bethlehem Land Trust]].

==Description and history==
The Bellamy-Ferriday House is located just north of the village green in the center of Bethlehem.  Its landscaped acreage is screened from the green by mature trees, and is accessed via a drive on Main Street North ([[Connecticut Route 61]]). The house consists of a 2-1/2 story main block, oriented facing south, with a two-story ell and modern wing to the north.  The main block is roughly square, and is topped by a gabled roof with a central chimney and gabled dormers.  Its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards with corner quoin blocks, and there is a projecting two-story entry section in the rightmost bay.  It has a Palladian window in the second floor, and a shallow portico supported by four fluted Ionic columns.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

Reverend [[Joseph Bellamy]] was granted {{convert|104|acre|ha}} of land on the north side of what is now Bethlehem village (it was then known as the North Purchase of [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]], incorporated as Bethlehem 1787) in 1738, when he became the North Purchase parish's first settled minister.  Through the 1740s and 1750s Bellamy rose in prominence as one of the leading theologians of the [[First Great Awakening]].  The traditional history of this house is that its ell was built about 1754 on land Bellamy purchased in 1741 that stood adjacent to his large tract, and is where his family lived while the main block was built.  The ell lacks evidence of a chimney adequate for cooking and heating, however, and it is more likely the house was built and occupied around 1760.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=82004444}}|title=NRHP nomination for Joseph Bellamy House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Henry Ferriday bought the property; his daughter, [[Caroline Ferriday|Carolyn Woolsey Ferriday]], owned it until her death in 1990.  Under the terms of her will, the house and several surrounding acres were subsequently turned into a small museum by the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, now known as [[Connecticut Landmarks]].

The museum features American and European antiques and a formal parterre garden with a collection of roses, peonies and lilacs. A weeping willow on the property once stood at the grave of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].

'''Captain Kidd's cannon''' is an [[iron]] [[cannon]] that was discovered in 2007 off of the coast of [[Catalina Island, Dominican Republic|Catalina Island]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="IUcannon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Kidd's pirate cannon from the Caribbean came to Indiana University |url=http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/13297.html |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818171929/http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/13297.html |archivedate=18 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon is believed to be part of the wreckage of the ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'', a ship that was commandeered and later abandoned by [[Captain Kidd]] in 1699. It is the first [[pirate]] cannon that has been recovered from the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="IUcannon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominican Island NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFadden|first=David|title=Captain Kidd's Ship Found Off Dominican Island|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071214-AP-caribbean-c.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of 26 cannons found off the coast of Catalina Island, it was first taken to [[Indiana University]]'s School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation for investigation and research before being displayed in the exhibit ''National Geographic: Treasures of the Earth'' at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].

==Description==
The cannon is made entirely of iron and weighs approximately {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=out}}. The cannon [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]] is {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=out|sp=us}} in diameter. The width of the [[trunnion]] is approximately {{convert|44|cm|in|abbr=out|sp=us}}. The diameter of the [[Cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] is approximately {{convert|39|cm|in|abbr=out|sp=us}}. The length of the cannon itself is approximately {{convert|209|cm|in|abbr=out|sp=us}}. Upon retrieval from the ocean, the cannon was encrusted with coral and the salt water had caused rusting and deterioration.&lt;ref name="IUcannon" /&gt;

==Recovery and conservation==
[[File:ElectrolyticReduction.ogg|thumb|right|A video describing the process of [[electrolytic reduction]] used in a display at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] within the Treasures of the Earth exhibit. The video describes the electrolytic process as it is occurring on Captain Kidd's Cannon, which is on display and currently undergoing the electrolytic process.]]
The cannon was found about {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=out|sp=us}} off the coastal waters of Catalina Island in the Dominican Republic. The cannon was only {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=out|sp=us}} below the surface of the water.&lt;ref name="Captain Kidd Vessel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Britten|first=N|title=Wreck believed to be vessel of Captain Kidd; race is on to protect 300 year old vessel, found a stones throw off of shore|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was extracted from the ocean, the cannon was transported to Indiana University to be studied. Initial investigations of the [[coral]] encrusted on the cannon allowed scientists to better understand the dynamics of the 1699 wreck of the ''Quedagh Merchant''. It is believed that the ship, once abandoned by Kidd, was looted and then set adrift and ablaze down the [[Rio Dulce (Guatemala)|Rio Dulce]].&lt;ref name="Pirate Hunter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacks|first=R|title=The Pirate Hunter: the true story of Captain Kidd|publisher=Hyperion|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7868-6533-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An underwater science lab conducted  [[electrochemistry|electrolytic]] conservation treatments to remove salt from the years of immersion in the ocean. Indiana University will construct a mold of the cannon and make museum-quality, exact reproductions which will be sent back to the Dominican Republic for development of a land-based exhibit on shore by the shipwreck.&lt;ref name="IUcannon"/&gt; The cannon continued to undergo the electrolytic conservation treatment when it arrived at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis for the National Geographic Treasures of the Earth exhibit.

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

In [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[popular culture]], there are a large number of [[Catalan myths and legends|legends]] about [[witch]]es ({{lang-ca|bruixes}}; {{IPA-ca|ˈbɾuʃəs|ec}}). In the popular imagination, a witch is a woman who, by means of a pact with the [[Devil]], has acquired supernatural power, which she uses for her own benefit and for evil purposes.  

Today, the general population no longer believes in witches, and many people view the witch only as a well-loved traditional character, appearing only in children's stories.

Catalan tradition distinguished between '''''bruixeria''''' ("witchcraft") based on an explicit compact with the Devil, and '''''fetilleria''''' (deriving from a word related to "fetish", and Old Portuguese ''feitiço''); magic worked through charms and fetishes. The former was considered inherently evil, the latter might include the working of magical cures. This article is focused on '''''bruixeria'''''.

==The mark of the devil==
Witches supposedly have "the [[mark of the devil]]" on their buttocks, made by a forceful bite by the Devil's teeth, which takes the form of two crossed horns, a toad, a ram with large horns, or a simple little circle. Legend also has it that the Devil can mark the witch's eye in various ways: with horns, or by making it empty, or with two pupils. Some traditions say that witches have two pupils in the left eye and deer horns in the right one. (This belief in the mark of the devil goes well beyond [[Catalonia]], although these particular forms are specifically Catalan.) 

According to Catalan tradition (again, this may not be uniquely Catalan), one can wash marks on the skin with [[holy water]] in order to know whether they are the Devil's work: the Devil's mark will not wash off. Witches were also said to have a heart-shaped mark on their left side; for a witch of great abilities, the heart-shaped mark would be hairy.

==The presence of witches==
It was said that the whispering of fallen leaves blown about a rooftop was the sound of witches criticizing the behavior of the family of the house. 

To prevent witches from sowing evil herbs to damage the fields and crops, one would place to the right of the gate a figure of a guardsman, precisely vertical. 

An old woman who could no longer hear the litany was in danger of being considered a witch for her deafness to the word of God.

==Power and practices==
According to one Catalan tradition, a person who wants to become a witch should go to the seashore, undress completely, and roll around on the sand. After giving seven full revolutions, stand and make three circles.

By the full moon of October and of January, witches were said to make marks on their buttocks, by means of which they maintain and strengthen their malign powers, which otherwise diminish and cool down by the action of time and age. In October, they were said to pray to the Devil with a rosary that had the cross broken off.

Witches were said to fly mounted on forks, poles, and especially brooms; in each case, the flying object was first anointed with an unguent provided by the Devil. It was said that, because in the past witches were always persecuted and garroted with brooms, the Devil had given them this particular power in order to be able to escape. While they fly, they supposedly would repeat, over and over''"Per ací, per allà, cap ací, cap allà",'' ("Here, there, hence, thence") as if they were in a cavalcade of animals.

Witches were said to make unguents or brews from the flesh of the hanged, from live infants, from black flour or grain, in a cauldron big enough to hold seven witches, cooked over a fire lit by the heat from their furious dancing. This was the unguent that enabled them to fly, to turn into whatever species of animal they desire, to prophesy, and to make all manner of evil spells. 

Witches were said to take the form of cats, in order to more easily enter houses and to enable them to take items of clothing, shoes, needles, and so forth. They supposedly stole in order to be able to bewitch and to do harm; they did not steal money nor valuable objects. 

Witches were said to be able to see the stars through the roof, to see people naked even through their clothing, and to look inside a person and know what organ is making that person ill. (This last may be related to the traditions of witches as [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]]s.)

Witches were said to climb up on top of the clouds, and make it rain or, especially, hail (which was particularly bad for the crops). One could ward this off by making certain signs of the cross or singing certain hymns, so that the devil would have to take the cloud elsewhere.

Witches were said to take toads as counsellors and to initiate to the novices. 

Many traditions about witches related to specific days of the year, especially the eves of certain [[Christian]] holidays and [[saint's day]]s; witches were also said to be very powerful during [[Lent]], which is, in a sense, the eve of [[Easter]].

===All Saints Day===
Certain traditional stories related specifically to [[All Saints Day]] (November 1).

On All Saints Day, witches were said to break the crosses from any graves they pass, destroying all proof of the existence of the buried dead.

Another tradition has it that one could destroy a witch by going to her house on November 1, and marking a star on the gate. One would then go to a mass dedicated to [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]. When the witch got home, the star would have burned, and the witch would be slowly consumed, her own witchcraft turned against her.

===Christmas Eve===
On [[Christmas Eve]], a witch was said to test the strength of her craft by looking upwards through the roof of her house; if she can't see all the stars, even the smallest, it is a sign that her condition is fading; then she must wait for the first full moon night, especially if it falls on [[New Year's Eve|Saint Silvester]]'s Day, to mark her buttocks and restore the power of her witchcraft.

It was said that one must not leave a toddler alone in the house on Christmas Eve, because the witches take them. There is a story that a woman of [[Palau de Vidre]] went to Midnight Mass and left her infant child at home alone; the witches supposedly took the child outside and left him on top of the garden gate.

''"Guardar un fil filat la nit de Nadal, guarda de les bruixes."'' ("To keep a thread spun on Christmas Eve, will keep you from the witches.")

===New Year's Eve===
On [[New Year's Eve]], witches were said to have the most power. To maintain that power, a witch was supposed to make seven laps around her house, make certain gestures and sprinkle everything with holy water, blessed leaves from Palm Sunday, or some other blessed object. (Note the remarkable contrast to traditions from elsewhere in Europe, where witches would shy away from any blessed object.) At the stroke of midnight, she would go to dance inside the oven; merely to come near a witch during any of this was said to be particularly dangerous. 

The witches of [[Alt Berguedà]] and [[Cadí]] were said to apply unguents, climb up the chimney and, mounted on brooms, head for [[Pedraforca]] to hold a great gathering. The main feature of the gathering was said to be a great circle dance. Similarly, the witches of the [[Alt Pallars]] and of the [[Vall d'Aran]] were said to meet on the plain of Beret. In [[Camp de Tarragona]], the witches were said to assemble on the peak of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], where they dance naked in the cold to the sound of a [[violin]] played by the Devil. 

On this night, also, witches were said to carry children away. On New Year's Eve, one should put the children to bed early and make the sign of the cross over them to ward off the evil power. 

Supposedly, at New Year's, more than any other night of the year, one must take measures against a visit by the witches. One would cover the embers of the fireplace with ashes, and make a cross over them with one or another fire tool, while reciting a formula (the text of which varies a great deal, from place to place within Catalonia). A householder would leave the fire tongs open in the form of a cross over the embers, or leave two fire tools crossed. These crosses were supposed to summon angels to come down and warm themselves by the embers and, by their presence, ward off devils and the witches. 

An alternative tradition was simply to put salt on the chimney. It also was the custom to wash and sprinkle with holy water all the doors and windows, and above all the keyhole, pushing through it a blessed sprig of laurel or rosemary and reciting a prayer (which, again, has a great number of variants). In the region of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] blessed palm leaves would be placed, crossed on the chimney to stop the witches from coming down it. In [[Lluçanés]], they would pour out all the water in the house to prevent the witches from being able to bewitch the house by washing it on their visit.

===The Eve of Saint John===
Another time of year when witches were specifically to be warded off was the Eve of the Feast of Saint [[John the Baptist]], a night associated with the gathering of herbs: supposedly, herbs gathered on that night were particularly powerful. On this night, witches were also said to take the form of partridges or of flies, and also to fly overhead and pour their poisonous brews onto the heads of those whom they wished to harm. 

Catalans would light bonfires to scare away the airborne witches. On that night, by the tower of [[Roquetes, Barcelona|Roquetes]], outside [[Sant Andreu de Palomar]] the flying embers were said to be witches fleeing the smoke from the bonfires; the flying witches were said to take embers in their hands to try to light the mountain afire, but they would fail because of the virtue that all herbs were said to have on this night. On the peak of Pedraforca, witches were said to gather and to sing:

:''Alfàbrega i valeriana,''
:''menta i ruda''
:''salven tota criatura''

:''Ruda i valeriana''
:''menta i alfàbrega,''
:''tot ho cura i tot ho salva.''

:''Menta i alfàbrega,''
:''ruda i valeriana''
:''salven tota persona nada.''

:''Ruda i Valeriana,''
:''alfàbrega i sàlvia ''
:''tot el món salven.''

: Basil and valerian,
: Mint and rue
: Save all creation

: Rue and valerian,
: Mint and basil
: Cure all and save all

: Mint and basil
: Rue and valerian
: Save every person born

: Rue and valerian
: Basil and sage
: Save the whole world

Their master, a goat, was said to leap and dance in the center of the circle, and to answer as a refrain to each verse:

:''Més val l'orella d'ós''
:''que ho cura i salva tot.''

: The borage leaf is worth more

: Which cures and saves all.

Unsurprisingly, it was said to be very dangerous to encounter one of these gatherings, but one could tell where the witches had danced by the remnants of rue, basil, valerian, and sage, and by the "fairy rings" of mushrooms. There is a story from [[Sant Martí de Sarroca]] in [[Penedès]], of an old man witnessing the witches' dance, with appropriately dramatic demonic appearances, the ground shaking like an earthquake from their steps, and so forth.

The witches of [[Andorra]], of both sexes, were said to dance naked at the lake of [[Engolasters]]. (This legend appears to be reflected in the recently revived festival of El Brut i La Bruta, celebrated in the Catalan village of [[Torà]] in the ''comarca'' of [[Segarra]]. ''See external site http://www.brutibruta.com.'') They form three concentric circles, and at a certain point in the music, they come together and the bump each other hard, rump to rump, dancing to the music of a demon, or a cavalcade of demons, with wooden flute and drum. Andorran witches also supposedly gathered at the summits of Font Argent and of Fra Miquel. Male and female witches were said to have intercourse with demons of the opposite sex.

Before this gathering, Andorran witches were required to fast and to sleep, but they sleep with one eye open, because if they were late for the gathering, the Devil would punish them.

==Other stories of Catalan witches==
Naturally, there are many other specific local stories of particular local witches, including one known as the ''Bruixa Napa del Prats del Lluçanès'' (or ''Bruixa Napa'', or ''Bruixa Prats'') who is often depicted accompanied by her daughter.

In [[Arbúcies]], there is a rhyme that goes:

:''Arbúcies,''
:''dotze dones, dotze bruixes.''

:Arbúcies,
:Twelve women, twelve witches.

Other stories include a story from [[Girona]] that a particular gargoyle is actually a witch turned to stone, or a story from [[Canigó]] of witches producing a hailstorm by urinating into a hole and beating the liquid with vines.

It may be worth reiterating that Catalans today are no more likely to believe in witches than any other modern people.  This article is strictly an attempt to give some specificity to the historic beliefs about witches in one particular region of Europe for which the beliefs are relatively well documented.

The '''''Collins Bird Guide''''' is a [[field guide]] to the birds of the [[Western Palearctic]].

Its authors are [[Lars Svensson (ornithologist)|Lars Svensson]], [[Killian Mullarney]], [[Dan Zetterström]] and [[Peter J. Grant]], and it is illustrated by [[Killian Mullarney]] and [[Dan Zetterström]] (with two plates of North American [[passerine]]s contributed by Larry McQueen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mullarney | first = Killian |author2=Svensson, Lars |author3=Zetterstrom, Dan |author4=Grant, Peter |title = Collins Bird Guide | year = 1999 | publisher = Collins |page = |isbn = 0-00-219728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "undoubtedly the finest field guide that has ever been produced", and "the last great bird book of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Golley | first = Mark | title = Book review: Collins bird guide | journal = [[Birding World]] | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 254–5 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally published in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Svensson| first = Lars |author2=Grant, Peter |author3=Mullarney, Killian |author4=Zetterstrom, Dan |title = Fågelguiden : Europas och Medelhavsområdets Fåglar i Fält | year = 1999 | publisher = Bonnier |page = |isbn = 978-91-34-51038-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Svensson| first = Lars |author2=Grant, Peter |author3=Mullarney, Killian |author4=Zetterstrom, Dan |title = Fugle i felten: Feltbestemmelse af fugle i Europa og Middelhavsområdet | year = 1999 | publisher = L&amp;R Fakta |isbn = 87-614-0107-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in hardback in the same year, and later in paperback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Svensson| first = Lars| title = The birth of a new field guide | journal = Birding World | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 78–80 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-format English edition has also been produced, as has a German and Dutch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ANWB Vogelgids van Europa, second edition | publisher = ANWB | url=http://webwinkel.anwb.nl/webwinkel/boeken-en-kaarten/flora-fauna-gidsen/anwb-vogelgids-van-europa.html | pages = 448 | ISBN = 9789018030803 | accessdate = 7 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; edition. The first edition was translated to 14 European languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and German. A second edition, revised and enlarged, was published in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Collins Bird Guide, second edition | publisher = HarperCollins | url=http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Our_Titles/Pages/Home.aspx?objID=36363 | accessdate = 23 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of updates and corrections were made in 2015, with no change to the edition number.&lt;ref name="RBA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collins Bird Guide updated, but did anyone know?|url=http://www.rarebirdalert.co.uk/v2/Content/Collins_Bird_Guide_updated_but_did_anyone_know.aspx?s_id=532461164|website=www.rarebirdalert.co.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the first edition, in all formats, depicts a [[barn owl]]. On the second edition, this was replaced by an [[arctic tern]].

Eleven pages of introductory material are followed by the book's main content: 366 pages of text and colour paintings. The text for each species gives brief status notes, followed by a section detailing identification, and concludes with a section on voice. Accompanying most species accounts is a small colour map showing breeding, wintering and migrant range.

The guide is also available as a paid-for app, for iPhone and Android devices.&lt;ref name="BG1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collins Bird Guide app - BirdGuides|url=https://www.birdguides.com/reviews/apps-software/collins-bird-guide-app/|website=www.birdguides.com|accessdate=2 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kehoe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kehoe |first1=Chris |title=Collins Bid Guide app for Android |journal=[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]] |date=February 2018 |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=114-116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The app includes all of the text and images from the print edition, as well as audio recordings.&lt;ref name="Kehoe" /&gt; Additional data can be bought separately; the first such package being a set of distribution maps for 271 species, from the [[British Trust for Ornithology]]'s ''Bird Atlas 2007–11''.&lt;ref name="Kehoe" /&gt;

All versions cover Europe, North Atlantic islands, much of North Africa and the Middle East. 

Most of the species covered in the main part of the guide are regular breeding, wintering or migrant species in its area of coverage, although some vagrants are also included. There are additional sections giving brief accounts of (a) vagrants and (b) introduced breeding species and species recorded only as escapes.

Eugene Vinaver studied in [[École pratique des hautes études]] where he was a pupil of [[Joseph Bédier]].

== Life in England ==
From the late 1920s, he lived in England (one of his teachers was [[Mildred Pope]]&lt;ref name=stuard&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Elspeth |editor=Jane Chance |chapter=Mildred K. Pope (1872–1956): Anglo-Norman Scholar |title=Women medievalists and the academy |year=2005 |publisher=U of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=978-0-299-20750-2 |pages=147–56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QrnjT2NT5MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in 1933 he was appointed Professor of French Language and Literature at the [[University of Manchester]]. He received his doctorate from [[Oxford University]] in 1950.

In 1928, Eugene Vinaver founded in Oxford the Arthurian society, which published two volumes under the title ''Arthuriana'' (1929, 1930). This society was renamed [[Society for the study of the medieval languages and literatures]]. Arthuriana became ''Medium Aevum''. In 1948, the [[International Arthurian Society]] was organized by Eugène Vinaver and [[Jean Frappier]].

In 1947, Eugène Vinaver published a new edition of Malory's ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'', based on the 15th century [[Le Morte d'Arthur|Winchester Manuscript]] which W.F. Oakeshott had discovered in the Fellows' Library at [[Winchester College]] in 1934. He noted the structural differences between the text in the manuscript and Caxton's edition of ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'', such as chapter headings and divisions, and wording changes.

In addition to his interest in Arthurian legend, Vinaver was also a recognised authority on [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Flaubert]].

Vinaver was a correspondent member of the [[British Academy]], laureate of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Medieval Academy of America]], a foreign member of [[Académie royale de langue et de littérature française]] of Belgium. He was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor.

==Description==
In early autumn when, as the title specifies, the wind is southerly and the sky is clear, the rising sun can turn [[Mount Fuji]] red. Hokusai captures this moment with compositional abstraction but meteorological specificity, especially when compared to the rest of the series. The three shades of deepening blue of the sky mirror the three hues of the mountain. The lingering remnants of snow at the peak of the mountain and dark shadows encompassing the forest at its base place it very precisely in time.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; Mount Fuji's solidly symmetrical shape on the right half of the image is balanced by the delicate clouds to the left, for a striking composition.&lt;ref name="ima"/&gt;

==Impressions==
[[File:Pink Fuji -- Hokusai.png|thumb|left|Early impression]]
The earliest impressions appear faded when compared to the versions usually seen, but are closer to Hokusai's original conception. The original prints have a deliberately uneven blue sky, which increases the sky's brightness and gives movement to the clouds. The peak is brought forward with a halo of [[Prussian blue]].  Subsequent prints have a strong, even blue tone and the printer added a new block, overprinting the white clouds on the horizon with light blue. Later prints also typically employ a strong ''benigara'' (Bengal red) pigment, which lent the painting its common name of ''Red Fuji''.  The green block colour was recut, lowering the meeting point between forest and mountain slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=42598013|first= Roger S.|last=Keyes|journal=Impressions|title=Pink Fuji: The Print Hokusai Saw|issue=29|pages=68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Clear_Sky_(alternate_version)_--_Hokusai.jpg|thumb|right|Variant impression]]
An alternative impression of the print was made with a completely different colour-scheme. In this version the clouds are only just visible in the upper portion. The sky is a mostly rendered in a flat pale blue with a thin strip of grey at the top, and a graduated strip of Prussian blue along the horizon which extends up the slope of the mountain.

==Historical information==
This print and Hokusai's other masterpiece from his ''Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji'' series, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', are perhaps the most widely recognized pieces of Japanese art in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossland|first=Thomas|last2=Grundtitle|first2=Dr. Andreas|title=The 'Faked' Fuji Print|publisher=Ukiyoe-Gallery|year=2004|url=http://www.ukiyoe-gallery.com/fake-fuji.htm|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are superb examples of the Japanese art of [[Ukiyo-e]], "pictures of the floating world". Although Ukiyo-e can depict anything from contemporary city life to classical literature, and Hokusai's notebooks show that his own interests spanned an equally wide range, it was landscapes like this that earned him his fame. The saturated colors and stylized forms in such prints helped inspire the [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-impressionist]] movements decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=1988|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">'''Hermann Streber''' (b. at [[Munich]], 27 September 1839; d. at [[Tölz]], 9 August 1896) was a German [[Roman Catholic]] priest and writer, particularly associated with the second edition of the ''[[Kirchenlexikon]]''.

== Life ==
His father was [[Franz Seraph Streber]]. He entered the Ludwigsgymnasium in 1850, but a nervous fever prevented him from qualifying for the university through the usual final school examination. From this ailment he never completely recovered.

Entering the university by a private examination in 1858, he devoted over two years to the study of philosophy and theology, attending besides historical lectures. During this period he compiled a description and catalogue of the ancient coins in the Royal Cabinet of Medals. In 1861 he entered the archiepiscopal seminary at [[Freising]], and in 1864 was ordained priest.

After the death of his father he was unable to pursue his original intention of studying [[numismatics]]. In 1867 he was appointed religious teacher at the Wilhelmsgymnasium. Having received six months' leave of absence in 1868, he won the doctorate in theology in Rome (January, 1869). He then resumed his duties as religious teacher until June, 1870, when he was dismissed for alleged "intriguing in favour of the dogma of infallibility".

He was then named pastor of [[Wolfersdorf]], near Freising. Invited by [[Joseph Hergenröther]] to assist him in editing the new edition of the ''Kirchenlexikon'', Streber resigned his parish, and settled in [[Würzburg]]. When Hergenröther was summoned as cardinal to Rome, Streber moved to [[Bonn]] to be near [[Kaulen]], the new editor, and worked on the "Nomenclator". He wrote many articles for the ''Kirchenlexikon'', the direction of which was for a time entirely in his hands.

In 1892 illness forced him to withdraw to his brother's house at Tölz, where he lived in retirement until death.

'''HomeStars.com''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] company which publishes reviews written by homeowners about home improvement professionals such as [[repairman]], [[General contractor|contractors]], renovators, and retailers.

HomeStars was formed in 2006 by Nancy Peterson.&lt;ref name=bnn&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto startup simplifies home renovations|url=http://www.bnn.ca/Video/player.aspx?vid=634565|publisher=[[Business News Network]]|date=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Globe and Mail]] ran a feature on the company shortly after its foundation.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rand-Watkinson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Finally, a rating system for renovation professionals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/finally-a-rating-system-for-renovation-professionals/article1106226/|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began as an [[online community]] of homeowners, sharing reviews based on their personal experience to help other homeowners find reputable contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Penny|title=What to Look for in a Good Contractor|url=http://torontoism.com/real-estate/2015/06/good-contractor-tips|publisher=Torontoism|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart Macneill|first1=Kim|title=What It Takes to Build Credibility|url=http://www.profitguide.com/small-business/what-it-takes-to-build-credibility-58218|publisher=ProfitGuide|date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each review can contain details on the delivery of the work, the contractor’s work habits and the quality of the follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanderson|first1=Vicky|title=Best building material is knowledge|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/01/27/best_building_material_is_knowledge.html|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to other review sites such as [[TripAdvisor]], contractors are able to respond to any reviews that are written about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carniol|first1=Naomi|title=Reno website sheds light on contractors|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/small_business/2010/10/26/reno_website_sheds_light_on_contractors.html|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Post]] announced in 2015 that HomeStars had over two million companies listed on its website and hundreds of thousands of consumer reviews about those contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bitti|first1=Mary Teresa|title=How HomeStars beat the odds to get past the five year mark and scale up|url=http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/growth-strategies/how-homestars-beat-the-odds-to-get-past-the-five-year-mark-and-scale-up?__lsa=178c-0273|publisher=[[National Post]]|date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ProfitGuide ranked HomeStars as the 77th fastest growing company in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#77 - HomeStars|url=http://www.profitguide.com/microsite/profit500/2015/ranking/77-homestars|publisher=ProfitGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder and CEO, Nancy Peterson, won an award in 2015 as one of [[Canada]]'s top female entrepreneurs, where she ranked in 71st position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#71 Nancy Peterson|url=http://www.profitguide.com/microsite/profitw100/2015/ranking/71-homestars|publisher=ProfitGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The company has received praise for how it ensures its reviews are authentic.

While the company has received mainly positive feedback, some contractors have voiced their anger after receiving bad reviews. Peterson was quoted by [[The Globe and Mail]] saying ''"we're doing the right thing if companies hate us"'', when discussing negative comments about the website.&lt;ref name=hateus /&gt; Another article has suggested that when contractors provide inadequate services, it is only natural for the contractor to blame [[review website]]s and not their own poor services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belton|first1=Padraig|title=Navigating the potentially murky world of online reviews|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33205905|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of lawsuits where contractors had attempted to file [[defamation]] lawsuits against homeowners who had written negative reviews about poor work. HomeStars helps people understand the difference between a negative review and a defamatory review.&lt;ref name=roseman /&gt; HomeStars was criticized for publishing a high rating on a contractor who then went bankrupt and left customers who had made large down-payments with unfinished work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Laura|title=Contractors going bankrupt mid-renovation a "nightmare" for homeowners: experts|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/01/04/stranded_homeowners_employees_hold_protest_at_house_of_failed_homebuilder.html|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HomeStars was acquired by HomeAdvisors parent company IAC, in February 2017. HomeAdvisor offers similar services in the US, and the acquisition of HomeStars is part of HomeAdvisor's strategy "to build a dominant global business and brand" according to their press release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://IAC's%20HomeAdvisor%20Acquires%20HomeStars,%20the%20Leading%20Canadian%20Home%20Services%20Platform Newswire.ca release, IAC's HomeAdvisor Acquires HomeStars, the Leading Canadian Home Services Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1093">IBM has developed [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] to compare the performance of their various [[IBM System i|iSeries]] server offerings. '''Computational Intensive Workload''' (CIW) measures performance in a situation where there is a high ratio of computation to Input/Output communication. The reverse situation is simulated by the '''Commercial Processing Workload''' (CPW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=End to End Performance Management on IBM i|url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247808.pdf|date=November 2009|publisher=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPW is a simplified variant of the industry-wide [[TPC-C]] benchmarking standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypJmzqt7JdUC&amp;pg=PA148|title=Fortress Rochester: the inside story of the IBM iSeries|author=Frank G.

{{nihongo|'''Izanagi'''|いざなぎ||recorded in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' as 伊邪那岐 and in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' as 伊弉諾}} is a deity born of the [[Kamiyonanayo|seven divine generations]] in [[Japanese mythology]] and [[Shinto]], and his name in the ''Kojiki'' is roughly translated to as "he-who-invites" or '''Izanagi-no-mikoto'''. He is also known as '''Izanagi-no-Okami'''.

==Accounts in mythology==

===Izanagi and Izanami===
{{See also|Izanami|Kuniumi|Yomotsu-shikome}}
He with his spouse and younger sister [[Izanami]] gave birth to the many islands of Japan (''[[kuniumi]]''), and begat numerous deities of [[Shintoism]] (''[[kamiumi]]''). But she died after giving birth to the fire-god [[Kagu-tsuchi]]. Izanagi executed the fire god with the "ten-grasp sword" ([[Totsuka-no-Tsurugi]]). Afterwards, he paid his wife a visit in [[Yomi-no-kuni]] (the [[Underworld]]) in the hopes of retrieving her. But she had partaken of food cooked in the furnace of the Underworld, rendering her return impossible. Izanagi betrayed his promise not to look at her, and lit up a fire, only to behold her in her monstrous and hellish state. To avenge her shame, she dispatched the lightning god ''Yakusa no ikazuchi no kami'' (''[[Raijin]]'') and the horrible hag [[Yomotsu-shikome]] to chase after him. Izanagi escaped, but the goddess vowed to kill a thousand of his people every day. Izanagi retorted that a thousand and five hundred will be born every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillipi |first=Donald L. |title=Kojiki |year=1969 |publisher=University of Tokyo Press |location=Tokyo |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chamberlain-I-IX&gt;{{cite book |last=Chamberlain |first=Sir Basil Hall |contribution=A Translation of the 'Ko-ji-ki', or Records of Ancient Matters |title=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan |place=Yokohama |publisher= |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSryAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA36 |volume=VI, Section IX |pages=86}}; Reedited in {{cite book|editor-last=Horne|editor-first=Charles Francis |title=The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East: With an Historical Survey and Descriptions|volume=13|place=|publisher=Parke|year=1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZEOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8|pages=8–61}} Wikisource: {{ws|"[[s:s:Kojiki#THE LAND OF HADES|"2.1 The Land of Hades"]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aston&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Aston |first=William George |title=Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697 |volume=1 |place=London |publisher=Japan Society of London |year=1896 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IJrNAKBpycC&amp;pg=PA24 |author-link=William George Aston |pages=24-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleansing and birth of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo ===
{{Further|Kamiumi#Purification of Izanagi}}
In the cleansing right after his return, he beget [[Amaterasu]] (the [[sun]] goddess) from his left eye, [[Tsukuyomi]] (the [[moon]] god) from his right eye and [[Susanoo]] (tempest or [[storm]] god) from his nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014qnld |title=In Our Time |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |host=Melvyn Bragg |date=22 Sep 2011 |time=17:14 |accessdate=29 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels==
Izanagi's visit to his wife Izanami in [[Yomi-no-kuni]] somewhat parallels the Greek [[Orpheus]]'s visit to [[Eurydice]] in the underworld,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweet |first=Charles Filkins |title=New life in the oldest empire |publisher=Macmillan |year=1919 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ja&amp;lr=&amp;id=JZtFAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a more striking resemblance is his wife's inability to return after eating the food in hell, matched by [[Persephone]] of Greek myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George Bailey |title=A History of Japan: To 1334 |publisher=Macmillan |year=1919 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2c4t4yw21gC&amp;pg=PA30 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an odd resemblance to the tale of [[Adam and Eve]], while one of China's Four Great Folktales, ''[[Baishe Zhuan]]'', appears to be a modernized retelling{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

'''Jacob Druyvesteyn''' (1612 &amp;ndash; 1691) was a Dutch lawyer and mayor of [[Haarlem]].

==Biography==
He was born in Haarlem as the son of [[Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn]] and became a lawyer.&lt;ref name=Aa&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog05_01/aa__001biog05_01_0797.php Jacob Druyvesteyn] in A. J. van der Aa&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed magistrate in the city council from 1637 and in 1639 he was portrayed as a flag bearer in [[Frans Hals]]' schutterstuk ''[[The Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1639]]''.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; Traditionally flag bearers were bachelors, but he was not a bachelor for long, because he married Wilhelmina Coymans, the wealthy daughter of [[Joseph Coymans]] in the same year. In 1647 he became mayor like his father before him. Among other offices, he served as head bailiff of Kennemerland and board member of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and in 1657 he was colonel of the [[schutterij]].&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt; 

He had 9 children, and his son Aarnoudt also became mayor. He died in Haarlem.

Originally, "Light’s Golden Jubilee" was a celebration organized by the [[General Electric Company]], which had absorbed Edison's original business and saw great business value in drawing connections between itself and the illustrious inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephson, ''Edison: A Biography'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1959), 477&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Edison and his family, however, believed that the aging inventor was being used and appealed to Henry Ford, Edison's long-time friend.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephson, ''Edison: A Biography'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1959), 477-478&lt;/ref&gt;   Eventually, the celebration turned into a collaboration between Henry Ford and General Electric, though Ford won control over much of the ceremony, which he relocated from its planned location in [[Schenectady, New York]] — General Electric's headquarters — to [[Dearborn, Michigan]], the site of Ford's Greenfield Village.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephson, ''Edison: A Biography'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1959), 478&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The events began with a train procession to Dearborn, with Edison getting off at the Smith Creek Station, where he had been ejected as a young [[Thomas Edison#Telegrapher|telegraph operator]] many years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress'' (New York: Viking, 2003), 377&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the inventor had arrived in Dearborn, in what [[Benedict Anderson]] has called "an experience of simultaneity," millions from around the country were invited to join in the commemoration of the ‘father of light.’&lt;ref&gt;Benedict R. Anderson, ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' (London: Verso, 1983), 145&lt;/ref&gt; The entire country was urged to turn off their lights for the evening, only to flick the switch back on at the exact moment when the elderly and emotional Edison, seated in his now-relocated laboratory in Greenfield Village, connected two wires to recreate the exact moment of the invention of the light bulb, a moment broadcast over the radio airwaves on as many as 140 stations.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People’s Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 402&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening concluded with numerous speeches at a formal candlelight dinner, which took place in Ford's still unfinished replica of [[Independence Hall]] at Greenfield Village, complete with its own [[Liberty Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Neil Baldwin]], ''Edison: Inventing the Century'' (New York: Hyperion, 1995), 396&lt;/ref&gt;  In attendance were celebrities such as President [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Lou Henry Hoover|Mrs. Hoover]], in their first voyage outside of the capital since President Hoover's inauguration, [[Walter Chrysler]], [[Marie Curie]], [[George Eastman]], [[Aimée de Heeren]], Treasury Secretary [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Adolph Ochs]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Julius Rosenwald]], [[Charles M. Schwab|Charles Schwab]], and [[Orville Wright]], with [[Albert Einstein]] chiming in during the speeches via a special radio hookup.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Baldwin, ''Edison: Inventing the Century'' (New York: Hyperion, 1995), 396&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the praise lavished upon him, Edison, overcome with emotion, said, "The experience makes me realize as never before that Americans are sentimental and this crowning event of Light’s Golden Jubilee fills me with gratitude.  As to Henry Ford, words are inadequate to express my feelings.  I can only say to you that, in the fullest and richest meaning of the term—he is my friend."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress'' (New York: Viking, 2003), 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The preceding year had similarly been filled with smaller-scale demonstrations of the influence of Edison's innovations: electrical displays across the country; Broadway signs temporarily darkened to show the difference their light made in the atmosphere of cities across the country; and an "open season" for biographies, newspaper articles, and commemorations of the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;"Science: Golden Jubilee," ''Time Magazine'', May 27, 1929, accessed October 25, 2011, [http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,927947-1,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Thomas Edison Institute===
As part of the celebration, Ford formally dedicated Greenfield Village to his friend Thomas Edison, a man who once encouraged a young Henry Ford to pursue the creation of a gasoline powered automobile.  Upon hearing of Ford's efforts to create a "[[horseless carriage|carriage without any horses]]," Edison urged the young inventor along, shouting, as Ford himself recalls it, "Young man, that’s the thing!" and emphatically banging his fist on a table.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress'' (New York: Viking, 2003), 246&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark component of Ford's creation was Edison's original laboratory, library, and machine shop from Edison's home of [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]], relocated by Ford "at great cost" and complete with seven train cars of, as Edison put it, the same "damn New Jersey clay."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People’s Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 401&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference, Edison claimed, between this relocated laboratory and his original was that "we never kept it as clean as this!"&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brinkley, ''Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress'' (New York: Viking, 2003), 377&lt;/ref&gt;   Ultimately, Henry Ford spent about $3 million on Greenfield Village's collection of "Edisonia" alone.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephson, ''Edison: A Biography'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1959), 476&lt;/ref&gt;   After Edison's death, the Henry Ford Museum at Greenfield Village would hold the inventor's literal last breath, trapped, at Ford's request, in a bottle by Edison's son.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Grandin, ''Fordlandia: the Rise and Fall of Henry Ford’s Forgotten Jungle City'' (New York: Henry Holt &amp; Company, 2009), 256&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21545">A '''record chart''', also known as a '''music chart''', is a method of ranking [[music]] judging by the [[popularity]] during a given period of time. Examples of record charts are the [[Hit parade]], [[Hot 100]] or [[Top 40]]. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other [[sales]] statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.

Record charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of [[Gramophone record|records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[compact disc]]s; amount of [[radio]] airplay; requests to radio [[disk jockey]]s; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of [[music download|download]]s.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts.  [[Component chart]]s have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

Reviewers often describe records using [[round number]] milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a "Top 10" [[hit single|hit]], even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.

[[Image:Lu Rebellamentu di Sichilia.jpg|thumb|The ''Rebellamentu'' in a [[codex]] that was kept in the Biblioteca Nazionale di Palermo until it was bought by the prince of San Giorgio Spinelli di Napoli in 1870. The left page contains the excerpt that is transcribed below.]]
'''''Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia''''', fully '''''Cronica di lu rebellamentu di Sichilia contra re Carlu''''',&lt;ref&gt;"Chronicle of the rebellion of Sicily against [[Charles of Anjou|King Charles [of Anjou]]]"; the title as it appears in Enrico Sicardi (1917), ''Due cronache del Vespro'', in [[Lodovico Muratori]], ''Raccolta'', XXXIV.3&amp;ndash;29, is ''Lu Rebellamentu di Sichilia, lu quali hordinam e fichi fari Misser Iohanni di Prochita, contra Re Carlu, narrato da Anonimo Messinese, sec. XIII'', derived from a line in the work.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] historical chronicle of the [[War of the Vespers]] written around 1290. The anonymous ''Rebellamentu'', probably written at [[Messina]], was ascribed to [[Atanasiu di Iaci]] by Pasquale Castorina in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cusimano (1962), "Atanasiu di Iaci," ''Dizionario biografico degli Italiani'', vol. 4 (Rome: Società Grafica Romana), 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ''Rebellamentu'' sometimes adds valuable details to the history of the Vespers, it is frequently untrustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton (1976), ''The Papacy and the Levant, 1204&amp;ndash;1571: The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries'' (DIANE Publishing), 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Its monastic provenance is evident in its moralising tone. The antiquity of its language has placed its authenticity beyond doubt, despite its lack of an early manuscript tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Bertoni (1910), ''Il Duecento'' (Milan), 426.&lt;/ref&gt; This has not prevented speculation that it was written contemporarily with events: one verb in one manuscript is found in the first-person present; this may represent the author inadvertently stepping out of his usual frame of reference, or merely an error in that manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Runciman]] (1958), ''The Sicilian Vespers: A History of the Mediterranean World in the Later Thirteenth Century'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 290&amp;ndash;91, who dismisses the contemporary dating, but defends its early provenance nonetheless.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rebellamentu'' covers the years 1279&amp;ndash;82 and treats [[John of Procida]] as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, 317. Its treatment of John of Procida helps secure its approximate date: after John was condemned by the Church in 1298, there would have been very little incentive to sing his praise.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the earliest chronicle to record that violence broke out after a Sicilian woman was raped by a French soldier, a story also recorded by Atanasiu di Iaci elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bolton Holloway (1993), ''Twice-told Tales: Brunetto Latino and Dante Alighieri'' (Florence: Aureo Anello Books), 129. This story of rape was adopted by [[Brunetto Latino]] for his ''Tesoro''. In this regard the ''Rebellamentu'' is contradicted by the pro-French ''Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco''.&lt;/ref&gt; It says that when the Sicilians complained to [[Charles of Anjou]] about their high taxes, he responded, "''Vi farro spendiri munita di soli, como altra volta havitu spisu'',"&lt;ref&gt;"I will make you spend coinage of shoe leather, as you have done in the past."&lt;/ref&gt; threatening that he would re-issue leather money as had been done in the past. This probably indicates that the legend that [[William I of Sicily|William I]] issued leather money, otherwise first recorded by [[Tommaso Fazello]] in his ''De Rebus Siculis'' (1558), was current in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Grierson and Lucia Travaini (1986), ''Medieval European Coinage: With a Catalogue of the Coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge'', vol. 14, Italy (III), South Italy, Sicily, Sardinia (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 127. The legend, for which there is no historical basis, probably derives from an ancient legend about [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. According to [[Ricordano Malispini]] and Villani, the [[Emperor Frederick II]], as King of Sicily, issued [[:wiktionary:obsidional|obsidional]] leather currency during his siege of [[Faenza]] in 1241&amp;ndash;2, to pay his troops. Each piece was worth one [[augustale]] and was redeemed later for gold, but the authenticity of these near-contemporary records is suspects because of the currency of similar legends since antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rebellamentu'' also makes the [[Orsini]] [[Pope Nicholas III]] party to a conspiracy to dethrone Charles of Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Loud (1987), Review of ''I Vespri siciliani e le relazioni tra Roma e Bisanzio: Studio critico sulle fonti'' by Antonino Franchi, ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', '''102'''(403), 472: "Few other commentators have followed the tract ''lu Rebellamentu di Sichilia'', despite its fairly early date, in seeing Nicholars III as a party to the conspiracy against Charles of Anjou&amp;mdash;if such conspiracy there was. Even if Nicholas did refuse to renew Charles as Senator of Rome, he was still dependent on Angevin troops to maintain his hold over the [[Papal state]]."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]], who was biased against the Orsini because of the legation of [[Napoleone Orsini Frangipani|Napoleone Orsini]] to Florence in 1306, supports the allegation. 

The ''Rebellamentu'' covers John's negotiations with the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] and with [[Peter III of Aragon]], the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the coronation of Peter in [[Palermo]] in August 1282, the retreat of Charles to [[Calabria]], and the entry of Peter and John into [[Messina]] in October 1282. The excerpt below describes how Peter was crowned by the [[Bishop of Cefalù]] because the incumbent of the [[Archdiocese of Palermo]], [[Piero II de Santa Fede]], had recently died, and the [[Archbishop of Monreale]], [[Giovanni Roccamezza]], was away in Rome:

: In the year of Our Lord Christ one thousand two hundred and eighty two, in the month of August the king of Aragon rode from Trapani to Palermo, and the Palermitans were extraordinarily happy of its coming, as men waiting to be freed by death; they welcomed him at least six miles outside the city, with a big uproar of women and girls, men, effeminates, Counts and Barons and Knights, anyway the Archbishop of Monreale didn't wish to crown him (and also the Archbishop of Palermo had recently died) in so much that he ran away, and walked by foot to the Pope; so the king wasn't crowned, but was said to be a people's king [...] This was the rebellion of Sicily, that was planned and led by Lord John of Procida against king Charles [...] They moved against the French, who were alerted from the noises, and there was a battle between French and Palermitans, and between the noises of the battle, of rocks and weapons, you could hear the screams "death to the French" and they entered the city with great clamor, and they went through the squares, and they killed as many French as they could kill, and between them there was the captain who at that time had been a supporter of king Charles.

The Spinelli Codex, the oldest surviving copy of the text, was probably copied from an older manuscript (perhaps the original) around 1330. It was published in English translation in 2015.

Two later [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] histories of the Vespers&amp;mdash;the ''[[Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco]]'' and the ''[[Leggenda di Messer Gianni di Procida]]''&amp;mdash;may share the ''Reballamentu'' as a source. Conversely, all three may derive from an earlier, now lost source. All three agree on the centrality of John of Procida in the Vespers.&lt;ref&gt;Deno John Geanakoplos (1959), ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West, 1258–1282: A Study in Byzantine–Latin Relations'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press), 351. &lt;/ref&gt; The [[opera]] ''[[Les vêpres siciliennes]]'' (1855), with music by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and a [[libretto]] by [[Eugène Scribe]], drew upon the ''Rebellamentu'' for elements of its story, notably the rape.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford R. Backman (2002), ''The Decline and Fall of Medieval Sicily: Politics, Religion, and Economy in the Reign of Frederick III, 1296&amp;ndash;1337'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 6. [[Leon Plantinga]] (1984), ''Romantic Music: A History of Musical Style in Nineteenth-Century Europe'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.), 312, writes that the libretto by Scribe was heavily influenced by Verdi, citing Andrew Porter (1978&amp;ndash;9), "''Les vêpres siciliennes'': New Letters from Verdi to Scribe," ''Nineteenth-Century Music'', '''2'''(2), 95&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maritime Museum of San Diego''', established in 1948, preserves one of the largest collections of historic sea vessels in the United States. Located on the [[San Diego Bay]], the centerpiece of the museum's collection is the ''[[Star of India (ship)|Star of India]]'', an 1863 iron [[bark (ship)|bark]]. The museum maintains the MacMullen Library and Research Archives aboard the 1898 ferryboat ''[[Berkeley (ferryboat)|Berkeley]]''. The museum also publishes the quarterly peer-reviewed journal ''Mains'l Haul: A Journal of Pacific Maritime History''.

The Maritime Museum at the Star of India Wharf is located on the west side of North Harbor Drive, between the ends of Ash Street and Grape Street, south of [[San Diego International Airport]].

==San Salvador replica==
Starting in 2011 the Maritime Museum of San Diego built a full-sized, fully functional, historically accurate replica of [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]]’s flagship, ''[[San Salvador (Cabrillo's ship)|San Salvador]]''. The replica was constructed in full public view in the bayside Spanish Landing park in San Diego, giving people the opportunity to watch a living recreation of the first modern industrial activity in the Americas. She was launched in 2015 and is stationed at the San Diego Bay Embarcadero as part of the Museum's fleet of historic and replica ships. She opened for public tours in September 2016 in conjunction with the Maritime Museum's annual Festival of Sail. Later that month she is expected to start making coastal tours up the California coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sdbj.com/news/2016/aug/30/maritime-museum-debuting-tours-san-salvador-replic/|title=Maritime Museum Debuting Tours of San Salvador Replica|last=Hirsh|first=Lou|date=August 30, 2016|work=San Diego Business Journal|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr.''', or '''Mila Rechcigl''', is a trained [[biochemist]], [[nutritionist]] and [[cancer]] [[researcher]], writer, [[editing|editor]], [[historian]], [[bibliographer]] and [[genealogist]]. He was one of the founders and past President for many years of the [[Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences]].

==Biography==
He was born on July 30, 1930 in [[Mladá Boleslav]], [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mladoboleslavsko v promenách casu (Prague &amp; Mladá Boleslav: Nakladatelství Libri &amp; Okresní muzeum, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Miloslav Rechcigl, Sr.]], was a prominent politician in the pre-World War II Czechoslovakia, having been elected as the youngest member to the Czechoslovak Parliament and who held the position of President of the Millers Association of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottuv Slovník Naucný Nové Doby.  Prague: "Novina", 1938, vol. V. 1, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; After the communist takeover, he escaped from his native country and in 1950 immigrated to the United States, where he became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"A 'B' for Behavior for the Miller's Son", Welcome to the Heart of Europe, vol. 2, No. 1 (1995), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Cornell University]] from 1951–58, receiving his B.S., M.N.S., and Ph.D. degrees there, specializing in [[biochemistry]], [[nutrition]], [[physiology]], and [[food science]].

He then spent two years conducting research at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], as a [[Postdoctoral]] Research [[Fellow]]. Subsequently, he was appointed as research biochemist to the staff of the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the [[National Cancer Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1962-.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1968-69 he was selected for one year of training in a special [[USPHS]] executive program in health administration, [[research]] [[management]], [[Grant (money)|grants]] administration, and [[science policy]].&lt;ref&gt;NIH Record, June 11, 1968, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DRG Personal Items (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), No. 5 (May 1968), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to his appointment as Special Assistant for Nutrition and Health in the Health Services and Mental Health Administration.&lt;ref&gt;."Appointment of Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl. Jr. as Special Assistant for Nutrition and Health", Regional Medical Programs Service News Information Data 4, No.1 (January 7, 1970), pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 he joined the US [[Agency for International Development]],which was originally a part of the [[US Department of State]], as nutrition advisor and later was put in charge of research program.&lt;ref&gt;The Biographical Register, US Department of State, July 1974, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of International Biography, 1969-&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research activities==
In his research,&lt;ref&gt;''American Men and Women of Science, 1960-''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World Who's Who in Science. From Antiquity to the Present'. Chicago, Illinois: Marquis-Who's Who, 1968, p.1401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Leaders in American Science'', Hattiesburg, MI, 1968-69&lt;/ref&gt; he initially specialized in [[amino acid metabolism]], including the utilization of D-amino acids and non specific forms of [[nitrogen]]. He then studied the relationship between [[protein]] and [[vitamin A]] which led to the finding that the amount, as well as [[biological value]], of dietary protein are important in the process of converting [[carotene]] to vitamin A.
Other studies dealt with [[metabolic]] changes during [[cachexia]] of tumor-bearing animals. One of the most striking affects of tumor on the [[Host (biology)|host]] was the depression of [[enzyme]] [[catalase]] in the [[livers]] and in the [[kidneys]] which some investigators thought  was due to a [[hypothetical]] substance, referred to as toxohormone. This was disproved by finding significant levels of the enzyme in liver [[tumors]].

A number of his studies dealt with the question of enzyme [[Turnover number|turnover]] ''in vivo''. Using specific metabolic [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]], he evaluated relative rates of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of the enzyme catalase under a variety of physiological, pathological and pharmacological conditions. These studies led to the conclusion that the rate of synthesis rather than the rate of destruction may be the preferential way of the [[mammalian]] [[organism]] to control its enzyme levels.

His finding of greatly different levels of catalase activity in certain substrains of  mice, which were under [[Genetics|genetic]] control, provided an excellent model for pursuing [[fundamental research]] in [[biochemical genetics]] in the mammalian system. The analyses of the first, the second the [[backcross]] generations between high-enzyme and low-enzyme mouse substrains showed that the difference was due to a single [[autosomal]] [[gene]] pair with low [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] to high. Using specific metabolic inhibitors, it was subsequently found that the genetic difference between the two substrains lies primarily in the markedly increased rate of the enzyme destruction in the liver of one of the substrains. This was a unique finding since in all normal rats and mice studied previously the rates of enzyme destruction seemed to be almost constant. Although transient alteration in the rate of enzyme degradation has been observed under certain physiological conditions with other enzyme systems, the observation on catalase iwas believed to be the first demonstration of such regulatory mechanism under genetic control.

Other studies dealt with the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], biochemistry and [[physiology]] of [[microbodies]], on which he collaborated with Prof. Z.. Hruban of the [[University of Chicago]], that led to the monograph Microbodies and Related Particles (1969).

==Scientific publications==
He is the author or editor of over thirty monographs and handbooks &lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Authors, Gale Res. Co., Detroit, MI,  1976, vol. 17-20, pp. 600-601&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of biochemistry, [[physiology]], [[nutrition]], [[food science]] and [[food technology]], [[agriculture]], and [[international development]], in addition to a large number of scientific articles and book chapters, including:

Apart from his purely scientific endeavors as a researcher and science administrator, Dr. Rechcigl devoted almost 50 years of his life to the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences (SVU), an international organization, with headquarters in [[Washington, D. C.]] &lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Nemec, "Important Anniversary of SVU Officer", Ceskoslovenský týdeník (New York), August 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr.", SVU Bulletin 11, No. 3 (August 1990), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Tríska, "Dr. Miloslav Rechcigl, Jr. The Man for All Seasons", News SVU 37, No. 4 (July–August 1995), p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Informacní Bulletin CSUZ 0998, September 30, 1998, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zdenek Slouka, "Rechcigl -Septuagenarian", Americké Listy 2000, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Profile: Miloslav Rechcigl", Czech the News, vol. 9, No. 8 (September 2000), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceskoslovenský biografický slovník (Prague: Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, 1992), p.  589&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josef Tomes et al., Ceský biografický slovník XX. století (Prague: Paseka, Petr Meissner, 1999), vol. 3, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;
He was responsible for the first two Society's World Congresses, both of which were a great success and which put the Society on the world map. He also edited the Congress lectures and arranged for their publication, under the title The Czechoslovak Contribution to World Culture &lt;ref&gt;The Hague - London - Paris: Mouton &amp; Co., 1964. 682 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and Czechoslovakia Past and Present&lt;ref&gt;The Hague - Paris: Mouton, 1968. 2 vols., 1889 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The publications received acclaim in the American academic circles and greatly contributed to the growing prestige of the Society worldwide.

Dr. Rechcigl was also involved, one way or another, with most of the subsequent SVU World Congresses, including the recent SVU Congresses in [[Prague]], [[Brno]], [[Bratislava]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Plzeň]], [[Olomouc]] and [[České Budějovice]].Prior to his last term as the SVU President (2004–06),&lt;ref&gt;SVU News, vol. 46, No. 5 (September-Oct. 2004), pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; he held similar posts during 1974-76, 1976–78, and again in 1994-96, 1996–98, 1998–2000, 2000–02 and 2002-04.&lt;ref&gt;"Miloslav Rechcigl -New SVU President", News SVU, vol. 16, No. 4 (Nov. 1974), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"SVU Elects New President", SVU Bulletin, vol. 25, No. 4 (Nov. 1994), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"SVU Inducts New President", News SVU, vol. 38, No. 6 (Nov.-Dec. 1996), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rechcigl again at the Helm of SVU", News SVU, vol. 40, No. 6 (Nov.-Dec. 1998), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rechcigl Reelected SVU President to Unprecedented 6th Term", News SVU, vol. 42, No.6 (Nov.-Dec., 2000), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SVU News, vol. 44, No. 6 (Nov.-Dec. 2002), pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the sponsorship of the SVU Research Institute, together with his colleagues, he conducted a series of workshops &lt;ref&gt;Interim Report. Workshops on US Practice in Research Management. Prague: SVU Research Institute, December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; about research management and the art of "grantsmanship" for scientists and scholars, as well as for the administrators and science policy makers, at Czech and Slovak universities, the Academies of Sciences ([[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]], [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]]) and the Government.

A '''mobile operating system''' (or '''mobile OS''') is an [[operating system]] for [[smartphone|phone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet]]s, [[smartwatch]]es, or other [[mobile device]]s. While computers such as typical [[laptop]]s are 'mobile', the operating systems usually used on them are not considered mobile ones, as they were originally designed for [[desktop computer]]s that historically did not have or need specific ''mobile'' features. This distinction is becoming blurred in some newer operating systems that are hybrids made for both uses.

Mobile operating systems combine features of a [[personal computer]] operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use; usually including, and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems; a [[touchscreen]], [[Cellular network|cellular]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) mobile navigation, [[video camera|video-]] and [[digital camera|single-frame picture cameras]], [[speech recognition]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recorder]], [[portable media player|music player]], [[near field communication]], and [[infrared blaster]]. By Q1 2018, over 383 million smartphones were sold with 85.9 percent running [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and 14.1 percent running [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3876865/ |title=Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Returned to Growth in First Quarter of 2018 |date=May 29, 2018 |website=Gartner, Inc. |publisher=Gartner |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows, and in general smartphone use (even without tablets) outnumber desktop use.

Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities (e.g., smartphones) contain two mobile operating systems{{snd}}the main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary [[real-time operating system]] which operates the radio and other hardware. Research has shown that these low-level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious [[base station]]s to gain high levels of control over the mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;Thom Holwerda, [[OSNews]], November 12, 2013, [http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone The second operating system hiding in every mobile phone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113173925/http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone |date=November 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile operating systems have majority use since 2017 (measured by web use); with even only the smartphones running them (excluding tablets) more used than any other kind of device.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share#daily-20161001-20170512 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045210/http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share |date=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus traditional desktop OS is now a minority used kind of OS; see [[usage share of operating systems]]. However, variations occur in popularity by regions, while desktop-minority also applies on some days in regions such as United States and United Kingdom.

====Chrome OS====
[[Chrome OS]] is an operating system designed by [[Google]] that is based on the [[Linux kernel]] and uses the [[Google Chrome]] web browser as its principal user interface. As a result, Chrome OS primarily supports [[web application]]s. Google announced the project in July 2009, conceiving it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]: hence Chrome OS primarily runs [[web application]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/chromium-os-kernel|title = Kernel Design|date = |accessdate = |website = The Chromium Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increase of popularity with 2 in 1 PCs, most of the recent Chromebook are introduce with touch screen capability, with Android applications started to become available for the operating system in 2014. And in 2016, access to Android apps in the entire [[Google Play Store]] was introduced on supported Chrome OS devices. With the support of Android applications, there are Chromebook devices that position it self closely to tablet based instead of notebooks.

Chrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners.

====Fuchsia====
[[Google Fuchsia|Fuchsia]] is a capability-based, real-time operating system (RTOS) currently being developed by Google.

Upon inspection, media outlets noted that the code post on GitHub suggested Fuchsia's capability to run on universal devices, from embedded systems to smartphones, tablets and personal computers. In May 2017, Fuchsia was updated with a user interface, along with a developer writing that the project was not a for experimental, prompting media speculation about Google's intentions with the operating system, including the possibility of it replacing Android.

* None - Mostly still in early alpha or beta (Currently entering open to developer testing)

====Sailfish OS====
[[Sailfish OS]] is from [[Jolla]]. It is open source with [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) for middleware stack core which comes from MER. Sailfish due to Jolla's business model and due to alliances with various partners and due to intentional design of OS internals, is capable to adopt in several layers third party software including Jolla software e.g. Jolla's UI is [[proprietary software]] (closed source), so such components can be proprietary with many different kinds of licences. However, user can replace them with open source components like e.g. NEMO UI instead Jolla's UI. Using third party software extends usability but does not make the OS code close, in the same way as preinstalled Microsoft Word (closed source) on a Linux device does not make Linux closed source.

After Nokia abandoned in 2011 the [[MeeGo]] project, most of the MeeGo team left Nokia, and established Jolla as a company to use MeeGo and [[Mer (software distribution)|Mer]] business opportunities. The MER standard allows it to be launched on any hardware with kernel compatible with MER. In 2012, Linux Sailfish OS based on MeeGo and using middleware of MER core stack distribution was launched for public use. The first device, the [[Jolla (mobile phone)|Jolla smartphone]], was unveiled on May 20, 2013. In 2015, [[Jolla Tablet]] was launched and the [[BRICS]] countries declared it an officially supported OS there. Jolla started licensing Sailfish OS 2.0 for third parties. Some devices sold are updateable to Sailfish 2.0 with no limits.

Each Sailfish OS version release is named after a Finnish lake:

====Tizen====
[[Tizen]] (based on the [[Linux kernel]]) is a mobile operating system hosted by [[Linux Foundation]], together with support from the Tizen Association, guided by a Technical Steering Group composed of [[Intel]] and [[Samsung]].

Tizen is an operating system for devices including smartphones, tablets, [[In-car entertainment|In-Vehicle Infotainment]] (IVI) devices, and smart TVs. It is an open source system (however the SDK was closed source and proprietary) that aims to offer a consistent user experience across devices. Tizen's main components are the Linux kernel and the [[WebKit]] runtime. According to Intel, Tizen "combines the best of LiMo and MeeGo." [[HTML5]] apps are emphasized, with MeeGo encouraging its members to transition to Tizen, stating that the "future belongs to HTML5-based applications, outside of a relatively small percentage of apps, and we are firmly convinced that our investment needs to shift toward HTML5." Tizen will be targeted at a variety of platforms such as handsets, touch pc, smart TVs and in-vehicle entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen Welcome to Tizen!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013071516/https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen |date=October 13, 2011 }}.

On August 18, 2011, HP announced that webOS hardware would be discontinued,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818b.html?mtxs=rss-corp-news |title=HP Confirms Discussions with Autonomy Corporation plc Regarding Possible Business Combination; Makes Other Announcements |publisher=HP |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 13, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006182519/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818b.html?mtxs=rss-corp-news |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but would continue to support and update webOS software and develop the webOS ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/08/the-next-chapter-for-webos/ |title=The next chapter for webOS |publisher=HP webOS Developer Blog |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924172749/http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/08/the-next-chapter-for-webos/ |archivedate=September 24, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; HP released webOS as open source under the name Open webOS, and plans to update it with additional features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openwebosproject.org/discover/roadmap/#.UIgNYMXA-So |title=Open webOS::Roadmap |publisher=Open webOS Project |date=September 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029145336/http://www.openwebosproject.org/discover/roadmap#.UIgNYMXA-So |archivedate=October 29, 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 2013 HP announced the sale of WebOS to [[LG Electronics]], who used the operating system for its "smart" or Internet-connected TVs. However, HP retained patents underlying WebOS and cloud-based services such as the App Catalog.

====BlackBerry OS====
{{Main|BlackBerry OS}}
In 1999, [[Research In Motion]] released its first BlackBerry devices, providing secure real-time push-email communications on wireless devices. Services such as BlackBerry Messenger provide the integration of all communications into a single inbox. In September 2012, RIM announced that the 200 millionth BlackBerry smartphone was shipped. As of September 2014, there were around 46 million active BlackBerry service subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arthur |first1=Charles |title=Ten things to know about BlackBerry – and how much trouble it is (or isn't) in |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/29/ten-things-to-know-blackberry-john-chen |website=TheGuardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528152319/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/29/ten-things-to-know-blackberry-john-chen |archivedate=May 28, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2010s, RIM has undergone a platform transition, changing its company name to [[BlackBerry Limited]] and making new devices on a new platform named "[[BlackBerry 10]]".&lt;ref name="Kevin McLaughlin"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kevin McLaughlin |url=http://www.crn.com/news/client-devices/222002587/blackberry-users-call-for-rim-to-rethink-service.htm |title=BlackBerry Users Call For RIM To Rethink Service |publisher=CRN.com |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907082336/http://www.crn.com/news/client-devices/222002587/blackberry-users-call-for-rim-to-rethink-service.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Windows Mobile====
[[Windows Mobile]] is a discontinued operating system from [[Microsoft]] that it replaced with Windows Phone.&lt;ref name="OS MS 3Q10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CEO Ballmer Reportedly Says Microsoft 'Screwed Up' with Windows Mobile |newspaper=[[eWeek]] |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-CEO-Steve-Ballmer-Says-Company-Screwed-Up-Windows-Mobile-241614/ |date=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closed source and proprietary.

The [[Windows CE]] operating system and Windows Mobile middleware was widely spread in Asia (which mostly uses Android now). The two improved variants of this operating system, [[Windows Mobile 6.0|Windows Mobile 6 Professional]] (for touch screen devices) and [[Windows Mobile#Next Versions|Windows Mobile 6 Standard]], were unveiled in February 2007. It was criticized for having a user interface which is not optimized for touch input by fingers; instead, it is more usable with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]. Like iOS, and most other Mobile OS, it supports both touch screen, physical and Bluetooth keyboard configurations. Microsoft phased out the Windows Mobile OS to focus on Windows Phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/09/16/iphone_drops_to_23_8_smartphone_market_share_android_jumps_to_17.html |title=iPhone drops to 24% smartphone share, Android jumps to 17% |publisher=AppleInsider |date=September 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826222606/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/09/16/iphone_drops_to_23_8_smartphone_market_share_android_jumps_to_17.html |archivedate=August 26, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.yeeply.com/professionals/windows-phone |title=Windows Phone developers |website=Yeeply Windows Phone |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219190709/https://en.yeeply.com/professionals/windows-phone |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Windows Phone====
[[Windows Phone]] is a family of mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones as the replacement successor to Windows Mobile and Zune. Windows Phone features a new user interface derived from Metro design language. Windows Phone was replaced by Windows 10 Mobile in 2015.

====Symbian====
The [[Symbian]] platform was developed by [[Nokia]] for some models of smartphones. It is proprietary software, it was however used by Ericsson (SonyEricsson), Sending and Benq. The operating system was discontinued in 2012, although a slimmed-down version for basic phones was still developed until July 2014. Microsoft officially shelved the platform in favor of Windows Phone after its acquisition of Nokia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/17/5912289/microsoft-kills-feature-phones-in-favor-of-windows-phone|title=Microsoft is killing off Nokia’s feature phones in favor of Windows Phone|date=July 17, 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154613/https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/17/5912289/microsoft-kills-feature-phones-in-favor-of-windows-phone|archivedate=August 8, 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bada====
[[Bada]] platform (stylized as bada; Korean: 바다) was an operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. It was developed by Samsung Electronics. Its name is derived from "바다 (bada)", meaning "ocean" or "sea" in Korean. It ranges from mid- to high-end smartphones. To foster adoption of Bada OS, since 2011 Samsung reportedly has considered releasing the source code under an open-source license, and expanding device support to include Smart TVs. Samsung announced in June 2012 intentions to merge Bada into the Tizen project, but would meanwhile use its own Bada operating system, in parallel with Google Android OS and Microsoft Windows Phone, for its smartphones. All Bada-powered devices are branded under the Wave name, but not all of Samsung's Android-powered devices are branded under the name Galaxy.
On February 25, 2013, Samsung announced that it will stop developing Bada, moving development to [[Tizen]] instead. Bug reporting was finally terminated in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/samsung-scraps-bada-os-folds-it-tizen/2013-02-25 Samsung scraps Bada OS, folds it into Tizen – FierceMobileIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228062542/http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/samsung-scraps-bada-os-folds-it-tizen/2013-02-25 |date=February 28, 2013 }}.

{{See also|Usage share of operating systems#Crossover to smartphones having majority share|Usage share of web browsers#Crossover to smartphones having majority share}}

In 2006, Android and iOS did not exist and only 64 million smartphones were sold.&lt;ref name="Canalys Q2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/64-million-smart-phones-shipped-worldwide-2006 |title=64 million smart phones shipped worldwide in 2006 |publisher=Canalys, Inc |accessdate=January 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106153828/http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/64-million-smart-phones-shipped-worldwide-2006 |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Q1, 383.5 million smartphones were sold and global market share was 85.9% for Android and 14.1% for iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3876865/ |title=Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Returned to Growth in First Quarter of 2018 |date=May 29, 2018 |website=Gartner, Inc. |publisher=Gartner |access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[StatCounter]] web use statistics (a proxy for all use), smartphones (alone without tablets) have majority use globally, with desktop computers used much less (and Android in particular more popular than Windows).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share#monthly-201606-201709|title=Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet vs Console Market Share Worldwide {{!}} StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use varies however by continent with smartphones way more popular in the biggest continents, i.e. Asia, and the desktop still more popular in some, though not in North America.

The desktop is still popular in many countries (while overall down to 44.9% in the first quarter of 2017&lt;ref name="Q1 2017"&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share#quarterly-201602-201701 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045210/http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share |date=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), smartphones are more popular even in many developed countries (or about to be in more). A few countries on any continent are desktop-minority; European countries (and some in South America, and a few, e.g. Haiti, in North America; and most in Asia and Africa) are smartphone-majority, Poland and Turkey highest with 57.68% and 62.33%, respectively. In Ireland, smartphone use at 45.55% outnumbers desktop use and mobile as a whole gains majority when including the tablet share at 9.12%.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/all/europe/#monthly-201703-201703-map {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420235518/http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/all/europe/ |date=April 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share#monthly-201703-201703-map {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045210/http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share |date=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain is also slightly desktop-minority.

The range of measured mobile web use varies a lot by country, and a StatCounter press release recognizes "India amongst world leaders in use of mobile to surf the internet"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/press/india-amongst-world-leaders-in-use-of-mobile-to-surf-the-internet |title=India amongst world leaders in use of mobile to surf the internet |date=March 28, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422123848/http://gs.statcounter.com/press/india-amongst-world-leaders-in-use-of-mobile-to-surf-the-internet |archivedate=April 22, 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (of the big countries) where the share is around (or over) 80%&lt;!--Android 62.31.% + Unknown 9.32% + e.g. Nokia Unknown 2.97% (iOS doesn't even register..)--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/india/#monthly-201503-201703 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422033545/http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/india/ |date=April 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and desktop is at 19.56%, with Russia trailing with 17.8% mobile use (and desktop the rest).
&lt;!--
"Unknown" is at about 70%, so not using these numbers for now:
Smartphone share of web use is up to over 90% in some countries, e.g. Papua New Guinea where desktop use is down to under 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/all/papua-new-guinea/#quarterly-201602-201701|title=Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet vs Console Market Share Papua New Guinea - StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/all/papua-new-guinea/#monthly-201604-201703|title=Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet vs Console Market Share Papua New Guinea - StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/all/oceania/#monthly-201703-201703-map|title=Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet vs Console Market Share Oceania - StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

Smartphones (alone, without tablets), first gained majority in December 2016 (desktop-majority was lost the month before), and it wasn't a Christmas-time fluke, as while close to majority after smartphone majority happened again in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share#monthly-201604-201703 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045210/http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share |date=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week from November 7–13, 2016, smartphones alone (without tablets) overtook desktop, for the first time (for a short period; non-full-month).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-weekly-201634-201645 |title=Comparison from W34 to W45 2015 |work=StatCounter Global Stats |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420175502/http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-weekly-201634-201645 |archivedate=April 20, 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile-majority applies to countries such as Paraguay in South America, Poland in Europe and Turkey; and most of Asia and Africa. Some of the world is still desktop-majority, with e.g. in the United States at 54.89% (but no not on all days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-weekly-201645-201645-map|title=StatCounter Global Stats – Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526/http://gs.statcounter.com/%23mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201012-201111-bar#all-comparison-ww-weekly-201645-201645-map|archivedate=May 26, 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some [[territories of the United States]], such as [[Puerto Rico]]&lt;!--and Guam in March 2017 by a tiny bit--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/puerto-rico/#monthly-201508-201703 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623104625/http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/puerto-rico |date=June 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; desktop is way under majority, with Windows under 30% overtaken by Android.

On October 22, 2016 (and subsequent weekends), mobile showed majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-daily-20160628-20161114|title=StatCounter Global Stats – Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526/http://gs.statcounter.com/%23mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201012-201111-bar#all-comparison-ww-daily-20160628-20161114|archivedate=May 26, 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 27, the desktop hasn't shown majority, not even on weekdays. And smartphones alone have showed majority since December 23 to the end of the year, with the share topping at 58.22% on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-comparison-ww-daily-20161024-20170430|title=StatCounter Global Stats – Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=March 22, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526/http://gs.statcounter.com/%23mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201012-201111-bar#all-comparison-ww-daily-20161024-20170430|archivedate=May 26, 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the "mobile"-majority share then of smartphones, tablets could be added giving a &lt;!--58.22% + 5.06% = --&gt; 63.22% majority. While an unusually high top, a similarly high also happened on Monday April 17, 2017, with then only smartphones share slightly lower and tablet share slightly higher, with them combined at 62.88%.

Formerly, according to StatCounter press release, the world has turned desktop-minority;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide |title=Mobile and tablet Internet usage exceeds desktop for first time worldwide |work=StatCounter |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101170640/http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide |archivedate=November 1, 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016|10|lc=y}}, at about 49% desktop use for that month, but mobile wasn't ranked higher, tablet share had to be added to it to exceed desktop share.

According to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] in his ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'', [[Muhammad]] decided after the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] to send letters to many rulers of the world, inviting them to Islam.
&lt;ref name=King_Lings&gt;{{cite book | last = Lings| first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Lings | year = 1994 | title = Muhammad: His Life based on the earliest sources | publisher = Suhail Academy Lahore | page = 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kings_Khan&gt;{{cite book | last = Khan| first = Dr. Majid Ali | authorlink = Dr. Majid Ali Khan | year = 1998 | title = Muhammad The Final Messenger | pages = 250–251 | publisher = Islamic Book Service, New Delhi, 110002 (India)| isbn = 81-85738-25-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haykal | first = Muhammad Husayn | authorlink = Muhammad Husayn Haykal | year = 1993 | title = The Life of Muhammad (Translated from the 8th Edition By Ism'il Ragi A. Al Faruqi) | publisher = Islami Book Trust, Kula Lumpur | page = 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims have disputed this tradition, however.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Said Reynolds, ''The Emergence of Islam'' (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2012), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad, according to traditional Islamic historiography, sent ambassadors with such letters to [[Heraclius]] the [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Chosroes II]] the [[Khosrow I|Khosrau]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Abyssinia]], [[Muqawqis]] the ruler of [[Egypt]], [[Harith Gassani]] the governor of [[Syria]], [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi|Munzir ibn Sawa]] and to the ruler of [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Sigismund Koelle]] reports that "Ibn Ishak also mentions the names of nine different messengers who had to carry Mohammed's letters to the following potentates: (1) to the Emperor of the Greeks; (2) to Chosroes, the king of Persia; (3) to Najashi, the prince of Abyssinia; (4) to Mokawkas, the prince of Alexandria; (5) to Jeifar and Iyaz, the princes of Oman; (6) to Thumama and Hawza, the princes of Yemama; (7) to Munzir, the prince of Bahrein; (8) to El Harith, the prince of the border districts of Syria; and (9) to the Himyarite Harith Ibn Abd Kulal, the prince of Yemen."

==To the Byzantine emperor==

Majid Ali Khan, ''Muhammad The Final Messenger''Islamic Book Service, New Delhi (1998).]]
{{see also|Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)}}
The text of the letter to Heraclius, as transmitted by Muslim historians, reads as follows:
{{cquote|من محمد بن عبد الله إلى هرقل عظيم الروم: سلام على من اتبع الهدى، أما بعد فإنى أدعوك بدعوة الإسلام . أسلم تسلم ويؤتك الله أجرك مرتين ، فإن توليت فإن عليك إثم الأريسيِّين.

{قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ} [سورة آل عمران : 64].

In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy

From Muhammad, son of God’s subordinate/slave (Abdullah) to Heraclius the Leader of the Romans:

Peace be upon he who follows the guidance.

Furthermore, I invite you with the invitation of peace. If you establish peace. then you will find peace and God will double your reward. If you turn away, you will bear the Arians’ sins.

"O People of the Scripture! Come to a common word between us and you: that we shall worship none but God, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, and that none of us shall take others for lords beside God. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). 

(Quran, Chapter: Aal Imran “The House of Joachim” 3:64)



==To the king of Ethiopia==
Letter of the Prophet Muhammed to [[Armah]], the [[Negus]]:

كتاب رسول الإسلام صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى النجاشي

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم من محمد رسول الإسلام إلى النجاشى ملك الحبشة: سلام عليك إنى أحمد الله إليك ،الله الذي لا إله إلا هو الملك القدوس السلام المؤمن المهيمن، وأشهد أن عيسى بن مريم روح الله وكلمته ألقاها إلى مريم البتول الطيبة الحصينة، فحملت بعيسى فخلقه الله من روحه كما خلق آدم بيده، وإنى أدعوك وجنودك إلى الله عز وجل، وقد بلغت ونصحت فاقبلوا نصحى، والسلام على من اتبع الهدى

Letter of the Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him.
In the name of Allah the most beneficial the Merciful.
Mohammed the Prophet of Islam to Nagaci king of Abyssinia:

رساله رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم محمد للمنذر بن ساوي التميمى

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم، من محمد رسول الله إلى المنذر بن ساوي، سلام عليك، فإني أحمد الله إليك الذي لا إله إلا هو، وأشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، وأن محمداً عبده ورسوله. أما بعد: فإني أذكرك الله عز وجل، فإنه من ينصح فإنما ينصح لنفسه، ومن يطع رسلي ويتبع أمرهم فقد أطاعني، ومن ينصح لهم فقد نصح لي، وإنّ رسلي قد أثنوا عليك خيراً، وإني قد شفعتُكَ في قومكَ، فاتركْ للمسلمين ما أسلموا عليه، وعفوتُ عن أهل الذنوب فاقبل منهم، وإنك مهما تصلح، فلن نعزلكَ عن عملك، ومن أقام على يهودية أو مجوسية فعليه الجزية.

In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful: From Muhammad the Prophet of Allah to Munzir bin Sawa, may peace be on you! I praise Allah, who is one and there none to be worshiped but except Him. I bear evidence that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is a servant of Allah and His Prophet. Thereafter I remind you of Allah. Whoever accepts admonition does it for his own good. Whoever followed my messengers and acted in accordance their guidance; he, in fact,followed me and accepted my advice. My messengers have highly praised your behavior. You shall continue in your present office. You should remain faithful to Allah and his Prophet. I accept your recommendation regarding the people of Bahrain. I forgive the offenses of the offenders.

Therefore, you may also forgive them of the people of Bahrain whoever want to continue in their Jewish or Majusi faith, should be made to pay Jizia.

==To Muqawqis of Egypt==
[[File:Muhammad's Letter to Mukaukis.png|thumb|300px|Drawing  of the Prophet Muhammed to the [[Muqawqis]], discovered in Egypt in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;"the original of the letter was discovered in 1858 by Monsieur Etienne Barthelemy, member of a French expedition, in a monastery in Egypt and is now carefully preserved in Constantinople. Several photographs of the letter have since been published. The first one was published in the well-known Egyptian newspaper Al-Hilal in November 1904"  Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, ''Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1980 ([http://www.alislam.org/library/books/muhammad_seal_of_the_prophets/chapter_12.html chapter 12]).

{{cquote|Letter of the Prophet Muhammed to the [[Muqawqis]]

In the name of Allah the Rahman, the Merciful. From the Apostle of Allah to the Mukaukis, chief of the Copts. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. Next, I summon thee with the appeal of establish peace (or submitting your will to Allah ): establish peace (submit your will to Allah) and you will have peace. Allah shall give you  your reward twofold. But if you decline then on you is the guilt of the Copts. O ye people of the Book, come unto an equal arrangement between us and you, that we should serve none save Allah, associating nothing with Him, and not taking one another for Lords besides Allah. And if ye decline, then bear witness that we have submitted our will to Allah .&lt;ref&gt;[[David Samuel Margoliouth|Margoliouth, D. S.]] (1905).

{{Lowercase title}}

'''n/a''' or '''N/A''' is a common [[abbreviation]] in [[Table (information)|table]]s and lists for the phrase '''not applicable''',&lt;ref name="ODA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Abbreviations|year=1998|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191733987.001.0001/acref-9780191733987-e-4211?rskey=pPOO9c&amp;result=1&amp;q=n/a | subscription=yes | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22n%2FA%22+%22not+applicable%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Google Books search: "N/A Not applicable"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''not available''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22n%2FA%22+%22not+available%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Google Books search: "N/A Not available]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''no answer'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22n%2FA%22+%22no+answer%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 Google Books search "N/A No answer"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to indicate when information in a certain table cell is not provided, either because it does not apply to a particular case in question or because the answer is not available.

The notation was in use at least as early as the 1920s, with a 1925 guide to conducting community surveys stating:

{{quote|Some of the questions on the card are of course not applicable at all times. For instance, a household composed of two widowed sisters living on their income has no wage earner. The survey director should request that the initials "n a" ("not applicable") be written down opposite such questions. No space should be left blank.&lt;ref name="Brunner"&gt;Edmund de Schweinitz Brunner, ''Surveying Your Community: A Handbook of Method for the Rural Church'' (1925), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The guide goes on to indicate that every blank should be filled, even if only to indicate that the blank is not applicable, so that those processing the surveys would be able to see that the blank had not merely been overlooked.&lt;ref name="Brunner"/&gt; An ''Information Circular'' from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]], Bureau of Mines, from the same year specified that it used "NA" to indicate that information was "not available" and "NAp" to indicate that a category information was "Not applicable".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, ''Information Circular'' (1925), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The n/a notation continues to serve the purpose of indicating that the blank can not be filled, and has not been left blank erroneously.

In the early years of [[computer programming]], computerized forms that required fields to be filled in could cause problems where the field was one for which no answer would be applicable to certain persons filling out the form. Before programmers became aware of a problem with a particular field, persons filling out that field might fill it in with a term such as this, which the program processing the form would misinterpret as an intent to provide the requested information.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Melton, Alan R. Simon, ''SQL:1999: Understanding Relational Language Components'' (2002), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a form contained a field for a middle name, and the person filling out the form put "N/A", the computer might interpret this as "N/A" being the person's middle name.

      <comment>Added content - when PIIIGS is explained I added Ireland to the explanation in addition to Iceland to tie the acronym back to PIGS. This was done as there are a number of different derivations of the acronym &amp; substations of the letters. This ties the description of PIIIGS back to the original PIGS acronym.</comment>

'''PIGS''' is an acronym used in [[economics]] and [[finance]]. The PIGS acronym originally refers, often derogatorily, to the economies of the [[Southern Europe|Southern European]] countries of [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Economy of Italy|Italy]], [[Economy of Greece|Greece]], and [[Economy of Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name="MiningJournal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mining-journal.com/comment/pigs-slaughtered?SQ_DESIGN_NAME=print_friendly|title=PIGS slaughtered|date=21 May 2010|newspaper=Mining Journal|publisher=Aspermont UK|location=London|accessdate=21 August 2012|quote=With all this uncertainty, an unfortunate acronym is back in fashion (despite being widely considered to be derogatory). PIGS usually refers to the economies of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, and dates back to the 1990s (when it referred generally to the southern economies of the European Union).  The currently vulnerable economies of Portugal, Greece and Spain are again being grouped together due to high national budget deficits relative to GDP, and high, or rising, government debt levels. Greece has a government debt to GDP level of 120%, Portugal 90% and Spain 54%.  Italy is not suffering to the same extent, and the country’s economy returned to growth in the third quarter of 2009.  Also, despite a rise in unemployment in March to almost 9%, Italian output has grown rapidly recently. For this reason, Italy is often replaced in the acronym, rather arbitrarily, by Ireland (which, in 2007, became the first eurozone country to enter recession).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/260035.html |quote=que l'argot communautaire a affublés d'un sobriquet peu élégant dans sa signification anglaise : « pigs », pour Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain. |title=L'Allemagne au coeur du débat français |date=24 April 1997 |work=[[Le Monde]] |author=Daniel Vernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dainotto&gt;{{citation|author=Roberto M.

However, taking on the guarantee of banks' debt, the Irish government budget deficit rose to 32% of GDP in 2010, which was the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ei.html|title=CIA World Factbook page on Ireland|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland then became associated with the term, replacing [[Italy]] or changing the acronym to ''PIIGS'',&lt;ref name="MiningJournal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=financialnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2012-03-19/investing-in-piigs-portugal|title=Investing in PIIGS: Portugal|newspaper=Financial News|author=Sarah Krouse|date=19 March 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012|quote=The acronym "PIGS" was first coined in the 1990s to describe Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain – four peripheral European Union states with the weakest economies.

[[File:Pennydreadful.png|thumb|right|250px|''Black Bess; or, The Knight of the Road''. A romanticized tale of [[Dick Turpin]] – a popular subject in fiction.  Circa 1860]]
{{Literature}}
'''Penny dreadfuls''' were cheap popular serial literature produced during the nineteenth century in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[pejorative]] term is roughly interchangeable with '''penny horrible''', '''penny awful''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zimmer |first=Ben |url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=31 |title=Horribles and terribles |publisher=Language Log |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''penny blood'''.&lt;ref&gt;Many people use the term "penny blood" interchangeably with "penny dreadful". Sally Powell distinguishes between these terms, however, and designates "penny bloods" as cheap sensational literature written largely for working-class adults. Powell, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically referred to a story published in weekly parts, each costing one [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]]. The subject matter of these stories was typically sensational, focusing on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls featured characters such as [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and [[Varney the Vampire]]. ''The Guardian'' described penny dreadfuls as “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref name=“Guardian”&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term "penny dreadful" was originally used in reference to a specific type of literature circulating in mid-[[Victorian Britain]], it came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as [[story paper]]s and booklet "libraries". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap [[Pulp (paper)|wood pulp]] paper and were aimed at young [[working class]] men.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last=James |first=Louis |year=1974 |title=Fiction for the Working Man, 1830–50 |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin University Books |isbn= 0-14-060037-X |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a million boys’ periodicals were sold a week, but the popularity of penny dreadfuls was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature, especially the half-penny periodicals published by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]].&lt;ref name=“Guardian”/&gt;&lt;ref name="springhall2"/&gt;

==Origins==

Crime [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] were commonly sold at [[public execution]]s in the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were often produced by printers who specialised in them. They were typically illustrated by a crude picture of the crime, a portrait of the criminal, or a generic [[woodcut]] of a hanging taking place. There would be a written account of the crime and of the trial and often the criminal's confession of guilt. A [[Doggerel|doggerel verse]] warning others to not follow the executed person's example, to avoid their fate, was another common feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://broadsides.law.harvard.edu/ | title=Dying Speeches and Bloody Murders: Crime Broadsides Collected by Harvard Law School Library | publisher=Harvard University Law School Library | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victorian era]] Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased [[literacy]] rates. With the rise of [[capitalism]] and [[industrialisation]], people began to spend more money on entertainment, contributing to the popularisation of the [[novel]]. Improvements in printing resulted in newspapers such as Joseph Addison's ''The Spectator'' and Richard Steele's ''The Tatler'', and England's more fully recognizing the singular concept of reading as a form of leisure; it was, of itself, a new industry. Other significant changes included [[industrialisation]] and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of tracks, engines, and the corresponding [[railway]] distribution.

These changes created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this demand.&lt;ref name="TurnerES"&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=E.

The stories themselves were reprints, or sometimes rewrites, of the earliest [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] thrillers such as ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' or ''[[The Monk]]'', as well as new stories about famous criminals. Some of the most famous of these penny part-stories were ''[[The String of Pearls|The String of Pearls: A Romance]]'' (introducing [[Sweeney Todd]], "the Demon Barber of [[Fleet Street]]"),&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/kqed/demonbarber/penny/ | title=Penny Dreadful: From True Crime to Fiction &gt; ''Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert'' |publisher=[[KQED-TV]] |accessdate=9 November 2015 |archivedate=21 February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221101922/http://www.pbs.org/kqed/demonbarber/penny/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Mysteries of London]]'' (inspired by the French serial ''[[The Mysteries of Paris]]''), and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845–47). ''Varney'' is the tale of the [[vampire]] Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the [[trope (literature)|trope]]s present in [[vampire fiction]] recognizable to modern audiences — it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-cronin/did-vampires-not-have-fan_b_8415636.html "Did Vampires Not Have Fangs in Movies Until the 1950s?"]. Huffington Post. Retrieved 27 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Highwayman|Highwaymen]] were popular heroes; ''Black Bess or the Knight of the Road'', outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real-life English highwayman [[Dick Turpin]], continued for 254 episodes. Other serials were thinly-disguised plagiarisms of popular contemporary literature. The publisher Edward Lloyd, for instance, published a number of penny serials derived from the works of [[Charles Dickens]] entitled ''Oliver Twiss'', ''Nickelas Nicklebery'', and ''Martin Guzzlewit''.&lt;ref name="TurnerES"/&gt;

Working class boys who could not afford a penny a week often formed clubs that would share the cost, passing the flimsy booklets from reader to reader. Other enterprising youngsters would collect a number of consecutive parts, then rent the volume out to friends. In 1866, ''[[Boys of England]]'' was introduced as a new type of publication, an eight-page magazine that featured serial stories as well as articles and shorts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Banham, "England and America Against the World": Empire and the USE in Edwin J. Brett's ''Boys of England'', 1866-99, ''Victorian Periodicals Review'', 40:2, 2007, pp.151-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boys of England|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10549458|work=Stanford University Libraries|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous competitors quickly followed, with such titles as ''Boys' Leisure Hour, Boys' Standard, Young Men of Great Britain'', etc. As the price and quality of other types of fiction works were the same, these also fell under the general definition of penny dreadfuls.

Appearing in the 1860s, American [[dime novel]]s were edited and rewritten for a British audience. These appeared in booklet form, such as the ''Boy's First Rate Pocket Library''. [[Frank Reade]], [[Buffalo Bill]], and [[Deadwood Dick]] were all popular with the penny dreadful audience.

The penny dreadfuls were influential since they were, in the words of one commentator, "the most alluring and low-priced form of escapist reading available to ordinary youth, until the advent in the early 1890s of future newspaper magnate [[Alfred Harmsworth]]'s price-cutting 'halfpenny dreadfuller'".&lt;ref name="springhall1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Springhall, John|title=Disseminating Impure Literature': The 'Penny Dreadful' Publishing Business Since 1860|journal=Economic Historical Review|volume= 47|issue=3 |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the serial novels were overdramatic and sensational, but generally harmless. If anything, the penny dreadfuls, although obviously not the most enlightening or inspiring of literary selections, resulted in increasingly literate youth in the Industrial period. The wide circulation of this sensationalist literature, however, contributed to an ever-greater fear of crime in mid-[[Victorian Britain]].&lt;ref name="casey"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Casey, Christopher|title=Common Misperceptions: The Press and Victorian Views of Crime|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=41|issue=3 |date=Winter 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[File:Portrait of Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe.jpg|thumb|upright|British publishing magnate [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]] developed popular journalism intended for the working class ]]

The popularity of penny dreadfuls was challenged in the 1890s by the rise of competing literature. Leading the challenge were popular periodicals published by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]]. Priced at one [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|half-penny]], Harmsworth's story papers were cheaper and, at least initially, were more respectable than the competition. Harmsworth claimed to be motivated by a wish to challenge the pernicious influence of penny dreadfuls. In an editorial in the first number of ''The Half-penny Marvel'' in 1893 it was stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is almost a daily occurrence with magistrates to have before them boys who, having read a number of 'dreadfuls', followed the examples set forth in such publications, robbed their employers, bought revolvers with the proceeds, and finished by running away from home, and installing themselves in the back streets as 'highwaymen'. This and many other evils the 'penny dreadful' is responsible for. It makes thieves of the coming generation, and so helps fill our gaols.&lt;ref name="springhall2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Springhall |first=John |title=Youth, Popular Culture and Moral Panics |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1998 |page=75 |isbn=978-0-312-21394-7 |oclc=38206817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''The Half-penny Marvel'' was soon followed by a number of other Harmsworth half-penny periodicals, such as ''[[Union Jack (magazine)|The Union Jack]]'' and ''Pluck''. At first the stories were high-minded moral tales, reportedly based on true experiences, but it was not long before these papers started using the same kind of material as the publications they competed against. [[A. A. Milne]], the author of ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'', once said, "Harmsworth killed the penny dreadful by the simple process of producing the 'ha'penny dreadfuller'". The quality of the Harmsworth/[[Amalgamated Press]] papers began to improve throughout the early 20th century, however. By the time of the [[First World War]], papers such as ''Union Jack'' dominated the market in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Editorials in early issues of papers such as the ''Union Jack ''or ''Boys' Friend'' make frequent references to "the blood and thunders", but as time went on the mentions disappeared. Letters sent in by parents or teachers were frequently printed, praising the papers for putting the "trash" out of business.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Two popular characters to come out of the penny dreadfuls were Jack Harkaway, introduced in the ''Boys of England'' in 1871, and [[Sexton Blake]], who began in ''the Half-penny Marvel'' in 1893. In 1904, the ''Union Jack'' became "Sexton Blake's own paper", and he appeared in every issue thereafter, up until the paper's demise in 1933. In total, Blake appeared in roughly 4,000&amp;nbsp;adventures, right up into the 1970s, a record exceeded only by [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] and [[Dixon Hawke]]. Harkaway was also popular in America and had many imitators.

The fictional [[Sweeney Todd]], the subject of both a successful musical by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and a feature film by [[Tim Burton]], also first appeared in an 1846/1847 penny dreadful titled ''[[The String of Pearls|The String of Pearls: A Romance]]'' by [[James Malcolm Rymer]] and [[Thomas Peckett Prest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_String_of_Pearls ''The String of Pearls'' (1846/1847) by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest on Wikisource.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the penny dreadfuls evolved into the [[British comic]] magazines.  Owing to their cheap production, their perceived lack of value, and such hazards as war-time paper drives, the penny dreadfuls, particularly the earliest ones, are fairly rare today.

Some items that have been named after this topic include a song called "Penny Dreadfuls" by [[Animal Collective]], the Irish literary magazine ''The Penny Dreadful''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepennydreadful.org/index.php/about |title=From Zine to Magazine. About, The Penny Dreadful, New Irish Writers |publisher=Thepennydreadful.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] horror television series set in Victorian England titled ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]''.

[[File:Seyahatname C1 Evliya Çelebi.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Seyahatname'' of Evliya Çelebi, 1895 edition]]
'''''Seyāḥat-nāme''''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: سياحت نامه, "[[travel literature|book of travels]]") is the name of a literary form and tradition whose examples can be found throughout centuries in the [[Middle Ages]] around the [[Islamic world]], starting with the [[Arab]] travellers of the [[Umayyad]] period. In a more specific sense, the name refers to the travel notes by the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turkish]] traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] (1611–1682).

The ''Seyahâtnâme'' of Evliya Çelebi is an outstanding example of this tradition. 

The author’s personal name is unknown, and “Evliya” is only his pen name, which he adopted in honor of his teacher, Evliya Mehmed Efendi. Evliya Çelebi’s father was the chief jeweller to the courts, and thanks to the talent of his father Evliya was allowed to enjoy the favor of the court. Because of his gift in reciting the [[Quran]], Evliya was presented to [[Sultan Murad IV]] and admitted to the palace, where he received extensive training in calligraphy, music, Arabic grammar, and [[tajwid]]. Shortly before Murad IV’s expedition to [[Baghdad]] in 1638, Evliya was appointed a [[sipahi]] of [[the Porte]].&lt;ref&gt;Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. "Ewliyā Čelebi." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2016. Reference. Northwestern University. 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his diverse talents and the opportunity to climb the social ladder, Evliya had a keen interest in [[geography]] and invested his wealth into life goal of traveling.  He set out on a journey to assemble a complete description of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its neighbors and to provide a complete record of his travels as a [[first-person narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;Çelebi, Evliya. An Ottoman Traveller: Selections from the Book of Travels of Evliya Çelebi. Trans. Dankoff, Robert and Kim, Sooyong. London: Eland, 2010., XXI-XXII.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ten-volume Seyâhatnâme, Evliya describes in Volume I: the capital city of [[Istanbul]] (his birthplace) and its surroundings; in II: [[Bursa]], [[İzmir]], [[Batum]], [[Trabzon]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Crete]], [[Erzurum]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], etc.; in III: [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Urmia]], [[Sivas]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Rumelia]] ([[Bulgaria]] and [[Dobruja]]), etc.; in IV: [[Van]], [[Tabriz]], [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]], etc.; in V: [[Van]], [[Basra]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Anatolia]], [[Bursa]], the [[Dardanelles]], [[Adrianople]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]], [[Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Sofia]]; in VI: [[Transylvania]], [[Albania]], [[Hungary]], [[Nové Zámky]], [[Belgrade]], [[Herzegovina]], [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]] ([[Dubrovnik]]), [[Montenegro]], [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]], [[Croatia]]; in VII: [[Hungary]], [[Buda]], [[Erlau]], [[Temesvár]], [[Transylvania]], [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], the [[Crimea]], [[Kazakhstan|Kazak]], South [[Russia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Dagestan]], [[Azak]]; in VIII: [[Azak]], [[Feodosia|Kafa]], [[Bakhchysarai|Bahçesaray]] ([[Crimea]]), [[Istanbul]], [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Athens]], the [[Dodecanese]], [[Peloponnesus]], [[Albania]], [[Vlorë|Valona]], [[Ochrida]], [[Adrianople]], [[Istanbul]]; in IX: ([[Pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]) south-west [[Anatolia]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Rhodes]], south [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Medina]], [[Mecca]], [[Suez]]; in X: [[Egypt]] (with historical excursus), [[Cairo]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. "Ewliyā Čelebi." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2016. Reference. Northwestern University. 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Evliya prefers legend to bare historical fact, and at times exaggerates or creates anecdotes designed for comic effect. His Seyâhatnâme thus appears as a work of 17th-century light literature, which was intelligible to a wide circle thanks to the mixed use of the colloquial [[Turkish language|Turkish]] of the 17th century with occasional borrowings of phrases and expressions from the ornate style. Such attempt to appeal to a wide audience may explain the author’s lack of concern for historical truth. He even recorded certain occurrences as though he had seen or experienced them himself even though a close examination reveals that he knows of them only from hearsay or literary sources, which he does not cite.&lt;ref&gt;Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. "Ewliyā Čelebi." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2016. Reference. Northwestern University. 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

In spite of these reservations, Evliya’s Seyâhatnâme offers a wealth of information on [[cultural history]], [[folklore]], and [[geography]]. The significance of the work lies in the fact that it reflects the mental approach of the 17th century [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turkish]] intellectuals in their attitudes to the non-Muslim Occident, and sheds light on the administration and internal organization of the [[Ottoman empire]] of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. "Ewliyā Čelebi." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2016. Reference. Northwestern University. 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the value of his work, the generic term of ''Seyâhatnâme'' is often refer to Evliya Çelebi's books in particular, as far as the [[Turkish language]] and studies are concerned.

Aside from several translations into modern Turkish, substantial portions of Evliya’s Seyâhatnâme have been translated into Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Hungarian, Romanina, Russian, and Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;Çelebi, Evliya. An Ottoman Traveller: Selections from the Book of Travels of Evliya Çelebi. Trans. Dankoff, Robert and Kim, Sooyong. London: Eland, 2010., XXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent English translation is Robert Dankoff and Sooyong Kim’s 2010 translation, ''An Ottoman Traveller: Selections from the Book of Travels of Evliya Çelebi'', which includes sections from all volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Ottoman Traveller|url=http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/shop-online-books/an-ottoman-traveller|website=Eland Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the ''Seyahâtnâme'' of Evliya Çelebi, other seyahatnames include the ''[[Mirat ul Memalik]]'' ("Mirror of Countries") by the Ottoman admiral [[Seydi Ali Reis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A related genre, specific to the journeys and experiences of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassadors, is the ''[[sefâretnâme]]'' (سفارت نامه), whose examples were edited by their authors with a view to their presentation to the Sultan and the high administration, thus also bearing a semi-official character, although they remained of interest for the general reader as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">The '''Sofia First Chronicle''' (Софийская первая летопись) is a [[Russia]]n [[chronicle]] associated with the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|St. Sophia Cathedral]], [[Novgorod]], [[Russia]]. Its copies exist in two versions: Early Redaction (''starshy izvod''), which ends by 1418  and Later Redaction (''mladshy izvod''), with sporadic additions up to 1471, and up to 1508 in one of the copies. 

Together with the [[Novgorod Fourth Chronicle]], it is believed that it is derived from a common source. Russian philologist [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]] tentatively called it the [[Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod]] (Novgorod-Sofia Corpus) and initially dated it by 1448, but later revised his opinion to 1430s. Some Russian philologists shared his opinion, while others attribute the common source  to the 1418 Corpus of [[Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow]].

Christian sources, such as the New Testament books in the Christian Bible, include detailed stories about Jesus but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus.&lt;ref name=MAPowell168 &gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee|first=Mark Allan|last=Powell|date=1998|isbn=0-664-25703-8|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two events subject to "almost universal assent" are that [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by the order of the [[Roman governor|Roman Prefect]] [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=AmyJill1&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Amy-Jill|author-link=Amy-Jill Levine|title=The Historical Jesus in Context|editor=Amy-Jill Levine et al.|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00992-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus Remembered|first=James D.

Non-Christian sources that are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as [[Josephus]], and Roman sources such as [[Tacitus]]. These sources are compared to Christian sources such as the [[Pauline Epistles]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. These sources are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.&lt;ref name="Camber121"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jesus|first=Markus N.

In a review of the state of research, the Jewish scholar [[Amy-Jill Levine]] stated that "no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars" and that all portraits of Jesus are subject to criticism by some group of scholars.&lt;ref name=AmyJill1 /&gt;

====Josephus====
{{Main article|Josephus on Jesus}}
[[File:Josephus Antiquitates Iudaice.jpg|thumb|170px|A page from a 1466 copy of ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'']]
The writings of the 1st century [[Roman citizenship|Romano]]-[[List of Jewish historians|Jewish historian]] [[Flavius Josephus]] include references to Jesus and the [[origins of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei, eds. (1987). ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity'' BRILL. {{ISBN|978-90-04-08554-1}}. pp. 54–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus' ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', written around 93–94&amp;nbsp;CE, includes two references to Jesus in Books [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|18]] and [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|20]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier9512&gt;Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). ''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two passages, the James passage in Book 20 is used by scholars to support the existence of Jesus, the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' in Book 18 his crucifixion.&lt;ref name="Camber121"/&gt; Josephus' James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person and that some of his contemporaries considered him the Messiah.&lt;ref name=Camber121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104&gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' {{ISBN|0-8054-4365-7}} pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bart Ehrman, Josephus' passage about Jesus was altered by a Christian scribe, including the reference to Jesus as the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Jesus Interrupted, p. 159, Harper Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

A textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term "Christos" there seems unusual for Josephus.&lt;ref name=EB128&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 128–130&lt;/ref&gt; An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the ''Antiquities'' before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt; A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=EB128/&gt;

The passage deals with the death of "James the brother of Jesus" in Jerusalem. Whereas the works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with [[Jesus (name)|the name Jesus]], this passage specifies that this Jesus was the one "who was called Christ".&lt;ref name=EB129&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter137&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.; Hata, Gōhei. ''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity''. Brill. {{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}}. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|Book 20, Chapter 9, 1]] of the ''Antiquities'' to "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James",&lt;ref name=Feldman557&gt;[[Louis Feldman]] ({{ISBN|90-04-08554-8}} pp. 55–57) states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been "almost universally acknowledged".&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst83&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham "For What Offense Was James Put to Death?" in ''James the Just and Christian origins'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1999 {{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter134&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} pp. 134–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refsummary &gt;Sample quotes from previous references: Van Voorst ({{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 83) states that the overwhelming majority of scholars consider both the reference to "the brother of Jesus called Christ" and the entire passage that includes it as authentic."  Bauckham ({{ISBN|90-04-11550-1}} pp. 199–203) states: "the vast majority have considered it to be authentic". Meir ({{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 108–109) agrees with Feldman that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage. Setzer ({{ISBN|0-8006-2680-X}} pp. 108–109) also states that few have questioned its authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Testimonium Flavianum'' (meaning the testimony of Flavius [Josephus]) is the name given to the passage found in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Book 18, Chapter 3, 3]] of the ''Antiquities'' in which Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus; Whiston, William; Maier, Paul L. (May 1999). ''The New Complete Works of Josephus''. Kregel Academic. {{ISBN|0-8254-2948-X}} p. 662&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 &gt;Schreckenberg, Heinz; Schubert, Kurt (1992a). ''Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature. 2''. {{ISBN|90-232-2653-4}} pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have differing opinions on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in the passage to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt; The general scholarly view is that while the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to Christian interpolation.&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A. (2001). ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wansbrough, Henry (2004). ''Jesus and the oral Gospel tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04090-9}} p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt; Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneemelcher, Robert McLachlan Wilson, ''New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and Related Writings'', p. 490 (James Clarke &amp; Co. Ltd, 2003). {{ISBN|0-664-22721-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the ''Testimonium'' by Josephus would have looked like.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;

The references found in ''Antiquities'' have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'', written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the ''Antiquities'' covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between the writing of the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 70 CE) and ''Antiquities'' (after 90 CE) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the ''Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H. (1984). "Flavius Josephus Revisited: The Man, his Writings and his Significance". In Temporini, Hildegard; Haase, Wolfgang. Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Part 2. pp. 763–771. {{ISBN|3-11-009522-X}} p. 826&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and the [[New Testament]] accounts.&lt;ref name=Painter143&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-567-04191-3}} pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, because a Christian interpolator would more likely have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.&lt;ref name=EB129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter143/&gt; Robert Eisenman provides numerous early Christian sources that confirm the Josephus testament, that James was the brother of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (2002), "James the Brother of Jesus: the key to unlocking the secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tacitus====
{{Main article|Tacitus on Christ}}
[[File:Lipsius manuscript.jpg|thumb|170px|The title page of 1598 edition of the works of Tacitus, kept in [[Empoli]], Italy.]]
The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] and [[Roman senate|senator]] [[Tacitus]] referred to [[Jesus|Christ]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his execution]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] and the existence of [[early Christians]] in Rome in his final work, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (c. AD 116), [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]].&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Easterling, E. J. Kenney (general editors), ''The Cambridge History of Latin Literature'', p. 892 (Cambridge University Press, 1982, reprinted 1996). {{ISBN|0-521-21043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brent32 &gt;''A political history of early Christianity'' by Allen Brent 2009 {{ISBN|0-567-03175-6}} pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Testament 2000. pp. 39–53"&gt;[[Robert Van Voorst]], ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2000. pp. 39–53&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant passage reads: "called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus."

Scholars generally consider Tacitus's reference to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]] to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans42  &gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A. Evans 2001 {{ISBN|0-391-04118-5}} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated343"&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interpretation2004"&gt;''Pontius Pilate in History and Interpretation'' by Helen K. Bond 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-61620-4}} p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Portier263 /&gt; William L. Portier has stated that the consistency in the references by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to [[Emperor Trajan]] by [[Pliny the Younger]] reaffirm the validity of all three accounts.&lt;ref name=Portier263 &gt;''Tradition and Incarnation: Foundations of Christian Theology'' by William L. Portier 1993 {{ISBN|0-8091-3467-5}} p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacitus was a patriotic [[Roman senator]] and his writings shows no sympathy towards Christians.&lt;ref name="CEvans42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated293"&gt;''Ancient Rome'' by William E. Dunstan 2010 {{ISBN|0-7425-6833-4}} p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated293"/&gt;&lt;ref name= MAPowell33 &gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to the New Testament and the origins of Christianity'' by Delbert Royce Burkett 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-00720-8}} p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Köstenberger]] and separately [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] state that the tone of the passage towards Christians is far too negative to have been authored by a Christian scribe – a conclusion shared by [[John P. Meier]]&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2000. pp. 39–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} p. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier, John P., [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus]], Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: pp. 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] states that "of all Roman writers, Tacitus gives us the most precise information about Christ".&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;

[[John Dominic Crossan]] considers the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: "That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact."&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, John Dominic (1995). Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography. HarperOne. {{ISBN|0-06-061662-8}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D. Ehrman]] states: "Tacitus's report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius's reign."&lt;ref name = "Ehrman-212"&gt;Ehrman p 212&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy and Boyd state that it is now "firmly established" that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name=EddyB127&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' Baker Academic, {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of scholars consider it to be genuine, a few scholars question the authenticity of the passage given that Tacitus was born 25&amp;nbsp;years after Jesus' death.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt;

Some scholars have debated the historical value of the passage given that Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce,''Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament'', (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1974) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerd Theissen]] and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labeled Pilate correctly as a ''prefect'' rather than a ''procurator''.&lt;ref&gt;Theissen and Merz p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about "Christus" and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Theissen, Gerd |author2=Merz, Annette | title=The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide |url = https://books.google.com/?id=3ZU97DQMH6UC&amp;pg=PA83| year=1998 | publisher=Fortress Press | location=Minneapolis  | isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 | page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that given his position as a senator Tacitus was also likely to have had access to official Roman documents of the time and did not need other sources.&lt;ref name=Eddy181 &gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels'' by Paul R. Eddy, et al 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Martin notes that the authenticity of this passage of the Annals has also been disputed on the grounds that Tacitus would not have used the word “messiah” in an authentic Roman document.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Christianity, By Michael Martin, pp. 50–51, at https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=historicity+of+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-_8U5-yEtTH7AbBpoCoAg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaver notes that Tacitus spoke of the persecution of Christians, but no other Christian author wrote of this persecution for a hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Jesus in the Twentieth Century: 1900–1950, By Walter P. Weaver, pp. 53, 57, at https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=historicity+of+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-_8U5-yEtTH7AbBpoCoAg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotema notes that this passage was not quoted by any Church father up to the 15th century, although the passage would have been very useful to them in their work;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"&gt;Secret of Regeneration, By Hilton Hotema, p. 100, at https://books.google.com/books?id=jCaopp3R5B0C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=interpolations+in+tacitus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CRf-U9-VGZCe7AbxrIDQCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=interpolations%20in%20tacitus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and that the passage refers to the Christians in Rome being a multitude, while at that time the Christian congregation in Rome would actually have been very small.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.za"/&gt;

[[Richard Carrier]] has put forward the ideas that the 'Christ, the author of this name, was executed by the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius' line is a Christian interpolation and that Tacitus wrote about Chrestians not Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) "The Prospect of a Christian Interpolation in Tacitus, Annals 15.44" ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Volume 68, Issue 3, pp. 264–283 (an earlier and more detailed version appears in Carrier's ''Hitler Homer Bible Christ'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Richard (2014) ''On the Historicity of Jesus'' Sheffield Phoenix Press {{ISBN|978-1-909697-49-2}} p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also debated the issue of hearsay in the reference by Tacitus. Charles Guignebert argued that "So long as there is that possibility [that Tacitus is merely echoing what Christians themselves were saying], the passage remains quite worthless".&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus'', University Books, New York, 1956, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; R.

[[File:Suetonius Lives of the Twelve Caesars 1540.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1540 copy of ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' by Suetonius ]]
The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Suetonius]] (c. 69 – after 122 CE) made references to [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and their leader in his work ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' (written 121 CE).&lt;ref name="Cradle110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lives &gt;''Lives of the Caesars'' by Suetonius, Catharine Edwards 2001 {{ISBN|0192832719}} pp. 184. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 &gt;''Birth of Christianity'' by John Dominic Crossan 1999 {{ISBN|0567086682}} pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt; The references appear in [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] and [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Nero#16|Nero 16]] which describe the lives of [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]].&lt;ref name=lives /&gt; The Nero 16 passage refers to the abuses by Nero and mentions how he inflicted punishment on Christians – which is generally dated to around AD 64.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire'' by Matthew Bunson 1994 {{ISBN|081602135X}} p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; This passage shows the clear contempt of Suetonius for Christians - the same contempt expressed by [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the younger]] in their writings, but does not refer to Jesus himself.&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 /&gt;

The earlier passage in Claudius, may include a reference to Jesus, but is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvorst29 /&gt; In [[s:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] Suetonius refers to the expulsion of Jews by Claudius and states:&lt;ref name=lives /&gt;

:"Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome."

The reference in Claudius 25 involves the agitations in the Jewish community which led to the expulsion of some Jews from Rome by Claudius, and is likely the same event mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]).&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; Most historians date this expulsion to around AD 49–50.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius refers to the leader of the Christians as ''Chrestus'', a term also used by [[Tacitus on Christ|used by Tacitus]], referred in Latin dictionaries as a (amongst other things) version of 'Christus'.&lt;ref name=France42 &gt;R. T. France. The Evidence for Jesus. (2006). Regent College Publishing {{ISBN|1-57383-370-3}}. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wording used by Suetonius implies that Chrestus was alive at the time of the disturbance and was agitating the Jews in Rome.&lt;ref name=Dunn141&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; This weakens the historical value of his reference as a whole, and there is no overall scholarly agreement about its value as a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt; However, the confusion of Suetonius also points to the lack of Christian interpolation, for a Christian scribe would not have confused the Jews with Christians.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;

Most scholars assume that in the reference Jesus is meant and that the disturbances mentioned were due to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|spread of Christianity in Rome]].&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman332&gt;Louis H.

Some scholars such as [[Craig A. Evans]], [[John P. Meier|John Meier]] and [[Craig S. Keener]] see it as a likely reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=BoydE166&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007).

Menahem Stern states Suetonius definitely was referring to Jesus; because he would have added "a certain" to Chrestus if he had meant some unknown agitator.&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Stern, 1980, Jerusalem, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism Vol.2, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Codex Reuchlin 2 96v.jpg|thumb|170px|A page from ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' in the 12th century Reuchlin Codex [[Talmud]]]]
The Babylonian [[Talmud]] in a few cases includes possible references to Jesus using the terms "Yeshu", "Yeshu ha-Notzri", "ben Stada", and "ben Pandera". Some of these references probably date back to the [[Tannaim|Tannaitic period]] (70–200 CE).&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum107 &gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' {{ISBN|0-8054-4365-7}}. pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it is not clear if the references are to Jesus, or other people, and scholars continue to debate their historical value, and exactly which references, if any, may be to Jesus.&lt;ref name=BEddy170&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theissen, Gerd, Annette Merz, ''The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide'', Fortress Press, 1998 pp. 72–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|140519362X}} p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the scarcity of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving [[Judaism]] itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Eisenman argues that the derivation of Jesus of Nazareth from "ha-Notzri" is impossible on etymological grounds, as it would suggest rather "the [[Nazirite]]" rather than "the Nazarene".&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "James; the Brother of Jesus" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Voorst states that although the question of who was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin 43a]]'' (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there is little doubt that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Leslie693&gt;In ''Jesus: The Complete Guide'' edited by J. L. Houlden (2006) {{ISBN|082648011X}} pp. 693–694&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst117118&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 177–118&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher M. Tuckett]] states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 {{ISBN|0521796784}} p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the passage is a [[Tannaitic]] reference to the trial and death of Jesus at Passover and is most likely earlier than other references to Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt; The passage reflects hostility toward Jesus among the rabbis and includes this text:&lt;ref name=Blom280&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg (1 Aug 2009) {{ISBN|0805444823}} p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is taught: On the eve of Passover they hung Yeshu and the crier went forth for forty days beforehand declaring that "[Yeshu] is going to be stoned for practicing witchcraft, for enticing and leading Israel astray. Anyone who knows something to clear him should come forth and exonerate him." But no one had anything exonerating for him and they hung him on the eve of Passover.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 43a.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Schäfer]] states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not [[Tannaitic]] but from a later [[Amoraic]] period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them.&lt;ref name=PeterS141&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (2009) {{ISBN|0691143188}} pp. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart Ehrman]] and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (1998) {{ISBN|0664257038}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference in early second century Rabbinic literature ([[Tosefta|Tosefta Hullin]] II 22) refers to Rabbi Eleazar ben Dama who was bitten by a snake, but was denied healing in the name of Jesus by another Rabbi for it was against the law, and thus died.&lt;ref name=Bammel393/&gt; This passage reflects the attitude of Jesus' early Jewish opponents, i.e. that his miracles were based on evil powers.&lt;ref name=Bammel393&gt;''Jesus and the Politics of his Day'' by E. Bammel and C. F. D. Moule (1985) {{ISBN|0521313449}} p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kee71&gt;''The Beginnings of Christianity'' by Howard Clark Kee (2005) {{ISBN|0567027414}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy and Boyd, who question the value of several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence.&lt;ref name=BEddy170/&gt; [[R. T. France]] and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France ''The Evidence for Jesus'' 2006 {{ISBN|1573833703}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as [[Celsus]].&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt; [[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;

===Minor sources===
{{Main article|Pliny the Younger on Christians|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

'''[[Pliny the Younger]]''' (c. 61 – c. 112), the provincial governor of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Bithynia]], wrote to [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] ''c''. 112 [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|concerning how to deal with Christians]], who refused to [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|worship the emperor]], and instead worshiped "Christus". Charles Guignebert, who does not doubt that Jesus of the Gospels lived in Gallilee in the 1st century, nevertheless dismisses this letter as acceptable evidence for a historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus, by Ch. Gugnebert, Translated from the French by S. H. Hooke, University Book, New York, 1956, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]''', of whom very little is known, and none of whose writings survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which [[Eusebius]] referred. [[Sextus Julius Africanus|Julius Africanus]], writing ''c'' 221, links a reference in the third book of the ''History'' to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts in three of the Gospels .&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Africanus, ''Extant Writings'' XVIII in ''Ante-Nicene Fathers'', ed. A. Roberts and J. Donaldson (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973) vol. VI, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 &gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 122–126&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49–52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89–92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112–109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD.  All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/thallus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Phlegon of Tralles]]''', AD 80–140, similar to Thallus, Julius Africanus mentions a historian named Phlegon who wrote a chronicle of history around AD 140, where he records:
“Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth to the ninth hour.” (Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)  Phlegon is also mentioned by Origen (an early church theologian and scholar, born in Alexandria):
“Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, I think, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events . . . but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 14)
“And with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place … ” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 33)
“Jesus, while alive, was of no assistance to himself, but that he arose after death, and exhibited the marks of his punishment, and showed how his hands had been pierced by nails.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 59).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html see book 2, chapter 33 and 59&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eusebius in The Chronicon (written in the 4th century AD) records what Phlegon said verbatim. "Now, in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [32 AD], a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour [noon] that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars could be seen in heaven, and the earth moved in Bithynia, toppling many buildings in the city of Nicaea." Phlegon never mentions Jesus or the 3 hour darkness.  He also mentions a solar eclipse, which can not occur at Passover. Apart from the year (which may be a corruption), this description fits an earthquake and eclipse that occurred in North West Turkey on November, 29 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=00291124&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Celsus]]''' writing late in the second century produced the first full-scale attack on Christianity.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst6568 /&gt; Celsus' document has not survived but in the third century [[Origen]] replied to it, and what is known of Celsus' writing is through the responses of Origen.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt; According to Origen, Celsus accused Jesus of being a magician and a sorcerer. While the statements of Celsus may be seen as valuable, they have little historical value, given that the wording of the original writings can not be examined.&lt;ref name=Voorst6568&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

===Disputed sources===
The following sources are disputed, and of limited historical value, but they are at least proof of Christians existing and being known and talked about in the first and second centuries.
* [[Lucian on Jesus|Lucian of Samosata]] (born 115 CE), a well-known [[Greek people|Greek]] satirist and traveling lecturer [[Lucian on Jesus|wrote mockingly of the followers of Jesus]] for their ignorance and credulity.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert E. Van Voorst 2000. pp 58-64"&gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 58–64&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Lucian's understanding of Christian traditions has significant gaps and errors, his writing is unlikely to have been influenced by Christians themselves, and he may provide an independent statement about the crucifixion of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Eddy122 /&gt; However, given the nature of the text as satire, Lucian may have embellished the stories he heard and his account cannot have a high degree of historical reliability.&lt;ref name="Robert E. Van Voorst 2000. pp 58-64"/&gt;
* [[Trajan|Emperor Trajan]] (c. 53–117), in reply to a letter sent by [[Pliny the Younger]], wrote "You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it—that is, by worshiping our gods—even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age."
* [[Epictetus]] (AD 55–135) provides another possible yet disputed reference to Christians as "Galileans" in his "Discourses" 4.7.6 and 2.9.19–21: "Therefore, if madness can produce this attitude [of detachment] toward these things [death, loss of family, property], and also habit, as with the Galileans, can no one learn from reason and demonstration that God has made all things in the universe, and the whole universe itself, to be unhindered and complete in itself, and the parts of it to serve the needs of the whole."
* [[Numenius of Apamea]], in the second century, wrote a possible allusion to Christians and Christ that is contained in fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, on the Good (in which according to Origen, Contra Celsum, iv. 51, he makes an allusion to Jesus Christ).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen164.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====James Ossuary====
{{Main article|James Ossuary}}
There is a limestone burial box from the 1st century known as the [[James Ossuary]] with the Aramaic inscription, "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."  The authenticity of the inscription was challenged by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], who filed a complaint with the Israeli police. In 2012, the owner of the ossuary was found not guilty, with the judge ruling that the authenticity of the ossuary inscription had not been proven either way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested it was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayalon, A., Bar-Matthews, M., &amp; Goren, Y. | year = 2004 | title = Authenticity examination of the inscription on the ossuary attributed to James, brother of Jesus | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1185–1189 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2004.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian sources==
Various books, memoirs and stories were written about Jesus by the early Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are believed to have been written within 50–70 years of the death of Jesus, with the [[Gospel of Mark]] believed to be the earliest, and the last the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. xix–xx, 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Burton L. (1996)"Who Wrote the New Testament: the making of a Christian Myth"(Harper One)&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by [[St Paul]]: the [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]], which appeared about 25 years after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey J.(2005), "The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Teachings of Christianity".(Inner Traditions)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Ehrman]], [[Robert Eisenman]] and others critical of traditional Christian views, in assessing the problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by people who did not know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2010), "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don't Know About Them)" (Harper One 1 Reprint edition (2 February 2010)). pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einsenman, Robert (2002), "james, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls" (Watkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}

====Overview====
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|150px|A page from [[2 Corinthians]] in [[Papyrus 46]], c. AD 200]]
In the context of Christian sources, even if all other texts are ignored, the [[Pauline epistles]] can provide some information regarding Jesus.&lt;ref name="Tuckett126"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38 /&gt; This information does not include a narrative of the life of Jesus, and refers to his existence as a person, but adds few specific items apart from his death by crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Furnish43&gt;Victor Furnish in ''Paul and Jesus'' edited by Alexander J. M. Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) {{ISBN|0567083969}} pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; This information comes from those letters of Paul whose authenticity is not disputed.&lt;ref name=McK38&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 {{ISBN|0865546770}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was not a companion of Jesus and claims his information comes from the holy spirit acquired after Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;From Jesus to Christianity, San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2004 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the thirteen letters that bear Paul's name, seven are considered authentic by almost all scholars, and the others are generally considered [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name=EerdDunn&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' by James D. G. Dunn (19 Nov 2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} p. 1274 "There is general scholarly agreement that seven of the thirteen letters beariing Pau's name are authentic, but his authorship of the other six cannot be taken for granted... Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philomen are certainly Paul's own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune9&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' by David E. Aune {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 9 "... seven of the letters attributed to Paul are almost universally accepted as authentic (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, Philomen)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 &gt;Pheme Perkins, ''Reading the New Testament: An Introduction'' (Paulist Press, 1988), {{ISBN|0809129396}} pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The 7 undisputed letters (and their approximate dates) are: [[1 Thessalonians]] (c. 51 CE), [[Philippians]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] (c. 52–54 CE), [[1 Corinthians]] (c. 53–54 CE), [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] (c. 55 CE), [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 55–56 CE) and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] (c. 55–58 CE).&lt;ref name=EerdDunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The authenticity of these letters is accepted by almost all scholars, and they have been referenced and interpreted by early authors such as [[Origen]] and [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name=Aune9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gorday&gt;Peter Gorday in ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' by Harold W. Attridge 1992 {{ISBN|0814323618}} pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Pauline epistles are generally dated to AD 50 to AD 60, they are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; These letters were written approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus, around AD 30–36.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The letters were written during a time when Paul recorded encounters with the disciples of Jesus, e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:18|Galatians 1:18]] states that several years after his conversion Paul went to Jerusalem and stayed with Apostle Peter for fifteen days.&lt;ref name=Adams94&gt;Edward Adams "Paul, Jesus and Christ" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|140519362X}} pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Paul disputed the nature of Jesus' message with Jesus's brother James, concerning the importance of adhering to kosher food restrictions and circumcision, important features of determining Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Buetz, Jeffrey (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (op cit)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters were not intended to provide a narrative of the life of Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt; In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul&gt;James D. G. Dunn "Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus" in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (2007) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|052104460X}} pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pauline letters clearly indicate that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4), a Jew ("born under the law", Romans 1.3) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5), who was crucified (as in 1 Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1) and who resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15.20, Romans 1.4 and 6.5, Philippians 3:10–11).&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt; And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Gentillic Christian Church that Jesus existed, was crucified and was raised from the dead.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;

The references by Paul to Jesus do not in themselves prove the existence of Jesus, but they do establish that the existence of Jesus was the accepted norm within the early Christians (including the Christian community in Jerusalem, given the references to collections there) twenty to thirty years after the death of Jesus, at a time when those who could have been acquainted with him could still be alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0805444823}} pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0860120066}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Specific references====
The seven Pauline epistles that are widely regarded as authentic include the following information that along with other historical elements are used to study the historicity of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;

[[File:Papyrus 27.png|thumb|110px|Early 3rd century copy of [[Epistle to the Romans]] from [[Papyrus 27]]]]
* ''Existence of Jesus'': That in Paul's view Jesus existed and was a Jew is based on [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#4:4|Galatians 4:4]] which states that he was "born of a woman" and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3]] that he was "born under the law".&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; Some scholars such as [[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Paul Barnett]] hold that this indicates that Paul had some familiarity with the circumstances of the birth of Jesus, but that is not shared among scholars in general.&lt;ref name=JRDunn143&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barn95&gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'' by Paul Barnett 2002 {{ISBN|0830826998}} pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statement does indicate that Paul had some knowledge of and interest in Jesus' life before his crucifixion.&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt;
* ''Disciples and brothers'': [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:5|
1 Corinthians 15:5]] states that Paul knew that Jesus had 12 disciples, and considers Peter as one of them.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and Scripture'' by Steve Moyise (1 Jul 2010) {{ISBN|080103924X}} p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#1:12|1 Corinthians 1:12]] further indicates that Peter was known in [[Corinth]] before the writing of [[1 Corinthians]], for it assumes that they were familiar with Cephas/Peter.&lt;ref&gt;''Paul, Antioch and Jerusalem'' by Nicholas Taylor 1991 {{ISBN|1850753318}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VernK74&gt;''The Tapestry of Early Christian Discourse'' by Vernon K. Robbins (1996) {{ISBN|0415139988}} pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; The statement in 1 Corinthians 15:5 indicates that "the twelve" as a reference to the [[twelve apostles]] was a generally known notion within the early Christian Church in Corinth and required no further explanation from Paul.&lt;ref name=JRDunn507&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:18|Galatians 1:18]] further states that Paul personally knew Peter and stayed with him in Jerusalem for fifteen days, about three years after his conversion.&lt;ref name=MateraGal65&gt;''Galatians'' by Frank J. Matera 2007 {{ISBN|0814659721}} p. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; It also implies that Peter was already known to the Galatians and required no introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Galatians'' by Martinus C. de Boer 2011 {{ISBN|0664221238}} p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#9:5|1 Corinthians 9:5]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:19|Galatians 1:19]] state that Jesus had brothers, one being called James, whom Paul met or "saw."&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish43/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; James was claimed by early Christian writers as Origen and Eusebius to have been the leader of the followers of Jesus, after his brother's death, and to have been the first bishop, or [[archbishop|bishop of bishops]] in Jerusalem.
* ''Betrayal and rituals'': That Jesus was betrayed and established some traditions such as the [[Eucharist]] are derived from [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|1 Corinthians 11:23–25]] which states: "The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.".&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;
* ''Crucifixion'': The Pauline letters include several references to the crucifixion of Jesus e.g. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|
1 Corinthians 11:23]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:2|
1 Corinthians 2:2]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:1|
Galatians 3:1]] among others.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; The death of Jesus forms a central element of the Pauline letters.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul/&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:15|1 Thessalonians 2:15]] places the responsibility for the death of Jesus on some Jews.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; Moreover the statement in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:14|1 Thessalonians 2:14–16]] about the Jews "who both killed the Lord Jesus" and "drove out us" indicates that the death of Jesus was within the same time frame as the persecution of Paul.&lt;ref name=Eddy46&gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels' by Paul R. Eddy, Gregory A. Boyd 2007 {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}} pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Burial'': [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:4|1 Corinthians 15:4]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:4|Romans 6:4]] state that following his death Jesus was [[empty tomb|buried]] (but does not mention a tomb).&lt;ref name=Furnish19&gt;''Jesus according to Paul'' by Victor Paul Furnish 1994 {{ISBN|0521458242}} pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is then used by Paul to build on the theology of resurrection, but reflects the common belief at the time that Jesus was buried after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''1 Corinthians'' by Richard Oster 1995 {{ISBN|0899006337}} p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle (1 Nov 2005) {{ISBN|0801027969}} pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of only these references to Jesus in the Pauline epistles has given rise to criticism of them by [[G. A. Wells]], who is generally accepted as a leader of the movement to deny the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=WellsT49 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Casey39 /&gt; When Wells was still denying the existence of Jesus, he criticized the Pauline epistles for not mentioning items such as John the Baptist or Judas or the trial of Jesus and used that argument to conclude that Jesus was not a historical figure.&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt;&lt;ref name= Casey39&gt;'Jesus of Nazareth: An independent historian's account of his life and teaching'' by Maurice Casey pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dunn29&gt;''The Evidence for Jesus'' by James D. G. Dunn (1986) {{ISBN|0664246982}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James D. G. Dunn]] addressed Wells' statement and stated that he knew of no other scholar that shared that view, and most other scholars had other and more plausible explanations for the fact that Paul did not include a narrative of the life of Jesus in his letters, which were primarily written as religious documents rather than historical chronicles at a time when the life story of Jesus could have been well known within the early Church.&lt;ref name= Dunn29 /&gt; Dunn states that despite Wells' arguments, the theories of the non-existence of Jesus are a "thoroughly dead thesis".&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt;

While Wells no longer denies the existence of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his [[arguments from silence]] not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that he still has a low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed a good number of decades before.&lt;ref name=WellsT49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells 2003 {{ISBN|0812695674}} p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Pauline creeds====
{{Main article|Creed}}
The Pauline letters sometimes refer to creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;&lt;ref name=RMartin57 &gt;''Worship in the Early Church'' by Ralph P. Martin 1975 {{ISBN|0802816134}} pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3–4]] reads: "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."&lt;ref name=Kruse41 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' by Colin G. Kruse (2012) {{ISBN|0802837433}} pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3–4]] refers to Romans 1:2 just before it which mentions an existing gospel, and in effect may be treating it as an earlier creed.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;

One of the keys to identifying a pre-Pauline tradition is given in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:11|1 Corinthians 15:11]]&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt;

: Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

Here Paul refers to others before him who preached the creed.&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt; James Dunn states that [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3]] indicates that in the 30s Paul was taught about the death of Jesus a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'', Volume 1 by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters thus contain Christian creed elements of pre-Pauline origin.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47

* R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81, 92&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the creed has been located by many Biblical scholars to less than a decade after Jesus' death, originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968)p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed. A. J. B. Higgins (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966) p. 66–66; R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81; Thomas Sheehan, ''First Coming: How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity'' (New York: Random House, 1986 pp. 110, 118; Ulrich Wilckens, ''Resurrection'' translated A. M. Stewart (Edinburgh: Saint Andrew, 1977) p. 2; Hans Grass, ''Ostergeschen und Osterberichte'', Second Edition (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1962) p. 96; Grass favors the origin in Damascus.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning this creed, Campenhausen wrote, "This account meets all the demands of historical reliability that could possibly be made of such a text,"&lt;ref&gt;Hans von Campenhausen, "The Events of Easter and the Empty Tomb," in ''Tradition and Life in the Church'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; whilst A. M. Hunter said, "The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability."&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hunter, ''Works and Words of Jesus'' (1973) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

These creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death, and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Leith12 &gt;''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (1982) {{ISBN|0804205264}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although embedded within the texts of the New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name=BAune &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' edited by David E. Aune 2010 {{ISBN|1405108258}} p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that existence and death of Jesus was part of Christian belief a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.&lt;ref name=Leith12 /&gt;

The authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute [[chronology of Jesus]] or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pp. 730–731&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]] with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 &gt;''Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology'' by Timothy Wiarda 2010 {{ISBN|0-8054-4843-8}} pp. 75–78&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} p. 613&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, scholars have used them to reconstruct a number of portraits of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders3&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus'' {{ISBN|0140144994}} Penguin, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]] the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 {{ISBN|0-19-955787-X}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have varying degrees of certainty about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity is the subject of almost universal agreement among scholars are the [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt; Scholars such as [[E.P. Sanders]] and separately [[Craig A. Evans]] go further and assume that two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus [[Twelve apostles|called disciples]], and caused a [[Cleansing of the Temple|controversy at the Temple]].&lt;ref name="Evans37"/&gt;

Ever since the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], scholars continue to debate the order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the [[Markan priority]] hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first c. 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' edited by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802837115}} pp. 1064–1065&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|authorlink=John P. Meier|title=A Marginal Jew|publisher=Doubleday|year=1991|location=New York City|pages=v.2 955–6|isbn=0-385-46993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 CE.&lt;ref name="Harris Gospels"&gt;[[Stephen L. Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "The Gospels" pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the competing, and more popular, [[Q source]] hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q–Z'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (1995) {{ISBN|0802837840}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[two-source hypothesis]] then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'' by Robert L. Thomas 2002 {{ISBN|0825438381}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospels can be seen as having three separate lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst7&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Church fathers===
[[File:Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eusebius of Caesarea]]]]
Two possible [[Church Fathers|patristic sources]] that may refer to eye witness encounters with Jesus are the early references of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]], reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr22/&gt;

The works of Papias have not survived, but [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] quotes him as saying:&lt;ref name=Bauck15&gt;Richard Bauckham ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans, 2006), {{ISBN|0802831621}} pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"…if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders – that is, what according to the elders Andrew or Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying."

[[Richard Bauckham]] states that while Papias was collecting his information (c. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus' disciples) were still alive and teaching in [[Asia minor]], and Papias gathered information from people who had known them.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt; However, the exact identity of the "elder John" is wound up in the debate on the authorship of the [[Gospel of John]], and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. [[Jack Finegan]] states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Finegan42 &gt;''The archeology of the New Testament'' by Jack Finegan (1981) {{ISBN|0709910061}} pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Burge]], on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting the Gospel of John'' by [[Gary M. Burge]] (1998) {{ISBN|0801010217}} pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter of Quadratus (possibly the first Christian apologist) to emperor [[Hadrian]] (who reigned 117 – 138) is likely to have an early date and is reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' 4.3.2 to have stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Eusebius: The Church History'' by Eusebius and Paul L. Maier (2007) {{ISBN|082543307X}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The words of our Savior were always present, for they were true: those who were healed, those who rose from the dead, those who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present, not merely when the Savior was living on earth, but also for a considerable time after his departure, so that some of them survived even to our own times."&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 &gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

By "our Savior" Quadratus means Jesus and the letter is most likely written before AD 124.&lt;ref name=Carr22&gt;''The Early Christian Church: Volume 2, The Second Christian Century by Philip Carrington (2011) {{ISBN|0521157382}} pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that by "our times" he may refer to his early life, rather than when he wrote (117–124), which would be a reference contemporary with Papias.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that the importance of the statement attributed to Quadratus is that he emphasizes the "eye witness" nature of the testimonies to interaction with Jesus.&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 /&gt; Such "eye witness statements" abound in early Christian writings, particularly the [[pseudonymous]] Christian [[Apocrypha]], Gospels and Letters, in order to give them credibility.

===Apocryphal texts===
{{see also|Gnostic gospels|New Testament apocrypha}}
A number of later Christian texts, usually dating to the second century or later, exist as [[New Testament apocrypha]], among which the [[gnostic gospels]] have been of major recent interest among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; The 1945 discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] created a significant amount of scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt; However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute to the study of the historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative, similar to the hypothesised Q documents), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72/&gt; The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has been away from gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, [[Greco-Roman]] and [[canonical gospel|canonical]] Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Keener52 &gt;''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' by Craig S. Keener 2012 {{ISBN|0802868886}} pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman 2001 {{ISBN|019512474X}} pp. 72–78&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, [[Bart Ehrman]] states that gnostic writings of the [[Gospel of Thomas]] (part of the Nag Hammadi library) have very little value in historical Jesus research, because the author of that gospel placed no importance on the physical experiences of Jesus (e.g. his crucifixion) or the physical existence of believers, and was only interested in the secret teachings of Jesus rather than any physical events.&lt;ref name=BartProphet72 /&gt; Similarly, the [[Apocryphon of John]] (also part of the Nag Hammadi library) has been useful in studying the prevailing attitudes in the second century, and questions of authorship regarding the [[Book of revelation]], given that it refers to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#1|Revelation 1:19]], but is mostly about the [[Ascension of Jesus|post ascension]] teachings of Jesus in a vision, not a narrative of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Revelation'' by [[Robert H. Mounce]] 1997 {{ISBN|0802825370}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Edward Arnal contend that the Gospel of Thomas continues to remain useful for understanding how the teachings of Jesus were transmitted among early Christians, and sheds light on the development of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolic Jesus'' by William Edward Arnal 2005 {{ISBN|1845530071}} pp. 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is overlap between the sayings of Jesus in the apocryphal texts and canonical Christian writings, and those not present in the canonical texts are called [[agrapha]]. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Robert Van Voorst states that the vast majority of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 /&gt;

'''''The Peoplepedia: The Ultimate Reference on the American People''''' is a 1996 book by Les Krantz and Jim McCormick. Covering "Americans and their habits...from serious to silly",&lt;ref name=HC96/&gt; it "purports to illuminate 'who we are and how we see ourselves'".&lt;ref name=Dempsey96/&gt; It was written in three parts providing "statistical snapshots of American life": "The American Mindset" with popular opinions; "The American Collective" with facts about broad categories such as education or religion; and "Notable Americans" with biographical sketches.&lt;ref name=SLJ97/&gt; A review said it was "entertaining but, in some places, deceptive" and concentrated on men's biographies over women.&lt;ref name=Levins96/&gt;

'''''The Story of the Kelly Gang''''' is a 1906 Australian [[silent film]] that traces the exploits of 19th-century [[bushranger]] and [[outlaw]] [[Ned Kelly]] and his gang. It was directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]] and shot in and around the city of [[Melbourne]]. The film ran for more than an hour with a reel length of about {{convert|1200|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, making it the longest [[fictional film|narrative film]] yet seen in the world.&lt;ref name="Sally"&gt;Sally Jackson and Graham Shirley (2006), ''The Story of the Kelly Gang.''

Since its release, many other films have been made about the Kelly legend.

In 2007, ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]] for being the world's first full-length narrative [[feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Origins==
Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] had been executed only twenty-six years before ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was made, and Ned's mother Ellen and younger brother Jim were still alive at the time of its release. The film was made during an era when plays about bushrangers were extremely popular, and there were, by one estimate, six contemporaneous theatre companies giving performances of the Kelly gang story.&lt;ref name = Sally/&gt; Historian [[Ian Jones (author)|Ian Jones]] suggests bushranger stories still had an "indefinable appeal" for Australians in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Jones (1995) ''Ned Kelly; A short life.'' Thomas C. Lothian, Melbourne. p.337. {{ISBN|0 85091 631 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' was made by a consortium of two partnerships involved in theatre—entrepreneurs [[John Tait (entrepreneur)|John Tait]] and [[Nevin Tait]], and pioneering film exhibitors [[Millard Johnson (producer)|Millard Johnson]] and [[William Gibson (producer)|William Gibson]]. The Tait family owned the [[Melbourne Athenaeum| Melbourne Athenaeum Hall]] and part of their concert program often included short films. Melbourne film exhibitors Johnson and Gibson also had technical experience, including developing film stock. Credit for writing the film scenario is generally given to brothers Frank, [[John Tait (entrepreneur)|John]] and sometimes [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. At a time when films were usually shorts of five to ten minutes duration, their inspiration for making a film of at least sixty minutes in length, and intended as a stand-alone feature, was undoubtedly based on the proven success of stage versions of the Kelly story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Film historians Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper have noted that at the time, the filmmakers were unaware of the historical importance of the film they were making, and only much later "poured forth their memories." Unfortunately, "with the passage of time and the desire to make a good story of it" they "created a maze of contradictory information."&lt;ref name = "Pike and Cooper"/&gt;

For example, in later years, William Gibson claimed that while touring through New Zealand showing the bio-pic ''Living London'', he noticed the large audiences attracted to [[Charles MacMahon (theatrical entrepreneur)|Charles McMahon]]'s stage play ''The Kelly Gang''. Film historian Eric Reade claimed the Taits themselves owned the stage rights to a Kelly play,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Reade (1979) ''History and Heartburn: The Saga of Australian Film.'' p.5. Harper &amp; Row, Sydney. {{ISBN|0-06-312033X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while actors Sam Crewes and John Forde later also claimed to have thought of the idea of a making a film of the Kelly Gang's exploits, inspired by the success of stage plays.

There is evidence that at least one other bushranging film had been made before 1906. This was Joseph Perry's 1904 short ''[[Bushranging in North Queensland]]'', made by the [[Salvation Army]]'s [[Limelight Department]] in Melbourne, one of the world's first film studios.

==Cast==
There is considerable uncertainty over who appeared in the film and a number of unsubstantiated claims have been made regarding participation. According to the Australian [[National Film and Sound Archive]], the only actors positively identified are; 
*John Forde as [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]]
*Elizabeth Tait as the stunt double for the actress playing [[Kate Kelly (Australian outlaw)|Kate Kelly]]&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt;
Others thought to be in the film include
*Frank Mills, as the title character [[Ned Kelly]]
*John and Frank Tait, Harriet Tait, members of Charles Tait's family.&lt;ref name=Tait /&gt;
*J. (Jack) Ennis, as [[Steve Hart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article209806877 |title=Stage Accidents |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=27020 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=22 November 1941 |accessdate=1 June 2017 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Will Coyne, as [[Joe Byrne]]
In her memoirs, Viola Tait claimed the part of Ned was played by a Canadian stunt actor, who deserted the project part way through.&lt;ref name=Tait /&gt;

==Production==
[[File:The Story of the Kelly Gang 1906.jpg|thumb|Actor portraying Ned Kelly in an authentic suit of the [[armour of the Kelly gang|Kelly gang's armour]], which was loaned to the filmmakers and used in the film.]]
Shooting of the film reportedly involved a budget variously estimated between £400 (Gibson) and £1,000 (Tait) and took six months.&lt;ref name="register"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pike and Cooper"/&gt; While it is now commonly accepted that the Tait's experienced older brother [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles]] directed the film, only ten years after it was made, pioneer Australian director [[W. J. Lincoln]] claimed it was actually "directed by Mr Sam Crews [sic], who... worked without a scenario, and pieced the story together as he went along."&lt;ref name="winner"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154552668 |title=PICTURE PROFILES IN THE OLDEN DAYS. |newspaper=[[Winner (Melbourne)|Winner]] |location=Melbourne |date=9 February 1916 |accessdate=26 October 2014 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also claimed that "the principal characters were played by the promoters and their relatives, who certainly made no pretensions to any great histrionic talent."&lt;ref name="winner"/&gt;

Viola Tait's memoirs, published in the early 1970s, identifies Charles as being chosen as director because of his theatrical experience. Her account confirmed that many of the extended Tait family and their friends appeared in scenes.&lt;ref name=Tait&gt;Viola Tait (1971) ''A Family of Brothers. The Taits and J.C.Williamson; a Theatre History.'' Chapter 4. Heinemann Australia. {{ISBN|0-85561-011-5}}. Viola was sister in law to Charles, John and Nevin Tait.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Millard Johnson (producer)|Millard Johnson]] was camera operator.

Much of the film was shot on the property of Elizabeth Tait's family (Charles' wife) at [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], now a suburb of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=Tait/&gt; Other scenes in the film may have been shot in the suburbs of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] (indoor scenes), and possibly [[Eltham, Victoria|Eltham]], [[Greensborough, Victoria|Greensborough]], [[Mitcham, Victoria|Mitcham]], and [[Rosanna, Victoria|Rosanna]].&lt;ref name=Reade&gt;Eric Reade (1975) ''The Australian Screen.''

Costumes were possibly borrowed from [[E. I. Cole]]'s Bohemian Company, and members of the troupe may have also performed in the film. According to Viola Tait, [[Sir Rupert Clarke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Rupert Clarke]] loaned the suit of Kelly armour his family then owned for use in the film.

[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|The police descend on Glenrowan.]]
Film historian Ina Bertrand suggests that the tone of ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' is "one of sorrow, depicting Ned Kelly and his gang as the last of the bushrangers." Bertrand identifies several scenes that suggest considerable film making sophistication on the part of the Taits. One is the composition of a scene of police shooting parrots in the bush. The second is the capture of Ned, shot from the viewpoint of the police, as he advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The latter provided audiences with the sort of information later provided by [[intertitle]]s, and can help historians imagine what the entire film may have been like.

According to the synopsis given in the surviving programme, the film originally comprised six sequences. These provided a loose narrative based on the Kelly gang story.&lt;ref&gt;A copy of the programme is held by the National Film and Sound Archive.[http://nfsa.gov.au/ National Film and Sound Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A scan of a page from the programme can be seen at the blog Classic Australian Cinema: Australian films and actors from silents to the New Wave.

*Scene 1: Police discuss a warrant for Dan Kelly's arrest. Later, Kate Kelly rebuffs the attentions of a Trooper.
*Scene 2: The killings of Kennedy, Scanlon and Lonigan at Stringybark Creek by the gang.
*Scene 3: The hold-up at Younghusband's station and a bank hold–up.
*Scene 4: Various gang members and supporters evade the police and the gang killing of Aaron Sherritt.
*Scene 5: The attempt to derail a train and scenes at the Glenrowan Inn. The police surround the hotel, Dan Kelly and Steve Hart "die by each other's hands" after Joe Byrne is shot dead.
*Scene 6: The closing scenes. Ned Kelly fights hard but is shot in the legs. "He begs the Troopers to spare his life, thus falls the last of the Kelly Gang…"

Some confusion regarding the plot has emerged as a result of a variant poster dating from the time the film was re-released in 1910. The similar (but different) photos suggest that either the film was being added to for its re-release, or an entirely new version was made by Johnson and Gibson, as the poster proclaims. In addition, a film fragment (" the Perth fragment ") exists, showing Aaron Sherritt being shot in front of an obviously painted canvas flat. This is now thought to be from a different film altogether, perhaps a cheap imitation of ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' made by a theatrical company, keen to cash in on the success of the original, or an earlier bushranger short.&lt;ref name= cinema/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Melbourne Athenaeum.jpg|thumb|The film premiered at Melbourne's [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Athenaeum Hall]].]]
The film was given a week of trial screenings in country towns in late 1906. This proved enormously successful and the movie recouped its budget for these screenings alone.&lt;ref name = "S&amp;A"/&gt;

Its Melbourne debut was made at the [[Athenaeum, Melbourne|Athenaeum Hall]] on 26 December 1906. It ran for five weeks to full houses, local papers noting the extraordinary popularity of the film. Although the country screenings had been silent, when the film was screened in Melbourne it was accompanied by live sound effects, including blank cartridges as gunshots and coconut shells beaten together to simulate hoofbeats. At later screenings a lecturer would also narrate the action.&lt;ref name = "S&amp;A"/&gt; These additions were well-received by the theatre critic for ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', who stated that they greatly enhance the film's realism. He went on to say:&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/175790643 "The Playgoer"]. ''Melbourne Punch'' (Melbourne). 3 January 1907. p. 28. Retrieved 13 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|All the notable features of the story of the Kellys are reproduced, and with the dialogue make up a sensational and realistic series dealing with the murders, robberies and misdeeds which are not the air-created fancies of a penny-dreadful writer, but actual facts which are well within the memory of our citizens.}}

Comparing the film to other artistic depictions of the Kelly saga, one [[Adelaide]] critic wrote that it conveys "a far more vivid impression of the actual life and deeds of the Kellys than letterpress and stagecraft combined."&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5122782 "The Kelly Gang"]. ''The Advertiser'' (Adelaide). 29 December 1906. p. 8. Retrieved 13 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups at the time, including some politicians and the police, interpreted the film as a glorification of criminality. The film was banned in "Kelly Country"—regional centres such as [[Benalla]] and [[Wangaratta]]—in April 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article139760973 |title=NOTES AND NOTICES |newspaper=[[The Australasian (Melbourne)|The Australasian]] |location=Melbourne |date=27 April 1907 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |page=37 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1912 [[bushranger ban|bushranger films were banned across New South Wales and Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11671365 |title=HARMFUL PICTURE SHOWS: KELLY GANG FILM BANNED |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |location=Melbourne |date=29 April 1912 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the bans, the film toured Australia for over 20 years and was also shown in New Zealand, Ireland and Britain. When [[Queen's Theatre, Dublin|Queen's Royal Theatre]] was rebuilt in [[Dublin]] in 1909, it opened with a program headed by ''The Story of the Kelly Gang''.&lt;ref&gt;Condon, Denis (2008). "Politics and the Cinematograph: The Boer War and the Funeral of Thomas Ashe". ''Field Day'' (Issue 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The backers and exhibitors made "a fortune" from the film, perhaps in excess of £25,000.&lt;ref name=Reade /&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' (fragment).]]
The film was considered lost until 1975, when five short segments totalling a few seconds of running time were found. In 1978 another 64 metres of the film was discovered in a collection belonging to a former film exhibitor. In 1980, further footage was found at a rubbish dump. The longest surviving single sequence, the scene at Younghusband's station, was found in the UK in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In director [[Warwick Thornton]]'s 2017 film ''[[Sweet Country (2017 film)|Sweet Country]]'', a "travelling picture show" in 1920s [[Northern Territory]] shows ''The Story of the Kelly Gang'' to residents of an outback town, who cheer for the bushranger. The film's protagonist, an Aboriginal outlaw, is also named Kelly, but vilified and hunted by the same townspeople. According to ''[[The Australian]]'', Thornton, an Aboriginal, "has little time" for depictions of Ned Kelly as a [[larrikin]] folk hero and Irish victim of British colonisation. "When there was a raiding party," said Thonrton, "and a massacre happened, the Scottish, the Irish and the British were all shooting us. It doesn’t equate for me.”&lt;ref&gt;Hawker, Philippa (13 January 2018).

'''Theodore G.H. Drake, MD'''(1891- 1959) was a Canadian pediatrician and one of three doctors that developed [[Pablum]].

==Early life==
Drake was born on September 16, 1891 in [[Webbwood, Ontario]]. He obtained his university degree from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1914. He spent two years in residence at the [[Toronto General Hospital]]. During [[World War I]], Drake was a medical officer. After the war he went back to the Toronto General Hospital where he eventually became head of the research institute.

==Medical accomplishments==
In 1923, he, along with Dr. Alan Brown and Dr. Frederick Tisdale, helped work out the formula for Pablum. The cereal marked a breakthrough in nutritional science: it helped prevent rickets, a crippling childhood disease, by ensuring that children have enough vitamin D in their diet. Although Pablum was not the first food designed and sold specifically for babies, it was the first baby food to come pre-cooked and thoroughly dried. The ease of preparation made Pablum successful in an era when infant malnutrition was still a major problem in industrialized countries.

During [[World War II]], Drake designed nutritional diets for [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] personnel as well as for POW parcels. After the war, he was named a member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] for his work.

==Personal life==
Drake met his first wife, Gerturd Salmond, overseas. She predeceased him by 15 years. His second wife was Nina Johnson. 

Drake was interested in the history of pediatric care. He began a collection of art and artifacts related to the history of children's health. Over 3000 artifacts and 1000 prints formed a base of his collection. This collection is now in the hands of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].

''Traffic Safety'' uses the methods of science to examine the deaths, injuries, and property damage from traffic crashes.  It is more focused on public policy and countermeasures than the author’s 1991 book ''Traffic Safety and the Driver''.  Results derived from many disciplines, including psychology, sociology, medicine, epidemiology, criminology, biomechanics, economics, physics, and engineering are synthesized into easily understood relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scienceservingsociety.com/traffic-safety.htm | title = Book Traffic Safety by Leonard Evans published 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Value and Capital''''' is a book by the British economist [[John Richard Hicks]], published in 1939. It is considered a [[Classic book|classic]] exposition of [[microeconomic theory]]. Central results include: 
*  extension of [[consumer theory]] for individual and market equilibrium as to [[good (economics)|goods]] [[supply and demand|demanded]] with explicit use of only [[ordinal utility]] for individuals, rather than requiring [[Social welfare function#Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function|interpersonal utility comparisons]]
* analysis of the 2-[[good (economics)|good]] as to effects of a price change and mathematical extension to any number of goods [[without loss of generality]]
* parallel results for [[production theory]] 
* extension of [[general equilibrium theory]] of markets and adaptation  of [[static equilibrium (economics)|static-equilibrium]] theory to economic dynamics in distinguishing temporary and [[long-run equilibrium]] through expectation of [[Agent (economics)|agents]].  `

==Outline and details==
The book has 19 chapters and the following outline:
* Introduction
* Part I, The theory of subjective value
* Part II, General equilibrium
* Part III, The foundations of economic dynamics
* Part IV, The working of the dynamic system
* Mathematical appendix.
 
It begins with a simplified case and generalises from it. An individual consumer has a given money income for spending on only two goods. What determines quantity demanded of each good by that individual? The basic [[hypothesis]] is the set of [[indifference curve#Map and properties of indifference curves|restrictions]] on the utility function and [[consumer theory#Indifference curves and budget constraints|demand equilibrium]] that results as to the consumer's budget constraint. That hypothesis drives the theoretical outcome of a price change in one of the goods on the quantity demanded of each good. The book decomposes the change into the [[substitution effect]] and the [[income effect#Income effect|income effect]]. The latter is the change in real income in theoretical terms without which the distinction between [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real and nominal values]] would be more problematic. The two effects are now standard in [[consumer theory]]. The analysis conforms with a proportionate change in money income and money prices of both goods leaving quantity demanded of both goods unchanged. This is also consistent with the distinction between real and nominal values and [[Mathematical problem|represents]] a common hypothesis in economics of no [[money illusion]].

An appendix generalises the 2-good case for consumption to the case of one good and a ''[[composite good]]'', that is, all other consumer goods. It derives the conditions under which the demand properties in equilibrium as to the price ratio and the [[marginal rate of substitution]] attributed to the 2-good case apply to the more general case, allowing the neat distinction between the income effect and the substitution effect. 

In his [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1972/hicks-lecture.html Nobel lecture], Hicks cites ''Value and Capital'' for clarifying an aspect of what became known as the [[aggregation problem]]. The problem is most acute in measuring the capital stock by its market value for the real-world case of heterogeneous capital goods (for example, steel presses and shovels). He showed that if the price ratios between the goods (equal to their marginal rates of substitution in equilibrium) did not remain constant with additional capital, aggregation of capital-good values would not be a strictly valid measure of the capital stock. He also showed that there was no unambiguous way of measuring the "period of production" (proposed by [[Böhm-Bawerk]]) that would in general serve as a measure of the capital stock.

From consumer equilibrium for an individual, the book aggregates to market equilibrium across all individuals, producers, and goods. In so doing, Hicks introduced Walrasian [[general equilibrium theory#History of general equilibrium modelling|general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience. This was the first publication to attempt a rigorous statement of ''stability conditions'' for general equilibrium. In doing so, Hicks formalised [[comparative statics]]. The book synthesises dynamic-adjustment elements from [[Walras]] and [[Knut Wicksell|Wicksell]] and from [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]. It distinguishes temporary, intermediate, and long-run equilibrium with expectations as to future market conditions affecting behaviour in current markets (Bliss, 1987, pp. 642–43).
