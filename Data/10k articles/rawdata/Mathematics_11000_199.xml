[[File:PassiveActive.JPG|thumb|310px|In the active transformation (left), a point moves from position P to P' by rotating clockwise by an angle θ about the origin of the coordinate system. In the passive transformation (right), point P does not move, while the coordinate system rotates counterclockwise by an angle θ about its origin. The coordinates of P' in the active case (that is, relative to the original coordinate system) are the same as the coordinates of P relative to the rotated coordinate system.]]

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], spatial transformations in the 3-dimensional Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; are distinguished into '''active''' or '''alibi transformations''', and '''passive''' or '''alias transformations'''. An '''active transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlibiTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alibi Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or [[rigid body]], which can be defined in the absence of a [[coordinate system]]; whereas a '''passive transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AliasTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alias Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or [[change of basis]]). By ''transformation'', [[mathematician]]s usually refer to active transformations, while [[physicist]]s and [[engineer]]s could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and a [[linear transformation]].

Put differently, a ''passive'' transformation refers to description of the ''same'' object in two different coordinate systems.&lt;ref name= Davidson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Robots and screw theory: applications of kinematics and statics to robotics 
|author=Joseph K. Davidson, Kenneth Henderson Hunt 
|chapter=§4.4.1 The active interpretation and the active transformation |page=74 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQq67Tr7D0cC&amp;pg=PA74 
|isbn=0-19-856245-4 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, an ''active transformation'' is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system. For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the [[tibia]] relative to the [[femur]], that is, its motion relative to a (''local'') coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (''global'') coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.&lt;ref name = Davidson/&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Alias and alibi rotations.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Rotation considered as a passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformation]]
[[File:Alias and alibi transformations 1 en.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Translation and rotation as passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformations]]
As an example, let the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2)\in \R^2&lt;/math&gt;, be a vector in the plane.  A rotation of the vector through an angle θ in counterclockwise direction is given by the [[rotation matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta\\
 \sin \theta &amp;  \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be viewed either as an ''active transformation'' or a ''passive transformation'' (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.

==Spatial transformations in the Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;==
In general a spatial transformation &lt;math&gt;T:\R^3\to \R^3&lt;/math&gt; may consist of a translation and a linear transformation. In the following, the translation will be omitted, and the linear transformation will be represented by a 3×3-matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

===Active transformation===
As an active transformation, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; into a new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)=T\mathbf{v}=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If one views &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{e}'_x=T(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_y=T(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_z=T(0,0,1)\}&lt;/math&gt; as a new basis, then the coordinates of the new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=v_x\mathbf{e}'_x+v_y\mathbf{e}'_y+v_z\mathbf{e}'_z&lt;/math&gt; in the new basis are the same as those of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=v_x\mathbf{e}_x+v_y\mathbf{e}_y+v_z\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; in the original basis. Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.

=== Passive transformation ===
On the other hand, when one views &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as a passive transformation, the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, i.e. with the inverse transformation &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref name=Amidror&gt;
{{cite book |isbn=1-4020-5457-2 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |title=The theory of the Moiré phenomenon: Aperiodic layers |first=Isaac|last=Amidror
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_QRomE5g3QC&amp;pg=PT361 |chapter=Appendix D: Remark D.12 |page=346 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new coordinate system XYZ with basis vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_X=T^{-1}(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Y=T^{-1}(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Z=T^{-1}(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;

The new coordinates &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the new coordinate system XYZ are given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)=v_Xe_X+v_Ye_Y+v_Ze_Z=T^{-1}(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

From this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by
:&lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a passive transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.

Note the difference between &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17051">The concept of [[angle]]s between [[line (geometry)|line]]s in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and between pairs of two lines, two planes or a line and a plane in [[space]] can be generalized to arbitrary [[dimension]]. This generalization was first discussed by [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]].&lt;ref name= "jordan"/&gt; For any pair of [[flat (geometry)|flats]] in a [[Euclidean space]] of arbitrary dimension one can define a set of mutual angles which are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[isometry|isometric]] transformation of the Euclidean space. If the flats do not intersect, their shortest [[distance]] is one more invariant.&lt;ref name= "jordan"/&gt; These angles are called '''canonical'''&lt;ref name="afriat"/&gt; or '''principal'''.&lt;ref name="bjoerck"/&gt; The concept of angles can be generalized to pairs of flats in a finite-dimensional [[inner product space]] over the [[complex number]]s.

==Jordan's definition&lt;ref name= "jordan"/&gt;==

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be flats of dimensions &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;E^n&lt;/math&gt;.  By definition, a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; does not alter their mutual angles. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; do not intersect, they will do so upon any translation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which maps some point in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to some point in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. It can therefore be assumed without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; intersect.

Jordan shows that [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_\rho,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y_1,\dots,y_\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;z_1,\dots,z_\tau,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;u_1,\dots,u_\upsilon,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;v_1,\dots,v_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;w_1,\dots,w_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;E^n&lt;/math&gt; can then be defined such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are described, respectively,  by the sets of equations

: &lt;math&gt;x_1=0,\dots,x_\rho=0,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;u_1=0,\dots,u_\upsilon=0,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;v_1=0,\dots,v_\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;x_1=0,\dots,x_\rho=0,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;z_1=0,\dots,z_\tau=0,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;v_1\cos\theta_1+w_1\sin\theta_1=0,\dots,v_\alpha\cos\theta_\alpha+w_\alpha\sin\theta_\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\theta_i&lt;\pi/2,i=1,\dots,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Jordan calls these coordinates '''canonical'''. By definition, the angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; are the '''angles''' between &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The non-negative integers &lt;math&gt;\rho,\sigma,\tau,\upsilon,\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are constrained by

: &lt;math&gt;\rho+\sigma+\tau+\upsilon+2\alpha=n,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma+\tau+\alpha=k,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma+\upsilon+\alpha=\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

For these equations to determine the five non-negative integers completely, besides the dimensions &lt;math&gt;n,k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt; and the number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, the non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; must be given. This is the number of coordinates &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt;, whose corresponding axes are those lying entirely within both &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The integer &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is thus the dimension of &lt;math&gt;F\cap G&lt;/math&gt;. The set of angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; may be supplemented with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; angles &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that &lt;math&gt;F\cap G&lt;/math&gt; has that dimension.

Jordan's proof applies essentially unaltered when &lt;math&gt;E^n&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional inner product space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^n&lt;/math&gt; over the complex numbers. (For [[#Angles between subspaces|angles between subspaces]], the generalization to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^n&lt;/math&gt; is discussed by Galántai and Hegedũs in terms of the below [[#vch|variational characterization]].&lt;ref name="galantai"/&gt;)

==Angles between subspaces==

Now let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be [[linear subspace|subspaces]] of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional inner product space over the [[real number|real]] or complex numbers. Geometrically, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are flats, so Jordan's definition of mutual angles applies. When for any canonical coordinate &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; the symbol &lt;math&gt;\hat\xi&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[unit vector]] of the &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; axis, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat y_1,\dots,\hat y_\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\hat w_1,\dots,\hat w_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\hat z_1,\dots,\hat z_\tau&lt;/math&gt; form an [[orthonormality|orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and the vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat y_1,\dots,\hat y_\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\hat w'_1,\dots,\hat w'_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\hat u_1,\dots,\hat u_\upsilon&lt;/math&gt; form an orthonormal basis for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat w'_i=\hat w_i\cos\theta_i+\hat v_i\sin\theta_i,\quad i=1,\dots,\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Being related to canonical coordinates, these basic vectors may be called '''canonical'''.

When &lt;math&gt;a_i,i=1,\dots,k&lt;/math&gt; denote the canonical basic vectors for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i,i=1,\dots,l&lt;/math&gt; the canonical basic vectors for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle a_i,b_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for any pair of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; except the following ones.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \langle\hat y_i,\hat y_i\rangle=1, &amp; &amp; i=1,\dots,\sigma, \\
&amp; \langle\hat w_i,\hat w'_i\rangle=\cos\theta_i, &amp; &amp; i=1,\dots,\alpha.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the above ordering of the basic vectors, the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the inner products &lt;math&gt;\langle a_i,b_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is thus [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]]. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;(a'_i,i=1,\dots,k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b'_i,i=1,\dots,\ell)&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary orthonormal bases in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then the [[orthogonal transformation|real, orthogonal]] or [[unitary transformation|unitary]] transformations from the basis &lt;math&gt;(a'_i)&lt;/math&gt; to the basis &lt;math&gt;(a_i)&lt;/math&gt; and from the basis &lt;math&gt;(b'_i)&lt;/math&gt; to the basis &lt;math&gt;(b_i)&lt;/math&gt; realize a [[singular value decomposition]] of the matrix of inner products &lt;math&gt;\langle a'_i,b'_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal matrix elements &lt;math&gt;\langle a_i,b_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the singular values of the latter matrix. By the uniqueness of the singular value decomposition, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat y_i&lt;/math&gt; are then unique up to a real, orthogonal or unitary transformation among them, and the vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat w'_i&lt;/math&gt; (and hence &lt;math&gt;\hat v_i&lt;/math&gt;) are unique up to equal real, orthogonal or unitary transformations applied simultaneously to the sets of the vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat w_i&lt;/math&gt; associated with a common value of &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; and to the corresponding sets of vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat w'_i&lt;/math&gt; (and hence to the corresponding sets of &lt;math&gt;\hat v_i&lt;/math&gt;).

A singular value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\cos\,0&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the angles &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; introduced above and associated with &lt;math&gt;F\cap G&lt;/math&gt; and a singular value &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\cos \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to right angles between the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] spaces &lt;math&gt;F\cap G^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F^\bot\cap G&lt;/math&gt;, where superscript &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[orthogonal complement]].

=={{anchor|vch}}Variational characterization&lt;ref name="bjoerck"/&gt;==

The [[singular value decomposition#vch|variational characterization]] of singular values and vectors implies as a special case a variational characterization of the angles between subspaces and their associated canonical vectors. This characterization includes the angles &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; introduced above and orders the angles by increasing value. It can be given the form of the below alternative definition. In this context, it is customary to talk of '''principal''' angles and vectors.

===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be an inner product space. Given two subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\dim(\mathcal{U})=k\leq \dim(\mathcal{W}):=\ell&lt;/math&gt;, there exists then a sequence of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; angles &lt;math&gt; 0 \le \theta_1 \le \theta_2 \le \cdots \le \theta_k \le \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; called the principal angles, the first one defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_1:=\min \left\{ \arccos \left( \left. \frac{ |\langle u,w\rangle| }{\|u\| \|w\|}\right) \right| u\in \mathcal{U}, w\in \mathcal{W}\right\}=\angle(u_1,w_1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the [[inner product]] and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; the induced [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]. The vectors &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding ''principal vectors.''

The other principal angles and vectors are then defined recursively via

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i:=\min \left\{ \left. \arccos \left( \frac{ |\langle u,w\rangle| }{\|u\| \|w\|}\right) \right| u\in \mathcal{U},~w\in \mathcal{W},~u\perp u_j,~w \perp w_j \quad \forall j\in \{1,\ldots,i-1\} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the principal angles &lt;math&gt;(\theta_1,\ldots, \theta_k)&lt;/math&gt; form a set of minimized angles between the two subspaces, and the principal vectors in each subspace are orthogonal to each other.

===Examples===

====Geometric example====
Geometrically, subspaces are [[Flat (geometry)|flats]] (points, lines, planes etc.) that include the origin, thus any two subspaces intersect at least in the origin. Two two-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; generate a set of two angles. In a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; are either identical, or their intersection forms a line. In the former case, both &lt;math&gt;\theta_1=\theta_2=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the latter case, only &lt;math&gt;\theta_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, where vectors &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; are on the line of the intersection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; and have the same direction. The angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; will be the angle between the subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[orthogonal complement]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;. Imagining the angle between two planes in 3D, one  intuitively thinks of the largest angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Algebraic example====
In 4-dimensional real coordinate space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, let the two-dimensional subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; be 
spanned by &lt;math&gt;u_1=(1,0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_2=(0,1,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, and let the two-dimensional subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; be 
spanned by &lt;math&gt;w_1=(1,0,0,a)/\sqrt{1+a^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2=(0,1,b,0)/\sqrt{1+b^2}&lt;/math&gt; with some real &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;|b|&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; are, in fact, the pair of principal vectors corresponding to the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta_1)=1/\sqrt{1+a^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; are the principal vectors corresponding to the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta_2)=1/\sqrt{1+b^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

To construct a pair of subspaces with any given set of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_k&lt;/math&gt; in a &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; (or larger) dimensional [[Euclidean space]], take a subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; with an orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt;(e_1,\ldots,e_k)&lt;/math&gt;  and complete it to an orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt;(e_1,\ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; of the Euclidean space, where &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2k&lt;/math&gt;. Then, an orthonormal basis of the other subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; is, e.g.,

: &lt;math&gt;(\cos(\theta_1)e_1+\sin(\theta_1)e_{k+1},\ldots,\cos(\theta_k)e_k+\sin(\theta_k)e_{2k}).&lt;/math&gt;

==Basic properties==
* If the largest angle is zero, one subspace is a subset of the other.
* If the largest angle is &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, there is at least one vector in one subspace perpendicular to the other subspace.
* If the smallest angle is zero, the subspaces intersect at least in a line.
* If the smallest angle is is &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, the subspaces are orthogonal. 
* The number of angles equal to zero is the dimension of the space where the two subspaces intersect.

==Advanced properties==
* Non-trivial (different from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt;) angles between two subspaces are the same as the non-trivial angles between their orthogonal complements.&lt;ref name="KA06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KJA"/&gt;
* Non-trivial angles between the subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding non-trivial angles between the subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}^\perp&lt;/math&gt; sum up to &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="KA06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KJA"/&gt;
* The angles between subspaces satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] in terms of [[majorization]] and thus can be used to define a [[distance]] on the set of all subspaces turning the set into a [[metric space]].&lt;ref name="QZL"/&gt;
* The [[sine]] of the angles between subspaces satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] in terms of [[majorization]] and thus can be used to define a [[distance]] on the set of all subspaces turning the set into a [[metric space]].&lt;ref name="KA06"/&gt; For example, the [[sine]] of the largest angle is known as a [[gap between subspaces]].&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt;

==Extensions==
The notion of the angles and some of the variational properties can be naturally extended to arbitrary [[inner products]]&lt;ref name="KA02"/&gt; and subspaces with infinite [[dimensions]].&lt;ref name="KJA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">In mathematics, '''Auerbach's lemma''', named after [[Herman Auerbach]], is a theorem in [[functional analysis]] which asserts that a certain property of [[Euclidean space]]s holds for general [[finite-dimensional]] [[normed vector space]]s.

== Statement ==
Let (''V'', ||·||) be an ''n''-dimensional normed vector space. Then there exists a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} of V such that
: ||''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|| = 1 and ||''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;|| = 1 for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'',
where {''e''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} is a basis of ''V''* [[dual basis|dual]] to {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, i. e. ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) = δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;. 

A basis with this property is called an ''Auerbach basis''.

If ''V'' is an [[inner product space]] (or even infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]) then this result is obvious as one may take for {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} any [[orthonormal basis]] of ''V'' (the dual basis is then {(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|·)}).

== Geometric formulation ==

An equivalent statement is the following: any centrally symmetric convex body in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; has a linear image which contains the unit cross-polytope (the unit ball for the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1^n&lt;/math&gt; norm) and is contained in the unit cube (the unit ball for the &lt;math&gt;\ell_{\infty}^n &lt;/math&gt; norm).

== Corollary ==
The lemma has a corollary with implications to [[approximation theory]]. 

Let ''V'' be an ''n''-dimensional [[linear subspace|subspace]] of a normed vector space (''X'', ||·||). Then there exists a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] ''P'' of ''X'' onto ''V'' such that ||''P''|| ≤ ''n''.

=== Proof ===
Let {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be an Auerbach basis of ''V'' and {''e''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} corresponding dual basis. By [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] each ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; extends to ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''X''* such that 
: ||''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;|| = 1.
Now set 
: ''P''(''x'') = ∑ ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
It's easy to check that ''P'' is indeed a projection onto ''V'' and that ||''P''|| ≤ ''n'' (this follows from [[triangle inequality]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">In [[mathematics]], a '''bitopological space''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] endowed with ''two'' [[Topological space|topologies]]. Typically, if the set is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the topologies are &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; then the bitopological space is referred to as &lt;math&gt;(X,\sigma,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Continuity==

A [[map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; from a bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to another bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt; is called '''continuous''' or sometimes '''pairwise continuous''' if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] both as a map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1')&lt;/math&gt; and as map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bitopological variants of topological properties==
Corresponding to well-known properties of topological spaces, there are versions for bitopological spaces.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise compact''' if each cover &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_i\in \tau_1\cup\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, contains a finite subcover. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; must contain at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise Hausdorff''' if for any two distinct points &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; there exist disjoint &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_1\in \tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_2\in\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x\in U_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y\in U_2&lt;/math&gt;.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise zero-dimensional''' if opens in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; which are closed in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and opens in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; which are closed in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\sigma,\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''binormal''' if for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-closed and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tau&lt;/math&gt;-closed sets there are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-open and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tau&lt;/math&gt;-open sets such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\sigma\subseteq G_\tau&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  F_\tau\subseteq G_\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle  G_\sigma\cap G_\tau= \empty.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Boris Levitan''' (7 June 1914 &amp;ndash; 4 April 2004) was a [[mathematician]] known in particular for his work on [[almost periodic functions]], and [[Sturm&amp;ndash;Liouville operator]]s, especially, on [[inverse scattering transform|inverse scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/stories/466/4716721.html Obituary in the [[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040428225642/http://www.startribune.com/stories/466/4716721.html |date=April 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Boris Levitan was born in [[Berdyansk]] (now south-eastern [[Ukraine]]), and grew up in [[Kharkov]]. He graduated from [[Kharkov University]] in 1936; in 1938, he submitted his PhD thesis "''Some Generalization of Almost Periodic Function''" under the supervision of [[Naum Akhiezer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=99630 Math Genealogy page]&lt;/ref&gt; Then he defended the habilitation thesis "''Theory of Generalized Translation Operators''".

He was drafted into the army at the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1941, and served until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kostyuchenko|first=A.G.|last2=Maslov|first2=V.P.|last3=Sadovnichii|first3=V.A.|last4=Sargsyan|first4=I.S.|last5=Shkalikov|first5=A.A.|last6=Zhikov|first6=V.V.|title=In memory of Boris Levitan.|journal=Russ.

During the last years of his life, he worked in the [[University of Minnesota]].

In [[graph theory]], a '''bridge''', '''isthmus''', '''cut-edge''', or '''cut arc''' is an [[Glossary_of_graph_theory#Basics|edge]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose deletion increases its number of [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another meaning of "bridge" appears in the term '''bridge of a subgraph'''.  If ''H'' is a subgraph of ''G'', a '''bridge of''' ''H'' '''in''' ''G'' is a maximal subgraph of ''G'' that is not contained in ''H'' and is not separated by ''H''.

==Trees and forests==
A graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes can contain at most &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; bridges, since adding additional edges must create a cycle. The graphs with exactly &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; bridges are exactly the [[tree (graph theory)|trees]], and the graphs in which every edge is a bridge are exactly the [[forest (graph theory)|forests]].

In every undirected graph, there is an [[equivalence relation]] on the vertices according to which two vertices are related to each other whenever there are two edge-disjoint paths connecting them. (Every vertex is related to itself via two length-zero paths, which are identical but nevertheless edge-disjoint.) The equivalence classes of this relation are called '''2-edge-connected components''', and the bridges of the graph are exactly the edges whose endpoints belong to different components. The '''bridge-block tree''' of the graph has a vertex for every nontrivial component and an edge for every bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Relation to vertex connectivity==
Bridges are closely related to the concept of [[Articulation vertex|articulation vertices]], vertices that belong to every path between some pair of other vertices. The two endpoints of a bridge are articulation vertices unless they have a degree of 1, although it may also be possible for a non-bridge edge to have two articulation vertices as endpoints.  Analogously to bridgeless graphs being 2-edge-connected, graphs without articulation vertices are [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-vertex-connected]].

In a [[cubic graph]], every cut vertex is an endpoint of at least one bridge.

==Bridgeless graphs==
A '''bridgeless graph''' is a graph that does not have any bridges. Equivalent conditions are that each [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of the graph has an [[ear decomposition|open ear decomposition]],&lt;ref name="robbins39"&gt;{{citation

An important open problem involving bridges is the [[cycle double cover conjecture]], due to [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]] and [[George Szekeres|Szekeres]] (1978 and 1979, independently), which states that every bridgeless graph admits a set of simple cycles which contains each edge exactly twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm==
The first [[linear time]] algorithm for finding the bridges in a graph was described by [[Robert Tarjan]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* Find a [[spanning forest]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
* Create a rooted forest &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from the spanning tree
* Traverse the forest &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in [[Tree traversal|preorder]] and number the nodes. Parent nodes in the forest now have lower numbers than child nodes.
* For each node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in preorder (denoting each node using its preorder number), do:
** Compute the number of forest descendants &lt;math&gt;ND(v)&lt;/math&gt; for this node, by adding one to the sum of its children's descendants.
** Compute &lt;math&gt;L(v)&lt;/math&gt;, the lowest preorder label reachable from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by a path for which all but the last edge stays within the subtree rooted at &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This is the minimum of the set consisting of the preorder label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, of the values of &lt;math&gt;L(w)&lt;/math&gt; at child nodes of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by edges that do not belong to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
** Similarly, compute &lt;math&gt;H(v)&lt;/math&gt;, the highest preorder label reachable by a path for which all but the last edge stays within the subtree rooted at &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This is the maximum of the set consisting of the preorder label of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, of the values of &lt;math&gt;H(w)&lt;/math&gt; at child nodes of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by edges that do not belong to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
** For each node &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; with parent node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;L(w) = w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(w) &lt;  w + ND(w)&lt;/math&gt; then the edge from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a bridge.

==Bridge-finding with chain decompositions==
A very simple bridge-finding algorithm&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{citation

 | title = A Simple Test on 2-Vertex- and 2-Edge-Connectivity
 | volume = 113| arxiv = 1209.0700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[chain decomposition|chain decompositions]].
Chain decompositions do not only allow to compute all bridges of a graph, they also allow to ''read off'' every [[cut vertex]] of ''G'' (and the [[Biconnected component|block-cut tree]] of ''G''), giving a general framework for testing 2-edge- and 2-vertex-connectivity (which extends to linear-time 3-edge- and 3-vertex-connectivity tests).

Chain decompositions are special ear decompositions depending on a DFS-tree ''T'' of ''G'' and can be computed very simply: Let every vertex be marked as unvisited. For each vertex ''v'' in ascending [[Depth-first search|DFS]]-numbers 1...''n'', traverse every backedge (i.e. every edge not in the DFS tree) that is incident to ''v'' and follow the path of tree-edges back to the root of ''T'', stopping at the first vertex that is marked as visited. During such a traversal, every traversed vertex is marked as visited. Thus, a traversal stops at the latest at ''v'' and forms either a directed path or cycle, beginning with v; we call this path
or cycle a ''chain''. The ''i''th chain found by this procedure is referred to as ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. ''C=C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...'' is then a ''[[chain decomposition]]'' of ''G''.

The following characterizations then allow to ''read off'' several properties of ''G'' from ''C'' efficiently, including all bridges of ''G''.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; Let ''C'' be a chain decomposition of a simple connected graph ''G=(V,E)''.
# ''G'' is 2-edge-connected if and only if the chains in ''C'' partition ''E''.
# An edge ''e'' in ''G'' is a bridge if and only if ''e'' is not contained in any chain in ''C''.
# If ''G'' is 2-edge-connected, ''C'' is an [[ear decomposition]].
# ''G'' is 2-vertex-connected if and only if ''G'' has minimum degree 2 and ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the only cycle in ''C''.
# A vertex ''v'' in a 2-edge-connected graph ''G'' is a cut vertex if and only if ''v'' is the first vertex of a cycle in ''C - C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.
# If ''G'' is 2-vertex-connected, ''C'' is an [[Ear decomposition|open ear decomposition]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''[[Busemann G-space|Busemann ''G''-space]]''' is a type of [[metric space]] first described by [[Herbert Busemann]] in 1942.

If &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space such that

#  for every two distinct &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in X-\{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Menger convexity]])
# every &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-bounded set of infinite cardinality possesses [[accumulation point]]s
# for every &lt;math&gt;w \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; such that for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in B(w,\rho_w)&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;z \in  ( b(w,\rho_w)-\{ x,y \} )^\circ&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)+d(y,z)=d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; ([[geodesic]]s are locally extendable)
# for any distinct points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;u,v \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,u)+d(y,u)=d(x,u)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x,v)+d(y,v)=d(x,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y,u)=d(y,v)&lt;/math&gt; (geodesic extensions are unique).

then ''X'' is said to be a ''Busemann'' ''G''-''space''.  Every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[homogenous space]].

The [[Busemann conjecture]] states that every Busemann ''G''-space is a [[topological manifold]]. It is a special case of the [[Bing–Borsuk conjecture]]. The Busemann conjecture is known to be true for dimensions 1 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Halverson, Denise|last2=Dušan|first2=Repovš,|title=The Bing–Borsuk and the Busemann conjectures|journal=Mathematical Communications|date=23 December 2008|volume=13|issue=2|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/30884|language=en|issn=1331-0623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Athanase|title=Metric Spaces, Convexity and Nonpositive Curvature|date=2005|publisher=European Mathematical Society|isbn=9783037190104|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrwzXZB0YrIC&amp;pg=PA77|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Combinatory categorial grammar''' ('''CCG''') is an efficiently [[parsable]], yet linguistically expressive grammar formalism. It has a transparent interface between surface syntax and underlying semantic representation, including predicate-argument structure, quantification and information structure. The formalism generates constituency-based structures (as opposed to dependency-based ones) and is therefore a type of [[phrase structure grammar]] (as opposed to a [[dependency grammar]]).

CCG relies on [[combinatory logic]], which has the same expressive power as the [[lambda calculus]], but builds its expressions differently. The first linguistic and psycholinguistic arguments for basing the grammar on combinators were put forth by [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]. More recent prominent proponents of the approach are [http://cog.brown.edu/People/jacobson/ Jacobson] and [http://www.jasonbaldridge.com/ Baldridge].

For example, the [[combinator]] B (the compositor) is useful in creating long-distance dependencies, as in "Who do you think Mary is talking about?" and the combinator W (the duplicator) is useful as the lexical interpretation of reflexive pronouns, as in "Mary talks about herself". Together with I (the identity mapping) and C (the permutator) these form a set of primitive, non-interdefinable combinators. Jacobson interprets personal pronouns as the combinator I, and their binding is aided by a complex combinator Z, as in "Mary lost her way". Z is definable using W and B.

==Parts of the formalism==

The CCG formalism defines a number of combinators (application, composition, and type-raising being the most common). These operate on syntactically-typed lexical items, by means of [[Natural deduction]] style proofs. The goal of the proof is to find some way of applying the combinators to a sequence of lexical items until no lexical item is unused in the proof. The resulting type after the proof is complete is the type of the whole expression. Thus, proving that some sequence of words is a sentence of some language amounts to proving that the words reduce to the type ''S''.

===Syntactic types===

The syntactic type of a lexical item can be either a primitive type, such as ''S'', ''N'', or ''NP'', or complex, such as ''S\NP'', or ''NP/N''.

The complex types, schematizable as ''X/Y'' and ''X\Y'', denote functor types that take an argument of type ''Y'' and return an object of type ''X''. A forward slash denotes that the argument should appear to the right, while a backslash denotes that the argument should appear on the left. Any type can stand in for the ''X'' and ''Y'' here, making syntactic types in CCG a recursive type system.

===Application combinators===

The application combinators, often denoted by ''&gt;'' for forward application and ''&lt;'' for backward application, apply a lexical item with a functor type to an argument with an appropriate type. The definition of application is given as:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y}{\alpha \beta : X}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X}&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Composition combinators===

The composition combinators, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward composition and &lt;math&gt;B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward composition, are similar to function composition from mathematics, and can be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X/Y \qquad \beta : Y/Z}{\alpha \beta : X/Z}B_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\beta : Y\backslash Z \qquad \alpha : X\backslash Y}{\beta \alpha : X\backslash Z}B_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

===Type-raising combinators===

The type-raising combinators, often denoted as &lt;math&gt;T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt; for forward type-raising and &lt;math&gt;T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt; for backward type-raising, take argument types (usually primitive types) to functor types, which take as their argument the functors that, before type-raising, would have taken them as arguments.

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T/(T\backslash X)}T_&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\alpha : X}{\alpha : T\backslash (T/X)}T_&lt;&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

The sentence "the dog bit John" has a number of different possible proofs. Below are a few of them. The variety of proofs demonstrates the fact that in CCG, sentences don't have a single structure, as in other models of grammar.

Let the types of these lexical items be

&lt;math&gt;the : NP/N \qquad dog : N \qquad John : NP \qquad bit : (S\backslash NP)/NP&lt;/math&gt;

We can perform the simplest proof (changing notation slightly for brevity) as:

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
       \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
       \qquad
       \dfrac{dog}{N}
    }{NP}&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
        \qquad
        \dfrac{John}{NP}
    }{S\backslash NP}&gt;
}{S}&lt;
&lt;/math&gt;

Opting to type-raise and compose some, we could get a fully incremental, left-to-right proof.  The ability to construct such a proof is an argument for the psycholinguistic plausibility of CCG, because listeners do in fact construct partial interpretations (syntactic and semantic) of utterances before they have been completed.

&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{
            \dfrac{
                \dfrac{the}{NP/N}
                \dfrac{dog}{N}
                \qquad
            }{NP}&gt;
        }{S/(S\backslash NP)}T_&gt;
        \qquad
        \dfrac{bit}{(S\backslash NP)/NP}
    }{S/NP}B_&gt;
    \qquad
    \dfrac{John}{NP}
}{S}&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal properties ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

CCGs are known to be able to generate the language &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n : n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; (which is a non-context-free [[indexed language]]). A grammar for this language  can be found in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994).&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995" /&gt;

Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994)&lt;ref name="vijayshankarAndWeir1995"&gt;Vijay-Shanker, K. and Weir, David J. 1994. ''The Equivalence of Four Extensions of Context-Free Grammars''. Mathematical Systems Theory 27(6): 511–546.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates that [[Indexed grammar#Linear indexed grammars|Linear Indexed Grammars]], Combinatory Categorial Grammars, [[Tree-adjoining grammar|Tree-adjoining Grammars]], and [[Head grammar|Head Grammars]] are [[Weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] formalisms, in that they all define the same string languages. Kuhlmann et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="KuhlmannKollerSatta2015"&gt;Kuhlmann, M., Koller, A., and Satta, G. 2015. ''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/COLI_a_00219 Lexicalization and Generative Power in CCG]''. Computational Linguistics 41(2): 215-247.&lt;/ref&gt; show that this equivalence, and the ability of CCG to describe &lt;math&gt;{a^n b^n c^n d^n}&lt;/math&gt;, rely crucially on the ability to restrict the use of the combinatory rules to certain categories, in ways not explained above.

The light source is usually an [[Actinic light|actínic]] bulb internal or external to the device&lt;ref name = "Magazines1948"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cryder |first=George R. |title=Contact |magazine=Popular Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA216 |date=November 1948 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |pages=216– |issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial contact printers or [[process camera]]s usually use a pump-operated [[vacuum frame]] where the original and the photosensitive surface are pressed together against a flat glass by a grooved rubber mat connected to the vacuum source.  A timer-controlled [[mercury vapor]] ([[Electric arc|arc]] or [[fluorescent]]) light source is on the other side of the glass.&lt;ref name = "Magazines1948" /&gt;

== Uses ==
The contact copying process was used in the early days of [[photography]] and sunlight-exposed [[blueprint]]s; it is still used in amateur photography, silkscreen printing, offset printing, and [[photochemical machining]], such as the manufacture of [[Printed circuit board]]s.  By the early 20th century, blueprinting (producing white lines) or [[diazo]] [[whiteprint|blue line printing]] used contact-rollers rather than flat-glass exposure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Silkscreen printing  and photochemical machining originally were based on [[gum bichromate]] photosensitive materials, where exposure to intense [[ultraviolet]] light made previously-soluble gum or gelatin [[colloids]] insoluble; after exposure, the exposed surface was washed in water and the unexposed coating dissolved, leaving the hardened gum or gelatin to [[resist]] the passage of the silk-screen ink or the metal-etching solution.  Offset printing can use either a negative plate, where the hardened, exposed photosensitive coating attracts ink and repels water, or a positive plate, where the exposed photosensitive coating decomposes or exposes the metal, water-attracting surface.

=== Photography===

The contact copier is used for duplication of'' negative or positive prints'' obtaining what are called ''contact prints'', that is, to reproduce on paper or film, a photographic negative ''or positive '' of exactly the same size of the original. (With normal photographic non inverting processes, ''black'' generates ''white'' on the target while ''white'' generates black). It was the common mode to make prints until it began the use of the alternative [[photographic enlarger]]. There are some models with internal light source constructed as a closed box, in which one or more lamps illuminate the negative through an opal or frosted [[glass]].

The reproduction is done by placing the negative on top of the glass and then the photo paper with the [[emulsion]] in contact with the negative. The negative role fits the body, the lid is closed applying some pressure against the glass to prevent blur; then proceed to impress photographic paper by turning on the interior light (contact copier) or an external focus, in the last case, usually from a [[photographic enlarger]]. Exposure time can be controlled "manually" or using a timer that controls the light source for a preset time and with greater precision.

===Whiteprint===
In the process of [[diazo copier|''whiteprint copying '']],&lt;ref name="BlueprinReplaced2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eva Zeisel|author2=Robert Sabella|title=Blueprints replaced by whiteprints|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Myz4kBTPTyQC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=Blueprints+replaced+by+whiteprints#v=onepage&amp;q=Blueprints%20replaced%20by%20whiteprints&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Que Certification|isbn=978-0-7897-3504-1|pages=244–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (essentially a [[diazotype]] process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful [[black light]] lamp . The original plan (on a transparent support) and the diazo paper are introduced, in perfect contact, within the pinch rollers of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]] coating -an impregnation of [[diazo]] - covering the surface of the paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).

=== Silkscreen ===

In [[screenprinting]] it is normally use a contact copier box with several [[fluorescent tube]]s close to the silk frame. The emulsion reacts depending on the amount of light received, for that reason it is important to make some tests for determining the exposure time. Usually for a "box type" contact copier, exposure is usually not more than one minute. In the industrial type contact copiers with actinic lamp placed at a distance, exposure time can be about 20 minutes.

The [[photolith]] (also called "Art") is placed under the frame against the emulsion. The black portions of photolith film does not let light into the relevant parts of the coated silk, therefore, in these parts [[Emulsion]] will not heal and may be subsequently washed, keep in mind that there must be no gap between the photolith and the silk, to achieve that purpose any element with enough weight may be used to press the silk against the photolith (or a vacuum pump in professional machines).

=== Offset ===
 
In [[Computer to film|CTF]] offset technology, a [[photolith]] is placed in direct contact with the printing plate and pressed with an opaque lid that sometimes has a vacuum pump that helps making a good contact. The plate comes coated with a layer of [[photoresist]] in which a (negative) inverted image is formed with respect to the original [[photolith]] and after the transfer of information (burning) it's accomplished,  then, after undergoing a developing process, the plate will be ready to be used in an offset printer.&lt;ref name = "Board2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=NIIR board |title=Hand Book on Printing Technology (offset, Gravure, Flexo, Screen) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMvZQJwVfk0C&amp;pg=PA222 |date=1 October 2002 |publisher=National Institute Of Industrial Research |isbn=978-81-7833-087-7 |pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process shares some fundamental principles with the photographic processes, since the pattern engraved on the plate is generated by exposure to light with an image created in a contact copier using an optical mask. This procedure is comparable to the high-precision method of the version used to make printed circuit boards.

===Printed circuits ===
The contact copier is used today, particularly in the areas hobbyist, for the photoengraving of prototype [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) before being sent to production (artisanal creation ). Substantially similar to the contact printer used in photography, this variant usually uses ultraviolet lamps to impress a copper base specifically pre-sensitized.

Burned by exposure to light parts reproduce patterns drawn on a transparent photolith film on a pre-sensitized plate ([[epoxy]] or [[Bakelite]]). This pre-sensitized plate comprises an insulating plate (epoxy resin or bakelite), adhered with a layer of copper, and coated with a varnish layer sensitized. The varnish is sensitive to UV rays, which weaken or strengthen its structure depending on whether a "positive" or "negative" process. Photolith film printed parts (usually black), inserted between the light source and the pre-sensitized plate, protect the varnish from the UV. The base copper impressed must then be engraved in a specific bath (usually iron chloride -FeCl3-), that  removes the excess copper.&lt;!--

A pre-sensitized plate comprises an insulating plate  with a copper layer adhered, and covered with a layer of pre-sensitized lacquer. . &lt;Ref name = "Eric2014" /&gt;

In the case of a plate of "positive" only "irradiated" unprotected areas. In the exposed areas the coating is weakened, and then can be removed with a developer. Which are no longer protected by varnish areas are exposed to iron perchloride during etching, and the copper layer unprotected be "eaten" by the latter, being completely dissolved (ie, become [[chloride]] of [[copper]]). &lt;ref name = "Eric2014" /&gt;

In the remaining areas of the plate are printed tracks on the original drawings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3127">In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is called '''countably generated''' if the topology of ''X'' is determined by the [[countable]] sets in a similar way as the topology of a [[sequential space]] (or a [[Fréchet space]]) by the convergent sequences.

The countable generated spaces are precisely the spaces having countable [[tightness (topology)|tightness]] - therefore the name ''countably tight'' is used as well.

==Definition==

A topological space ''X'' is called '''countably generated''' if ''V'' is closed in ''X'' whenever for each countable [[Subspace (topology)|subspace]] ''U'' of ''X'' the set &lt;math&gt;V \cap U&lt;/math&gt; is closed in ''U''. Equivalently, ''X'' is countably generated if and only if the closure of any subset ''A'' of ''X'' equals the union of closures of all countable subsets of ''A''.

==Countable fan tightness==

A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has '''countable fan tightness''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and every sequence &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in\bigcap_n\overline{A_n}&lt;/math&gt; , there are finite set &lt;math&gt;B_1\subset A_1, B_2\subset A_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in \overline{\bigcup_nB_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has '''countable strong fan tightness''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and every sequence &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in\bigcap_n\overline{A_n}&lt;/math&gt; , there are points &lt;math&gt;x_1\subset A_1, x_2\subset A_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in \overline{\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}}&lt;/math&gt;. Every [[strong Fréchet–Urysohn space]] has strong countable fan tightness.

==Properties==

A [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of countably generated space is again countably generated. Similarly, a [[topological sum]] of countably generated spaces is countably generated. Therefore the countably generated spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. They are the coreflective hull of all countable spaces.

Any subspace of a countably generated space is again countably generated.

==Examples==

Every sequential space (in particular, every metrizable space) is countably generated.

An example of a space which is countably generated but not sequential can be obtained, for instance, as a subspace of [[Arens–Fort space]].

==See also==

* The concept of [[finitely generated space]] is related to this notion.
* [[Tightness_(topology)|Tightness]] is a cardinal function related to countably generated spaces and their generalizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">In mathematics, '''Darboux's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[real analysis]], named after [[Jean Gaston Darboux]]. It states that every function that results from the [[derivative|differentiation]] of other functions has the '''intermediate value property''': the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is also an interval.

When ''&amp;fnof;'' is [[continuous function|continuously]] differentiable (''ƒ'' in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;([''a'',''b''])), this is a consequence of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. But even when ''ƒ&amp;prime;'' is ''not'' continuous, Darboux's theorem places a severe restriction on what it can be.

==Darboux's theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a [[closed interval]], &lt;math&gt;f\colon I\to \R&lt;/math&gt; a real-valued differentiable function. Then &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; has the '''intermediate value property''': If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are points in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then for every &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(b)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Apostol1974"&gt;Apostol, Tom M.: Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus, 2nd edition, Addison-Wesley Longman, Inc. (1974), page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen2004"&gt;Olsen, Lars: ''A New Proof of Darboux's Theorem'', Vol. 111, No. 8 (Oct., 2004) (pp. 713–715), The American Mathematical Monthly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudin1976"&gt;Rudin, Walter: Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition, MacGraw-Hill, Inc. (1976), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs==
'''Proof 1.''' The first proof is based on the [[extreme value theorem]].

If &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f'(b)&lt;/math&gt;, then setting &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, gives the desired result. Now assume that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is strictly between &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'(b)&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular that &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&gt;y&gt;f'(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Let  &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon I\to \R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t)=f(t)-yt&lt;/math&gt;. If it is the case that &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;y&lt;f'(b)&lt;/math&gt; we adjust our below proof, instead asserting that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has its minimum on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is attained at some point in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, according to the [[extreme value theorem]]. 

Because &lt;math&gt;\varphi'(a)=f'(a)-y&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; cannot attain its maximum value at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. (If it did, then &lt;math&gt; (\varphi(t)-\varphi(a))/(t-a) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; t \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt; \varphi'(a) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.)
 
Likewise, because &lt;math&gt;\varphi'(b)=f'(b)-y&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; cannot attain its maximum value at &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. 

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must attain its maximum value at some point &lt;math&gt;x\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], &lt;math&gt;\varphi'(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. 



'''Proof 2.''' The second proof is based on combining the [[mean value theorem]] and the [[intermediate value theorem]].&lt;ref name="Apostol1974"&gt;Apostol, Tom M.: Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus, 2nd edition, Addison-Wesley Longman, Inc. (1974), page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen2004"&gt;Olsen, Lars: ''A New Proof of Darboux's Theorem'', Vol. 111, No. 8 (Oct., 2004) (pp. 713–715), The American Mathematical Monthly&lt;/ref&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{2} (a + b)&lt;/math&gt;.
For &lt;math&gt;a \leq t \leq c,&lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt;\alpha (t)  = a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta (t) = 2t - a&lt;/math&gt;.
And for &lt;math&gt;c \leq t \leq b,&lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt;\alpha (t) = 2t - b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta(t) = b&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, for &lt;math&gt;t \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;a \leq \alpha (t) &lt; \beta (t) \leq b&lt;/math&gt;.
Now, define  &lt;math&gt;g(t) = \frac{(f \circ \beta)(t) - (f \circ \alpha)(t)}{\beta(t) - \alpha(t)}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a &lt; t &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\, g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;g(t) \rightarrow {f}' (a)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(t) \rightarrow {f}' (b)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt;; therefore, from the Intermediate Value Theorem, if &lt;math&gt;y \in ({f}' (a), {f}' (b))&lt;/math&gt; then, there exists &lt;math&gt;t_0 \in (a, b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g(t_0) = y&lt;/math&gt;.
Let's fix &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;.

From the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point &lt;math&gt;x \in (\alpha (t_0), \beta (t_0))&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;{f}'(x) = g(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;{f}' (x) = y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Darboux function==
A '''Darboux function''' is a [[real-valued function]] ''ƒ'' which has the "intermediate value property": for any two values ''a'' and ''b'' in the domain of ''ƒ'', and any ''y'' between ''ƒ''(''a'') and ''ƒ''(''b''), there is some ''c'' between ''a'' and ''b'' with ''ƒ''(''c'') = ''y''.&lt;ref name=Cie&gt;{{cite book | last=Ciesielski | first=Krzysztof | title=Set theory for the working mathematician | zbl=0938.03067 | series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts | volume=39 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1997 | isbn=0-521-59441-3 | pages=106–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the [[intermediate value theorem]], every [[continuous function]] on a [[real numbers|real]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is a Darboux function. Darboux's contribution was to show that there are discontinuous Darboux functions.

Every [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] of a Darboux function is [[essential discontinuity|essential]], that is, at any point of discontinuity, at least one of the left hand and right hand limits does not exist.

An example of a Darboux function that is discontinuous at one point is the function
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \begin{cases}\sin(1/x) &amp; \text{for } x\ne 0, \\ 0 &amp;\text{for } x=0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

By Darboux's theorem, the derivative of any differentiable function is a Darboux function. In particular, the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^2\sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; is a Darboux function even though it is not continuous at one point.

An example of a Darboux function that is [[Nowhere continuous function|nowhere continuous]] is the [[Conway base 13 function]]. 

Darboux functions are a quite general class of functions. It turns out that any real-valued function ''ƒ'' on the real line can be written as the sum of two Darboux functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bruckner, Andrew M: ''Differentiation of real functions'', 2 ed, page 6, American Mathematical Society, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This implies in particular that the class of Darboux functions is not closed under addition.

A '''strongly Darboux function''' is one for which the image of every (non-empty) open interval is the whole real line.  Such functions exist and are Darboux but nowhere continuous.&lt;ref name=Cie/&gt;

'''Doubling the cube''', also known as the '''Delian problem''', is an ancient&lt;ref&gt;It shows up in Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' ({{circa|380 BC}}) VII.530&lt;/ref&gt; [[geometry|geometric]] problem. Given the [[Edge (geometry)|edge]] of a [[cube]], the problem requires the construction of the edge of a second cube whose [[volume]] is double that of the first.

The [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]], [[Indian mathematics|Indians]], and particularly the [[Greek mathematics|Greeks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guilbeau | first1 = Lucye | year = 1930 | title = The History of the Solution of the Cubic Equation | url = | journal = Mathematics News Letter | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 8–12 | doi=10.2307/3027812}}&lt;/ref&gt; were aware of the problem and made many futile attempts at solving what they saw as an obstinate but soluble problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Ian|title=Galois Theory|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato's ''[[Republic]]'' Book VII "if any whole city should hold these things honourable and take a united lead and supervise, they would obey, and solution sought constantly and earnestly would become clear."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nonexistence of a solution was finally proven by [[Pierre Wantzel]] in 1837.

In algebraic terms, doubling a [[unit cube]] requires the construction of a [[line segment]] of length {{math|''x''}}, where {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2}}; in other words, {{math|''x'' {{=}} {{radic|2|3}}}}. This is because a cube of side length 1 has a volume of {{nowrap|1=1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, and a cube of twice that volume (a volume of 2) has a side length of the [[cube root]] of 2. The impossibility of doubling the cube is therefore [[logical equivalence|equivalent]] to the statement that {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}} is not a [[constructible number]]. This is a consequence of the fact that the coordinates of a new point constructed by a compass and straightedge are roots of [[polynomial]]s over the field generated by the coordinates of previous points, of no greater [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] than a [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]]. This implies that the degree of the [[field extension]] generated by a constructible point must be a power of 2. The field extension generated by {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}}, however, is of degree 3.

==Proof of impossibility==

We begin with the unit line segment defined by [[coordinate|points]] (0,0) and (1,0) in the [[cartesian plane|plane]]. We are required to construct a line segment defined by two points separated by a distance of {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}}. It is easily shown that compass and straightedge constructions would allow such a line segment to be freely moved to touch the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] with the unit line segment - so equivalently we may consider the task of constructing a line segment from (0,0) to ({{math|{{radic|2|3}}}}, 0), which entails constructing the point ({{math|{{radic|2|3}}}}, 0).

Respectively, the tools of a compass and straightedge allow us to create [[circles]] [[centre (geometry)|centred]] on one previously defined point and passing through another, and to create lines passing through two previously defined points. Any newly defined point either arises as the result of the [[intersection]] of two such circles, as the intersection of a circle and a line, or as the intersection of two lines. An exercise of elementary [[analytic geometry]] shows that in all three cases, both the {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-coordinates of the newly defined point satisfy a polynomial of degree no higher than a quadratic, with [[coefficients]] that are additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions involving the coordinates of the previously defined points (and rational numbers). Restated in more abstract terminology, the new {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-coordinates have [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]s of degree at most 2 over the [[Field (mathematics)|subfield]] of {{math|[[real numbers|ℝ]]}} generated by the previous coordinates. Therefore, the [[degree of a field extension|degree]] of the [[field extension]] corresponding to each new coordinate is 2 or 1.

So, given a coordinate of any constructed point, we may proceed [[mathematical induction|inductively]] backwards through the {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-coordinates of the points in the order that they were defined until we reach the original pair of points (0,0) and (1,0). As every field extension has degree 2 or 1, and as the field extension over {{math|[[rational numbers|ℚ]]}} of the coordinates of the original pair of points is clearly of degree 1, it follows from the [[Degree of a field extension#The multiplicitivity formula for degrees|tower rule]] that the degree of the field extension over {{math|ℚ}} of any coordinate of a constructed point is a [[power of 2]].

Now, {{math|1=''p''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 2 = 0}} is easily seen to be [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|[[integer|ℤ]]}} – any [[factorisation]] would involve a [[linear factor]] {{math|(''x'' − ''k'')}} for some {{math|''k'' ∈ ℤ}}, and so {{math|''k''}} must be a [[mathematics|root]] of {{math|''p''(''x'')}}; but also {{math|''k''}} must divide 2, that is, {{math|1=''k'' = 1, 2, −1}} or {{math|−2}}, and none of these are roots of {{math|''p''(''x'')}}. By [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's Lemma]], {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is also irreducible over {{math|ℚ}}, and is thus a minimal polynomial over {{math|ℚ}} for {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}}. The field extension {{math|ℚ({{radic|2|3}}):ℚ}} is therefore of degree 3. But this is not a power of 2, so by the above, {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}} is not the coordinate of a constructible point, and thus a line segment of {{math|{{radic|2|3}}}} cannot be constructed, and the cube cannot be doubled. By [[Eisenstein's criterion]], {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is also irreducible over {{math|ℚ}}, and indeed it does since 2 does not divide the leading coefficient {{math|1}}, it divides all other coefficients and its square {{math|4}} does not divide the constant coefficient −2.

==History==
The problem owes its name to a story concerning the citizens of [[Delos]], who consulted the oracle at [[Delphi]] in order to learn how to defeat a plague sent by [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="Zhmud"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oX28qf7LKdoC&amp;pg=PA84 L. Zhmud ''The origin of the history of science in classical antiquity'', p.84], quoting [[Plutarch]] and [[Theon of Smyrna]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0243%3Asection%3D6 De E apud Delphos 386.E.4]&lt;/ref&gt; it was the citizens of [[Delos]] who consulted the [[oracle]] at [[Delphi]], seeking a solution for their internal political problems at the time, which had intensified relationships among the citizens. The oracle responded that they must double the size of the altar to Apollo, which was a regular cube. The answer seemed strange to the Delians and they consulted [[Plato]], who was able to interpret the oracle as the mathematical problem of doubling the volume of a given cube, thus explaining the oracle as the advice of Apollo for the citizens of [[Delos]] to occupy themselves with the study of geometry and mathematics in order to calm down their passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], De genio Socratis 579.B&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], [[Plato]] gave the problem to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archytas]] and [[Menaechmus]], who solved the problem using mechanical means, earning a rebuke from Plato for not solving the problem using [[pure geometry]] (Plut., ''Quaestiones convivales'' [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter8.html#section80 VIII.ii], 718ef). This may be why the problem is referred to in the 350s BC by the author of the pseudo-Platonic ''[[Sisyphus (dialogue)|Sisyphus]]'' (388e) as still unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Werner Müller, ''Die Kurzdialoge der Appendix Platonica'', Munich: Wilhelm Fink, 1975, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; However another version of the story (attributed to [[Eratosthenes]] by [[Eutocius of Ascalon]]) says that all three found solutions but they were too abstract to be of practical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first=Wilbur Richard|last=Knorr|authorlink=Wilbur Knorr|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1986|isbn=9780486675329|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgQS5BaTWl4C&amp;pg=PA4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant development in finding a solution to the problem was the discovery by [[Hippocrates of Chios]] that it is equivalent to finding two mean proportionals between a line segment and another with twice the length.&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;T.L. Heath ''A history of Greek mathematics'', Vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern notation, this means that given segments of lengths {{math|''a''}} and {{math|2''a''}}, the duplication of the cube is equivalent to finding segments of lengths {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} so that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{r} = \frac{r}{s} = \frac{s}{2a} .&lt;/math&gt;

In turn, this means that

:&lt;math&gt;r=a\cdot\sqrt[3]{2}&lt;/math&gt;

But [[Pierre Wantzel]] proved in 1837 that the [[cube root]] of 2 is not [[constructible number|constructible]]; that is, it cannot be constructed with [[straightedge and compass]].

==Solutions via means other than compass and straightedge==
Menaechmus' original solution involves the intersection of two [[conic]] curves. Other more complicated methods of doubling the cube involve [[neusis]], the [[cissoid of Diocles]], the [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoid of Nicomedes]], or the [[Philo line]]. [[Archytas]] solved the problem in the 4th century BC using geometric construction in three dimensions, determining a certain point as the intersection of three surfaces of revolution.

False claims of doubling the cube with compass and straightedge abound in mathematical [[Crank (person)|crank]] literature ([[pseudomathematics]]).

Origami may also be used to construct the [[Mathematics of paper folding#Doubling the cube|cube root of two by folding paper]].

===Using a marked ruler===
[[File:Doubling the cube.svg|right|300px]]
There is a simple [[neusis construction]] using a marked ruler for a length which is the cube root of 2 times another length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics |author=Heinrich Dörrie |publisher=Dover |year=1965 |page=171 |isbn=0486-61348-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Mark a ruler with the given length; this will eventually be GH.
#Construct an equilateral triangle ABC with the given length as side.
#Extend AB an equal amount again to D.
#Extend the line BC forming the line CE.
#Extend the line DC forming the line CF
#Place the marked ruler so it goes through A and one end, G, of the marked length falls on ray CF and the other end of the marked length, H, falls on ray CE. Thus GH is the given length.

Then AG is the given length times {{radic|2|3}}.

==In music theory==
In [[music theory]], a natural analogue of doubling is the [[octave]] (a musical interval caused by doubling the frequency of a tone), and a natural analogue of a cube is three repetitions of the same interval. In this sense, the problem of doubling the cube is solved by the [[major third]] in [[equal temperament]]. This is a musical interval that is exactly one third of an octave. It multiplies the frequency of a tone by {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|1|3}}&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{radic|2|3}}}}, the side length of the Delian cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=R. C.|last=Phillips|title=The equal tempered scale|journal=Musical opinion and music trade review|volume=29|issue=337|date=October 1905|pages=41–42|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/7191936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Compass Rose English East.svg|thumb|250px|right|A 16-point [[compass rose]] with east highlighted.]]
'''East''' is one of the four [[cardinal direction]]s or [[points of the compass]]. It is the opposite direction from [[west]].

==Etymology==
The word ''east'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''est'', from [[Old English]] ''ēast'', which itself comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''aus-to-'' or *''austra-'' "east, toward the sunrise", from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *aus- "to shine," or "dawn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=east |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=east&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to [[Old High German]] ''*ōstar'' "to the east", [[Latin]] ''aurora'' "dawn", and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ēōs'' {{lang|grc|ἠώς}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=east |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/east |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ēostre]]'', a [[List of Germanic deities|Germanic goddess]] of dawn, might have been a personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.

==Navigation==
By [[Norm (social)|convention]], the right hand side of a [[map]] is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. However, on maps of planets such as Venus which rotate [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]], the left hand side is east.

To go east using a compass for [[navigation]], one sets a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] of 90°.

==Cultural==
East is the direction toward which the [[Earth]] rotates about its [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis]], and therefore the general direction from which the [[Sun]] appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been adopted by this religion as the Orient was thought of as containing mankind's original home. Hence, some Christian churches have been traditionally oriented towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orientation of Churches |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11305a.htm |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Bosco |title=Architectural Design Guidelines 1 |url= http://liturgy.co.nz/architectural-design-guidelines-1/9558 |publisher=Liturgy.co.nz |accessdate=3 December 2013 |date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Orient'' is the ''East'', traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the [[Eastern world]], in relation to [[Europe]]. In [[English language|English]], it is largely a [[metonym]] for, and coterminous with, the [[continent]] of [[Asia]], divided into the [[Far East]], [[Middle East]], and [[Near East]]. Despite this Eurocentric origin, these regions are still located to the east of the [[Geographical centre of Earth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a [[canonical form]] of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

The canonical form of a graph is an example of a [[Complete set of invariants|complete]] [[graph invariant]]: every two isomorphic graphs have the same canonical form, and every two non-isomorphic graphs have different canonical forms.&lt;ref name=p2tree&gt;{{citation

==Computational complexity==
Clearly, the graph canonization problem is at least as [[Computational complexity theory|computationally hard]] as the [[graph isomorphism problem]]. In fact, graph isomorphism is even [[AC0|AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]]-[[reducible (complexity)|reducible]] to graph canonization. However it is still an open question whether the two problems are [[polynomial time equivalent]].&lt;ref name=ktree/&gt;

While existence of (deterministic) polynomial algorithms for graph isomorphism is still an open problem in [[computational complexity theory]], in 1977 [[László Babai]] reported that with probability at least 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;exp(&amp;minus;O(''n'')), a simple vertex classification algorithm after only two refinement steps produces a canonical labeling of a graph chosen uniformly at random from the set of all ''n''-vertex graphs. Small modifications and an added [[depth-first search]] step produce canonical labeling of such uniformly-chosen random graphs in linear expected time. This result sheds some light on the fact why many reported graph isomorphism algorithms behave well in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Babai | first1 = László | authorlink = László Babai|title=On the Isomorphism Problem|publisher=unpublished manuscript|year =1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important breakthrough in [[probabilistic complexity theory]] which became widely known in its manuscript form and which was still cited as an "unpublished manuscript" long after it was reported at a symposium.

A commonly known canonical form is the [[lexicographical order|lexicographically smallest]] graph within the [[isomorphism class]], which  is the graph of the class with lexicographically smallest [[adjacency matrix]] considered as a linear string.
However, the computation of the lexicographically smallest graph is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name=p2tree/&gt;

For trees, a concise polynomial canonization algorithm requiring O(n) space is presented by {{harvtxt|Read|1972}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Iteratively for each non-leaf x remove the leading 0 and trailing 1 from x's label; then sort x's label along with the labels of all adjacent leaves in lexicographic order.  Concatenate these sorted labels, add back a leading 0 and trailing 1, make this the new label of x, and delete the adjacent leaves. If there are two vertices remaining, concatenate their labels in lexicographic order.

==Applications==
Graph canonization is the essence of many graph isomorphism algorithms. One of the leading tools is Nauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A number of [[identifier]]s for [[chemical substance]]s,  such as [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]] use canonicalization steps in their computation, which is essentially the canonicalization of the graph which represents the molecule.

The '''guillotine problem'''  is a problem in [[combinatorial geometry]] and in printing. 

Closely related to [[packing problem]]s and specifically to [[Cutting stock problem|cutting stock]] and [[bin packing]] problems,&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Wäscher, Heike Haußner, Holger Schumann, An improved typology of cutting and packing problems, European Journal of Operational Research 183 (2007) 1109–1130, [http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS7212/Project/12/papers/Wascher%20et%20al%2007.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; it is the question of how to get the maximum number of sheets of one rectangular size out of a larger sheet, only orthogonal cuts that bisect one component of the sheet are allowed, as on a paper cutting [[Paper_cutter|guillotine]].

The Guillotine problem is important in glass machining. Glass sheets are scored along horizontal and vertical lines and then broken along these lines to obtain smaller panels.

Like the cutting stock problem, it is [[NP hard]], but various approximate and exact solutions have been devised.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. McHale, Roshan P. Shah Cutting the Guillotine Down to Size.

The '''history of logic''' deals with the study of the development of the science of valid [[inference]] ([[logic]]).  Formal logics developed in ancient times in [[Indian logic|India]], [[Logic in China|China]], and [[Greek philosophy|Greece]]. Greek methods, particularly [[Aristotelian logic]] (or term logic) as found in the ''[[Organon]]'', found wide application and acceptance in Western science and mathematics for millennia.&lt;ref name="Boehner p. xiv"&gt;Boehner p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoicism|Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]], began the development of [[predicate logic]].

[[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] philosophers such as [[Boethius]] (died 524), [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna, died 1037) and [[William of Ockham]] (died 1347) further developed Aristotle's logic in the [[Medieval philosophy#High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century, with [[Jean Buridan]]. The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century saw largely decline and neglect, and at least one historian of logic regards this time as barren.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oxford Companion p. 498; Bochenski, Part I Introduction, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical methods]] ruled the day, as evidenced by Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organon]]'' of 1620.

Logic revived in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period when the subject developed into a rigorous and formal discipline which took as its exemplar the exact method of [[mathematical proof|proof]] used in [[mathematics]], a hearkening back to the Greek tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Frege,Gottlob/Frege,%20Gottlob%20-%20The%20Foundations%20of%20Arithmetic%20%281953%29%202Ed_%207.0-2.5%20LotB.pdf|title= The Foundations of Arithmetic|author= Gottlob Frege|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the modern "symbolic" or "mathematical" logic during this period by the likes of [[George Boole|Boole]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] is the most significant in the two-thousand-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human [[intellectual history]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion p. 500"&gt;Oxford Companion p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress in [[mathematical logic]] in the first few decades of the twentieth century, particularly arising from the work of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]], had a significant impact on [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]], particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as [[modal logic]], [[temporal logic]], [[deontic logic]], and [[relevance logic]].

==Logic in the East==

===Logic in India===
{{Main|Indian logic}}

Logic began independently in [[History of India|ancient India]] and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BC) founded the ''[[anviksiki]]'' school of logic.&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the ''anviksiki'' and ''tarka'' schools of logic. {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which [[Boolean logic]] has some similarities) for his formulation of [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]]. Logic is described by [[Chanakya]] (c. 350-283 BC) in his ''[[Arthashastra]]'' as an independent field of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Kangle (1986). ''The Kautiliya Arthashastra'' (1.2.11). Motilal Banarsidass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the six Indian schools of thought deal with logic: [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]]. The [[Nyaya Sutras]] of [[Aksapada Gautama]] (c. 2nd century AD) constitute the core texts of the Nyaya school, one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu]] philosophy. This [[Philosophical realism|realist]] school developed a rigid five-member schema of [[inference]] involving an initial premise, a reason, an example, an application, and a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski p. 417 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Idealism|idealist]] [[Buddhist philosophy]] became the chief opponent to the Naiyayikas. [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 150-250 AD), the founder of the [[Madhyamika]] ("Middle Way") developed an analysis known as the [[catuṣkoṭi]] (Sanskrit), a "four-cornered" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, ''P'':
# ''P''; that is, being.
# not&amp;nbsp;''P''; that is, not being.
# ''P'' and not&amp;nbsp;''P''; that is, being and not being.
# not (''P'' or not&amp;nbsp;''P''); that is, neither being nor not being.{{Paragraph break}}Under [[propositional logic]], [[De Morgan's laws]] imply that this is equivalent to the third case (''P'' and not&amp;nbsp;''P''), and is therefore superfluous; there are actually only 3 cases to consider.

However, [[Dignaga]] (c 480-540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism,&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski pp. 431–7&lt;/ref&gt; and it was through him and his successor, [[Dharmakirti]], that [[Buddhist logic]] reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, "[[vyapti]]", also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion.&lt;ref name=Matilal&gt;{{cite book|last=Matilal|first=Bimal Krishna|title=The Character of Logic in India|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791437407|pages=12, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, a doctrine known as "apoha" or differentiation was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Bochenksi p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.

Dignāga's famous "wheel of reason" (''[[Hetucakra]]'') is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dignāga's analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the traditional five-member Indian syllogism, though deductively valid, has repetitions that are unnecessary to its logical validity. As a result, some commentators see the traditional Indian syllogism as a rhetorical form that is entirely natural in many cultures of the world, and yet not as a logical form—not in the sense that all logically unnecessary elements have been omitted for the sake of analysis.

===Logic in China===
{{Main|Logic in China}}
In China, a contemporary of [[Confucius]], [[Mozi]], "Master Mo", is credited with founding the [[Mohism|Mohist school]], whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions. In particular, one of the schools that grew out of Mohism, the [[School of Names|Logicians]], are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of [[formal logic]]. Due to the harsh rule of [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] in the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]], this line of investigation disappeared in China until the introduction of Indian philosophy by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].

==Logic in the West==

===Prehistory of logic===
Valid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the ''principles'' of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with [[geometry]], which originally meant the same as "land measurement".&lt;ref&gt;Kneale, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians discovered [[Egyptian mathematics|geometry]], including the formula for the volume of a [[Frustum|truncated pyramid]].&lt;ref name=Kneale3&gt;Kneale p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babylonian mathematics|Ancient Babylon]] was also skilled in mathematics. [[Esagil-kin-apli]]'s medical ''Diagnostic Handbook'' in the 11th century BC was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions,&lt;ref name="Stol-99"&gt;H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 99, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-13666-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC employed an [[internal logic]] within their predictive planetary systems, an important contribution to the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;D. Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology '', Styx Publications, {{ISBN|90-5693-036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece before Aristotle===
While the ancient Egyptians empirically discovered some truths of geometry, the great achievement of the ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative [[Mathematical proof|proof]]. Both [[Thales]] and [[Pythagoras]] of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] seem aware of geometry's methods.

Fragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;Heath, ''Mathematics in Aristotle'', cited in Kneale, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the [[Platonic Academy]].&lt;ref name=Kneale3/&gt; The proofs of [[Euclid of Alexandria]] are a paradigm of Greek geometry. The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:

* Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an [[axiom]] of geometry.
* Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] or a "derivation" of the proposition.
* The proof must be ''formal''; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.&lt;ref name=Kneale3/&gt;
Further evidence that early Greek thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called ''[[dissoi logoi]]'', probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the [[Rhetoric]]ians or Orators and the [[Sophists]], who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346217/history-of-logic#toc65918|title=History of logic|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thales' Theorem.svg|thumb|130px|left|Thales Theorem]]

====Thales====
It is said Thales, most widely regarded as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPM"&gt;{{cite book|author = Smith|title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year = 1870|url = https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/1016|page = 1016|first = Sir William}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the height of the [[pyramids]] by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. Thales was said to have had a sacrifice in celebration of discovering [[Thales' theorem]] just as Pythagoras had the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Prof.T.Patronis &amp; D.Patsopoulos {{cite book | url =http://journals.tc-library.org/index.php/hist_math_ed/article/viewFile/189/184 | title = The Theorem of Thales: A Study of the naming of theorems in school Geometry textbooks  | publisher = [[Patras University]]  | accessdate = 2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales is the first known individual to use [[deductive reasoning]] applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to his theorem, and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] and Babylonian mathematicians knew his theorem for special cases before he proved it.&lt;ref&gt;de Laet, Siegfried J. (1996). ''History of Humanity: Scientific and Cultural Development''. [[UNESCO]], Volume 3, p. 14. {{ISBN|92-3-102812-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Thales learned that an angle inscribed in a [[semicircle]] is a right angle during his travels to [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Carl B. and [[Uta Merzbach|Merzbach, Uta C.]] (2010). ''A History of Mathematics''. John Wiley and Sons, Chapter IV. {{ISBN|0-470-63056-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pythagoras====
[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|thumb|180px|Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem in Euclid's ''Elements'']]
Before 520&amp;nbsp;BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met the c.&amp;nbsp;54 years older Thales.&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Boyer (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic study of proof seems to have begun with the school of Pythagoras (i. e. the Pythagoreans) in the late sixth century BC.&lt;ref name=Kneale3/&gt;  Indeed, the Pythagoreans, believing all was number, are the first philosophers to emphasize ''form'' rather than ''matter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=11|author=Samuel Enoch Stumpf|title=Socrates to Sartre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heraclitus and Parmenides====
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535 – c. 475 BC) was the first place where the word ''[[logos]]'' was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;F.E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Heraclitus held that everything changes and all was fire  and conflicting opposites, seemingly unified only by this ''Logos''. He is known for his obscure sayings.
{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels-Kranz]]|22B1}}
[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|160px|Parmenides has been called the discoverer of logic.]]
In contrast to Heraclitus, [[Parmenides]] held that all is one and nothing changes. He may have been a dissident Pythagorean, disagreeing that One (a number) produced the many.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bard.edu/library/arendt/pdfs/Cornford-Parmenides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "X is not" must always be false or meaningless. What exists can in no way not exist.  Our sense perceptions with its noticing of generation and destruction are in grievous error. Instead of sense perception, Parmenides advocated ''logos'' as the means to Truth. He has been called the discoverer of logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Philosophy: an introduction|author=R. J. Hollingdale|year=1974|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/From_religion_to_philosophy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''For this view, that That Which Is Not exists, can never predominate. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (namely, that of allowing) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (you must) judge by means of the Reason ([[Logos]]) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me.'' (B 7.1–8.2)

[[Zeno of Elea]], a pupil of Parmenides, had the idea of a standard argument pattern found in the method of proof known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. This is the technique of drawing an obviously false (that is, "absurd") conclusion from an assumption, thus demonstrating that the assumption is false.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Zeno and his teacher are seen as the first to apply the art of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPoqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170|title=The Numismatic Circular|author=|date=2 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Plato's dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the [[monism]] of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Zeno famously used this method to develop his [[Zeno's Paradoxes|paradoxes]] in his arguments against motion. Such ''dialectic'' reasoning later became popular. The members of this school were called "dialecticians" (from a Greek word meaning "to discuss").

None of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher [[Plato]] (428–347 BC) include any formal logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; but they include important contributions to the field of [[philosophical logic]]. Plato raises three questions:

* What is it that can properly be called true or false?
* What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?
* What is the nature of definition?

The first question arises in the dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (''logos'').&lt;ref&gt;"forming an opinion is talking, and opinion is speech that is held not with someone else or aloud but in silence with oneself" ''Theaetetus'' 189E–190A&lt;/ref&gt; The second question is a result of Plato's [[theory of Forms]]. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called [[universals]], namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and the ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between "forms".&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 20.  For example, the proof given in the ''Meno'' that the square on the diagonal is double the area of the original square presumably involves the forms of the square and the triangle, and the necessary relation between them&lt;/ref&gt; The third question is about [[definition]]. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Plato's student [[Aristotle]], in particular Aristotle's notion of the [[essence]] of a thing.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/#Def Aristotle's Logic]". [[Stanford University]], 18 March 2000. Retrieved 13 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|160px|Aristotle]]
The logic of [[Aristotle]], and particularly his theory of the [[syllogism]], has had an enormous influence in [[Western thought]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/ Aristotle's logic], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle was the first logician to attempt a systematic analysis of [[logical syntax]], of noun (or ''[[terminology|term]]''), and of verb. He was the first ''formal logician'', in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying [[logical form]] of an argument. He sought relations of dependence which characterize necessary inference, and distinguished the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of these relations, from the truth of the premises (the [[soundness]] of the argument). He was the first to deal with the principles of [[Principle of contradiction|contradiction]] and [[Law of excluded middle|excluded middle]] in a systematic way.&lt;ref name="Bochenski p. 63"&gt;Bochenski p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Aristoteles Logica 1570 Biblioteca Huelva.jpg|alt=Front cover of book, titled "Aristotelis Logica", with an illustration of eagle on a snake|240px|thumb|left|Aristotle's logic was still influential in the [[Renaissance]]]]
====The Organon====
His logical works, called the ''[[Organon]]'', are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times. Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle's logical works is:
* ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'', a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.
* ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|The Topics]]'' (with an appendix called ''[[On Sophistical Refutations]]''), a discussion of dialectics.
* ''[[De Interpretatione|On Interpretation]]'', an analysis of simple [[categorical proposition]]s into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. 
* ''[[Prior Analytics|The Prior Analytics]]'', a formal analysis of what makes a [[syllogism]] (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).
* ''[[Posterior Analytics|The Posterior Analytics]]'', a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.
[[File:Square of opposition, set diagrams.svg|thumb|180px|This diagram shows the contradictory relationships between [[categorical proposition]]s in the [[square of opposition]] of [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]].]]
These works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. In the ''Categories'', he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', which itself had a profound influence on Western thought.  

He also developed a theory of non-formal logic (''i.e.,'' the theory of [[logical fallacy|fallacies]]), which is presented in ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''.&lt;ref name="Bochenski p. 63"/&gt;

''On Interpretation'' contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of [[Square of opposition|opposition]] and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the [[square of opposition]] (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of [[modal logic]].

The ''Prior Analytics'' contains his exposition of the "syllogism", where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system.

===Stoics===
{{Main|Stoic logic}}
The other great school of Greek logic is that of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Throughout later antiquity two great schools of logic were distinguished, the Peripatetic which was derived from Aristotle, and the Stoic which was developed by Chrysippus from the teachings of the Megarians" – Kneale p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher [[Euclid of Megara]], a pupil of [[Socrates]] and slightly older contemporary of Plato, probably following in the tradition of Parmenides and Zeno. His pupils and successors were called "[[Megarian school|Megarians]]", or "Eristics", and later the "Dialecticians". The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were [[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]], who were active in the late 4th century BC. 
[[File:Chrysippos BM 1846.jpg|alt=Stone bust of a bearded, grave-looking man|thumb|160px|[[Chrysippus]] of Soli]]
The Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was [[Chrysippus]] (c. 278–c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine.  He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion'', article "Chrysippus", p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [[Susanne Bobzien]], ''Ancient Logic''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently [[Diogenes Laertius]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Galen]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], and [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Huelser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, 4 vols, Stuttgart 1986-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Three significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of [[Modal logic|modality]], (ii) their theory of the [[Material conditional]], and (iii) their account of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] and [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;Kneale 117–158&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Modality''. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality and actuality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Eta 3, 1046b 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boethius]], ''Commentary on the Perihermenias'', Meiser p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his [[Master argument (Diodorus Cronus)|Master argument]], which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:
:* Everything that is past is true and necessary.
:* The impossible does not follow from the possible.
:* What neither is nor will be is possible.
: Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epictetus]], ''Dissertationes'' ed. Schenkel ii. 19. I.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Conditional statements''. The first logicians to debate [[Material conditional|conditional statements]] were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a false [[consequent]]. Precisely, let ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' be true statements, and let ''F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):
:* If ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''
:* If ''F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''
:* If ''F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''
: The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:
:* If ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''
: Indeed, Sextus says "According to &amp;#91;Philo&amp;#93;, there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false."&lt;ref name=sextus-adv-math&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Adv. Math.'' viii, Section 113&lt;/ref&gt; Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a [[truth-functional]] definition of "if ... then"; it is the definition used in [[predicate logic|modern logic]].

:In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.&lt;ref name=sextus-adv-math /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' ii. 110, comp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 47, ''de Fato'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.
* ''Meaning and truth''. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern [[propositional logic]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lukasiewicz p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics distinguished between utterance (''phone''), which may be noise, speech (''lexis''), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (''logos''), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a ''lekton'', is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a ''proposition''. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word ''Dion'', and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Bk viii., Sections 11, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Averroes]] and other Muslim logicians were based on Aristotelian logic and were important in communicating the ideas of the ancient world to the medieval West.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/H057 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online Version 2.0]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFDTux7u?url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/islamic-philosophy;jsessionid=B31B033F077DD5E68E09CC9D35C02105 |date=2015-05-03 }}, article 'Islamic philosophy'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873–950) was an Aristotelian logician who discussed the topics of [[future contingent]]s, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Al-Farabi also considered the theories of [[conditional syllogism]]s and [[Analogy|analogical inference]], which were part of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 0022-362X | volume = 61 | issue = 22 | pages = 724–734 | last = Feldman | first = Seymour | title = Rescher on Arabic Logic | journal = The Journal of Philosophy| date = 1964-11-26 | jstor = 2023632 | doi = 10.2307/2023632 | publisher = Journal of Philosophy, Inc.}} [726]. {{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-27556-3 | last = Long | first = A.

[[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) (980–1037) was the founder of [[Avicennian logic]], which replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world,&lt;ref name=Hasse&gt;{{cite web |author=Dag Nikolaus Hasse|title=Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=September 19, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also had an important influence on Western medieval writers such as [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Washell (1973), "Logic, Language, and Albert the Great", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''34''' (3), pp. 445–450 [445].&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna wrote on the [[hypothetical syllogism]]&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; and on the [[propositional calculus]], which were both part of the Stoic logical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan (1992); ''Avicenna'', p. 188, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an original "temporally modalized" syllogistic theory, involving [[temporal logic]] and [[modal logic]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made use of [[inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], such as the [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference, and concomitant variation]] which are critical to the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Goodman, Lenn Evan (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Avicenna's ideas had a particularly important influence on Western logicians such as [[William of Ockham]]: Avicenna's word for a meaning or notion (''ma'na''), was translated by the scholastic logicians as the Latin ''intentio''; in medieval logic and [[epistemology]], this is a sign in the mind that naturally represents a thing.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; This was crucial to the development of Ockham's [[conceptualism]]: A universal term (''e.g.,'' "man") does not signify a thing existing in reality, but rather a sign in the mind (''intentio in intellectu'') which represents many things in reality; Ockham cites Avicenna's commentary on ''Metaphysics'' V in support of this view.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale: p. 266; Ockham: [[Summa Logicae]] i. 14; Avicenna: ''Avicennae Opera'' Venice 1508 f87rb&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's "[[Syllogism|first figure]]" and formulated an early system of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref name=Iqbal&gt;[[Muhammad Iqbal]], ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'', "The Spirit of Muslim Culture" ([[cf.]] [http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/prose/english/reconstruction] and [http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/MI_RRTI/chapter_05.htm])&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Razi's work was seen by later Islamic scholars as marking a new direction for Islamic logic, towards a [[Logic in Islamic philosophy#Post-Avicennian logic|Post-Avicennian logic]]. This was further elaborated by his student Afdaladdîn al-Khûnajî (d. 1249), who developed a form of logic revolving around the subject matter of [[concept]]ions and [[Grammar of Assent|assents]]. In response to this tradition, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274) began a tradition of Neo-Avicennian logic which remained faithful to Avicenna's work and existed as an alternative to the more dominant Post-Avicennian school over the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

The [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]] was founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive necessity", which refers to the reduction of all modalities (necessity, [[Logical possibility|possibility]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] and [[impossibility]]) to the single mode of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lotfollah Nabavi, [http://public.ut.ac.ir/html/fac/lit/articles.html Sohrevardi's Theory of Decisive Necessity and kripke's QSS System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126100838/http://public.ut.ac.ir/html/fac/lit/articles.html |date=2008-01-26 }}, ''Journal of Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288) wrote a book on Avicennian logic, which was a commentary of Avicenna's ''Al-Isharat'' (''The Signs'') and  ''Al-Hidayah'' (''The Guidance'').&lt;ref name=Roubi&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263–1328), wrote the ''Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin'', where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the [[syllogism]]&lt;ref&gt;See pp.&amp;nbsp;253–254 of {{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-52069-0 | pages = 247–265 | editors = Peter Adamson and Richard C.

===Logic in medieval Europe===
[[File:Britoquestionsonoldlogic.jpg|alt=Top left corner of early printed text, with an illuminated S, beginning "Sicut dicit philosophus"|thumb|[[Radulphus Brito|Brito's]] questions on the ''Old Logic'']]

"Medieval logic" (also known as "Scholastic logic") generally means the form of Aristotelian logic developed in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] throughout roughly the period 1200–1600.&lt;ref name="Boehner p. xiv"/&gt; For centuries after Stoic logic had been formulated, it was the dominant system of logic in the classical world. When the study of logic resumed after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher [[Boethius]], who was familiar with some of Aristotle's logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics.&lt;ref name=Kneale198&gt;Kneale p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the ''Categories'', ''On Interpretation'', and Boethius's translation of the [[Isagoge]] of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the "Old Logic" (''Logica Vetus'' or ''Ars Vetus''). An important work in this tradition was the ''Logica Ingredientibus'' of [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142).  His direct influence was small,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dumont, article "Peter Abelard" in Gracia and Noone p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; but his influence through pupils such as [[John of Salisbury]] was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale, pp. 202–3&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle's ''Organon'' (including the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', and the ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'') had been recovered in the West.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Kneale p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Boehner p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before.  These were:&lt;ref&gt;Boehner pp. 19–76&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of [[Supposition theory|supposition]]. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (''e.g.,'' 'man') range over a domain of individuals (''e.g.,'' all men).&lt;ref&gt;Boehner p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual?  Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern [[first-order logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Boehner p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; "The theory of supposition with the associated theories of ''copulatio'' (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), ''ampliatio'' (widening of referential domain), and ''distributio'' constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic".&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory of [[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]].  Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike ''categorematic'' terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words.  Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.
* The theory of [[Logical consequence|consequences]].  A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms 'if ... then'.  For example, 'if a man runs, then God exists' (''Si homo currit, Deus est'').&lt;ref&gt;Boehner pp. 54–5&lt;/ref&gt;  A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of [[William of Ockham]]'s work [[Summa Logicae]].  There, Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern [[Material conditional|material implication]] and [[logical implication]] respectively.  Similar accounts are given by [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony]].

The last great works in this tradition are the ''Logic'' of John Poinsot (1589–1644, known as [[John of St Thomas]]), the ''Metaphysical Disputations'' of [[Francisco Suarez]] (1548–1617), and the ''Logica Demonstrativa'' of [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]] (1667–1733).

''Traditional logic'' generally means the textbook tradition that begins with [[Antoine Arnauld]]'s and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic, or the Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion'' p. 504, article "Traditional logic"&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Buroker xxiii"&gt;Buroker xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval [[term logic]]. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that.&lt;ref name="Buroker xxiii"/&gt;  The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of [[extension (semantics)|extension]] and [[intension]]. The account of [[proposition]]s that [[John Locke|Locke]] gives in the ''Essay'' is essentially that of the Port-Royal:  "Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree."&lt;ref&gt;(Locke, ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', IV. 5. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dudley Fenner]] helped popularize [[Ramist]] logic, a reaction against Aristotle. Another influential work was the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' by [[Francis Bacon]], published in 1620. The title translates as "new instrument". This is a reference to [[Aristotle]]'s work known as the ''[[Organon]]''. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure "which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding".&lt;ref&gt;Farrington, 1964, 89&lt;/ref&gt; This method is known as [[inductive reasoning]], a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a ''phenomenal nature'' such as heat, 3 lists should be constructed:
* The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.
* The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.
* The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.
Then, the ''form nature'' (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.

Other works in the textbook tradition include [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason'' (1725), [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Logic'' (1826), and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''A System of Logic'' (1843).  Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill's view that the foundations of logic lie in introspection&lt;ref&gt;N. Abbagnano, "Psychologism" in P. Edwards (ed) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', MacMillan, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Of the German literature in this period, Robert Adamson wrote "''Logics'' swarm as bees in springtime..."; Robert Adamson, ''A Short History of Logic'', Wm. Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1911, page 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic in Hegel's philosophy===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]
[[G.W.F. Hegel]] indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive ''[[Science of Logic]]'' into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his ''Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.''  The "Shorter" or "Encyclopaedia" ''Logic'', as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories—Hegel begins with "Pure Being" and "Pure Nothing"—to the "[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it.  Despite the title, Hegel's ''Logic'' is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference.  Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of "Quality" without the concept of "Quantity"); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves.  His purpose is to show the rational structure of the "Absolute"—indeed of rationality itself.  The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian [[dialectic]].

Although Hegel's ''Logic'' has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:
* [[Karl von Prantl|Carl von Prantl]]'s ''Geschichte der Logik in Abendland'' (1855–1867).&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Prantl (1855-1867), ''Geschichte von Logik in Abendland'', Leipsig:  S. Hirzl, anastatically reprinted in 1997, Hildesheim:  Georg Olds.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The work of the [[British Idealism|British Idealists]], such as F.H. Bradley's ''Principles of Logic'' (1883).
* The economic, political, and philosophical studies of [[Karl Marx]], and in the various schools of [[Marxism]].

===Logic and psychology===
Between the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism Psychologism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;  The German psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], for example, discussed deriving "the logical from the psychological laws of thought", emphasizing that "psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Wundt, ''Logik'' (1880–1883); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:
* [[Theodor Lipps]] described logic as "a specific discipline of psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Lipps, ''Grundzüge der Logik'' (1893); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christoph von Sigwart]] understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual's compulsion to think in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph von Sigwart, ''Logik'' (1873–78); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benno Erdmann]] argued that "logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Benno Erdmann, ''Logik'' (1892); quoted in Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;
Such was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill's work.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Moran, "Introduction"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  This psychological approach to logic was rejected by [[Gottlob Frege]].  It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by [[Edmund Husserl]] in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'' (1900), an assault which has been described as "overwhelming".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dummett, "Preface"; Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations,'' translated J.N. Findlay, Routledge, 2008, Volume 1, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;  Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that [[skepticism]] and [[relativism]] were unavoidable consequences.

Such criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called "[[psychologism]]". For example, the American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]], while acknowledging the force of Husserl's critique, remained "unable to doubt" that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Royce, "Recent Logical Enquiries and their Psychological Bearings" (1902) in John J. McDermott (ed) ''The Basic Writings of Josiah Royce'' Volume 2, Fordham University Press, 2005, p. 661&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of modern logic==
The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in [[mathematics]]. The development of the modern "symbolic" or "mathematical" logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion p. 500"/&gt;

A number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern logic is fundamentally a ''calculus''  whose rules of operation are determined only by the ''shape'' and not by the ''meaning'' of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics.  Many logicians were impressed by the "success" of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] noted&lt;ref&gt;Peirce 1896&lt;/ref&gt; that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by [[Laplace]] led to an error concerning the moon's orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute.  Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in [[metaphysics]]. He argued that a truly "exact" logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., "diagrammatic" or "iconic" thought.  "Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected".  Modern logic is also "constructive" rather than "abstractive"; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called "[[Syncategorematic term|syncategoremata]]") and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.

==Modern logic==
The development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:&lt;ref&gt;See Bochenski p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''embryonic period''' from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.
* The '''algebraic period''' from [[Boole]]'s Analysis to [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]]'s ''Vorlesungen''.  In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.
* The '''[[logicist]] period''' from the [[Begriffsschrift]] of [[Frege]] to the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[A.N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]. The aim of the "logicist school" was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology.  The major logicists were [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], and the early [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion'' p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; It culminates with the ''Principia'', an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the [[antinomy|antinomies]] which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.
* The '''metamathematical period''' from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of [[metalogic]], in the [[finitist]] system of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], and the non-finitist system of [[Leopold Löwenheim|Löwenheim]] and [[Skolem]], the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of [[Gödel]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]].  Gödel's [[incompleteness theorem]] of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic.  Later in the 1930s, Gödel developed the notion of [[set-theoretic constructibility]].
* The '''period after World War II''', when [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]], and its ideas and methods began to influence [[philosophy]].

===Embryonic period===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|Leibniz]]
The idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as [[Ramon Llull|Raymond Llull]], who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings.  The work of logicians such as the [[Oxford Calculators]]&lt;ref&gt;Edith Sylla (1999), "Oxford Calculators", in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Cambridge, Cambridgeshire:  Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (''calculationes'') in words, a method used, for instance, in the ''Logica magna'' by [[Paul of Venice]].  Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction.&lt;ref&gt;El. philos. sect. I de corp 1.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea is found in the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus.  But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to "countless ambiguities" and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words;&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; hence, he proposed to identify an [[alphabet of human thought]] comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Donald, 1995, "Philosophy and language" in Jolley, N., ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz''. Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and create a ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]'' that would make all arguments "as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Philip, 1951. ''Leibniz: Selections''. Scribner.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Diaz Gergonne|Gergonne]] (1816) said that reasoning does not have to be about objects about which one has perfectly clear ideas, because algebraic operations can be carried out without having any idea of the meaning of the symbols involved.&lt;ref&gt;''Essai de dialectique rationelle'', 211n, quoted in Bochenski p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] anticipated a fundamental idea of modern proof theory when he defined logical consequence or "deducibility" in terms of variables:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Algebraic period===
[[File:George Boole color.jpg|thumb|140px|George Boole]]
Modern logic begins with what is known as the "algebraic school", originating with Boole and including [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]], and [[John Venn|Venn]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Bochenski p. 296 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Their objective was to develop a calculus to formalise reasoning in the area of classes, propositions, and probabilities.  The school begins with Boole's seminal work ''Mathematical Analysis of Logic'' which appeared in 1847, although [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (1847) is its immediate precursor.&lt;ref&gt;Before publishing, he wrote to [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], who was just finishing his work ''Formal Logic''.  De Morgan suggested they should publish first, and thus the two books appeared at the same time, possibly even reaching the bookshops on the same day. cf. Kneale p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental idea of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations.  This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol ''='' signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on.  Boole calls these ''elective symbols'', i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration.&lt;ref name="Kneale p. 407"&gt;Kneale p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;  An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an ''elective function'', and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an ''elective equation''.&lt;ref&gt;Boole (1847) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of elective functions and their "development" is essentially the modern idea of [[truth-function]]s and their expression in [[disjunctive normal form]].&lt;ref name="Kneale p. 407"/&gt;

Boole's system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic.  Boole distinguished between "primary propositions" which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and "secondary propositions", which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different "interpretations" the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is "All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics."  An example of a secondary proposition is "Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics."&lt;ref&gt;Boole 1847 pp. 58–9&lt;/ref&gt;  These are easily distinguished in modern propositional calculus, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.&lt;ref&gt;Beaney p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Symbolic Logic'' (1881), [[John Venn]] used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole's methods could be mechanised, and constructed a "logical machine" which he showed to the [[Royal Society]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Kneale p. 407"/&gt;  In 1885 [[Allan Marquand]] proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080908073359/http://finelib.princeton.edu/instruction/wri172_demonstration.php picture at the Firestone Library]).
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Charles Sanders Peirce]]
The defects in Boole's system (such as the use of the letter ''v'' for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers.  Jevons published ''Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity'' in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify [[exclusive or]], which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified.&lt;ref&gt;Kneale p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;  This was usefully exploited by Schröder when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890–1905).  Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, "[[Logical NOR|neither ... nor ...]]" and equally well "[[Sheffer stroke|not both ... and ...]]",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, "A Boolean Algebra with One Constant", 1880 MS, ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 12–20, reprinted ''Writings'' v. 4, pp. 218-21. Google [https://books.google.com/books?id=E7ZUnx3FqrcC&amp;q=378+Winter Preview].&lt;/ref&gt; however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until [[Henry M. Sheffer|Sheffer]] rediscovered it in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., xiv (1913)'', pp. 481–8. This is now known as the [[Sheffer stroke]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the [[logical sum]] which originates in Peirce (1867), [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]] (1877) and Jevons (1890),&lt;ref&gt;Bochenski 296&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of [[Inclusion (logic)|inclusion]], first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).
[[File:Boolean multiples of 2 3 5.svg|alt=Coloured diagram of 4 interlocking sets|right|thumb|250px|Boolean multiples]]
The success of Boole's algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schröder's monumental ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik'' ("Lectures on the Algebra of Logic", vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;See CP III&lt;/ref&gt;

Boole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] in an accessible introduction to ''Laws of Thought''&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. The Laws of Thought, facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in Philosophy in Review.24 (2004) 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of ''Prior Analytics'' and ''Laws of Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol. 24 (2003), pp. 261–288.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were "to go under, over, and beyond" Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat — from assessing validity to solving equations — and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle — e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. 
First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotelian logic to formulas in the form of equations — by itself a revolutionary idea. 
Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic — another revolutionary idea — involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the "perfect syllogisms") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. 
Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce "No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus" from "No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle" or from "No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle".

===Logicist period===
[[File:Young frege.jpg|thumb|160px|Gottlob Frege.]]
After Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. Frege's objective was the program of [[Logicism]], i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic.&lt;ref name=k435&gt;Kneale p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;  Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or [[Begriffsschrift]] is important.&lt;ref name=k435/&gt; Frege also tried to show that the concept of [[number]] can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic.  He was not the first writer to suggest this.  In his pioneering work ''Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik'' (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15–17, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, [[J.S. Mill]] as well as Jevons, citing the latter's claim that "algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, ''The Principles of Science'', London 1879, p. 156, quoted in ''Grundlagen'' 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's first work, the ''Begriffsschrift'' ("concept script") is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (''modus ponens'' and substitution), and six axioms.  Frege referred to the "completeness" of this system, but was unable to prove this.&lt;ref&gt;Beaney p. 10 – the completeness of Frege's system was eventually proved by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1934&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] in terms of mathematical functions.  Traditional logic regards the sentence "Caesar is a man" as of fundamentally the same form as "all men are mortal."  Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as "every Caesar is a man".&lt;ref&gt;See for example the argument by the medieval logician [[William of Ockham]] that singular propositions are universal, in [[Summa Logicae]] III. 8 (??)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the outset Frege abandons the traditional "concepts ''subject'' and ''predicate''", replacing them with ''argument'' and ''function'' respectively, which he believes "will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words ''if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,'' and so forth, deserves attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege argued that the quantifier expression "all men" does not have the same logical or semantic form as "all men", and that the universal proposition "every A is B" is a complex proposition involving two ''functions'', namely ' – is A' and ' – is B' such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second.  In modern notation, this would be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \; x \big( A(x) \rightarrow B (x) \big)&lt;/math&gt;

In English, "for all x, if Ax then Bx".  Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition.  Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all.  If "all mammals" were the logical subject of the sentence "all mammals are land-dwellers", then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give "all mammals are ''not'' land-dwellers".  But this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;"On concept and object" p. 198; Geach p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and [[linguistics]].

This means that in Frege's calculus, Boole's "primary" propositions can be represented in a different way from "secondary" propositions.  "All inhabitants are either men or women" is
[[File:BS-13-Begriffsschrift Quantifier2-svg.svg|130px|alt=Straight line with bend; text "x" over bend; text "F(x)" to the right of the line.|thumb|[[Frege]]'s "Concept Script"]]
: &lt;math&gt;\forall \; x \Big( I(x) \rightarrow \big( M(x) \lor W(x) \big) \Big) &lt;/math&gt;

whereas "All the inhabitants are men or all the inhabitants are women" is

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \; x \big( I(x) \rightarrow M(x) \big) \lor \forall \;x \big( I(x) \rightarrow W(x) \big)&lt;/math&gt;

As Frege remarked in a critique of Boole's calculus:

: "The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot.  In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it'&lt;ref&gt;BLC p. 14, quoted in Beaney p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege's calculus also resolved the ancient [[problem of multiple generality]].  The ambiguity of "every girl kissed a boy" is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege's logic resolves this through the different scope of the quantifiers.  Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \; x \Big( G(x) \rightarrow  \exists \; y \big( B(y) \land K(x,y) \big) \Big)&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Giuseppe_Peano.jpg|thumb|120px|Peano]]
means that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But

:&lt;math&gt;\exists \;x \Big( B(x) \land \forall \;y \big( G(y) \rightarrow K(y, x) \big) \Big)&lt;/math&gt;

means that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible.  Using it, Frege provided a definition of the [[ancestral relation]], of the [[Injective function|many-to-one relation]], and of [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/frege.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy], article "Frege"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ernst Zermelo 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Ernst Zermelo]]
This period overlaps with the work of what is known as the "mathematical school", which included [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Moritz Pasch|Pasch]], [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]], [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]], [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] and [[Arend Heyting|Heyting]]. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory. Most notable was [[Hilbert's Program]], which sought to ground all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by "finitistic" means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. The standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s is named the [[Peano axioms]] in his honor. Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols. While unaware of Frege's work, he independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by [[Bertrand Russell]].  This proved Frege's [[naive set theory]] led to a contradiction.  Frege's theory contained the axiom that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion.  Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Potter 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This contradiction is now known as [[Russell's paradox]]. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by [[Ernst Zermelo]].&lt;ref&gt;Zermelo 1908&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zermelo set theory]] was the first [[axiomatic set theory]]. It was developed into the now-canonical [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). Russell's paradox symbolically is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Let } R = \{ x \mid x \not \in x \} \text{, then } R \in R \iff R \not \in R&lt;/math&gt;
The monumental [[Principia Mathematica]], a three-volume work on the [[foundations of mathematics]], written by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and published 1910–13 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate [[system of types]]: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the "[[set of all sets]]".  The ''Principia'' was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]].

===Metamathematical period===
[[File:Kurt gödel.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Kurt Gödel]]
The names of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] dominate the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Feferman 1999 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; a crucial period in the development of [[metamathematics]] – the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce [[metatheory|metatheories]], or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories.  Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by Hilbert's program. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of Gödel, who in 1929 showed that a given [[first-order logic|first-order sentence]] is [[Provability logic|deducible]] if and only if it is logically valid – i.e. it is true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] for its language.  This is known as [[Gödel's completeness theorem]].  A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form.  The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an [[Effective method|effective procedure]] such as an [[algorithm]] or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the [[natural number]]s.  For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself.  These two results are known as [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], or simply ''Gödel's Theorem''.  Later in the decade, Gödel developed the concept of [[set-theoretic constructibility]], as part of his proof that the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[continuum hypothesis]] are consistent with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Alonzo Church.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Alonzo Church]] --&gt;
In [[proof theory]], [[Gerhard Gentzen]] developed [[natural deduction]] and the [[sequent calculus]].  The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it 'naturally' occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system.  Since Gentzen's work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science.  Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jean-Yves | last=Girard | authorlink=Jean-Yves Girard |author2=Paul Taylor |author3=Yves Lafont  | title=Proofs and Types | publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, 7) | year=1990 | origyear=1989 | isbn=0-521-37181-3 | url= http://www.paultaylor.eu/stable/Proofs%2BTypes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=CutEliminationTheorem | title=Cut Elimination Theorem | author=Alex Sakharov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AlfredTarski1968.jpeg|right|200px|alt=Balding man, with bookshelf in background|thumb|Alfred Tarski]]
[[Alfred Tarski]], a pupil of [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]], is best known for his definition of truth and [[logical consequence]], and the semantic concept of [[Open sentence|logical satisfaction]].  In 1933, he published (in Polish) ''The concept of truth in formalized languages'', in which he proposed his [[semantic theory of truth]]: a sentence such as "snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white.  Tarski's theory separated the [[metalanguage]], which makes the statement about truth, from the [[object language]], which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the [[T-schema]]) between phrases in the object language and elements of an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].  Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of [[model theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Feferman and Feferman 2004, p. 122, discussing "The Impact of Tarski's Theory of Truth".&lt;/ref&gt;  Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], [[consistency]] and [[Structure (mathematical logic)|definability]]. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski "changed the face of logic in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Feferman 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert's ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The ''Entscheidungsproblem'' asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true.  Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing's paper introduced the [[halting problem]] as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.

Church's system for computation developed into the modern [[λ-calculus]], while the [[Turing machine]] became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the [[Church–Turing thesis]] that any deterministic [[algorithm]] that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[first-order logic]] are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Later work by [[Emil Post]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of [[degrees of unsolvability]].

The results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]], particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as [[modal logic]], [[temporal logic]], [[deontic logic]], and [[relevance logic]].

===Logic after WWII===
[[File:Kripke.JPG|alt=Man with a beard and straw hat on a beach|thumb|[[Saul Kripke]]]]

After World War II, [[mathematical logic]] branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[computability theory]], and [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Barwise, ''Handbook of Mathematical Logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

In set theory, the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results. &lt;!-- Kunen p. 235ff, Kanamori p. 114ff --&gt; [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] introduced this method in 1963 to prove the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] and the [[axiom of choice]] from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/72252 The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, II]  Paul J. Cohen Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 51, No. 1. (Jan. 15, 1964), pp. 105-110.
&lt;/ref&gt; His technique, which was simplified and extended soon after its introduction, has since been applied to many other problems in all areas of mathematical logic.

Computability theory had its roots in the work of Turing, Church, Kleene, and Post in the 1930s and 40s. It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as [[recursion theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Many of the foundational papers are collected in ''The Undecidable'' (1965) edited by Martin Davis&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Turing degree|priority method]], discovered independently by [[Albert Muchnik]] and [[Richard Friedberg]] in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the [[degrees of unsolvability]] and related structures. &lt;!-- cooper 246 --&gt;  Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory. &lt;!-- sacks "higher recursion theory" --&gt;  The fields of [[constructive analysis]] and [[computable analysis]] were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of [[reverse mathematics]].  A separate branch of computability theory, [[computational complexity theory]], was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into [[descriptive complexity]].

Model theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title ''Contributions to the theory of models''. &lt;!-- "alfred tarski's work in model theory", vaught, JSL, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2273900 --&gt; In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on [[non-standard analysis|infinitesimals]], a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz. &lt;!-- Keisler, fundamentals of model theory, HML, p. 48 --&gt;

In proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the [[realizability]] method invented by [[Georg Kreisel]] and Gödel's [[Dialectica interpretation|''Dialectica'' interpretation]]. This work inspired the contemporary area of [[proof mining]]. The [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] used in computer science.  As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory.  Advances were also made in [[ordinal analysis]] and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the [[Paris–Harrington theorem]].

This was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking.  For example, [[tense logic]] is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher [[Arthur Prior]] played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. [[Modal logic]]s extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of [[Linguistic modality|modality]] (for example, [[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Necessary conditions|necessity]]). The ideas of [[Saul Kripke]], particularly about [[possible world]]s, and the formal system now called [[Kripke semantics]] have had a profound impact on [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Fodor, "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/jerry-fodor/waters-water-everywhere Water's water everywhere]", ''London Review of Books'', 21 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His best known and most influential work is ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning'', Scott Soames: "''Naming and Necessity'' is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century". Cited in Byrne, Alex and Hall, Ned. 2004. 'Necessary Truths'. ''Boston Review'' October/November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deontic logic]]s are closely related to modal logics: they attempt to capture the logical features of [[obligation]], [[Permission (philosophy)|permission]] and related concepts. Although some basic novelties [[syncretism|syncretizing]] mathematical and philosophical logic were shown by [[Bernard Bolzano#Metaphysics|Bolzano]] in the early 1800s, it was [[Ernst Mally]], a pupil of [[Alexius Meinong]], who was to propose the first formal deontic system in his ''Grundgesetze des Sollens'', based on the syntax of Whitehead's and Russell's [[propositional calculus]].

Another logical system founded after World War II was [[fuzzy logic]] by Azerbaijani mathematician [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] in 1965.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">'''Hume's principle''' or '''HP'''—the terms were coined by [[George Boolos]]—says that the number of ''F''s is equal to the number of ''G''s if and only if there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] (a [[bijection]]) between the ''F''s and the ''G''s. HP can be stated formally in systems of [[second-order logic]]. Hume's principle is named for the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].

HP plays a central role in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions [[logical consequence|entail]] all axioms of what we now call [[second-order arithmetic]]. This result is known as [[Frege's theorem]], which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as [[Logicism#Neo-logicism|neo-logicism]].

== Origins ==
Hume's principle appears in Frege's ''Foundations of Arithmetic'' (§73), which quotes from Part III of Book I of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1740). Hume there sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas. Concerning one of these, [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] in [[quantity]] or [[number]], Hume argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by [[geometry]], can never achieve "perfect precision and exactness", since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or [[arithmetic]], in which such a precision ''can'' be attained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Algebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. ''When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal''; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note Hume's use of the word ''[[number]]'' in the ancient sense, to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of "positive integer". The ancient Greek notion of number (''arithmos'') is of a finite plurality composed of units. See [[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1020a14 and [[Euclid]], ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).

== Influence on set theory ==
The principle that [[cardinal number]] was to be characterized in terms of [[one-to-one correspondence]] had previously been used to great effect by [[Georg Cantor]], whose writings [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume's principle ought better be called "Cantor's Principle". But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines [[cardinal number]]s in terms of [[ordinal number]]s, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor's point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of [[transfinite number]]s, as developed in [[axiomatic set theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">In [[mathematics]], in the study of [[fractal]]s, a '''Hutchinson operator'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hutchinson | first=John E. | title=Fractals and self similarity | journal=Indiana Univ. Math. J. | volume=30 | year=1981 | pages=713–747 | doi=10.1512/iumj.1981.30.30055 | issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the collective action of a set of contractions, called an [[iterated function system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barnsley | first=Michael F. | author2=Stephen Demko | title=Iterated function systems and the global construction of fractals | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume=399 | year=1985 | pages=243–275 | issue=1817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iterated function|iteration]] of the operator converges to a unique [[attractor]], which is the often [[self-similar]] fixed set of the operator.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\{f_i : X \to X\ |\ 1\leq i \leq N\}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[iterated function system]], or a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[contraction mapping|contractions]] from a [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  The operator &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is defined over subsets &lt;math&gt;S\subset X&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;H(S) = \bigcup_{i=1}^N f_i(S).\,&lt;/math&gt;

A key question is to describe the attractors &lt;math&gt;A=H(A)&lt;/math&gt; of this operator, which are compact sets. One way of generating such a set is to start with an initial compact set &lt;math&gt;S_0\subset X&lt;/math&gt; (which can be a single point, called a seed) and iterate &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; as follows

:&lt;math&gt;S_{n+1} = H(S_n) = \bigcup_{i=1}^N f_i(S_n) &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the limit, the iteration converges to the attractor

:&lt;math&gt;A = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n . &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
Hutchinson showed in 1981 the existence and uniqueness of the attractor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The proof follows by showing that the Hutchinson operator is contractive on the set of compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Hausdorff distance]].

The collection of functions &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; together with composition form a [[monoid]]. With ''N'' functions, then one may visualize the monoid as a full [[k-ary tree|N-ary tree]] or a [[Cayley tree]].

[[Isomorphism (crystallography)|Isomorphous]] when used in the relation to [[crystal structure]]s is not synonymous: in addition to the same atomic connectivity that characterises isostructural compounds, isomorphous substances crystallise in the same [[space group]] and have the same [[unit cell]] dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=A.F|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry|edition=3rd.|year=1962|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-855125-8}} p 182&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union of Crystallography|IUCR]] definition&lt;ref&gt;IUCR Online Dictionary of CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, "Isostructural crystals", [http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Isostructural_crystals]&lt;/ref&gt; used by crystallographers is:
{{quotation|Two crystals are said to be isostructural, if they have the same structure, but not necessarily the same cell dimensions nor the same chemical composition, and with a 'comparable' variability in the atomic coordinates to that of the cell dimensions and chemical composition. For instance, calcite CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, sodium nitrate NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and iron borate FeBO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are isostructural. One also speaks of isostructural series, or of isostructural polymorphs or isostructural phase transitions. The term isotypic is synonymous with isostructural.}}

Examples include:
*I-[[Gold(I) bromide]] is isostructural with [[gold(I) chloride]]
*[[Borazine]] is isostructural with [[benzene]]
*[[Indium(I) bromide]] is isostructural with β-[[thallium(I) iodide]] and has a distorted rock salt structure.

Many minerals are isostructural when they differ only in the nature of a cation.

Compounds which are [[isoelectronic]] usually have similar chemical structures. For example, [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the [[ammonium]] ion, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, are isoelectric and are isostructural 
as both have a [[tetrahedral]] structure. The C-H and N-H bond lengths are different and crystal structures are completely different because the ammonium ion only occurs in [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26489">In [[mathematics]], an '''iterated function''' is a function {{math|''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} (that is, a function from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}} to itself) which is obtained  by [[function composition|composing]] another function {{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} with itself a certain number of times. The process of repeatedly applying the same function is called [[iteration]]. In this process, starting from some initial number, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated.

Iterated functions are objects of study in [[computer science]], [[fractals]],  [[dynamical system]]s, mathematics and [[renormalization group]] physics.

==Definition==
The formal definition of an iterated function on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' follows.

Let {{mvar|''X''}} be a set and {{math|''f:  X → X''}} be a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

Define {{math| ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  as the ''n''-th iterate  of {{mvar|''f''}}, where ''n'' is a non-negative integer, by:

:: &lt;math&gt;f^0 ~   \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}  ~ \operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt;
and
:: &lt;math&gt;f^{n+1} ~ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} ~ f \circ f^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|''X''}} and {{math|''f''○''g''}}  denotes [[function composition]]. That is, 
::{{math|(''f''○''g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''g''(''x''))}}, 
always [[associative]].

Because the notation  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may refer to both iteration (composition) of the function {{mvar|''f''}} or [[Exponentiation#Exponential notation for function names|exponentiation of the function]] {{mvar|''f''}} (the latter is commonly used in [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometry]]), some mathematicians choose to write  {{math|''f'' °&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the ''n''-th iterate  of the function {{mvar|''f''}}.

==Abelian property and iteration sequences==
In general, the following identity holds for all non-negative integers {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}},

: &lt;math&gt;f^{m} \circ f^{n} =   f^{n} \circ f^{m} = f^{m+n}~.&lt;/math&gt;

This is structurally identical to the property of [[exponentiation]] that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, i.e. the special case {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}''ax''}}.

In general, for arbitrary general (negative, non-integer, etc.) indices {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}, this relation is called the '''translation functional equation''', cf. [[Schröder's equation]] and [[Abel equation]]. On a logarithmic scale, this reduces to the '''nesting property''' of [[Chebyshev polynomials]],   {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')){{=}}''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}, since  {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} cos(''n'' arcos(''x'' ))}}.

The relation  {{math|(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} (''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} also holds, analogous to the property of exponentiation that  {{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}}(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The sequence of functions  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called a '''Picard sequence''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Functional equations in a single variable |last=Kuczma |first=Marek| authorlink=Marek Kuczma|series=Monografie Matematyczne |year=1968 |publisher=PWN – Polish Scientific Publishers |location=Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iterative Functional Equations| last=Kuczma| first=M., Choczewski B., and Ger, R. |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-35561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Charles Émile Picard]].

For a given {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, the [[sequence]] of values  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is called the '''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''' of {{mvar|x}}.

If  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'') {{=}}  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'')}} for some integer {{mvar|m}}, the orbit is called a '''periodic orbit'''.  The smallest such value of {{mvar|m}} for a given {{mvar|x}} is called the '''period of the orbit'''. The point {{mvar|x}} itself is called a [[periodic point]]. The [[cycle detection]] problem in computer science is the [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding the first periodic point in an orbit, and the period of the orbit.

==Fixed points==

If ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' for some ''x'' in ''X'' (that is, the period of the orbit of ''x'' is 1), then ''x'' is called a '''[[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]''' of the iterated sequence.  The set of fixed points is often denoted as '''Fix'''(''f'' ).  There exist a number of [[fixed-point theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of fixed points in various situations, including the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] and the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

There are several techniques for [[convergence acceleration]] of the sequences produced by [[fixed point iteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carleson|first=L.
|last2= Gamelin|first2= T. D. W.|title=Complex dynamics|series=Universitext: Tracts in Mathematics|publisher= Springer-Verlag|year=1993 
|isbn=0-387-97942-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Aitken method]] applied to an iterated fixed point is known as [[Steffensen's method]], and produces quadratic convergence.

==Limiting behaviour==

Upon iteration, one may find that there are sets that shrink and converge towards a single point. In such a case, the point that is converged to is known as an [[attractive fixed point]]. Conversely, iteration may give the appearance of points diverging away from a single point; this would be the case for an [[unstable fixed point]].&lt;ref&gt;Istratescu, Vasile  (1981). ''Fixed Point Theory, An Introduction'',  D. Reidel, Holland.  {{ISBN|90-277-1224-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
When the points of the orbit converge to one or more limits, the set of [[accumulation point]]s of the orbit is known as the '''[[limit set]]''' or the '''ω-limit set'''.

The ideas of attraction and repulsion generalize similarly; one may categorize iterates into [[stable manifold|stable set]]s and [[unstable set]]s, according to the behaviour of small [[neighborhood]]s under iteration. (Also see [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]].)

Other limiting behaviours are possible; for example, [[wandering point]]s are points that move away, and never come back even close to where they started.

==Invariant measure==
If one considers the evolution of a density distribution, rather than that of individual point dynamics, then the limiting behavior is given by the [[invariant measure]]. It can be visualized as the behavior of a point-cloud or dust-cloud under repeated iteration. The invariant measure is a eigenstate of the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator or [[transfer operator]], corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1. Smaller eigenvalues correspond to unstable, decaying states.

In general, because repeated iteration corresponds to a shift, the transfer operator, and its adjoint, the [[Koopman operator]] can both be interpreted as [[shift operator]]s action on a [[shift space]].  The theory of [[subshifts of finite type]] provides general insight into many iterated functions, especially those leading to chaos.

==Fractional iterates and flows, and negative iterates==

In some instances,&lt;ref&gt;The notion {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be used with care when the equation {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}  has multiple solutions, which is normally the case, as in [[Functional square root|Babbage's equation]] of the functional roots of the identity map. For example, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''−6}}, both {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 6−2''x''}} and {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''−2}} are  solutions; so the expression {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} doesn't denote a unique function, just as algebraic roots of numbers are multiple. The issue is quite similar to [[division by zero#In algebra|division by zero]]. The roots chosen are normally the ones belonging to the orbit under study.&lt;/ref&gt; fractional iteration of a function can be defined:  for instance, a [[functional square root|half iterate]] of a function {{mvar|f}} is a function {{mvar|''g''}} such that {{math|''g''(''g''(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}. This function {{math|''g''(''x'')}} can be written using the index notation as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} . Similarly, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the function defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅔&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} may be defined equal to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}, and so forth, all based on the principle, mentioned earlier, that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt;○''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This idea can be generalized so that the iteration count {{mvar|n}} becomes a '''continuous parameter''', a sort of continuous "time" of a continuous [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]].

In such cases, one refers to the system as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], specified by [[Schröder's equation]]. (cf. Section on [[#Conjugacy|conjugacy]] below.)

Negative iterates correspond to function inverses and their compositions. For example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the normal inverse of {{mvar|f}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the inverse composed with itself, i.e. {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}. Fractional negative iterates are defined analogously to fractional positive ones; for example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}}  ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, or, equivalently, such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; 0&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}}.

== Some formulas for fractional iteration==

One of several methods of finding a series formula for fractional iteration, making use of a fixed point, is as follows.

# First determine a fixed point for the function such that {{math|''f''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} .
# Define   {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} for all ''n'' belonging to the reals. This, in some ways, is the most natural extra condition to place upon the fractional iterates.
# Expand {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'')}}   around the fixed point ''a'' as a [[Taylor series]],
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = f^n(a) + (x-a)\frac{d}{dx}f^n(x)|_{x=a} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f^n(x)|_{x=a} +\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Expand out
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = f^n(a) + (x-a) f'(a)f'(f(a))f'(f^2(a))\cdots f'(f^{n-1}(a)) + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#  Substitute in for   {{math|''f  &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}} ''a''}}, for any ''k'', 
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\left(1+f'(a)+\cdots+f'(a)^{n-1}  \right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Make use of the [[geometric progression]] to simplify terms,
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\frac{f'(a)^n-1}{f'(a)-1}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#* There is a special case when {{math|''f'' '(a){{=}}1}},
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = x  + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(n f''(a))+ \frac{(x-a)^3}6\left(\frac{3}{2}n(n-1) f''(a)^2 + n f'''(a)\right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# When ''n'' is not an integer, make use of the power formula {{math| ''y'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} exp(''n'' ln(''y''))}}.
This can be carried on indefinitely, although inefficiently, as the latter terms become increasingly complicated.
A more systematic procedure is outlined in the following section on '''Conjugacy'''.

===Example 1===
For example, setting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''Cx''+''D''}}  gives the fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''D''/(1-''C'')}}, so  the above formula terminates to just
:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x)=\frac{D}{1-C} + (x-\frac{D}{1-C})C^n=C^nx+\frac{1-C^n}{1-C}D ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is trivial to check.

===Example 2===
Find the value of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} }&lt;/math&gt; where this is done ''n'' times (and possibly the interpolated values when ''n'' is not an integer). We have {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A fixed point is {{math|''a''{{=}}''f''(2){{=}}2}}.

So set ''x''=1 and {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (1)}} expanded around the fixed point value of 2 is then an infinite series,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} } = f^n(1) = 2  - (\ln 2)^n +  \frac{(\ln 2)^{n+1}((\ln 2)^n-1)}{4(\ln 2-1)} - \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
which, taking just the first three terms, is correct to the first decimal place when ''n'' is positive&amp;mdash;cf. [[Tetration]]: {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(1) {{=}} &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;{{sqrt|2}} }}. (Using the other fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''f''(4) {{=}} 4}} causes the series to diverge.)

For {{math| ''n'' {{=}} −1}}, the series computes the inverse function,  {{math| 2 ln''x''/ln 2}}.

===Example 3===
With the function   {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, expand around the fixed point 1 to get the series
: &lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = 1 + b^n(x-1) + \frac{1}2b^{n}(b^n-1)(x-1)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}b^n (b^n-1)(b^n-2)(x-1)^3 + \cdots  ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is simply the Taylor series of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;/sup&gt; expanded around 1.

==Conjugacy==

If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two iterated functions, and there exists a [[homeomorphism]] {{mvar|h}} such that  {{math| ''g'' {{=}}  ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''f'' ○ ''h'' }},  then {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are said to be [[Topological conjugacy|topologically conjugate]].

Clearly, topological conjugacy is preserved under iteration, as {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;{{=}}''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  ○  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''h''}}.  Thus, if one can solve for one iterated function system, one also  has solutions for all topologically conjugate systems. For example, the [[tent map]] is topologically conjugate to the [[logistic map]]. As a special case, taking {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''+1}}, one has the iteration of {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'')+1)}} as 
:{{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'') + ''n'')}},  &amp;nbsp;  for any function {{mvar|h}}.

Making the substitution {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'') {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y'')}} yields 
:{{math|''g''(''ϕ''(''y'')) {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y''+1)}},  &amp;nbsp; a form known as the [[Abel equation]].

Even in the absence of a strict homeomorphism, near a fixed point, here taken to be at {{mvar|x}} = 0, {{mvar|f}}(0) = 0, one may often solve&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, Tosihusa  (1971). "On the Iteration of Analytic Functions",  [http://www.math.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp/~fe/ ''Funkcialaj Ekvacioj''] '''14''', 197-238.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schröder's equation]] for a function  {{mvar|Ψ}}, which makes {{math|''f''(''x'')}} locally conjugate to a mere dilation, {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' '(0) ''x''}}, that is  
:{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}}  ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)  ''Ψ''(''x''))}}.

Thus, its iteration orbit, or flow, under suitable provisions (e.g., {{math|''f'' '(0) ≠ 1}}), amounts to the conjugate of the orbit of the monomial, 
:{{math|''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}},  
where {{mvar|n}} in this expression serves as a plain exponent: ''functional iteration has been reduced to multiplication!''  Here, however, the exponent {{mvar|n}} no longer needs be integer or positive, and is a continuous "time" of evolution for the full orbit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtright |first=T.L. |authorlink=Thomas Curtright|author2=Zachos, C.K. |authorlink2=Cosmas Zachos | year=2009|title=Evolution Profiles and Functional Equations |journal=Journal of Physics A |volume=42|issue=48 |pages=485208|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/42/48/485208|arxiv=0909.2424|bibcode=2009JPhA...42V5208C}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[monoid]] of the Picard sequence (cf. [[transformation semigroup]]) has generalized to a full [[continuous group]].&lt;ref&gt;For explicit instance, example 2 above amounts to just {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;((ln2)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}}, for ''any n'', not necessarily integer, where {{mvar|''Ψ''}} is the solution of the relevant [[Schröder's equation]], {{math|''Ψ''({{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;){{=}} ln2 ''Ψ''(''x'')}}. This solution is also the infinite ''m'' limit of {{math|(''f'' &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') −2)/(ln2)&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Half-iterate (&lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;), i.e., the sine's functional square root; the functional square root of that, the quarter-iterate (black) above it; and further fractional iterates up to the 1/64th. The functions below the (&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;)  sine are six integral iterates below it, starting with the second iterate (&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;) and ending with the 64th iterate. The &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; envelope triangle represents the limiting null iterate, the sawtooth function serving as the starting point leading to the sine function. The dashed line is the negative first iterate, i.e. the inverse of sine (arcsin).

]]

This method (perturbative determination of the principal [[eigenfunction]] {{mvar|Ψ}}, cf. [[Carleman matrix]]) is equivalent to the algorithm of the preceding section, albeit, in practice,  more powerful and systematic.

==Markov chains==
If the function is linear and can be described by a [[stochastic matrix]], that is, a matrix whose rows or columns sum to one, then the iterated system is known as a [[Markov chain]].

==Examples==
There are [[List of chaotic maps|many chaotic maps]]. 
Well-known iterated functions include the [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[iterated function systems]].

[[Ernst Schröder]],&lt;ref name="schr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schröder |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Schröder |year=1870 |title=Ueber iterirte Functionen|journal=Math. Ann. |volume=3 |issue= 2|pages=296&amp;ndash;322 | doi=10.1007/BF01443992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1870, worked out special cases of the [[logistic map]], such as the chaotic case {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''(1−''x'')}}, so that {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} arcsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{radic|''x''}})}}, hence {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  arcsin({{radic|''x''}}))}}.

A nonchaotic case  Schröder also illustrated with his method,  {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''(1 − ''x'')}}, yielded  {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} ln(1−2''x'')}}, and hence  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}((1−2''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;−1)}}.

If {{mvar|''f''}} is the [[group action|action]] of a group element on a set, then the iterated function corresponds to a [[free group]].

Most functions do not have explicit general [[closed-form expression]]s for the ''n''-th iterate. The table below lists some&lt;ref name="schr"/&gt; that do. Note that all these expressions are valid even for non-integer and negative ''n'', as well as positive integer ''n''.

Note: these two special cases of {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c''}} are the only cases that have a closed-form solution. Choosing ''b'' = 2 = –''a'' and ''b'' = 4 = –''a'', respectively, further reduces them to the nonchaotic and chaotic logistic cases discussed prior to the table.

Some of these examples are related among themselves by simple conjugacies. A few further examples, essentially amounting to simple conjugacies of Schröder's examples  can be found in ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Katsura | first1 = S. | last2 = Fukuda | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1016/0378-4371(85)90048-2 | title = Exactly solvable models showing chaotic behavior | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 597 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1985PhyA..130..597K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of study==
Iterated functions can be studied with the [[Artin–Mazur zeta function]] and with [[transfer operator]]s.

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], iterated functions occur as a special case of [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]], which in turn anchor the study of such broad topics as [[lambda calculus]], or narrower ones, such as the [[denotational semantics]] of computer programs.

==Definitions in terms of iterated functions==
Two important [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]] can be defined in terms of iterated functions. These are [[summation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\sum_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x+g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the equivalent product:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\prod_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,1\}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Functional derivative==
The [[functional derivative]] of an iterated function is given by the recursive formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \delta f^N(x)}{\delta f(y)} = f'( f^{N-1}(x) ) \frac{ \delta f^{N-1}(x)}{\delta f(y)} + \delta( f^{N-1}(x) - y ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Lie's data transport equation==
Iterated functions crop up in the series expansion of combined functions, such as  {{math|''g''(''f''(''x''))}}.

Given the [[Koenigs function#Structure of univalent semigroups|iteration velocity]], or [[beta function (physics)]],  
:&lt;math&gt;v(x)=\partial f^n(x)  / \partial n |_{n=0}&lt;/math&gt; 
for the {{mvar|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; iterate of the function {{mvar|f}}, we have&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berkson | first1 = E. | last2 = Porta | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1307/mmj/1029002009 | title = Semigroups of analytic functions and composition operators | journal = The Michigan Mathematical Journal | volume = 25 | pages = 101 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}  {{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C. K. | doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/43/44/445101 | title = Chaotic maps, Hamiltonian flows and holographic methods | journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical | volume = 43 | issue = 44 | pages = 445101 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1002.0104 | bibcode = 2010JPhA...43R5101C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
g(f(x)) = \exp\left[ v(x) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \right] g(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
For example, for rigid advection, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' + ''t''}}, then {{math|''v''(''x'') {{=}} ''t''}}.  Consequently,  {{math|''g''(''x'' + ''t'') {{=}} exp(''t'' ∂/∂''x'')  ''g''(''x'')}}, action by a plain [[shift operator]].

Conversely, one may   specify {{math|''f''(''x'')}}  given an arbitrary {{math|''v''(''x'')}}, through the generic [[Abel equation]]  discussed above,
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = h^{-1}(h(x)+1) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
h(x) = \int{\frac{1}{v(x)}dx} .
&lt;/math&gt;
This is evident by noting that 
:&lt;math&gt;f^n(x)=h^{-1}(h(x)+n)~.&lt;/math&gt;

For continuous iteration index {{mvar|t}}, then, now written as a subscript, this amounts to Lie's celebrated exponential realization of a continuous group,
:&lt;math&gt;e^{t~\frac{\partial ~~}{\partial h(x)}} g(x)= g(h^{-1}(h(x )+t))= g(f_t(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
The initial flow velocity {{mvar|v}} suffices to determine the entire flow, given this exponential realization which automatically provides the  general solution to the ''translation functional equation'',&lt;ref  name="acz"&gt;Aczel, J (2006), ''Lectures on Functional 
Equations and Their Applications'' (Dover Books on Mathematics, 2006), Ch. 6, {{ISBN|978-0486445236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;f_t(f_\tau (x))=f_{t+\tau} (x)  ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In algebra, a '''j-multiplicity''' is a generalization of a [[Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity]]. For ''m''-primary ideals, the two notions coincide.&lt;!-- It was introduced by Achilles and Manaresi in 1993, and has an application to the study of singularities in algebraic varieties.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(R, \mathfrak{m})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[local ring|local]] [[Noetherian ring]] of [[Krull dimension]] &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the '''j-multiplicity''' of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' is
:&lt;math&gt;j(I) = j(\operatorname{gr}_I R)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;j(\operatorname{gr}_I R)&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized coefficient of the degree ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 term in the Hilbert polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\mathfrak{m}(\operatorname{gr}_I R)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; means the space of sections supported at &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Biography==
Bourgain received his Ph.D. from the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] in 1977.

His work is in various areas of [[mathematical analysis]] such as the [[geometry]] of [[Banach space]]s, [[harmonic analysis]], [[analytic number theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[ergodic theory]], [[partial differential equations]], [[spectral theory]] and recently also in [[group theory]]. He has been recognised by a number of awards, most notably the [[Fields Medal]] in 1994.

In 2000 Bourgain connected the [[Kakeya set|Kakeya problem]] to [[arithmetic combinatorics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. |last=Bourgain |chapter=Harmonic analysis and combinatorics: How much may they contribute to each other? |title=Mathematics: Frontiers and Perspectives |publisher=IMU/Amer.

'''Johannes Franciscus Abraham Karel (Johan) van Benthem''' (born 12 June 1949 in [[Rijswijk]]) is a University Professor 
(''[[universiteitshoogleraar]]'') of [[logic]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] at the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] and [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Stanford University]] (at [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]]). He was awarded the [[Spinozapremie]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/1996 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 1996 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elected a Foreign Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2015.

He studied [[physics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] 1969), [[philosophy]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] 1972) and [[mathematics]] ([[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] 1973) at the University of Amsterdam and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the same university under supervision of [[Martin Löb]] in 1977. Before becoming University Professor in 2003, he held appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1973–1977), at the [[University of Groningen]] (1977–1986), and as a [[professor]] at the University of Amsterdam (1986–2003).

In 1992 he was elected member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/3856 |title=Johan van Benthem |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Benthem is known for his research in the area of [[modal logic]]. This research has resulted in [[Van Benthem's Theorem]], which states that propositional modal logic is the fragment of [[first-order logic]] that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed under]] [[bisimulation]].

He has also been active in the fields of [[philosophy of science]], logical structures in natural language ([[generalized quantifier]]s, [[categorial grammar]], substructural [[proof theory]]), [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and [[update logic]] and applications of [[logic]] to [[game theory]] as well as applications of [[game theory]] to [[logic]] ([[game semantics]]). Van Benthem is a member of the group collectively publishing under the [[pseudonym]] [[L. T. F. Gamut]]. He has also taught in China. He made an effort to encourage and organize international collaboration between Chinese and Western logicians.

Professor van Benthem retired from the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] in  September 2014.

A '''jump process''' is a type of [[stochastic]] process that has discrete movements, called [[jump discontinuity|jumps]], with random arrival times, rather than continuous movement, typically modelled as a [[Poisson point process|simple]] or  [[Poisson point process#Compound Poisson point process|compound Poisson]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Tankov, P. (2003). Financial modelling with jump processes (Vol. 2). CRC press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], various stochastic models are used to model the price movements of [[financial instrument]]s; for example the [[Black–Scholes]] model for pricing options assumes that the underlying instrument follows a traditional [[diffusion process]], with continuous, random movements at all scales, no matter how small. [[John Carrington Cox]] and [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = J. C. | authorlink1 = John Carrington Cox| last2 = Ross | first2 = S.

[[Robert C. Merton]] extended this approach to a hybrid model known as [[Jump-diffusion models|jump diffusion]], which states that the prices have large jumps interspersed with small continuous movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Lie–Palais theorem''' states that an [[group action|action]] of a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth]] [[compact manifold]] can be lifted to an action of a finite-dimensional [[Lie group]]. For manifolds with boundary the action must preserve the boundary, in other words the vector fields on the boundary must be tangent to the boundary.  {{harvs|txt|last=Palais|year=1957|authorlink=Richard Palais}} proved it as a global form of an earlier local theorem due to [[Sophus Lie]].

The example of the [[vector field]] ''d''/''dx'' on the open [[unit interval]] shows that the result is false for non-compact manifolds.

Without the assumption that the Lie algebra is finite dimensional the result can be false. {{harvtxt|Milnor|1984|loc=p. 1048}} gives the following example due to Omori: the Lie algebra is all vector fields ''f''(''x'',''y'')∂/∂''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''(''x'',''y'')∂/∂y acting on the torus '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''g''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/2. This Lie algebra is not the Lie algebra of any group. {{harvtxt|Pestov|1995}} gives an infinite dimensional generalization of the Lie–Palais theorem for Banach–Lie algebras with finite-dimensional center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13833">In mathematics, '''lifting theory''' was first introduced by [[John von Neumann]] in his (1931) pioneering paper (answering a question raised by [[Alfréd Haar]]),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J.: Algebraische Repräsentanten der Funktionen bis auf eine Menge von Maße Null. J. Crelle '''165''', 109–115 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by Dorothy Maharam’s (1958) paper,&lt;ref&gt;Maharam, D.: On a theorem of von Neumann. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. '''9''', 987–995 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Alexandra_Bellow|A. Ionescu Tulcea]] and [[:de:Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea|C. Ionescu Tulcea]]’s (1961) paper.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ionescu Tulcea and C. Ionescu Tulcea: On the lifting property, I., J. Math. Anal. App. '''3''', 537–546 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Lifting theory was motivated to a large extent by its striking applications; for its development up to 1969, see the Ionescu Tulceas' work and the monograph,&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea and Cassius Ionescu Tulcea, ''Topics in the Theory of Lifting'', Ergebnisse der Mathematik, Vol. 48, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; now a standard reference in the field. Lifting theory continued to develop after 1969, yielding significant new results and applications.

A '''lifting''' on a [[measure space]] (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is a linear and multiplicative inverse

:&lt;math&gt; T:L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)\to \mathcal L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

of the quotient map

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\mathcal L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)\to L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu) \\
 f\mapsto [f]\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is the seminormed [[Lp_space |L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space]] of measurable functions and &lt;math&gt; L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is its usual normed quotient. In other words, a lifting picks from every equivalence class [''f''] of bounded measurable functions modulo negligible functions a representative&amp;mdash; which is henceforth written ''T''([''f'']) or ''T''[''f''] or simply ''Tf'' &amp;mdash; in such a way that

:&lt;math&gt;T(r[f]+s[g])(p)=rT[f](p) + sT[g](p), \qquad \forall p\in X, r,s\in \mathbf R;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T([f]\times[g])(p)=T[f](p)\times T[g](p), \qquad \forall p\in X;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T[1]=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Liftings are used to produce [[Disintegration theorem|disintegrations of measures]], for instance [[conditional probability distribution]]s given continuous random variables, and fibrations of Lebesgue measure on the level sets of a function. 
&lt;!--
==Properties of liftings==
A lifting is necessarily positive:
:&lt;math&gt;[f]\ge0\implies T[f]\ge0 \mathrm{\ (since\ } [f] \mathrm{\ is\ a\ square)} &lt;/math&gt;

and an isometry:&lt;ref&gt;The ''essential supremum'' of a class [''f''] of ''μ''-measurable functions is the smallest number α for which the set [''f'' &gt; α] is ''μ''-negligible.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \big\Vert T[f]\big\Vert_\infty:= \sup_{p\in X}\,\big|T[f](p)\big|=\mathrm{ess.sup}\,\big|[f]\big|.&lt;/math&gt;

For every point ''p'' in ''X'', the map &lt;math&gt;[f]\mapsto T_pf:= T[f](p)&lt;/math&gt; is a character&lt;ref name=character&gt; A ''character'' on a unital algebra is a multiplicative linear functional with values in the coefficient field that maps the unit to 1.&lt;/ref&gt; of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', Σ, ''μ'').
--&gt;

==Existence of liftings==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' Suppose (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is complete.&lt;ref&gt;A subset ''N'' ⊂ ''X'' is locally negligible if it intersects every integrable set in Σ in a subset of a negligible set of Σ. (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is ''complete'' if every locally negligible set is negligible and belongs to Σ.&lt;/ref&gt; Then (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') admits a lifting if and only if there exists a collection of mutually disjoint integrable sets in Σ whose union is&amp;nbsp;''X''.

In particular, if (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is the completion of a ''σ''-finite&lt;ref&gt;i.e., there exists a countable collection of integrable sets &amp;ndash; sets of finite measure in Σ &amp;ndash; that covers the underlying set ''X''.&lt;/ref&gt; measure or of an inner regular Borel measure on a locally compact space, then (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') admits a lifting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proof consists in extending a lifting to ever larger sub-''σ''-algebras, applying [[Doob's martingale convergence theorems|Doob's martingale convergence theorem]] if one encounters a countable chain in the process.

&lt;!-- 
Here are the details. Henceforth write ''Tf'' := ''T''[''f''] = ''T''([''f'']). (Σ, ''μ'') is ''σ''-finite if there exists a countable collection of sets of finite measure in Σ whose union has negligible complement. This permits a reduction to the case that the measure ''μ'' is finite, in fact, it may be taken to be a probability. The proof uses [[Zorn's lemma]] together with the following order on pairs &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak A,T_{\mathfrak A})&lt;/math&gt; of sub-''σ''-algebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A&lt;/math&gt; of Σ and liftings &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathfrak A}&lt;/math&gt; for them: &lt;math&gt; (\mathfrak A,T_{\mathfrak A})\le(\mathfrak B,T_{\mathfrak B}) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A\subseteq\mathfrak B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathfrak A}&lt;/math&gt; is the restriction of &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathfrak B}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;L^\infty(X,\mathfrak A,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;. It is to be shown that a chain &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt; of such pairs has an upper bound, and that a maximal pair, which then exists by Zorn's lemma, has Σ for its first entry.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt; has no countable [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] subset, then the union &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak U:=\bigcup\{\mathfrak A:\,(\mathfrak A,T_{\mathfrak A}) \in \mathfrak C\} &lt;/math&gt; is a ''σ''-algebra and there is an obvious lifting &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathfrak U}&lt;/math&gt; for it that restricts to the liftings of the chain; &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak U,T_{\mathfrak U})&lt;/math&gt; is the sought upper bound of the chain.

The argument is more complicated when the chain &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt; has a countable cofinal subset &lt;math&gt;\left\{(\mathfrak A_n,T_{\mathfrak A_n}), n = 1, 2, \ldots \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak U&lt;/math&gt; be the  [[Sigma-algebra|''σ''-algebra generated]] by the union &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\{\mathfrak A_n: \, n = 1, 2, \ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;, which is generally only an [[Field of sets|algebra of sets]]. For the construction of &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathfrak U}&lt;/math&gt; it is convenient to identify a set ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' with its indicator function and to write &lt;math&gt;TA:=TI_A=T[I_A]&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathfrak U&lt;/math&gt; let ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the [[conditional expectation]] of ''A'' under &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak A_n&lt;/math&gt;. By [[Doob's martingale convergence theorems|Doob's martingale convergence theorem]] the set ''θ''(''A'')of points where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to 1 differs negligibly from&amp;nbsp;''A''.

Here are a few facts that are straightforward to check (some use the completeness and finiteness of &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt; \tau:=\{\theta(A)\setminus N \ : \ A\in\mathfrak U, \mu(N)=0\}\subset\mathfrak U&lt;/math&gt;
is a topology whose only negligible open set is the empty set and such that every &lt;math&gt; A=I_A\in\mathfrak U&lt;/math&gt; is almost everywhere continuous, to wit, on &lt;math&gt; A\cap\theta(A)&lt;/math&gt; and on &lt;math&gt; A^c\cap\theta(A^c)&lt;/math&gt;. Then every &lt;math&gt;f \in\mathcal L^\infty(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, being the uniform limit of a sequence of step functions over &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak U&lt;/math&gt;, is almost everywhere continuous in this topology. For ''p'' in ''X''

:&lt;math&gt; I_p:=\{[f]: f \text{ is continuous at } p \text{ and }f(p)=0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

is a proper ideal of &lt;math&gt; L^\infty(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, contained (by another application of Zorn's lemma) in some maximal proper ideal &lt;math&gt; J_p\subset L^\infty(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, which has codimension 1. The quotient map &lt;math&gt;L^\infty(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)\to L^\infty(X,\mathfrak U,\mu)/J_p&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a character&lt;ref name=character/&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Defining

:&lt;math&gt; \left(T_{\mathfrak U}[f]\right)(p):=T_p[f]\;\;,\;\;\;\;\;\;p\in E,&lt;/math&gt;

provides the upper bound &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak U,T_{\mathfrak U})&lt;/math&gt; for the chain &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt;.

In either case the chain &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak C&lt;/math&gt; therefore has an upper bound. By Zorn's lemma there is a maximal pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak U,T_{\mathfrak U})&lt;/math&gt;,
and a small additional calculation shows that &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak U=\mathfrak F&lt;/math&gt;. END OF DETAILED PROOF--&gt;

== Strong liftings ==
Suppose (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is complete and ''X'' is equipped with a completely regular Hausdorff topology τ ⊂ Σ such that the union of any collection of negligible open sets is again negligible &amp;ndash; this is the case if (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is ''σ''-finite or comes from a Radon measure. Then the ''support'' of ''μ'', Supp(''μ''), can be defined as the complement of the largest negligible open subset, and the collection ''C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'', ''τ'') of bounded continuous functions belongs to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''strong lifting''' for (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') is a lifting 
:&lt;math&gt; T:L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)\to \mathcal L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; 
such that ''Tφ'' = ''φ'' on Supp(''μ'') for all φ in ''C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'', τ). This is the same as requiring that&lt;ref&gt;''U'', Supp(''μ'') are identified with their indicator functions.&lt;/ref&gt; ''TU'' ≥ (''U'' ∩ Supp(''μ'')) for all open sets ''U'' in&amp;nbsp;''τ''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' If (Σ, ''μ'') is ''σ''-finite and complete and ''τ'' has a countable basis then (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') admits a strong lifting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Proof.''' Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a lifting for (''X'', Σ, ''μ'') and {''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} a countable basis for ''τ''. For any point ''p'' in the negligible set

:&lt;math&gt;N:=\bigcup\nolimits _n \left\{p\in \mathrm{Supp}(\mu): (T_0U_n)(p)&lt;U_n(p) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

let ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' be any character&lt;ref name=character&gt;A ''character'' on a unital algebra is a multiplicative linear functional with values in the coefficient field that maps the unit to 1.&lt;/ref&gt; on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', Σ, ''μ'') that extends the character φ ↦ φ(''p'') of ''C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'', τ). Then for ''p'' in ''X'' and [''f''] in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', Σ, ''μ'') define:

:&lt;math&gt; (T[f])(p):= \begin{cases} (T_0[f])(p)&amp; p\notin N\\
T_p[f]&amp; p\in N.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

''T'' is the desired strong lifting.

==Application: disintegration of a measure==
Suppose (''X'', Σ, ''μ''), (''Y'', Φ, ν) are ''σ''-finite measure spaces (''μ'', ''ν'' positive) and ''π'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a measurable map. A '''disintegration of ''μ'' along ''π'' with respect to ''ν''''' is a slew &lt;math&gt;Y\ni y\mapsto \lambda_y&lt;/math&gt; of positive ''σ''-additive measures on (''X'', Σ) such that

#λ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is carried by the fiber &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(\{y\})&lt;/math&gt; of π over ''y'':
:::&lt;math&gt; \{y\}\in\Phi\;\;\mathrm{ and }\;\; \lambda_y\left((X\setminus \pi^{-1}(\{y\})\right)=0 \qquad \forall y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;
#for every ''μ''-integrable function ''f'',
:::&lt;math&gt; \int_X f(p)\;\mu(dp)= \int_Y \left(\int_{\pi^{-1}(\{y\})}f(p)\,\lambda_y(dp)\right) \nu(dy) \qquad (*)&lt;/math&gt;
::in the sense that, for ''ν''-almost all ''y'' in ''Y'', ''f'' is ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;-integrable, the function 
:::&lt;math&gt; y\mapsto \int_{\pi^{-1}(\{y\})} f(p)\,\lambda_y(dp) &lt;/math&gt; 
::is ν-integrable, and the displayed equality (*) holds.

[[Disintegration theorem|Disintegrations]] exist in various circumstances, the proofs varying but almost all using strong liftings. Here is a rather general result. Its short proof gives the general flavor.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem.''' Suppose ''X'' is a Polish&lt;ref&gt;A separable space is ''Polish'' if its topology comes from a complete metric. In the present situation it would be sufficient to require that ''X'' is ''Suslin'', i.e., is the continuous Hausdorff image of a polish space.&lt;/ref&gt; space and ''Y'' a separable Hausdorff space, both equipped with their Borel ''σ''-algebras. Let ''μ'' be a ''σ''-finite Borel measure on ''X'' and π : ''X'' → ''Y'' a Σ, Φ&amp;ndash;measurable map. Then there exists a σ-finite Borel measure ν on ''Y'' and a disintegration (*).

If ''μ'' is finite, ''ν'' can be taken to be the pushforward&lt;ref&gt;The ''pushforward'' ''π''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''μ'' of ''μ'' under ''π'', also called the image of ''μ'' under ''π'' and denoted ''π''(''μ''), is the measure ν on Φ defined by &lt;math&gt;\nu(A):=\mu\left(\pi^{-1}(A)\right)&lt;/math&gt; for ''A'' in Φ.&lt;/ref&gt; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''μ'', and then the ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are probabilities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Proof.''' Because of the polish nature of ''X'' there is a sequence of compact subsets of ''X'' that are mutually disjoint, whose union has negligible complement, and on which π is continuous. This observation reduces the problem to the case that both ''X'' and ''Y'' are compact and π is continuous, and ''ν'' = ''π''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''μ''. Complete Φ under ''ν'' and fix a strong lifting ''T'' for (''Y'', Φ, ''ν''). Given a bounded ''μ''-measurable function  ''f'', let &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lfloor f\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; denote its conditional expectation under π, i.e., the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem|Radon-Nikodym derivative]] of&lt;ref&gt;''fμ'' is the measure that has density ''f'' with respect to ''μ''&lt;/ref&gt; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''fμ'') with respect to ''π''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''μ''. Then set, for every ''y'' in ''Y'', &lt;math&gt;\lambda_y(f):=T(\lfloor f\rfloor)(y).&lt;/math&gt; To show that this defines a disintegration is a matter of bookkeeping and a suitable Fubini theorem. To see how the strongness of the lifting enters, note that

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_y(f\cdot\varphi\circ\pi)=\varphi(y) \lambda_y(f) \qquad \forall y\in Y, \varphi\in C_b(Y), f\in L^\infty(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

and take the infimum over all positive ''φ'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') with ''φ''(''y'') = 1; it becomes apparent that the support of ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in the fiber over&amp;nbsp;''y''.

Mathematicians seek and use [[patterns]]&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], engineering, medicine, finance and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time&amp;nbsp;– days, seasons, years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24–27}}

Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=originally published 1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]]. 

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]],[[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mathematic |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both senses can be found in Plato. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P. Boas Jr. | year=1995 | orig-year=1991 | page=257 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&amp;pg=PA257 | chapter=What Augustine Didn't Say About Mathematicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

==Definitions of mathematics==

[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&amp;nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World]]
Mathematics has [[definitions of mathematics|no generally accepted definition]].&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runge/&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philosophy of Mathematics |last=Franklin |first=James |date=2009-07-08 |isbn=9780080930589 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1. Newton and Leibniz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206092629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm |date=December 6, 2012 }}'', [[BBC Radio 4]], September 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"&gt;Waltershausen, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1809–1880) called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), p. 14, Basel, Birkhäuser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain/&gt;

Starting in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint) |author=Cajori, Florian |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1893 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA285 285–86] |isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.

Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.&lt;ref name=Snapper&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |id= |jstor=2689412 |ref=harv|bibcode=1975MathM..48...12G }}&lt;/ref&gt; All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt;

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906135700/https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj0a_aV2mxIC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=5|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' telling how the tokens may be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]
The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"/&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in German ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted "natural science" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain&gt;Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" This question was inspired by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians{{Who|date=January 2011}} that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.elte.hu/~kutrovatz/LakatosEng.pdf |title=Gábor Kutrovátz, "Imre Lakatos's Philosophy of Mathematics" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E.

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&amp;nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-40460-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&amp;nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

|-

|}

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

|}

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&amp;nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1&amp;nbsp;million reward.

The [[history of calculus]] is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of [[fluxion]]s or [[infinitesimal]] numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|epsilon–delta]] procedures rather than infinitesimals. '''Non-standard analysis'''&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis in Practice. Edited by [[Francine Diener]], [[Marc Diener]]. Springer, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis, Axiomatically. By [[V. Vladimir Grigorevich Kanovei]], [[Michael Reeken]]. Springer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis for the Working Mathematician. Edited by [[Peter A. Loeb]], [[Manfred P. H. Wolff]]. Springer, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of [[infinitesimal]] numbers.

Non-standard analysis was originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician [[Abraham Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Non-standard Analysis. By [[Abraham Robinson]]. Princeton University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcps.umn.edu/philosophy/11_7dauben.pdf Abraham Robinson and Nonstandard Analysis]: History, Philosophy, and Foundations of Mathematics. By [[Joseph W. Dauben]]. www.mcps.umn.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the idea of infinitely small or ''infinitesimal'' quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection [...] that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were ''to possess the same properties as the latter''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson argued that this [[law of continuity]] of Leibniz's is a precursor of the [[transfer principle]]. Robinson continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;[[Abraham Robinson|Robinson, A.]]: Non-standard analysis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is shown in this book that Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and that they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary [[model theory]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, [[Intuitionism|intuitionist]] [[Arend Heyting]] praised non-standard analysis as "a standard model of important mathematical research".&lt;ref&gt;Heijting, A. (1973) Address to Professor A. Robinson. At the occasion of the Brouwer memorial lecture given by Prof. A.Robinson on the 26th April 1973. Nieuw Arch. Wisk. (3) 21, pp. 134—137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
A non-zero element of an [[ordered field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal if and only if its [[absolute value]] is smaller than any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called [[non-Archimedean ordered field|non-Archimedean]]. More generally, non-standard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on [[non-standard model]]s and the [[transfer principle]]. A field which satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is a [[hyperreal field]], and non-standard real analysis uses these fields as ''non-standard models'' of the real numbers.

Robinson's original approach was based on these non-standard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject ''Non-standard Analysis'' was published in 1966 and is still in print.&lt;ref name="NSA2"&gt;{{cite book| last=Robinson |first=Abraham|title=Non-standard analysis|year=1996|edition=Revised|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-04490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 88, Robinson writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The existence of non-standard models of arithmetic was discovered by [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the [[ultrapower]] construction [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article on [[hyperreal number]]s for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.

==Basic definitions==
In this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the field of real numbers, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[semiring]] of natural numbers. Denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; the set of sequences of real numbers. A field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a suitable quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows. Take a nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] &lt;math&gt;F \subset P(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[Fréchet filter]]. Consider a pair of sequences

:&lt;math&gt;u = (u_n), v = (v_n) \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices which is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;\{n \in \mathbb{N} : u_n = v_n\} \in F&lt;/math&gt;

The quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, a situation summarized by the formula &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R} = {\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}}/{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Motivation==
There are at least three reasons to consider non-standard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.

===Historical===
Much of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as ''infinitesimal number'' and ''vanishing quantity''. As noted in the article on [[hyperreal number]]s, these formulations were widely criticized by [[George Berkeley]] and others. It was a challenge to develop a consistent theory of analysis using infinitesimals and the first person to do this in a satisfactory way was Abraham Robinson.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt;

In 1958 Curt Schmieden and [[Detlef Laugwitz]] published an Article "Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung"&lt;ref&gt;Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz: ''Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung'', Mathematische Zeitschrift 69 (1958), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; - "An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus", which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.

===Pedagogical===
[[H. Jerome Keisler]], [[David Tall]], and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|"epsilon-delta" approach]] to analytic concepts.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;H. Jerome Keisler, ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''. First edition 1976; 2nd edition 1986: [http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html full text of 2nd edition]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon-delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:

::infinitesimal × bounded = infinitesimal

::infinitesimal + infinitesimal = infinitesimal

together with the transfer principle mentioned below.

Another pedagogical application of non-standard analysis is [[Edward Nelson]]'s treatment of the theory of [[stochastic processes]].&lt;ref name="Ele"&gt;Edward Nelson: ''Radically Elementary Probability Theory'', Princeton University Press, 1987, [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/rept.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical===
Some recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from non-standard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. [[Sergio Albeverio]] et al.&lt;ref name="Alb"&gt;Sergio Albeverio, Jans Erik Fenstad, Raphael Høegh-Krohn, Tom Lindstrøm: ''Nonstandard Methods in Stochastic Analysis and Mathematical Physics'', Academic Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss some of these applications.

==Approaches to non-standard analysis==
There are two very different approaches to non-standard analysis: the [[semantic]] or [[model-theoretic approach]] and the [[syntactic approach]]. Both these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.

Robinson's original formulation of non-standard analysis falls into the category of the ''semantic approach''. As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular [[saturated model]]s) of a [[theory]]. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to [[Elias Zakon]]) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called [[Universe (mathematics)|superstructures]]. In this approach ''a model of a theory'' is replaced by an object called a ''superstructure'' {{math|''V''(''S'')}} over a set {{mvar|S}}. Starting from a superstructure {{math|''V''(''S'')}} one constructs another object {{math|*''V''(''S'')}} using the [[ultrapower]] construction together with a mapping {{math|''V''(''S'') → *''V''(''S'')}} that satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. The map * relates formal properties of {{math|''V''(''S'')}} and {{math|*''V''(''S'')}}. Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called [[countable]] saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.

The ''syntactic approach'' requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician [[Edward Nelson]]. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of non-standard analysis that he called [[Internal Set Theory]] (IST).&lt;ref name="Nel"&gt;[[Edward Nelson]]: ''Internal Set Theory: A New Approach to Nonstandard Analysis'', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 83, Number 6, November 1977. A chapter on Internal Set Theory is available at [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; IST is an extension of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation ∈, it introduces a new unary predicate ''standard'', which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.

Syntactic non-standard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the [[axiom of comprehension]]), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of ''[[illegal set formation]]''. For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here ''standard'' is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.&lt;ref name="Nel" /&gt;

Another example of the syntactic approach is the [[Alternative Set Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Vopěnka, P. Mathematics in the Alternative Set Theory. Teubner, Leipzig, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by [[Vopěnka]], trying to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the non-standard analysis than the axioms of ZF.

==Robinson's book==
Abraham Robinson's book ''Non-standard analysis'' was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of non-standard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre–non-standard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s "sum theorem" in [[Cours d'Analyse]] concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.

==Invariant subspace problem==
Abraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used non-standard analysis to prove that every [[polynomially compact]] [[linear operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] has an [[invariant subspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen Bernstein and Abraham Robinson, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994835 ''Solution of an invariant subspace problem of K. T. Smith and P. R. Halmos''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics 16:3 (1966) 421-431&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an operator {{mvar|T}} on Hilbert space {{mvar|''H''}}, consider the orbit of a point {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|H}} under the iterates of {{mvar|T}}. Applying Gram-Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{mvar|H}}. Let {{math|(''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} be the corresponding nested sequence of "coordinate" subspaces of {{mvar|H}}. The matrix {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} expressing {{mvar|T}} with respect to {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if {{mvar|T}} is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index {{mvar|w}} such that the matrix coefficient {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''w''+1,''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|*''H''}}. If {{mvar|y}} in {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has finite norm, then {{math|''T''(''y'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Now let {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the operator &lt;math&gt;P_w \circ T&lt;/math&gt; acting on {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the orthogonal projection to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Denote by {{mvar|q}} the polynomial such that {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is compact. The subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} where {{mvar|k}} runs from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|w}}, such that each of the corresponding {{mvar|k}}-dimensional subspaces {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{mvar|T}}-invariant. Denote by {{math|Π&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} the projection to the subspace {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For a nonzero vector {{mvar|x}} of finite norm in {{mvar|H}}, one can assume that {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} is nonzero, or {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}} to fix ideas. Since {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is a compact operator, {{math|(''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''))(''x'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} and therefore one has also {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}}. Now let {{mvar|j}} be the greatest index such that &lt;math&gt;|q(T_w) \left (\Pi_j(x) \right)|&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the desired invariant subspace.

Upon reading a preprint of the Bernstein-Robinson paper, [[Paul Halmos]] reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques.&lt;ref&gt;P. Halmos, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994836 ''Invariant subspaces for Polynomially Compact Operators''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 16:3 (1966) 433-437.&lt;/ref&gt; Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the ''Pacific Journal of Mathematics''. Some of the ideas used in Halmos' proof reappeared many years later in Halmos' own work on quasi-triangular operators.

==Other applications==
Other results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Kamae's proof&lt;ref&gt;T. Kamae: ''A simple proof of the ergodic theorem using nonstandard analysis'', Israel Journal of Mathematics vol. 42, Number 4, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[individual ergodic theorem]] or van den Dries and Wilkie's treatment&lt;ref&gt;L. van den Dries and A. J. Wilkie: ''Gromov's Theorem on Groups of Polynomial Growth and Elementary Logic'', Journal of Algebra, Vol 89, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and [[Shmuel Weinberger]] to prove a result in algebraic topology.&lt;ref&gt;Manevitz, Larry M.; Weinberger, Shmuel: Discrete circle actions: a note using non-standard analysis. Israel J. Math. 94 (1996), 147--155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The real contributions of non-standard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilizes the new extended language of non-standard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability &lt;ref name="Ele"/&gt;
hydrodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Capinski&amp;nbsp;M., [[Nigel Cutland|Cutland]]&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;J. ''Nonstandard Methods for Stochastic Fluid Mechanics.''
Singapore&amp;nbsp;etc., World Scientific Publishers (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; measure theory,&lt;ref&gt;Cutland N. ''[[Peter A. Loeb|Loeb]] Measures in Practice: Recent Advances.'' Berlin&amp;nbsp;etc.: Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; nonsmooth and harmonic analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. I., [[Semën Samsonovich Kutateladze|Kutateladze S. S.]], and Kusraev A. G. ''Infinitesimal Analysis'' Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

There are also applications of non-standard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et-al&lt;ref name="Alb" /&gt; have an excellent introduction to this area of research.

===Applications to calculus===
As an application to [[mathematical education]], [[H. Jerome Keisler]] wrote ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Covering [[non-standard calculus]], it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of non-standard analysis depend on the existence of the ''[[standard part function|standard part]]'' of a finite hyperreal {{mvar|r}}. The standard part of {{mvar|r}}, denoted {{math|st(''r'')}}, is a standard real number infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together. Keisler's book is now out of print, but is freely available from his website; see references below.

==Critique==
{{summarize|from|criticism of non-standard analysis|section=y}}
Despite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of non-standard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by E. Bishop, A. Connes, and P. Halmos, as documented at [[criticism of non-standard analysis]].

==Logical framework==
Given any set {{mvar|S}}, the ''superstructure'' over a set {{mvar|S}} is the set {{math|''V''(''S'')}} defined by the conditions

:&lt;math&gt;V_0(S) = S, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+1}(S) = V_{n}(S) \cup \wp (V_{n}(S)), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} V_{n}(S).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the superstructure over {{mvar|S}} is obtained by starting from {{mvar|S}} and iterating the operation of adjoining the [[power set]] of {{mvar|S}} and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains [[isomorphic]] copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

The working view of nonstandard analysis is a set {{math|*'''R'''}} and a mapping {{math|* : ''V''('''R''') → ''V''(*'''R''')}} which satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.

A formula has ''bounded quantification'' if and only if the only quantifiers which occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, the formula

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y \in 2^B, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

has bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable {{mvar|x}} ranges over {{mvar|A}}, the existentially quantified variable {{mvar|y}} ranges over the powerset of {{mvar|B}}. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

does not have bounded quantification because the quantification of ''y'' is unrestricted.

==Internal sets==
A set ''x'' is ''internal'' if and only if ''x'' is an element of *''A'' for some element ''A'' of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}. *''A'' itself is internal if ''A'' belongs to {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

We now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:
* [[Extension principle]]: The mapping * is the identity on {{math|'''R'''}}.
* ''Transfer principle'': For any formula {{math|''P''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} with bounded quantification and with free variables {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and for any elements {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}, the following equivalence holds:

::&lt;math&gt;P(A_1, \ldots, A_n) \iff P(*A_1, \ldots, *A_n) &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Countable saturation'': If {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''k'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; is a decreasing sequence of nonempty internal sets, with ''k'' ranging over the natural numbers, then

::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_k A_k \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;

One can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of {{math|''V''('''R''')}} are called ''standard''. Elements of {{math|*'''R'''}} are called [[hyperreal number]]s.

==First consequences==
The symbol {{math|*'''N'''}} denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of {{math|'''N'''}}. The set {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}} is nonempty. To see this, apply countable [[saturated model|saturation]] to the sequence of internal sets

:&lt;math&gt; A_n = \{k \in {^*\mathbf{N}}: k \geq n\} &lt;/math&gt;

The sequence {{math|{''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.

We begin with some definitions: Hyperreals ''r'', ''s'' are ''infinitely close'' [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt; r \cong s \iff \forall \theta \in \mathbf{R}^+, \ |r - s| \leq \theta&lt;/math&gt;

A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''infinitesimal'' if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if {{mvar|n}} is a [[hyperinteger]], i.e. an element of {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}}, then {{math|1/''n''}} is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''limited'' (or ''finite'') if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of {{math|*'''R'''}} containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

The set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are ''external'' subsets of {{math|''V''(*'''R''')}}; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.

'''Example''': The plane {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} ranging over {{math|*'''R'''}} is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} restricted to limited values (analogous to the [[Dehn planes|Dehn plane]]) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point {{math|(0, 1)}} on the {{mvar|y}}-axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis.

'''Theorem.''' For any limited hyperreal {{mvar|r}} there is a unique standard real denoted {{math|st(''r'')}} infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. The mapping {{math|st}} is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to {{math|'''R'''}}.

The mapping st is also external.

One way of thinking of the [[standard part function|standard part]] of a hyperreal, is in terms of [[Dedekind cut]]s; any limited hyperreal {{mvar|s}} defines a cut by considering the pair of sets {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} where {{mvar|L}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|a}} less than {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|U}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|b}} greater than {{mvar|s}}. The real number corresponding to {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of {{mvar|s}}.

One intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal {{mvar|x}} in the interval {{math|*[''a'', ''b'']}}, we have: {{math|*''f''(''x'') ≅ *''f''(st(''x''))}}.

(see [[microcontinuity]] for more details). Similarly,

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} is differentiable at the real value {{mvar|x}} if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number {{mvar|h}}, the value

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x)= \operatorname{st} \left(\frac{{^*f}(x+h) - {^*f}(x)}{h}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

exists and is independent of {{mvar|h}}. In this case {{math|''f''′(''x'')}} is a real number and is the derivative of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}.

=={{mvar|κ}}-saturation==
It is possible to "improve" the saturation by allowing collections of higher cardinality to be intersected. A model is {{mvar|κ}}-[[Saturated model|saturated]] if whenever &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of internal sets with the [[finite intersection property]] and &lt;math&gt;|I|\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful, for instance, in a topological space {{mvar|X}}, where we may want {{math|{{!}}2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}}}-saturation to ensure the intersection of a standard [[neighborhood base]] is nonempty.&lt;ref&gt;Salbany, S.; Todorov, T. [http://www.esi.ac.at/static/esiprpr/esi666.pdf Nonstandard Analysis in Point-Set Topology]. Erwing Schrodinger Institute for Mathematical Physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any cardinal {{mvar|κ}}, a {{mvar|κ}}-saturated extension can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C.; Keisler, H. J. Model theory. Third edition.

[[Image:Arabic Numerals.svg|thumb|400px|The ten digits of the [[Arabic numerals]], in order of value.]]
[[Image:Numbers with digits.png|thumb|400px|These three numbers are not three different digits; they are three different numbers made of digits. (e.g. "21" has two digits just as "480" has three digits.)]]

A '''numerical digit''' is a single symbol (such as "2" or "5") used alone, or in combinations (such as "25"), to represent [[number]]s (such as the number 25) according to some [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s. The single digits (as  one-digit-numerals) and their combinations (such as "25") are the numerals of the numeral system they belong to. The name "digit" comes from the fact that the ten digits ([[Latin]] ''digiti'' meaning fingers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digit?s=t |title="Digit" Origin |publisher=[[dictionary.com]] |accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the hands correspond to the ten symbols of the common [[base&amp;nbsp;10]] [[numeral system]], i.e. the decimal (ancient Latin adjective ''decem'' meaning ten)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decimal?s=t |title="Decimal" Origin |publisher=[[dictionary.com]] |accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; digits. 

For a given numeral system with an integer [[radix|base]], the number of digits required to express arbitrary numbers is given by the [[absolute value]] of the base. For example, the decimal system (base&amp;nbsp;10) requires ten digits (0 through to 9), whereas the binary system (base&amp;nbsp;2) has two digits (e.g.: 0 and 1).

==Overview==
In a basic digital system, a [[numeral system|numeral]] is a sequence of digits, which may be of arbitrary length. Each position in the sequence has a [[positional notation|place value]], and each digit has a value. The value of the numeral is computed by multiplying each digit in the sequence by its place value, and summing the results.

===Digital values===
Each digit in a number system represents an integer. For example, in [[decimal]] the digit "1" represents the integer [[one]], and in the [[hexadecimal]] system, the letter "A" represents the number [[10 (number)|ten]]. A [[positional number system]] has one unique digit for each integer from [[zero]] up to, but not including, the [[radix]] of the number system.

Thus in the positional decimal system, the numbers 0 to 9 can be expressed using their respective numerals "0" to "9" in the rightmost "units" position. The number 12 can be expressed with the numeral "2" in the units position, and with the numeral "1" in the "tens" position, to the left of the "2" while the number 312 can be expressed by three numerals: "3" in the "hundreds" position, "1" in the "tens" position, and "2" in the "units" position.

===Computation of place values===
The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] (or the Hindu numeral system) uses a [[decimal separator]], commonly a [[period (punctuation)|period]] in English, or a [[comma]] in other [[Europe]]an languages, to denote the "ones place" or "units place",&lt;ref name=math-textbooks1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z4DKqNFIR5gC&amp;q=%22units+or+ones+place%22&amp;dq=%22units+or+ones+place%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2--DUunsD4bKiwKA-4CoBA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCDgK][https://books.google.com/books?id=IYvSWIw3oxUC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22units+or+ones+place%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w--DUqn8G-H8igKoiYCIBw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22units%20or%20ones%20place%22&amp;f=false][https://books.google.com/books?id=xwYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22units+or+ones+place%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w--DUqn8G-H8igKoiYCIBw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22units%20or%20ones%20place%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation.

Each successive place to the left of this has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit times the [[radix|base]]. Similarly, each successive place to the right of the separator has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit divided by the base. For example, in the numeral '''10.34''' (written in [[base&amp;nbsp;10]]),
:the '''0''' is immediately to the left of the separator, so it is in the ones or units place, and is called the ''units digit'' or ''ones digit''&lt;ref name=math-textbooks2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W4AXAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22units+or+ones+digit%22&amp;dq=%22units+or+ones+digit%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MeyDUsfqDKaUiALdl4HwCA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK][https://books.google.com/books?id=ng11FOHjNmcC&amp;q=%22ones+or+units+digit%22&amp;dq=%22ones+or+units+digit%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TOyDUpyHI4qiigKC7YGABA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK][https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Y51BtCOKMC&amp;q=%22ones+or+units+digit%22&amp;dq=%22ones+or+units+digit%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TOyDUpyHI4qiigKC7YGABA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}};
:the '''1''' to the left of the ones place is in the tens place, and is called the ''tens digit'';
:the '''3''' is to the right of the ones place, so it is in the tenths place, and is called the ''tenths digit'';
:the '''4''' to the right of the tenths place is in the hundredths place, and is called the ''hundredths digit''.

The total value of the number is 1 ten, 0 ones, 3 tenths, and 4 hundredths. Note that the zero, which contributes no value to the number, indicates that the 1 is in the tens place rather than the ones place.

The place value of any given digit in a numeral can be given by a simple calculation, which in itself is a compliment to the logic behind numeral systems. The calculation involves the multiplication of the given digit by the base raised by the exponent {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, where ''n'' represents the position of the digit from the separator; the value of ''n'' is positive (+), but this is only if the digit is to the left of the separator. And to the right, the digit is multiplied by the base raised by a negative (−) ''n''. For example, in the number '''10.34''' (written in base&amp;nbsp;10),
:the '''1''' is second to the left of the separator, so based on calculation, its value is,

:&lt;math&gt;n - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^1 = 10&lt;/math&gt;

:the '''4''' is second to the right of the separator, so based on calculation its value is,

:&lt;math&gt;n = -2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 10^{-2} = \frac{4}{100}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
[[Image:Arabic numerals-en.svg|thumb|500px|Glyphs used to represent digits of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.]]
The first true written [[positional numeral system]] is considered to be the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]]. This system was established by the 7th&amp;nbsp;century in India,&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson"&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and Robertson, E. F. [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html Arabic Numerals]. January 2001. Retrieved on 2007-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not yet in its modern form because the use of the digit [[zero]] had not yet been widely accepted. Instead of a zero sometimes the digits were marked with dots to indicate their significance, or a space was used as a placeholder. The first widely acknowledged use of zero was in 876. The original numerals were very similar to the modern ones, even down to the [[glyph]]s used to represent digits.&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson"/&gt;

[[Image:Maya.svg|thumb|left|150px|The digits of the Maya numeral system]]
By the 13th century, [[Western Arabic numerals]] were accepted in European mathematical circles ([[Fibonacci]] used them in his ''[[Liber Abaci]]''). They began to enter common use in the 15th&amp;nbsp;century. By the end of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century virtually all non-computerized calculations in the world were done with Arabic numerals, which have replaced native numeral systems in most cultures.

===Other historical numeral systems using digits===
The exact age of the [[Maya numerals]] is unclear, but it is possible that it is older than the Hindu–Arabic system. The system was [[vigesimal]] (base&amp;nbsp;20), so it has twenty digits. The Mayas used a shell symbol to represent zero. Numerals were written vertically, with the ones place at the bottom. The [[Mayas]] had no equivalent of the modern [[decimal separator]], so their system could not represent fractions.

The [[Thai numerals|Thai numeral system]] is identical to the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] except for the symbols used to represent digits. The use of these digits is less common in [[Thailand]] than it once was, but they are still used alongside Arabic numerals.

The rod numerals, the written forms of [[counting rods]] once used by [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese mathematicians, are a decimal positional system able to represent not only zero but also negative numbers. Counting rods themselves predate the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The [[Chinese numerals#Suzhou numerals|Suzhou numerals]] are variants of rod numerals.

==Modern digital systems==
===In computer science===
The [[Binary numeral system|binary]] (base&amp;nbsp;2), [[octal]] (base&amp;nbsp;8), and [[hexadecimal]] (base&amp;nbsp;16) systems, extensively used in [[computer science]], all follow the conventions of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]]. The binary system uses only the digits "0" and "1", while the octal system uses the digits from "0" through "7". The hexadecimal system uses all the digits from the decimal system, plus the letters "A" through "F", which represent the numbers 10 to 15 respectively.

===Unusual systems===
The [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] and [[balanced ternary]] systems have sometimes been used. They are both base&amp;nbsp;3 systems.

Balanced ternary is unusual in having the digit values 1, 0 and –1. Balanced ternary turns out to have some useful properties and the system has been used in the experimental Russian [[Setun]] computers.

Several authors in the last 300 years have noted a facility of [[positional notation]] that amounts to a ''modified'' [[decimal representation]]. Some advantages are cited for use of numerical digits that represent negative values. In 1840 [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] advocated use of [[signed-digit representation]] of numbers, and in 1928 [[Florian Cajori]] presented his collection of references for [[signed-digit representation#Negative numerals|negative numerals]]. The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in [[computer design]].

==Digits in mathematics==
Despite the essential role of digits in describing numbers, they are relatively unimportant to modern [[mathematics]]. Nevertheless, there are a few important mathematical concepts that make use of the representation of a number as a sequence of digits.

===Digital roots===
{{main|Digital root}}
The digital root is the single-digit number obtained by summing the digits of a given number, then summing the digits of the result, and so on until a single-digit number is obtained.

===Casting out nines===
{{main|Casting out nines}}
[[Casting out nines]] is a procedure for checking arithmetic done by hand. To describe it, let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[digital root]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, as described above. Casting out nines makes use of the fact that if &lt;math&gt;A + B = C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(f(A) + f(B)) = f(C)&lt;/math&gt;. In the process of casting out nines, both sides of the latter [[equation]] are computed, and if they are not equal the original addition must have been faulty.

===Repunits and repdigits===
{{main|Repunit}}
Repunits are integers that are represented with only the digit 1. For example, 1111 (one thousand, one hundred and eleven) is a repunit. [[Repdigit]]s are a generalization of repunits; they are integers represented by repeated instances of the same digit. For example, 333 is a repdigit. The [[prime number|primality]] of repunits is of interest to mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Repunit|title=Repunit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palindromic numbers and Lychrel numbers===
{{main|Palindromic number}}
Palindromic numbers are numbers that read the same when their digits are reversed. A [[Lychrel number]] is a positive integer that never yields a palindromic number when subjected to the iterative process of being added to itself with digits reversed. The question of whether there are any Lychrel numbers in base&amp;nbsp;10 is an open problem in [[recreational mathematics]]; the smallest candidate is [[196 (number)|196]].

==History of ancient numbers==
{{Main|History of writing ancient numbers}}
Counting aids, especially the use of body parts (counting on fingers), were certainly used in prehistoric times as today. There are many variations. Besides counting ten fingers, some cultures have counted knuckles, the space between fingers, and toes as well as fingers. The [[Oksapmin]] culture of New Guinea uses a system of 27 upper body locations to represent numbers.

To preserve numerical information, [[Tally marks|tallies]] carved in wood, bone, and stone have been used since prehistoric times. Stone age cultures, including ancient [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] groups, used tallies for gambling, personal services, and trade-goods.

A method of preserving numeric information in clay was invented by the [[Sumer]]ians between 8000 and 3500&amp;nbsp;BC. This was done with small clay tokens of various shapes that were strung like beads on a string. Beginning about 3500&amp;nbsp;BC, clay tokens were gradually replaced by number signs impressed with a round stylus at different angles in clay tablets (originally containers for tokens) which were then baked. About 3100&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;BC, written numbers were dissociated from the things being counted and became abstract numerals.

Between 2700 and 2000 BC, in Sumer, the round stylus was gradually replaced by a reed stylus that was used to press wedge-shaped cuneiform signs in clay. These cuneiform number signs resembled the round number signs they replaced and retained the additive [[sign-value notation]] of the round number signs. These systems gradually converged on a common [[sexagesimal]] number system; this was a place-value system consisting of only two impressed marks, the vertical wedge and the chevron, which could also represent fractions. This sexagesimal number system was fully developed at the beginning of the Old Babylonia period (about 1950&amp;nbsp;BC) and became standard in Babylonia.

[[Sexagesimal]] numerals were a [[mixed radix]] system that retained the alternating base&amp;nbsp;10 and base&amp;nbsp;6 in a sequence of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons. By 1950&amp;nbsp;BC, this was a [[positional notation]] system. Sexagesimal numerals came to be widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians. Babylonian-style sexagesimal numeration is still used in modern societies to measure [[time]] (minutes per hour) and [[angle]]s (degrees).

==History of modern numbers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In [[China]], armies and provisions were counted using modular tallies of [[prime number]]s. Unique numbers of troops and measures of rice appear as unique combinations of these tallies. A great convenience of [[modular arithmetic]] is that it is easy to multiply, though quite difficult to add. This makes use of modular arithmetic for provisions especially attractive. Conventional tallies are quite difficult to multiply and divide. In modern times modular arithmetic is sometimes used in [[digital signal processing]].

The oldest Greek system was that of the [[Attic numerals]], but in the 4th century BC they began to use a quasidecimal alphabetic system (see [[Greek numerals]]). Jews began using a similar system ([[Hebrew numerals]]), with the oldest examples known being coins from around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.

The Roman empire used tallies written on wax, papyrus and stone, and roughly followed the Greek custom of assigning letters to various numbers. The [[Roman numerals|Roman numerals system]] remained in common use in Europe until [[positional notation]] came into common use in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.

The [[Maya numerals|Maya]] of Central America used a mixed base 18 and base 20 system, possibly inherited from the [[Olmec]], including advanced features such as positional notation and a [[zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Modern Mathematics |first1=Ruric E. |last1=Wheeler |first2=Ed R. |last2=Wheeler |publisher=Kendall Hunt |year=2001 |isbn=9780787290627 |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azSPh9SBwwEC&amp;pg=PA130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They used this system to make advanced astronomical calculations, including highly accurate calculations of the length of the solar year and the orbit of [[Venus]].

The Incan Empire ran a large command economy using [[quipu]], tallies made by knotting colored fibers. Knowledge of the encodings of the knots and colors was suppressed by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, and has not survived although simple quipu-like recording devices are still used in the [[Andes|Andean]] region.

Some authorities believe that positional arithmetic began with the wide use of [[counting rods]] in China. The earliest written positional records seem to be [[rod calculus]] results in China around 400. In particular, zero was correctly described by Chinese mathematicians around 932.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The modern positional Arabic numeral system was developed by [[Indian mathematics|mathematicians in India]], and passed on to [[Islamic mathematics|Muslim mathematicians]], along with astronomical tables brought to [[Baghdad]] by an Indian ambassador around 773.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

From [[India]], the thriving trade between Islamic sultans and Africa carried the concept to [[Cairo]]. Arabic mathematicians extended the system to include [[Decimal|decimal fractions]], and [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī]] wrote an important work about it in the 9th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;century. The modern [[Arabic numerals]] were introduced to Europe with the translation of this work in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century in Spain and [[Leonardo of Pisa]]'s ''Liber Abaci'' of 1201. In Europe, the complete Indian system with the zero was derived from the Arabs in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The [[binary numeral system|binary system]] (base 2), was propagated in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Leibniz had developed the concept early in his career, and had revisited it when he reviewed a copy of the [[I ching]] from China. Binary numbers came into common use in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century because of computer applications.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In mathematics, a '''pantachy''' or '''pantachie''' (from the Greek word πανταχη meaning everywhere) is a maximal totally ordered [[subset]] of a [[partially ordered set]], especially a set of equivalence classes of sequences of real numbers. The term was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=du Bois-Reymond|authorlink=Paul du Bois-Reymond|year1=1879|year2=1882}} to mean a [[dense subset]] of an ordered set, and he also introduced "infinitary pantachies" to mean the ordered set of equivalence classes of real functions ordered by domination, but as [[Felix Hausdorff]] pointed out this is not a totally ordered set.&lt;ref&gt;Hausdorff declared that "''the infinitary pantachie'' in the sense of Du Bois-Reymond ''does not exist''" (1907), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Hausdorff|1907}} redefined a pantachy to be a maximal totally ordered subset of this set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6491">In [[logic]], '''Peirce's law''' is named after the [[philosopher]] and [[logician]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  It was taken as an [[Axiom#Mathematics|axiom]] in his first axiomatisation of [[propositional logic]].  It can be thought of as the [[law of excluded middle]] written in a form that involves only one sort of connective, namely implication.

In [[propositional calculus]], '''Peirce's law''' says that ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P''.  Written out, this means that ''P'' must be true if there is a proposition ''Q'' such that the truth of ''P'' [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the truth of "if ''P'' then ''Q''". In particular, when ''Q'' is taken to  be a false formula, the law says that if ''P'' must be true whenever it implies falsity, then ''P'' is true. In this way Peirce's law implies the [[law of excluded middle]].

Peirce's law does not hold in [[intuitionistic logic]] or [[intermediate logic]]s and cannot be deduced from the [[deduction theorem]] alone.

Under the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]], Peirce's law is the type of [[continuation]] operators, e.g. [[call/cc]] in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.26.6893 A Formulae-as-Types Notion of Control] - Griffin defines K on page 3 as an equivalent to Scheme's call/cc and then discusses its type being the equivalent of Peirce's law at the end of section 5 on page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is Peirce's own statement of the law:
: A ''fifth icon'' is required for the principle of [[excluded middle]] and other propositions connected with it.  One of the simplest formulae of this kind is:
{| align="center"
 | {(''x'' → ''y'') → ''x''} → ''x''.
|}
: This is hardly axiomatical.  That it is true appears as follows.  It can only be false by the final consequent ''x'' being false while its antecedent (''x'' → ''y'') → ''x'' is true.  If this is true, either its consequent, ''x'', is true, when the whole formula would be true, or its antecedent ''x'' → ''y'' is false.  But in the last case the antecedent of ''x'' → ''y'', that is ''x'', must be true.  (Peirce, the ''Collected Papers'' 3.384).
Peirce goes on to point out an immediate application of the law:
: From the formula just given, we at once get:
{| align="center"
 | {(''x'' → ''y'') → ''a''} → ''x'',
|}
: where the ''a'' is used in such a sense that (''x'' → ''y'') → ''a'' means that from (''x'' → ''y'') every proposition follows.  With that understanding, the formula states the principle of excluded middle, that from the falsity of the denial of ''x'' follows the truth of ''x''.  (Peirce, the ''Collected Papers'' 3.384).

'''Warning''': ((''x''→''y'')→''a'')→''x'' is ''not'' a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]. However, [''a''→''x'']→[((''x''→''y'')→''a'')→''x''] is a tautology.

==Other proofs of Peirce's law==
Here is a simple proof of Peirce's law assuming double negation &lt;math&gt;(\neg \neg P \iff P)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow p \\
&amp; \ \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
\neg (p \rightarrow q) \lor p \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
\neg (\neg p \lor q) \lor p \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
(p \land \neg q) \lor p \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
(p \land \neg q) \lor (p \land 1) \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
p \land (\neg q \lor 1) \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
p \land 1 \\
&amp; \ \\
\Rightarrow &amp; \ 
p. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Using Peirce's law with the deduction theorem==

Peirce's law allows one to enhance the technique of using the [[deduction theorem]] to prove theorems. Suppose one is given a set of premises &amp;Gamma; and one wants to deduce a proposition ''Z'' from them. With Peirce's law, one can add (at no cost) additional premises of the form ''Z''→''P'' to &amp;Gamma;. For example, suppose we are given ''P''→''Z'' and (''P''→''Q'')→''Z'' and we wish to deduce ''Z'' so that we can use the deduction theorem to conclude that (''P''→''Z'')→(((''P''→''Q'')→''Z'')→''Z'') is a theorem. Then we can add another premise ''Z''→''Q''. From that and ''P''→''Z'', we get ''P''→''Q''. Then we apply modus ponens with (''P''→''Q'')→''Z'' as the major premise to get ''Z''. Applying the deduction theorem, we get that (''Z''→''Q'')→''Z'' follows from the original premises. Then we use Peirce's law in the form ((''Z''→''Q'')→''Z'')→''Z'' and modus ponens to derive ''Z'' from the original premises. Then we can finish off proving the theorem as we originally intended.
**''P''→''Z'' 1. hypothesis
***(''P''→''Q'')→''Z'' 2. hypothesis
****''Z''→''Q'' 3. hypothesis
*****''P'' 4. hypothesis
*****''Z'' 5. modus ponens using steps 4 and 1
*****''Q'' 6. modus ponens using steps 5 and 3
****''P''→''Q'' 7. deduction from 4 to 6
****''Z'' 8. modus ponens using steps 7 and 2
***(''Z''→''Q'')→''Z'' 9. deduction from 3 to 8
***((''Z''→''Q'')→''Z'')→''Z'' 10. Peirce's law
***''Z'' 11. modus ponens using steps 9 and 10
**((''P''→''Q'')→''Z'')→''Z'' 12. deduction from 2 to 11
*(''P''→''Z'')→((''P''→''Q'')→''Z'')→''Z'') 13. deduction from 1 to 12 QED

==Completeness of the implicational propositional calculus==
{{main|Implicational propositional calculus}}
One reason that Peirce's law is important is that it can substitute for the law of excluded middle in the logic which only uses implication. The sentences which can be deduced from the axiom schemas:
* ''P''→(''Q''→''P'')
* (''P''→(''Q''→''R''))→((''P''→''Q'')→(''P''→''R''))
* ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P''
* from ''P'' and ''P''→''Q'' infer ''Q''
(where ''P'',''Q'',''R'' contain only "→" as a connective) are all the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] which use only "→" as a connective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">{{distinguish|Pfaffian|Pfaffian system}}
In [[mathematics]], '''Pfaffian functions''' are a certain class of functions whose derivative can be written in terms of the original function. They were originally introduced by [[Askold Georgevich Khovanskiǐ]] in the 1970s, but are named after German mathematician [[Johann Pfaff]].

==Basic definition==
Some [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], when [[Derivative|differentiated]], give a result which can be written in terms of the original function.  Perhaps the simplest example is the [[exponential function]], ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.  If we differentiate this function we get ''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' again, that is

:&lt;math&gt;
f^\prime(x)=f(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

Another example of a function like this is the reciprocal function, ''g''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x''.  If we differentiate this function we will see that

:&lt;math&gt;
g^\prime(x)=-g(x)^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

Other functions may not have the above property, but their derivative may be written in terms of functions like those above.  For example, if we take the function ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;log(''x'') then we see

:&lt;math&gt;
h^\prime(x)=e^x\log x+x^{-1}e^x=h(x)+f(x)g(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

Functions like these form the links in a so-called '''Pfaffian chain'''.  Such a chain is a sequence of functions, say ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc., with the property that if we differentiate any of the functions in this chain then the result can be written in terms of the function itself and all the functions preceding it in the chain (specifically as a [[polynomial]] in those functions and the variables involved).  So with the functions above we have that ''f'', ''g'', ''h'' is a Pfaffian chain.

A '''Pfaffian function''' is then just a polynomial in the functions appearing in a Pfaffian chain and the function argument.  So with the Pfaffian chain just mentioned, functions such as ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''g''(''x'')''h''(''x'') are Pfaffian.

==Rigorous definition==

Let ''U'' be an open domain in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  A '''Pfaffian chain''' of order ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and degree ''α''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 in ''U'' is a sequence of real [[analytic functions]]  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in ''U'' satisfying differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f_{i}}{\partial x_j}=P_{i,j}(\boldsymbol{x},f_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}),\ldots,f_{i}(\boldsymbol{x}))
&lt;/math&gt;

for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,…,''r'' where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;] are [[polynomials]] of degree ≤&amp;nbsp;''α''.  A function ''f'' on ''U'' is called a '''Pfaffian function''' of order ''r'' and degree (''α'',''β'') if

:&lt;math&gt;
f(\boldsymbol{x})=P(\boldsymbol{x},f_{1}(\boldsymbol{x}),\ldots,f_{r}(\boldsymbol{x})),\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;] is a polynomial of degree at most ''β''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.  The numbers ''r'', ''α'', and ''β'' are collectively known as the format of the Pfaffian function, and give a useful measure of its complexity.

==Examples==

* The most trivial examples of Pfaffian functions are the polynomials in '''R'''[''X''].  Such a function will be a polynomial in a Pfaffian chain of order ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, that is the chain with no functions.  Such a function will have ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''β'' equal to the degree of the polynomial.
* Perhaps the simplest nontrivial Pfaffian function  is ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is Pfaffian with order ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1 due to the equation ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''.
* Inductively, one may define ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(''x'') and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;exp(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) for 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''.  Then ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;···''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.  So this is a Pfaffian chain of order ''r'' and degree ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''.
* All of the [[algebraic functions]] are Pfaffian on suitable domains as are the [[hyperbolic function]]s.  The [[trigonometric functions]] on bounded intervals are Pfaffian, but they must be formed indirectly.  For example, the function cos(''x'') is a polynomial in the Pfaffian chain tan(''x''/2), cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''/2) on the interval (&amp;minus;π,π).
* In fact all the [[elementary function]]s and [[Liouvillian function|Liouvillian functions]] are Pfaffian.&lt;ref&gt;Liouville functions are essentially all the real analytic functions obtainable from the elementary functions by applying the usual arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and integration. They are unrelated to [[Liouville function|Liouville's function]] in number theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In model theory==

Consider the structure '''R'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;('''R''',+,&amp;minus;,·,&lt;,0,1), the ordered field of real numbers.  In the 1960s [[Andrei Gabrielov]] proved that the structure obtained by starting with '''R''' and adding a function symbol for every analytic function restricted to the unit box [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[model complete]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gabrielov, "Projections of semi-analytic sets", ''Functional Anal. Appl.'' '''2''' (1968), pp.282–291.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, any set definable in this structure '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;an&lt;/sub&gt; was just the projection of some higher-dimensional set defined by identities and inequalities involving these restricted analytic functions.

In the 1990s, [[Alex Wilkie]] showed that one has the same result if instead of adding ''every'' analytic function, one just adds the exponential function to '''R''' to get the ordered real field with exponentiation, '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, a result known as [[Wilkie's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wilkie, "Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential functions", ''J. Amer. Math. Soc.'' '''9''' (1996), pp. 1051–1094.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilkie then tackled the question of which finite sets of functions could be added to '''R''' to get this result.  It turned out that adding any Pfaffian chain restricted to the box [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; would give the same result.  In particular one may add ''all'' Pfaffian functions to '''R''' to get the structure '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;Pfaff&lt;/sub&gt; as an intermediate result between Gabrielov's result and [[Wilkie's theorem]].  Since the exponential function is a Pfaffian chain by itself, the result on exponentiation can be viewed as a special case of this latter result.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie's theorem is actually stronger than this special case.  The special case would still require the exponential function to be restricted to the closed interval [0,1]. Wilkie proved that this is unnecessary in the case of the exponential function, and one may define it as usual on all of '''R'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This result of Wilkie's proved that the structure '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;Pfaff&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[o-minimal structure]].

==Noetherian functions==

The equations above that define a Pfaffian chain are said to satisfy a triangular condition, since the derivative of each successive function in the chain is a polynomial in one extra variable.  Thus if they are written out in turn a triangular shape appears:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f_1^\prime &amp;= P_1(x,f_1)\\
f_2^\prime &amp;= P_2(x,f_1,f_2)\\
f_3^\prime &amp;= P_3(x,f_1,f_2,f_3),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.  If this triangularity condition is relaxed so that the derivative of each function in the chain is a polynomial in all the other functions in the chain, then the chain of functions is known as a '''Noetherian chain''', and a function constructed as a polynomial in this chain is called a '''Noetherian function'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrei Gabrielov, Nicolai Vorobjov |chapter=Complexity of computations with Pfaffian and Noetherian functions |title=Normal Forms, Bifurcations and Finiteness Problems in Differential Equations |editor=Yulij Ilyashenko, [[Christiane Rousseau]] |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=1-4020-1928-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So, for example, a Noetherian chain of order three is composed of three functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfying the equations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f_1^\prime &amp;= P_1(x,f_1,f_2,f_3)\\
f_2^\prime &amp;= P_2(x,f_1,f_2,f_3)\\
f_3^\prime &amp;= P_3(x,f_1,f_2,f_3).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The name stems from the fact that the [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] generated by the functions in such a chain is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]].&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Tougeron, "Algèbres analytiques topologiquement nœthériennes, Théorie de Hovanskii", ''Annales de l'Institut Fourier'' '''41''' (1991), pp.823&amp;ndash;840.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any Pfaffian chain is also a Noetherian chain; the extra variables in each polynomial are simply redundant in this case.  But not every Noetherian chain is Pfaffian.  If we take ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin(''x'') and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos(''x'') then we have the equations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}f_1^\prime(x)&amp;=f_2(x)\\
f_2^\prime(x)&amp;=-f_1(x),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and these hold for all real numbers ''x'', so ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a Noetherian chain on all of '''R'''.  But there is no polynomial ''P''(''x'',''y'') such that the derivative of sin(''x'') can be written as ''P''(''x'',sin(''x'')), and so this chain is not Pfaffian.

'''''Proofs from THE BOOK''''' is a book of [[mathematical proof]]s by [[Martin Aigner]] and [[Günter M. Ziegler]]. The book is dedicated to the [[mathematician]] [[Paul Erdős]], who often referred to "The Book" in which [[God]] keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical [[theorem]]. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, "You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book."

==Content==
''Proofs from THE BOOK'' contains 32 sections (44 in the fifth edition), each devoted to one theorem but often containing multiple proofs and related results. It spans a broad range of mathematical fields: [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]]. Erdős himself made many suggestions for the book, but died before its publication. The book is illustrated by [[Karl Heinrich Hofmann]]. It has gone through five editions in English, and has been translated into Persian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Korean, Turkish, Russian and Spanish.

In November 2017 the American Mathematical Society announced the 2018 [[Leroy_P._Steele_Prize|Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition]] to be awarded to Aigner and Ziegler for this book.

The proofs include:
*[[Proof of Bertrand's postulate]]
*[[Proof that e is irrational]] (also showing the irrationality of certain related numbers)
*Six proofs of the infinitude of the [[prime number|primes]], including [[Euclid's theorem|Euclid]]'s and [[Furstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes|Furstenberg's]]
*[[Monsky's theorem]] (4th edition)
*[[Wetzel's problem]] on families of analytic functions with few distinct values
*Steve Fisk's proof of the [[Art gallery problem#Fisk's short proof|art gallery theorem]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7933">'''Quantum cloning''' is a process that takes an arbitrary, unknown [[quantum state]] and makes an exact copy without altering the original state in any way.  In [[Dirac notation]], the process of quantum cloning is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;U |\psi\rangle_A |e\rangle_B = |\psi\rangle_A |\psi\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the actual cloning operation, &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_A&lt;/math&gt; is the state to be cloned, and &lt;math&gt;|e\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt; is the initial state of the copy.

Quantum cloning is forbidden by the laws of [[quantum mechanics]] as shown by the [[no cloning theorem]], which states that there is no operation for cloning any arbitrary state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle_A&lt;/math&gt; perfectly.  Though perfect quantum cloning is not possible, it is possible to perform imperfect cloning, where the copies have a non-unit (i.e. non-perfect) [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]].  As a result of cloning, the copies resulted from a pure state will be entangled. A cloner often increases the entanglement between the states. However, outputs of an optimal phase-covariant cloner {{clarify span|date=April 2017|(where equatorial states)}} can be unentangled (see [[#References|References]]).

The accuracy of copies is measured by [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] and other metrics. The '''universal''' property of cloning machines means the input state is equally likely to be any pure state.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Kay [https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4951 Optimal Universal Quantum Cloning: Asymmetries and Fidelity Measures] First submitted on July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In universal cloning, the qualities of the two outputs have to be independent of the input states. Other alternative prior distributions include phase-covariant cloners and real cloners.  A universal &lt;math&gt;1\rightarrow2&lt;/math&gt; cloning machine can have a fidelity as high as 5/6.&lt;ref&gt;Bužek V. and Hillery, M. Quantum Copying: Beyond the No-Cloning Theorem. Phys. Rev. A 54, 1844 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum cloning operation is the best way to make copies of quantum information; therefore, cloning is an important task in [[Quantum information science|quantum information processing]], especially in the context of [[quantum cryptography]].  Researchers{{who|date=February 2015}} are seeking ways to build quantum cloning machines which work at the so-called [[quantum limit]].  The first cloning machine relied on [[stimulated emission]] to copy quantum information encoded into single photons. Teleportation, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], quantum amplification, and superior phase conjugation have been some other methods utilized to realize a quantum cloning machine.&lt;ref&gt;Antía Lamas-Linares, Christoph Simon, John C. Howell, Dik Bouwmeester, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205149 Experimental Quantum Cloning of Single Photons]'', [[Science]] '''296''' 5568 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ion trapping techniques have been applied to cloning quantum states of ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Implementing a Universal Quantum Cloning Machine via Adiabatic Evolution in Ion-Trap System|last1=YANG|first1=Rong-Can|last2=LI|first2=Hong-Cai†|last3=LIN|first3=Xiu|last4=HUANG|first4=Zhi-Ping|last5=XIE|first5=Hong|date = Jan 2008|journal = |accessdate = |doi = 10.1088/0253-6102/49/1/17|pmid = |bibcode = 2008CoTPh..49...80Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special cases ==

It may be possible to clone a quantum state to arbitrary accuracy in the presence of [[closed timelike curve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Todd A. Brun, Mark M. Wilde, Andreas Winter, Quantum state cloning using Deutschian closed timelike curve. Physical Review Letters 111, 190401 (2013); arXiv:1306.1795&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase-Covariant Cloning ===

It is also possible to consider quantum cloning in more complicated cases; for instance, if the input states are restricted to a special form such that they are equally distributed in the equator of the Bloch sphere which can represent arbitrary states of qubits; alternatively, approximately but optimally quantum-copying N identical states to M states (where M is larger than N) can be considered; {{clarify span|date=April 2017|on the other hand, a quantum state can be cloned perfectly but with the highest probability}}. Based on different aims and applications, various quantum cloning machines can be constructed. Universal and phase-covariant quantum cloning machines can be directly related with [[BB84]] and the [[Six-State Protocol]] of quantum cryptography. A probabilistic quantum cloning machine can be related with the simplified B92 quantum key distribution protocol. Such quantum cloning machines can be implemented in various physical systems for quantum information processing.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Extensions ===
===Asymmetric Quantum Cloning===
The Uncertainty principle puts a limit on the fidelity of cloning. However, a higher fidelity can be achieved in one of the copies if the other copy or copies require less fidelity. If the fidelities of the clones are designed to be unequal, the optimal quantum cloning machine is asymmetric.  This can be used to customize the accuracy by choosing any arbitrary point in the trade-off curve between the qualities of the copies.  The trade-off of optimal accuracy between the resulting copies has been studied in quantum circuits,&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Rezakhani, S. Siadatnejad, and A. H. Ghaderi.

In [[topology]] and related fields of [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is called a '''regular space''' if every [[closed subset]] ''C'' of ''X'' and a point ''p'' not contained in ''C'' admit non-overlapping [[open neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''p'' and ''C'' can be [[separated sets|separated]] by neighborhoods. This condition is known as '''Axiom T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The term "'''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space'''" usually means "a regular [[Hausdorff space]]". These conditions are examples of [[separation axiom]]s.

== Definitions ==
[[Image:Regular space.svg|250px|thumb|right|The point ''x'', represented by a dot to the left of the picture, and the closed set ''F'', represented by a closed disk to the right of the picture, are separated by their neighbourhoods ''U'' and ''V'', represented by larger [[open disk]]s. The dot ''x'' has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''U'', and the closed disk F has plenty of room to wiggle around the open disk ''V'', yet ''U'' and ''V'' do not touch each other.]]

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is a '''regular space''' if, given any [[closed set]] ''F'' and any [[Point (geometry)|point]] ''x'' that does not belong to ''F'', there exists a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' and a neighbourhood ''V'' of ''F'' that are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]]. Concisely put, it must be possible to [[separated set|separate]] ''x'' and ''F'' with disjoint neighborhoods.

A '''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; space''' or '''regular Hausdorff space''' is a topological space that is both regular and a [[Hausdorff space]]. (A Hausdorff space or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space is a topological space in which any two distinct points are separated by neighbourhoods.) It turns out that a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (A T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or [[Kolmogorov space]] is a topological space in which any two distinct points are [[topologically distinguishable]], i.e., for every pair of distinct points, at least one of them has an [[open neighborhood]] not containing the other.) Indeed, if a space is Hausdorff then it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and each T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; regular space is Hausdorff: given two distinct points, at least one of them misses the closure of the other one, so (by regularity) there exist disjoint neighborhoods separating one point from (the closure of) the other.

Although the definitions presented here for "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" are not uncommon, there is significant variation in the literature: some authors switch the definitions of "regular" and "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;" as they are used here, or use both terms interchangeably. In this article, we will use the term "regular" freely, but we will usually say "regular Hausdorff", which is unambiguous, instead of the less precise "T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;". For more on this issue, see [[History of the separation axioms]].

A [[locally regular space]] is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is regular. Every regular space is locally regular, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a locally regular space that is not regular is the [[bug-eyed line]].

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
A regular space is necessarily also [[preregular space|preregular]], i.e., any two [[topologically distinguishable]] points can be separated by neighbourhoods.
Since a Hausdorff space is the same as a preregular [[Kolmogorov space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]], a regular space which is also T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must be Hausdorff (and thus T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
In fact, a regular Hausdorff space satisfies the slightly stronger condition [[Urysohn space|T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt;]].
(However, such a space need not be [[Completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]].)
Thus, the definition of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may cite T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], or T&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; instead of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Hausdorffness); all are equivalent in the context of regular spaces.

Speaking more theoretically, the conditions of regularity and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ness are related by [[Kolmogorov quotient]]s.
A space is regular if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; and, as mentioned, a space is T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it's both regular and T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
Thus a regular space encountered in practice can usually be assumed to be T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by replacing the space with its Kolmogorov quotient.

There are many results for topological spaces that hold for both regular and Hausdorff spaces.
Most of the time, these results hold for all preregular spaces; they were listed for regular and Hausdorff spaces separately because the idea of preregular spaces came later.
On the other hand, those results that are truly about regularity generally don't also apply to nonregular Hausdorff spaces.

There are many situations where another condition of topological spaces (such as [[normal space|normality]], [[Pseudonormal space|pseudonormality]], [[paracompactness]], or [[local compactness]]) will imply regularity if some weaker separation axiom, such as preregularity, is satisfied.
Such conditions often come in two versions: a regular version and a Hausdorff version.
Although Hausdorff spaces aren't generally regular, a Hausdorff space that is also (say) locally compact will be regular, because any Hausdorff space is preregular.
Thus from a certain point of view, regularity is not really the issue here, and we could impose a weaker condition instead to get the same result.
However, definitions are usually still phrased in terms of regularity, since this condition is more well known than any weaker one.

Most topological spaces studied in [[mathematical analysis]] are regular; in fact, they are usually [[completely regular space|completely regular]], which is a stronger condition.
Regular spaces should also be contrasted with [[normal space]]s.

== Examples and nonexamples ==
A [[zero-dimensional space]] with respect to the [[small inductive dimension]] has a [[Base (topology)|base]] consisting of [[clopen set]]s.
Every such space is regular.

As described above, any [[completely regular space]] is regular, and any T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space that is not [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (and hence not preregular) cannot be regular.
Most examples of regular and nonregular spaces studied in mathematics may be found in those two articles.
On the other hand, spaces that are regular but not completely regular, or preregular but not regular, are usually constructed only to provide [[counterexample]]s to conjectures, showing the boundaries of possible [[theorem]]s.
Of course, one can easily find regular spaces that are not T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus not Hausdorff, such as an [[indiscrete space]], but these examples provide more insight on the [[Kolmogorov axiom|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; axiom]] than on regularity.  An example of a regular space that is not completely regular is the [[Tychonoff corkscrew]].

Most interesting spaces in mathematics that are regular also satisfy some stronger condition.
Thus, regular spaces are usually studied to find properties and theorems, such as the ones below, that are actually applied to completely regular spaces, typically in analysis.

There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular.  An example is the set '''R''' with the topology generated by sets of the form ''U&amp;nbsp;— C'', where ''U'' is an open set in the usual sense, and ''C'' is any countable subset of ''U''.

== Elementary properties ==
Suppose that ''X'' is a regular space.
Then, given any point ''x'' and neighbourhood ''G'' of ''x'', there is a closed neighbourhood ''E'' of ''x'' that is a [[subset]] of ''G''.
In fancier terms, the closed neighbourhoods of ''x'' form a [[local base]] at ''x''.
In fact, this property characterises regular spaces; if the closed neighbourhoods of each point in a topological space form a local base at that point, then the space must be regular.

Taking the [[interior (topology)|interior]]s of these closed neighbourhoods, we see that the [[regular open set]]s form a [[base (topology)|base]] for the open sets of the regular space ''X''.
This property is actually weaker than regularity; a topological space whose regular open sets form a base is ''[[semiregular space|semiregular]]''.

A '''self-organizing map''' ('''SOM''') or '''self-organizing feature map''' ('''SOFM''') is a type of [[artificial neural network]] (ANN) that is trained using [[unsupervised learning]] to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a '''map''', and is therefore a method to do [[dimensionality reduction]]. Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply [[competitive learning]] as opposed to error-correction learning (such as [[backpropagation]] with [[gradient descent]]), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the [[Topology|topological]] properties of the input space.

[[File:Synapse Self-Organizing Map.png|thumb|right|300px|A self-organizing map showing [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] voting patterns. The input data was a table with a row for each member of Congress, and columns for certain votes containing each member's yes/no/abstain vote. The SOM algorithm arranged these members in a two-dimensional grid placing similar members closer together. '''The first plot''' shows the grouping when the data are split into two clusters. '''The second plot''' shows average distance to neighbours: larger distances are darker. '''The third plot''' predicts [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] (red) or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] (blue) party membership. '''The other plots''' each overlay the resulting map with predicted values on an input dimension: red means a predicted 'yes' vote on that bill, blue means a 'no' vote. The plot was created in [[Peltarion Synapse|Synapse]].]]&lt;!--
--&gt;
This makes SOMs useful for [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] by creating low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to [[multidimensional scaling]]. The artificial neural network introduced by the [[Finland|Finnish]] professor [[Teuvo Kohonen]] in the 1980s is sometimes called a '''Kohonen map''' or '''network'''.&lt;ref name="KohonenMap"&gt;{{cite web |title= Kohonen Network |last1= Kohonen |first1= Teuvo |last2= Honkela |first2= Timo |year= 2007 |work= Scholarpedia |url= http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kohonen_network }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kohonen |first= Teuvo |year= 1982 |title= Self-Organized Formation of Topologically Correct Feature Maps |journal= Biological Cybernetics |volume= 43 |number= 1 |pages= 59–69 |doi= 10.1007/bf00337288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kohonen net is a computationally convenient abstraction building on biological models of neural systems from the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Von der Malsburg | first1 = C | year = 1973 | title = Self-organization of orientation sensitive cells in the striate cortex | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 85–100 | doi=10.1007/bf00288907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[morphogenesis]] models dating back to [[Alan Turing]] in the  1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = Alan | year = 1952 | title = The chemical basis of morphogenesis | url = | journal = Phil.

While it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to [[Feedforward neural networks|feedforward networks]] where the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation.

Useful extensions include using [[Torus|toroidal]] grids where opposite edges are connected and using large numbers of nodes.

It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to [[K-means algorithm|K-means]], larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character.

It is also common to use the [[U-Matrix]].&lt;ref name="UltschSiemon1990"&gt;{{cite book |first= Alfred |last= Ultsch |first2= H.

== Structure and operations ==

Like most artificial neural networks, SOMs operate in two modes: training and mapping. "Training" builds the map using input examples (a [[competitive learning|competitive process]], also called [[vector quantization]]), while "mapping" automatically classifies a new input vector.

The visible part of a self-organizing map is the map space, it consists of components called nodes or neurons.  The map space is defined beforehand, usually as a finite two-dimensional region where nodes are arranged in a regular [[hexagonal]] or [[rectangular]] grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ics.aalto.fi/jhollmen/dippa/node9.html |author=Jaakko Hollmen |date=9 March 1996 |title=Self-Organizing Map (SOM) |website=[[Aalto University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each node is associated with a "weight" vector, which is a position in the input space; that is, it has the same dimension as each input vector.  While nodes in the map space stay fixed, training consists in moving weight vectors toward the input data (reducing a distance metric) without spoiling the topology induced from the map space.  Thus, the self-organizing map describes a mapping from a higher-dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional map space.  Once trained, the map can classify a vector from the input space by finding the node with the closest (smallest distance metric) weight vector to the input space vector.

== Learning algorithm ==
The goal of learning in the self-organizing map is to cause different parts of the network to respond similarly to certain input patterns. This is partly motivated by how visual, auditory or other [[sense|sensory]] information is handled in separate parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] in the [[human brain]].&lt;ref name="Haykin"&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Haykin |title=Neural networks - A comprehensive foundation |chapter=9. Self-organizing maps |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-908385-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blue blob is the distribution of the training data, and the small white disc is the current training datum drawn from that distribution. At first (left) the SOM nodes are arbitrarily positioned in the data space. The node (highlighted in yellow) which is nearest to the training datum is selected. It is moved towards the training datum, as (to a lesser extent) are its neighbors on the grid. After many iterations the grid tends to approximate the data distribution (right).]]&lt;!--

The weights of the neurons are initialized either to small random values or sampled evenly from the subspace spanned by the two largest [[principal component]] [[eigenvectors]]. With the latter alternative, learning is much faster because the initial weights already give a good approximation of SOM weights.&lt;ref name="SOMIntro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Intro to SOM |first=Teuvo |last=Kohonen |work=SOM Toolbox |url=http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/theory/somalgorithm.shtml |year=2005&lt;!-- last updated 18 March 2005 --&gt; |accessdate=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network must be fed a large number of example vectors that represent, as close as possible, the kinds of vectors expected during mapping. The examples are usually administered several times as iterations.

The training utilizes [[competitive learning]]. When a training example is fed to the network, its [[Euclidean distance]] to all weight vectors is computed. The neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input is called the best matching unit (BMU). The weights of the BMU and neurons close to it in the SOM grid are adjusted towards the input vector. The magnitude of the change decreases with time and with the grid-distance from the BMU. The update formula for a neuron v with weight vector '''W&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'''(s) is
:&lt;math&gt;W_{v}(s + 1) = W_{v}(s) + \theta(u, v, s) \cdot \alpha(s) \cdot (D(t) - W_{v}(s))&lt;/math&gt;,
where s is the step index, t an index into the training sample, u is the index of the BMU for '''D'''(t), α(s) is a [[monotonically decreasing]] learning coefficient and '''D'''(t) is the input vector; Θ(u, v, s) is the neighborhood function which gives the distance between the neuron u and the neuron v in step s.&lt;ref name="Scholarpedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kohonen_network|title=Kohonen network|last2=Honkela|first2=Timo|year=2011&lt;!-- last approved revision 2011-11-15 --&gt;|first1=Teuvo|last1=Kohonen|work=Scholarpedia|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;!--

Consider first data items that are n-dimensional Euclidean vectors x(t)=[ξ1(t),ξ2(t),…,ξn(t)]. Here t is the index of the data item in a given sequence. Let the ith model be mi(t)=[μi1(t),μi2(t),…,μin(t)], where now t denotes the index in the sequence in which the models are generated.

The equation mi(t+1)=mi(t)+α(t)hci(t)[x(t)−mi(t)] thus uses the symbol t to mean *two different things*: the t of x(t) is not the t of m, α and h. This is why we use s and t here.

Ultsch &amp; Siemon 1990 also use three nested loops when describing Kohonen's algorithm: the outer one is over the training steps (and controls the decay of Θ and α (called n and η, respectively, in their paper)), the middle one is over the data items, and the inner is over the neurons.
--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the implementations, t can scan the training data set systematically (t is 0, 1, 2...T-1, then repeat, T being the training sample's size), be randomly drawn from the data set ([[bootstrap sampling]]), or implement some other sampling method (such as [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknifing]]).

The neighborhood function Θ(u, v, s) depends on the grid-distance between the BMU (neuron ''u)'' and neuron ''v''. In the simplest form it is 1 for all neurons close enough to BMU and 0 for others, but a [[Gaussian function]] is a common choice, too. Regardless of the functional form, the neighborhood function shrinks with time.&lt;ref name="Haykin" /&gt; At the beginning when the neighborhood is broad, the self-organizing takes place on the global scale. When the neighborhood has shrunk to just a couple of neurons, the weights are converging to local estimates. In some implementations the learning coefficient α and the neighborhood function Θ decrease steadily with increasing s, in others (in particular those where t scans the training data set) they decrease in step-wise fashion, once every T steps.

This process is repeated for each input vector for a (usually large) number of cycles '''λ'''. The network winds up associating output nodes with groups or patterns in the input data set. If these patterns can be named, the names can be attached to the associated nodes in the trained net.

During mapping, there will be one single ''winning'' neuron: the neuron whose weight vector lies closest to the input vector. This can be simply determined by calculating the Euclidean distance between input vector and weight vector.

While representing input data as vectors has been emphasized in this article, it should be noted that any kind of object which can be represented digitally, which has an appropriate distance measure associated with it, and in which the necessary operations for training are possible can be used to construct a self-organizing map. This includes matrices, continuous functions or even other self-organizing maps.

===SOM Initialization===
Selection of a good initial approximation is a well-known problem for all iterative methods of learning neural networks. Kohonen&lt;ref&gt;T. Kohonen,  Self-Organization and Associative Memory. Springer, Berlin, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; used random initiation of SOM weights. Recently, principal component initialization, in which initial map weights are chosen from the space of the first principal components, has become popular due to the exact reproducibility of the results.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ciampi, Y. Lechevallier,   Clustering large, multi-level data sets: An approach based on Kohonen self organizing maps, in D.A. Zighed, J. Komorowski, J. Zytkow (Eds.), PKDD 2000, Springer LNCS (LNAI), vol. 1910, pp. 353-358, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful comparison of the random initiation approach to principal component initialization for one-dimensional SOM (models of principal curves) demonstrated that the advantages of principal component SOM initialization are not universal. The best initialization method depends on the geometry of the specific dataset. Principal component initialization is preferable (in dimension one) if the principal curve approximating the dataset can be univalently and linearly projected on the first principal component (quasilinear sets). For nonlinear datasets, however, random initiation performs better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akinduko | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Mirkes | first2 = E.M. | last3 = Gorban | first3 = A.N. | year = 2016 | title = SOM: Stochastic initialization versus principal components | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283768202_SOM_Stochastic_initialization_versus_principal_components | journal = Information Sciences | volume =  364-365| issue = | pages =  213–221| doi = 10.1016/j.ins.2015.10.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Fisher's Iris Flower Data===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=June 2017}}
Consider an {{math|''n''×''m''}} array of nodes, each of which contains a weight vector and is aware of its location in the array. Each weight vector is of the same dimension as the node's input vector. The weights may initially be set to random values.

Now we need input to feed the map.  Colors can be represented by their red, green, and blue components. Consequently, we will represent colors as vectors in the [[unit cube]] of the [[Free module#Formal linear combinations|free vector space over {{mvar|ℝ}} generated by the basis]]:
:R = &lt;255, 0, 0&gt;
:G = &lt;0, 255, 0&gt;
:B = &lt;0, 0, 255&gt;

The diagram shown [[File:SOM of RGB and eight colors.JPG|thumb|Self organizing maps (SOM) of three and eight colors with U-Matrix.]] compares the results of training on the data sets&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;These data sets are not [[Normalized vector|normalized]].  Normalization would be necessary to train the SOM.&lt;/ref&gt;
:threeColors = [255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0], [0, 0, 255]
:eightColors = [0, 0, 0], [255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0], [0, 0, 255], [255, 255, 0], [0, 255, 255], [255, 0, 255], [255, 255, 255]

and the original images.  Note the striking resemblance between the two.

Similarly, after training a {{math|40×40}} grid of neurons for 250 iterations with a learning rate of 0.1 on [[Fisher's Iris]], the map can already detect the main differences between species.

There are two ways to interpret a SOM. Because in the training phase weights of the whole neighborhood are moved in the same direction, similar items tend to excite adjacent neurons. Therefore, SOM forms a semantic map where similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar ones apart. This may be visualized by a [[U-Matrix]] (Euclidean distance between weight vectors of neighboring cells) of the SOM.&lt;ref name="UltschSiemon1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultsch2003"&gt;Ultsch, Alfred (2003); ''U*-Matrix: A tool to visualize clusters in high dimensional data'', Department of Computer Science, University of Marburg, [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/datenbionik/pdf/pubs/2003/ultsch03ustar Technical Report Nr. 36:1-12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saadatdoost, Robab, Alex Tze Hiang Sim, and Jafarkarimi, Hosein. "Application of self organizing map for knowledge discovery based in higher education data." Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS), 2011 International Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other way is to think of neuronal weights as pointers to the input space. They form a discrete approximation of the distribution of training samples. More neurons point to regions with high training sample concentration and fewer where the samples are scarce.

SOM may be considered a nonlinear generalization of [[Principal components analysis]] (PCA).&lt;ref&gt;Yin, Hujun; ''Learning Nonlinear Principal Manifolds by Self-Organising Maps'', in [[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|Gorban, Alexander N.]]; Kégl, Balázs; Wunsch, Donald C.; and Zinovyev, Andrei (Eds.); [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271642170_Principal_Manifolds_for_Data_Visualisation_and_Dimension_Reduction_LNCSE_58 ''Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction''], Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering (LNCSE), vol. 58, Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-73749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown, using both artificial and real geophysical data, that SOM has many advantages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Yonggang | last2 = Weisberg | first2 = Robert H | year = 2005 | title = Patterns of Ocean Current Variability on the West Florida Shelf Using the Self-Organizing Map | url = http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004JC002786.shtml | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 110 | issue = | page = C06003 | doi = 10.1029/2004JC002786 | bibcode=2005JGRC..110.6003L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Yonggang | last2 = Weisberg | first2 = Robert H. | last3 = Mooers | first3 = Christopher N.

Originally, SOM was not formulated as a solution to an optimisation problem. Nevertheless, there have been several attempts to modify the definition of SOM and to formulate an optimisation problem which gives similar results.&lt;ref&gt;Heskes, Tom; [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.6572 ''Energy Functions for Self-Organizing Maps''], in Oja, Erkki; and Kaski, Samuel (Eds.), ''Kohonen Maps'', Elsevier, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Elastic map]]s use the mechanical metaphor of elasticity to approximate [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction#Principal curves and manifolds|principal manifolds]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|Gorban, Alexander N.]]; Kégl, Balázs; Wunsch, Donald C.; and Zinovyev, Andrei (Eds.); [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271642170_Principal_Manifolds_for_Data_Visualisation_and_Dimension_Reduction_LNCSE_58 ''Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction''], Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering (LNCSE), vol. 58, Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-73749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the analogy is an elastic membrane and plate.

== Alternatives ==
* The '''[[generative topographic map]]''' (GTM) is a potential alternative to SOMs. In the sense that a GTM explicitly requires a smooth and continuous mapping from the input space to the map space, it is topology preserving. However, in a practical sense, this measure of topological preservation is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaski |first=Samuel |title=Data Exploration Using Self-Organizing Maps |journal=Acta Polytechnica Scandinavica |series=Mathematics, Computing and Management in Engineering Series No. 82 |year=1997 |publisher=Finnish Academy of Technology |location=Espoo, Finland |isbn=952-5148-13-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[time adaptive self-organizing map]]''' (TASOM) network is an extension of the basic SOM. The TASOM employs adaptive learning rates and neighborhood functions. It also includes a scaling parameter to make the network invariant to scaling, translation and rotation of the input space. The TASOM and its variants have been used in several applications including adaptive clustering, multilevel thresholding, input space approximation, and active contour modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hamed |last=Shah-Hosseini |first2=Reza |last2=Safabakhsh |title=TASOM: A New Time Adaptive Self-Organizing Map |journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics—Part B: Cybernetics |volume=33 |number=2 |date=April 2003 |pages=271–282 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1187438&amp;tag=1 |doi=10.1109/tsmcb.2003.810442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a Binary Tree TASOM or BTASOM, resembling a binary natural tree having nodes composed of TASOM networks has been proposed where the number of its levels and the number of its nodes are adaptive with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hamed |last=Shah-Hosseini |title=Binary Tree Time Adaptive Self-Organizing Map |journal=Neurocomputing |volume=74 |number=11 |date=May 2011 |pages=1823–1839 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231211000786 |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2010.07.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[growing self-organizing map]]''' (GSOM) is a growing variant of the self-organizing map. The GSOM was developed to address the issue of identifying a suitable map size in the SOM. It starts with a minimal number of nodes (usually four) and grows new nodes on the boundary based on a heuristic. By using a value called the ''spread factor'', the data analyst has the ability to control the growth of the GSOM.
* The '''[[elastic map]]s''' approach&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Gorban, A. Zinovyev, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1122 Principal manifolds and graphs in practice: from molecular biology to dynamical systems], [[International Journal of Neural Systems]], Vol. 20, No. 3 (2010) 219–232.&lt;/ref&gt; borrows from the [[spline interpolation]] the idea of minimization of the [[elastic energy]]. In learning, it minimizes the sum of quadratic bending and stretching energy with the [[least squares]] [[approximation error]].
* The conformal approach &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Kuo | first2=Y.-T. | title=Conformal Self-organizing Map for a Genus Zero Manifold |journal=The Visual Computer |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=340–353 |date=2005 |doi=10.1007/s00371-005-0290-6 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00371-005-0290-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Tai | first2=W.-P. | title=Conformality in the self-organization network |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=116 |pages=265–286 |date=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00093-4 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370299000934}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses conformal mapping to interpolate each training sample between grid nodes in a continuous surface. A one-to-one smooth mapping is possible in this approach.
* The '''[[oriented and scalable map]]''' (OS-Map) generalises the neighborhood function and the winner selection&lt;ref&gt;Hua, H., 2016. Image and geometry processing with Oriented and Scalable Map. Neural Networks, 77, pp.1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;. The homogeneous Gaussian neighborhood function is replaced with the matrix exponential. Thus one can specify the orientation either in the map space or in the data space. SOM has a fixed scale (=1), so that the maps "optimally describe the domain of observation". But what about a map covering the domain twice or in n-folds? This entails the conception of scaling. The OS-Map regards the scale as a statistical description of how many best-matching nodes an input has in the map.

The '''Swarm Development Group''' ('''SDG''') is an American non-profit organization to advance the development of [[complex adaptive system]]-oriented [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) tools initiated at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, US. It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by [[Chris Langton]]. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called [[artificial life]].  The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.

The role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_SwarmFest SwarmFest]&lt;/ref&gt; during May, June, or July each summer – typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] (University of Chicago) and Ascape&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/es/dynamics/models/ascape/ Ascape]&lt;/ref&gt; (Brookings).  Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest.   The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute.   From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.

Recent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions.  SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.depaul.edu/news/default.asp School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois.  Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on [[agent based modeling]] in [[Systems Biology]], and the implementation of [[agent based model]]s in [[high-performance computing]] environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].  Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8–9.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ucf.edu/swarmfest2013.html SwarmFest2013]&lt;/ref&gt; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 – July 1, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |title=SwarmFest2014 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001230/http://www.swarmfest2014.org/ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |title=SwarmFest2015 |accessdate=2018-02-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117084740/http://www.swarmfest2015.org/ |archivedate=January 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/swarmfest2016/ SwarmFest2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://swarmfest2017.org/ SwarmFest2017]&lt;/ref&gt; were the selected venues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">In [[mathematics]], the ''n''-fold '''symmetric product''' of an [[algebraic curve]] ''C'' is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of the ''n''-fold [[cartesian product]]

:''C'' &amp;times; ''C'' &amp;times; ... &amp;times; ''C''

or ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[group action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' letters permuting the factors. It exists as a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[algebraic variety]] Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''; if ''C'' is a [[compact Riemann surface]] it is therefore a [[complex manifold]]. Its interest in relation to the classical geometry of curves is that its points correspond to [[effective divisor]]s on ''C'' of degree&amp;nbsp;''n'', that is, [[formal sum]]s of points with non-negative integer coefficients.

For ''C'' the [[projective line]] (say the [[Riemann sphere]]) Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C'' can be identified with [[projective space]] of dimension&amp;nbsp;''n''.

If ''G'' has [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 then the Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C'' are closely related to the [[Jacobian variety]] ''J'' of ''C''. More accurately for ''n'' taking values up to ''g'' they form a sequence of approximations to ''J'' from below: their images in ''J'' under addition on ''J'' (see [[theta-divisor]]) have dimension ''n'' and fill up ''J'', with some identifications caused by [[special divisor]]s.

For ''g'' = ''n'' we have Σ&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;''C'' actually [[birationally equivalent]] to ''J''; the Jacobian is a [[blowing down]] of the symmetric product. That means that at the level of [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]s it is possible to construct ''J'' by taking [[linearly disjoint]] copies of the function field of ''C'', and within their [[compositum]] taking the [[fixed subfield]] of the symmetric group. This is the source of [[André Weil]]'s technique of constructing ''J'' as an [[abstract variety]] from 'birational data'. Other ways of constructing ''J'', for example as a [[Picard variety]], are preferred now ([[Greg W. Anderson]] (''Advances in Mathematics'' 172 (2002) 169–205) provided an elementary construction as lines of matrices). But this does mean that for any rational function ''F'' on ''C''

:''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... + ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;)

makes sense as a rational function on ''J'', for the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; staying away from the poles of ''F''.

For ''N''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' the mapping from Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C'' to ''J'' by addition fibers it over ''J''; when ''n'' is large enough (around twice ''g'') this becomes a [[projective space]] bundle (the '''Picard bundle'''). It has been studied in detail, for example by Kempf and Mukai.

==Betti numbers and the Euler characteristic of the symmetric product==
Let ''C'' be smooth and projective of genus ''g'' over the complex numbers '''C'''. The Betti numbers ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;C) of the symmetric product are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \sum_{i = 0}^{2n} b_i( \Sigma^n C ) y^n u^{i-n} = \frac{ (1 + y)^{2g} }{ (1 - u y) (1 - u^{-1} y) }&lt;/math&gt;
and the topological Euler characteristic ''e''(Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;C) is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} e( \Sigma^n C ) p^n = (1 - p)^{2g - 2} . &lt;/math&gt;
Here we have set ''u''=-1 and ''y'' = - ''p'' in the formula before.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">An '''undulating number''' is a number that has the digit form ABABAB... when in the [[decimal|base 10]] number system. It is sometimes restricted to non-trivial undulating numbers which are required to have at least 3 digits and A ≠ B. The first few such numbers are: 

:[[101 (number)|101]], [[121 (number)|121]], [[131 (number)|131]], [[141 (number)|141]], [[151 (number)|151]], [[161 (number)|161]], [[171 (number)|171]], [[181 (number)|181]], [[191 (number)|191]], [[202 (number)|202]], [[212 (number)|212]], [[232 (number)|232]], [[242 (number)|242]], [[252 (number)|252]], [[262 (number)|262]], [[272 (number)|272]], [[282 (number)|282]], [[292 (number)|292]], [[303 (number)|303]], [[313 (number)|313]], 323, 343, 353, 363, 373, 383, 393, 404, 414, 424, 434, 454, 464, 474, 484, 494, ... {{OEIS|id=A046075}}

For the full sequence of undulating numbers, see {{oeis|id=A033619}}.

Some higher undulating numbers are: 6363, 80808, 1717171.

For any ''n'' ≥ 3, there are 9 &amp;times; 9 = 81 non-trivial ''n''-digit undulating numbers, since the first digit can have 9 values (it cannot be 0), and the second digit can have 9 values when it must be different from the first.

== Undulating prime ==

An ''undulating prime'' is an undulating number that is also prime. In every base, all undulating primes having at least 3 digits have an odd number of digits. The undulating primes in base 10 are:
:2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, 18181, 32323, 35353, 72727, 74747, 78787, 94949, 95959, ... {{OEIS|id=A032758}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">In mathematics and [[logic]], a '''vacuous truth''' is a [[Statement (logic)|statement]] that asserts that [[Universal quantification|all]] members of the [[empty set]] have a certain [[Property (philosophy)|property]]. For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be [[Truth|true]] whenever there are no [[cell phone]]s in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned ''on''" would also be vacuously true, as would the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on ''and'' turned off".

More formally, a relatively [[Well-definition|well-defined]] usage refers to a [[Counterfactual conditional|conditional]] statement with a false [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]. One example of such a statement is "if [[Uluru]] is in [[France]], then the [[Eiffel Tower]] is in [[Bolivia]]". Such statements are considered vacuous because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the [[consequent]]. They are true because a [[material conditional]] is defined to be true when the antecedent is false (regardless of whether the conclusion is true).

In [[pure mathematics]], vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithms and Data Structures: The Science of Computing|first1=Douglas L.|last1=Baldwin|first2=Greg W.|last2=Scragg|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn= 9781285225128|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETA9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has relevance in [[pure mathematics]], as well as in any other field which uses [[classical logic]].

Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about [[Qualifier|qualified]] objects which [[Nonexistence|do not actually exist]]. For example, a child might tell their parent "I ate every vegetable on my plate", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with.

A statement &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is "vacuously true" if it [[Logical form|resembles]] the statement &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is known to be false.

Statements that can be reduced ([[Mutatis mutandis|with suitable transformations]]) to this basic form include the following [[Universal quantifier|universally quantified]] statements:
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x: P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where it is the case that &lt;math&gt;\forall x: \neg P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in A: Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|empty]].
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \xi: Q(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;, where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to a [[type (type theory)|type]] that has no representatives.

Vacuous truth most commonly appears in [[classical logic]], which in particular is [[Binary decision|two-valued]]. However, vacuous truth also appears in, for example, [[intuitionistic logic]] in the same situations given above. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; will yield vacuous truth in any logic that uses the [[material conditional]]; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Contradiction|necessary falsehood]], then it will also yield vacuous truth under the [[strict conditional]].

Other non-classical logics (for example, [[relevance logic]]) may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (for example, the [[counterfactual conditional]]).

== Examples ==

These examples, one from [[mathematics]] and one from [[natural language]], illustrate the concept:

"For any integer x, if x &gt; 5 then x &gt; 3."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What precisely is a vacuous truth?|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1257728}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This statement is [[Truth|true]] non-vacuously (since some [[integer]]s are greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that "if 2 &gt; 5 then 2 &gt; 3".

"All my children are cats" is a vacuous truth when spoken by someone without children.

* [[Empty sum]] and [[Empty product]]
* [[Paradoxes of material implication]], especially the [[Principle of explosion]]
*[[Presupposition]]; [[Double question]]
* [[Tautology (logic)]] – another type of true statement that also fails to convey any substantive information
* [[Triviality (mathematics)]] and [[Degeneracy (mathematics)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9037">'''Victor Yakovlevich Pan''' ({{lang-ru|Пан Виктор Яковлевич}}) is a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]], known for his research on [[algorithm]]s for [[polynomial]]s and [[matrix multiplication]].

==Education and career==
Pan earned his Ph.D. at [[Moscow University]] in 1964, under the supervision of [[Anatoli Georgievich Vitushkin]],{{r|mgp}} and continued his work at the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]]. During that time, he published a number of significant papers and became known informally as "polynomial Pan" for his pioneering work in the area of [[polynomial]] [[computation]]s. In late 1970s, he immigrated to the [[United States]] and held positions at several institutions including [[IBM Research]]. Since 1988, he has taught at [[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]].{{r|lehman}}

==Contributions==
Victor Pan is an expert in [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] and has developed a number of new [[algorithms]]. One of his notable early results is a proof that the number of multiplications in [[Horner's method]] is optimal.{{ran|CVP}}

In the theory of [[matrix multiplication algorithm]]s, Pan in 1978 published an algorithm with running time &lt;math&gt;O(n^{2.795})&lt;/math&gt;. This was the first improvement over the [[Strassen algorithm]], and kicked off a long line of improvements in fast matrix multiplication that later included the [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] and subsequent developments.{{ran|SNO}} He wrote the text ''How to Multiply Matrices Faster'' (Springer, 1984) surveying early developments in this area.{{r|how}}{{ran|HMM}} In 1998, with his student Xiaohan Huang, Pan showed that matrix multiplication algorithms can take advantage of rectangular matrices with unbalanced [[aspect ratio]]s, multiplying them more quickly than the time bounds one would obtain using square matrix multiplication algorithms.{{ran|FRM}}

Since that work, Pan has returned to symbolic and numeric computation and to an earlier theme of his research, computations with polynomials. He developed fast algorithms for the numerical computation of polynomial [[Zero of a function|roots]],{{ran|UP}}
and, with Bernard Mourrain, algorithms for multivariate polynomials based on their relations to structured matrices.{{r|jcbpa}}{{ran|MPD}}
He also authored or co-authored several more books, on matrix and polynomial computation,{{r|polymat}}{{ran|PMC}}
structured matrices,{{r|struc}}{{ran|SMP}} and on
numerical root-finding proceedures.{{r|numroot}}{{ran|NMR}}

==Recognition==
Pan was appointed [[Distinguished Professor]] at Lehman College in 2000.{{r|lehman}}

In 2013 he became a [[fellow]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]], for "contributions to the mathematical theory of computation".{{r|fams}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''butterfly lemma''' or '''Zassenhaus lemma''', named after [[Hans Zassenhaus]], is a technical result on the [[lattice of subgroups]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] or the [[lattice of submodules]] of a module, or more generally for any [[modular lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Associative algebras |first=R.S. |last=Pierce |publisher=Springer |at=p. 27, exercise 1 |year=1982 |isbn=0-387-90693-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lemma:''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group with [[subgroup]]s &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;B\triangleleft A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D\triangleleft C&lt;/math&gt;

are [[normal subgroup]]s. Then there is an [[isomorphism]] of [[quotient group]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(A\cap C)B}{(A\cap D)B}\ \cong\ \frac{(A\cap C)D}{(B\cap C)D}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to the case of a [[group with operators]] &lt;math&gt;(G, \Omega)&lt;/math&gt; with [[stable subgroup]]s &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the above statement being the case of &lt;math&gt;\Omega=G&lt;/math&gt; acting on itself by conjugation.

Zassenhaus proved this lemma specifically to give the most direct proof of the [[Schreier refinement theorem]]. The 'butterfly' becomes apparent when trying to draw the [[Hasse diagram]] of the various groups involved.

Zassenhaus' lemma for groups can be derived from a more general result known as [[Goursat's lemma|Goursat's theorem]] stated in a [[Goursat variety]] (of which groups are an instance); however the group-specific [[Lattice_of_subgroups#Properties|modular law]] also needs to be used in the derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Aldo Ursini |editor2=Paulo Agliano |title=Logic and Algebra |year=1996 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-9606-8 |pages=161–180 |author=J.
