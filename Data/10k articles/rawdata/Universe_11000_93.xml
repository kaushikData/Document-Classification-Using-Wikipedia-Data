'''Asymmetry of lift''' describes an aspect of the nature of [[aerodynamic lift]] generation along the length of an individual [[helicopter rotor|rotor blade]] of a [[helicopter]].

[[Image:Autorotational regions.jpg|thumb|Overhead view of helicopter rotors. The rotor tips travel much faster than the inner sections, so produce more lift. (For the purposes of this article, the demarcated circular regions are irrelevant and should be ignored.)]]
The phenomenon is most easily envisaged when a helicopter is [[hover (helicopter)|hover]]ing, that is, maintaining a fixed position above a fixed point, and with no wind in the atmosphere.

A helicopter rotor blade is an [[airfoil|aerofoil]], acting like the [[wing]] on an aeroplane being driven through the air to create lift. In the case of a fixed-wing aircraft in normal flight, the entire [[wing]] travels forward through the air at the same speed. In the case of helicopter rotor blades, the tips of the blade travel very fast through the air  while the parts near the rotor hub travel much more slowly. Because lift increases with speed, the outermost sections of the rotor blades generate more lift than those parts closer to the rotor hub. So a rotor blade is said to be an ''aysmmetric generator of lift'', because of the difference in lift generated along its length.

Helicopter manufacturers try to reduce this differential effect (that is, aim for more equality of lift along the blade length).  This has two main aspects:
# tapering a blade toward its tip, which reduces its surface area, in turn reducing its lift;
# twisting the blade (commonly called geometric twist) so that the blade root near the hub presents a higher angle-of-attack, thus higher lift.

When the helicopter is travelling forwards with respect to the atmosphere, a further phenomenon comes into play, [[dissymmetry of lift]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">In [[mathematics]], a '''Benz plane''' is a type of 2-[[dimension]]al [[Geometry|geometrical]] structure, named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Walter Benz]]. The term was applied to a group of objects that arise from a common [[axiomatization]] of certain structures and split into three families, which were introduced separately: [[Möbius plane]]s, [[Laguerre plane]]s, and [[Minkowski plane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W. Benz, ''Vorlesungen über Geomerie der Algebren'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;F. Buekenhout (ed.), ''Handbook of [[Incidence (geometry)|Incidence Geometry]]'', [[Elsevier]] (1995) {{ISBN|0-444-88355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Möbius plane ==
{{main|Möbius plane}}

[[Image:Moebius-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Möbius plane: 2d/3d model]]
Starting from the real [[euclidean plane]] and merging the set of lines with the set of circles to a set of blocks results in an inhomogeneous [[incidence structure]]: three distinct points determine one block, but lines are distinguishable as a set of blocks that pairwise mutually intersect at one point without being tangent (or no points when parallel). Adding to the point set the new point &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, defined to lie on every line results in every block being determined by exactly three points, as well as the intersection of any two blocks following a uniform pattern (intersecting at two points, tangent or non-intersecting). This homogeneous geometry is called classical inversive geometry or a Möbius plane.  The inhomogeneity of the description (lines, circles, new point) can be seen to be non-substantive by using a 3-dimensional model. Using a [[stereographic projection]], the classical Möbius plane may be seen to be isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections (circles) on a sphere in Euclidean 3-space. 

Analogously to the (axiomatic) [[projective plane]], an (axiomatic) Möbius plane defines an incidence structure. 
Möbius planes may similarly be constructed over fields other than the real numbers.

== Laguerre plane==
{{main|Laguerre plane}}

[[Image:Laguerre-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Laguerre plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Starting again from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R^2 &lt;/math&gt; and taking the curves with equations &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; (parabolas and lines) as blocks, the following homogenization is effective: Add to the curve &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt; the new point &lt;math&gt;(\infty,a)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the set of points is &lt;math&gt;  (\R\cup{\infty})\times\R&lt;/math&gt;. This geometry of parabolas is called the classical Laguerre plane (Originally it was designed as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles. Both geometries are isomorphic.)

As for the Möbius plane, there exists a 3-dimensional model: the geometry of the elliptic plane sections on an orthogonal cylinder (in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;). An abstraction leads (analogously to the Möbius plane) to the axiomatic Laguerre plane.

==Minkowski plane==
{{main|Minkowski plane}}
[[Image:Minkowski-2d3d-model.svg|400px|thumb|classical Minkowski plane: 2d/3d-model]]
Starting from &lt;math&gt;\R^2 &lt;/math&gt; and merging the lines &lt;math&gt;y=mx+d, m\ne0&lt;/math&gt; with the hyperbolas &lt;math&gt;y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a\ne0&lt;/math&gt; in order to get the set of blocks, the following idea homogenizes the incidence structure: Add to any line the point 
&lt;math&gt;(\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and to any hyperbola &lt;math&gt;y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c, a\ne0&lt;/math&gt; the two points &lt;math&gt;(b,\infty), (\infty,c)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the point set is &lt;math&gt;(\R\cup{\infty})^2&lt;/math&gt;. This geometry of the hyperbolas is called the classical Minkowski plane.

Analogously to the classical Möbius and Laguerre planes, there exists a 3-dimensional model: The classical Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet (non degenerated quadric of index 2) in 3-dimensional projective space.  Similar to the first two cases we get the (axiomatic) Minkowski plane.

==Planar circle geometries or Benz planes==
Because of the essential role of the circle (considered as the non-degenerate [[conic]] in a [[projective plane]]) and the plane description of the original models the three types of geometries are subsumed to planar circle geometries or in honor of Walter Benz, who considered these geometric structures from a common point of view, Benz planes.

A '''Black nor'easter''' is a persistent and potentially violent north-easterly [[storm]] that occurs on the east coast of [[Australia]] during spring and summer, usually about two days a year. It is not a [[convection]] wind, but a storm system that develops offshore which can last several days. This is heralded by the rapid build-up of dense black cloud that can convert to a [[gale]] in well under one hour, and also bringing with it a heavy [[rainfall]] event usually accompanied by a [[thunderstorm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133992605 |title=NORTHCLIFFE BOATS CAPSIZE IN "BLACK NOR'EASTER. |newspaper=[[Illawarra Daily Mercury]] |location=Wollongong, NSW |date=8 January 1951 |accessdate=27 March 2015 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of storm was first recorded during the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15284763 |title=BLACK NOR-EASTER. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 October 1911 |accessdate=27 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Northeasterly [[sea breeze]]s are a common occurrence on the NSW coast during summer, generated by temperature imbalances between the sea and the land. A broader synoptic pattern however can greatly intensify these onshore winds, which results in a "Black Nor'easter", so-named because of its dark grey to virtually black clouds and the moist gale force winds (around 60 kilometres per hour) brought on by intense [[high-pressure]] systems, thus eventually bringing [[thunderstorms]], dramatic rainfall and at times [[hail]].&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/4503317.htm Stormageddon] Reporter: Anja Taylor. [[ABC News Australia]]. Tuesday, 19 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Formation===
On a hot sunny day in Sydney, the land heats up rapidly during the morning. The prevailing early morning wind is a light south-west offshore breeze (a [[katabatic wind]]) that blows from land to sea, but as the land heats up a north-east convection wind develops. A typical sea breeze, it starts shortly after sunrise on the coast and gradually pushes inland as the day proceeds, typically reaching the city by mid to late morning and the [[Greater Western Sydney]] area by early to mid afternoon. Though it doesn't dramatically decrease the temperatures as the [[southerly buster]] does, it would bring heavy rain, [[thunder]] and even [[hail]] at times.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; 

Referred as an [[anticyclone]] intensification, the nor'easter causes a sharp leap in [[wave height]]s from the east-northeast for the east coast, conjuring a strong north-east [[air current]] and east-north east storm waves over the western [[Tasman Sea]]. The winds ofttimes produce large waves and, when combined with an [[east coast low]], they bring forth the most intense storm wave environment. The north-east wind field leading warm moist tropical air to the [[subtropics]] and mid-latitudes can combine with a higher level cut off low from the [[Southern Ocean]].&lt;ref name="swellnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swellnet.com/news/swellnet-dispatch/2016/06/15/beating-heart-black-noreaster|title=From the beating heart of a Black Nor&amp;#039;Easter &amp;#124; Swellnet Dispatch|website=Swellnet|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
The 'Black Nor'Easter' swell of June 2016 remoulded areas of the east Australian coastline, with [[backyard]]s tumbling down into the sea at [[Collaroy]] and the houses adjoining them damaged. Bridges, piers, and walkways were felled as well. Almost every north facing beach endured some level of [[erosion]], from unsophisticated scouring of the [[foredune]] to waves devouring into the brown dirt. In [[Cronulla]], several large [[boulder]]s were thrown from beneath the tide zone up onto a rock platform.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

Due to the strong winds caused by the Black Nor'easterly storms, a number of people in [[New South Wales]] (especially in [[Sydney]]) have been killed by falling trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-11/falling-tree-kills-man/10363276 Man killed by falling tree in Federal as wild weather lashes northern NSW] by By Donna Harper - ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35319621 Sydney storm: Man killed after tree falls on moving car] by [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/14/man-dies-when-tree-falls-on-car-in-emu-plains-during-wild-storm Man dies when tree falls on moving car in Sydney during wild storm] by [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, such storms also bring torrential floods, strike down [[power lines]] (where thousands of homes and businesses would be left without [[electricity]]) and collapse roofs.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; 

==Notable storms==
In February 2010, Sydney received some of the highest and heaviest rainfalls in 25 years which were accompanied by violent thunderstorms and [[wind gust|gusty winds]] that cut out power and damaged homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/02/12/Storm-drenches-Sydney/UPI-14931266019035/ |title=Storm drenches Sydney |publisher=UPI.com |date=12 February 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/hundreds-of-calls-as-rain-deluges-nsw-20100213-nxqd.html |title=Sydney dries out but regional threatened |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/wild-storms-lash-sydney/13848 |title=Weather News - Wild storms lash Sydney |publisher=Weatherzone.com.au |date=13 February 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy rain was caused by remnants of ex-tropical [[2009–10 Australian region cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Olga|Cyclone Olga]] and by a massive amount of moisture blowing in on north-east winds which slammed into a [[Trough (meteorology)|low pressure trough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/rain-swamps-sydneys-water-catchments-20100206-nk2b.html |title=Rain swamps Sydney's water catchments |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=7 February 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huffer |first=Julie |url=http://hornsby-advocate.whereilive.com.au/news/story/heaviest-rain-in-almost-20-years/ |title=Heaviest rain in almost 20 years - Environment - News &amp;#124; Hornsby &amp; Upper North Shore Advocate |publisher=Hornsby-advocate.whereilive.com.au |date=10 February 2010|accessdate=1 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120043112/http://hornsby-advocate.whereilive.com.au/news/story/heaviest-rain-in-almost-20-years/ |archivedate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bucca tornado''' was one of the most violent tornadoes ever observed in [[Australia]], being the first Australian tornado to be officially rated F4 on the [[Fujita scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tornadoes |url = http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/storm1.htm |publisher  = Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate = 6 April 2008|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/storm1.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurred near the township of [[Bucca, Queensland|Bucca]] (near [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]]) in [[Queensland]] on 29 November 1992 at around 2:20pm [[Time in Australia|AEST]]. The tornado was accompanied by cricket-ball sized hail across Bucca and [[Bullyard]] regions.

The tornado damaged or destroyed nine houses, some flattened to the ground. Trees were snapped and stones were found embedded into tree trunks.

Investigations by members of the Italian parliament revealed that '''Bruno Mentasti-Granelli''', who is known as a close friend of Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], owns 33 percent of CEIGH through two companies, Hexagon Prima and Hexagon Seconda.&lt;ref name="hexagon"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=34194|title=Berlusconi, Centrex, Hexagon 1 and 2 and Gazprom|publisher=''[[The Jamestown Foundation]]''|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal was denounced due to the spreading scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=636565 The Putin and Pals Project]. Kommersant. Dec. 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Italian parliament blocked the contract, accusing Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the contract.&lt;ref name="hexagon"/&gt;

[[Robert Nowikovsky]], an Austrian lawyer linked to Russian operations, was one of the company's directors.&lt;ref name="hexagon"/&gt;

The 2008 article "Berlusconi, Centrex, Hexagon 1 and 2 and Gazprom" suggested:&lt;ref name="hexagon"/&gt;
{{quote|This subterfuge suggests that the Italian Prime Minister is deeply indebted to Moscow and will play the role of a loyal puppet, similar to that played by former German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and former EU Commissioner [[Romano Prodi]], who have been promoting the Kremlin’s energy, and possibly other, interests in their home countries and in the EU in any which way they can.}}

[[BMW]] '''CleanEnergy''' vehicles have both a [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]] and a [[petrol]] tank. If one of the tanks is empty, the [[Bivalent (engine)|bivalent]] BMW [[engine]] unit switches over automatically to the other fuel system. One decisive advantage of the combustion engine is [[bivalence]]. It enables both hydrogen and petrol to be used, thus creating the ideal conditions for a transition from non-regenerative to regenerative drive energies. During [[electrolysis]] water is split into its components of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and the oxygen is needed in the vehicle for the combustion of the hydrogen. The combustion process generates energy and water as a waste product, which returns to the natural [[water cycle]]. And so with the aid of regenerative energy suppliers, a theoretically emission-free fuel is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMW CleanEnergy.|url=http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/technology_guide/articles/bmw_cleanenergy.html|website=bmw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="826">'''Composite epoxy materials''' (CEM) are a group of [[composite material]]s typically made from woven glass fabric surfaces and non-woven glass core combined with [[epoxy]] [[synthetic resin]]. They are typically used in [[printed circuit board]]s.

There are different types of CEMs:

CEM-1 is low-cost, flame-retardant, cellulose-paper-based laminate with only one layer of woven glass fabric.

CEM-2 has cellulose paper core and woven glass fabric surface.

CEM-3 is very similar to the most commonly used PCB material, [[FR-4]]. Its color is white, and it is flame-retardant.

CEM-4 quite similar as CEM-3 but not flame-retardant.

CEM-5 (also called CRM-5) has polyester woven glass core.

The '''February 2017 North American blizzard''' was a fast-moving but powerful [[blizzard]] that affected the [[Northeastern United States]] with [[severe weather]] in the time span of February 8–9. Forming as an [[Alberta clipper]] in the northern [[United States]], the system initially produced light snowfall from the [[Midwest]] to the [[Ohio Valley]] as it tracked southeastwards. It eventually reached the [[East Coast of the United States]] and began to rapidly grow into a powerful [[nor'easter]]. Up to {{convert|18|in|cm}} of [[snow]] as well as [[blizzard]] conditions were recorded in some of the hardest hit areas before the system moved away from the coastline early on February 10.

Prior to the blizzard, unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region, with record highs of above {{convert|60|F|C}} recorded in several areas, including [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm, with some meteorologists calling the extreme weather changes "unprecedented".

== Meteorological history ==
On February 6, an [[Alberta clipper]] developed near the [[Canada–United States border]] and dove southeastwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/06/2017&amp;selmap=2017020621&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 02/06/2017|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With relatively little moisture to supply it, initial snowfall totals in the [[Great Plains|Plains]] and [[Midwest]] were light, ranging from {{convert|1–3|in|cm}}. The system quickly advanced eastwards through the heart of the country, and by 18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on February 8, a surface low had developed over the [[Arkansas]]–[[Tennessee]] state border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/08/2017&amp;selmap=2017020818&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 02/08/2017|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=8 February 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low would become the dominant low of the system as it continued towards the [[Northeastern United States]], while also producing light to moderate snow across the [[Ohio Valley]] since there was enough cold air in place from a departing storm system. As the clipper system neared the [[Tri-State area]], it began to steadily intensify and produce more moderate and heavy snow while beginning to make the transition into a [[nor'easter]].

By 09–12:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on February 9, the low had begun to move just offshore near the [[Delaware]] coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/09/2017&amp;selmap=2017020909&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 02/09/2017|work=Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BombInProgress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/09/2017&amp;selmap=2017020912&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 02/09/2017|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As very heavy snow bands (with snowfall rates of {{convert|2–4|in|cm}} in some spots) set up offshore, forecasters noted that the low was likely to rapidly deepen – or in meteorological terms, [[Explosive cyclogenesis|bomb out]] – due to the temperature contrast between the cold air to its north and moisture feeding into the storm from the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="TWCBomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-niko-bombogenesis-weather-bomb|title=Bombogenesis: Could Winter Storm Niko Become a Weather 'Bomb'?|work=The Weather Channel|date=8 February 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the storm had undergone this process, meeting the criteria for [[bombogenesis]], with the central pressure dropping from {{convert|1005|mbar|inHg}} at 18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on February 8 to {{convert|977|mbar|inHg}} by 18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on February 9 while it was offshore the [[New Jersey]] coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=02/09/2017&amp;selmap=2017020915&amp;maptype=satsfcnps|title=WPC Surface Analysis for 02/09/2017|work=Weather Prediction Center|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow slowly began to subside in areas such as eastern [[Pennsylvania]] and western New Jersey. The storm system was absorbed by another system forming off the coast of Greenland on February 11.

== Preparations and impact ==
On February 8, winter storm warnings were issued for much of the Northeast, including a blizzard warning for parts of [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-niko-forecast-northeast-megalopolis-february-2017|title=Winter Storm Niko to Become a Northeast Snowstorm: Winter Storm Warnings Issued For Philadelphia, New York City, Boston|work=weather.com|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2,400 flights were cancelled across the affected regions.&lt;ref name="TWC"/&gt;

=== New York ===
On February 8, Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] announced that schools in [[New York City]] would be closed the following day, due to the impending snowstorm.&lt;ref name="CBS-NY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/08/new-york-city-snow-preps/|title=NYC Could See Up To A Foot Of Snow Thursday; Schools To Close|work=cbslocal.com|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advising residents to stay indoors and stay off the roads, Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, "This will be a very dangerous storm.

The '''Felsenau power plant''' ({{lang-de|Kraftwerk Felsenau}}) is a [[hydroelectric power plant]] located on the river [[Aar]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland. It was built in 1909 by the city's utility company, [[Energie Wasser Bern]]. After a 1989 modernisation, the turbine hall is now used as a museum. The plant's current power output is 11.5 [[megawatt]]s.

The main building was designed by [[Eduard Locher]] and [[Alfred Brunschwyler]] in a then-popular historicising style as a "palace of technology". The 1989 expansion is by [[Vladimir Grossen]] and [[Bea Baumann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5939">'''Ferromagnetic resonance''', or FMR, is a [[spectroscopic]] technique to probe the [[magnetization]] of [[ferromagnetic]] materials.  It is a standard tool for probing [[spin wave]]s and spin dynamics. FMR is very broadly similar to [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR), and also somewhat similar to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), except that FMR probes the sample magnetization resulting from the [[magnetic moment]]s of dipolar-coupled but unpaired [[electron]]s, while NMR probes the magnetic moment of [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|atomic nuclei]] that are screened by the atomic or molecular orbitals surrounding such nuclei of non-zero nuclear spin.

== History ==
Ferromagnetic resonance was unknowingly discovered by V. K. Arkad'yev when he observed the [[Absorption (optics)|absorption]] of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radiation by [[ferromagnetic material]]s in 1911.  A qualitative explanation of FMR along with an explanation of the results from Arkad'yev was offered up by Ya. G. Dorfman in 1923 when he suggested that the [[optical]] transitions due to [[Zeeman effect|Zeeman]] splitting could provide a way to study ferromagnetic structure.

A 1935 paper published by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] predicted the existence of ferromagnetic resonance of the [[Larmor precession]], which was independently verified in experiments by J. H. E. Griffiths (UK) and [[Yevgeny Zavoisky|E. K. Zavoiskij]] (USSR) in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=J. H. E. Griffiths |title=Anomalous high-frequency resistance of ferromagnetic metals|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=158 |issue=4019 | date=1946 |pages=670–671|url= |doi=10.1038/158670a0|bibcode=1946Natur.158..670G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zavoisky | first=E. |authorlink=Yevgeny Zavoisky| last2= |first2= | year=1946 | title=Spin magnetic resonance in the decimeter-wave region | journal=Fizicheskiĭ Zhurnal | volume=10 | issue= | pages= | bibcode= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zavoisky | first=E. |authorlink=Yevgeny Zavoisky| last2= |first2= | year=1946 | title=Paramagnetic absorption in some salts in perpendicular magnetic fields | journal=Zhurnal Eksperimental'noi i Teoreticheskoi Fiziki | volume=16 | issue=7 | pages=603–606 | bibcode= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
FMR arises from the precessional motion of the (usually quite large) magnetization &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{M}&lt;/math&gt; of a ferromagnetic material in an external magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{H}&lt;/math&gt;.  The magnetic field exerts a [[torque]] on the sample magnetization which causes the magnetic moments in the sample to [[precess]].  The precession frequency of the magnetization depends on the orientation of the material, the strength of the magnetic field, as well as the macroscopic magnetization of the sample; the effective precession frequency of the ferromagnet is much lower in value from the precession frequency observed for free electrons in EPR. Moreover, linewidths of absorption peaks can be greatly affected both by dipolar-narrowing and exchange-broadening (quantum) effects. Furthermore, not all absorption peaks observed in FMR are caused by the precession of the magnetic moments of electrons in the ferromagnet. Thus, the theoretical analysis of FMR spectra is far more complex than that of EPR or NMR spectra.

The basic setup for an FMR experiment is a [[Microwave cavity|microwave resonant cavity]] with an [[electromagnet]].  The resonant cavity is fixed at a frequency in the [[super high frequency]] band.  A detector is placed at the end of the cavity to detect the microwaves. The magnetic sample is placed between the poles of the electromagnet and the [[magnetic field]] is swept while the resonant absorption intensity of the microwaves is detected.  When the magnetization precession frequency and the resonant cavity frequency are the same, absorption increases sharply which is indicated by a decrease in the intensity at the detector.

Furthermore, the resonant absorption of microwave energy causes local heating of the ferromagnet. In samples with local magnetic parameters varying on the nanometer scale this effect is used for spatial dependent spectroscopy investigations.

The resonant frequency of a film with parallel applied external field &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Charles Kittel|Kittel]] formula:&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, Charles; (2004). Introduction to Solid State Physics (8th ed.). Wiley. {{ISBN|047141526X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f = \frac{\gamma} {2 \pi} \sqrt{B (B + \mu_0 M)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetization of the ferromagnet and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kittel|first1=Charles|title=On the Theory of Ferromagnetic Resonance Absorption|journal=Physical Review|date=15 January 1948|volume=73|issue=2|pages=155–161|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.155|bibcode = 1948PhRv...73..155K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gavoshan Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Gaveh River]] {{Convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Sanandaj]] in [[Kordestan province]], [[Iran]]. It was created for the primary purpose of irrigation but also supports an 11 MW hydroelectric power station. Water from the dam's [[reservoir]] is transferred for irrigation in Kordestan and [[Kermanshah province]]s via {{Convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} Gavoshan Water Conveyance Tunnel. About {{Convert|189000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}} can be transferred annually for the irrigation of {{Convert|310|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Additionally, water from the reservoir is used to provide drinking water for the city of [[Kermanshah]] in the amount of {{Convert|63000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on}} annually. Construction on the dam began in 1992 and was completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavoshan Dam and Conveyance Tunnel|url=http://www.mahabghodss.com/project/dhp/p-Gavoshan.ASP|publisher=Mahab Ghodss Consulting|accessdate=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026170902/http://www.mahabghodss.com/project/dhp/p-Gavoshan.ASP|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated by Iran's President [[Mohammad Khatami]] on 13 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavoshan Dam Inaugurated|url=http://www.shana.ir/45226-en.html|publisher=Shana|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=13 February 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406043820/http://www.shana.ir/45226-en.html|archivedate=6 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Gibbs free energy''' ([[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommended name: '''Gibbs energy''' or '''Gibbs function'''; also known as '''free enthalpy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Greiner | first1=Walter | last2=Neise | first2=Ludwig | last3=Stöcker | first3=Horst | title=Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from [[Helmholtz free energy]]) is a [[thermodynamic potential]] that can be used to calculate the [[maximum]] of reversible [[work (physics)|work]] that may be performed by a [[thermodynamic system]] at a constant [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] ([[isothermal]], [[Isobaric process|isobaric]]).  The Gibbs free energy (ΔGº = ΔHº-TΔSº) ([[Joule|J]] in [[International System of Units|SI units]]) is the ''maximum'' amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a [[closed system|thermodynamically closed system]] (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the [[pressure]] forces.&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | last = Perrot | first = Pierre | title = A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-19-856552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gibbs energy (also referred to as ''G'') is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches [[chemical equilibrium]] at constant pressure and temperature. Its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point. As such, a reduction in ''G'' is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant [[pressure]] and [[temperature]].

The Gibbs free energy, originally called ''available energy'', was developed in the 1870s by the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]. In 1873, Gibbs described this "available energy" as
{{quote|the greatest amount of mechanical work which can be obtained from a given quantity of a certain substance in a given initial state, without increasing its total [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] or allowing heat to pass to or from external bodies, except such as at the close of the processes are left in their initial condition.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Gibbs, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces," ''[[Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' 2, Dec. 1873, pp. 382-404 (quotation on p. 400).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The initial state of the body, according to Gibbs, is supposed to be such that "the body can be made to pass from it to states of [[dissipated energy]] by [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]]".  In his 1876 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'', a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems, he engaged his thoughts on chemical free energy in full.

==Overview==
[[File:Diamond.jpg|thumb|right|The reaction C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;diamond&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;graphite&lt;/sup&gt; has a negative change in Gibbs free energy and is therefore thermodynamically favorable at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atm. However, even though favorable, it is so slow that it is not observed.  Whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable does not determine its rate.]]
According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], for systems reacting at [[standard temperature and pressure|STP]] (or any other fixed temperature and pressure), there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the Gibbs free energy.

A quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the change Δ''G'' (sometimes written "delta ''G''" or "d''G''") in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) caused by the reaction. As a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure, Δ''G'' must be smaller than the non-[[pressure-volume work|PV]] (e.g. electrical) work, which is often equal to zero (hence Δ''G'' must be negative).  Δ''G'' equals the maximum amount of non-''PV'' work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of reversible process. If the analysis indicated a positive Δ''G'' for the reaction, then energy — in the form of electrical or other non-''PV'' work — would have to be added to the reacting system for Δ''G'' to be smaller than the non-''PV'' work and make it possible for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name="AtkinsJones2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Atkins|author2=Loretta Jones|title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight|date=1 August 2007|publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=978-1-4292-0965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|298–299}}

We can think of ∆G as the amount of "free" or "useful" energy available to do work. The equation can be also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, assume that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. Then the [[entropy]] released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy that the environment must absorb or release, respectively. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. This is reflected in a negative Δ''G'', and the reaction is called [[exergonic]].

If we couple reactions, then an otherwise [[endergonic]] chemical reaction (one with positive Δ''G'') can be made to happen. The input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction, such as the [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of [[cyclohexanol]] to [[cyclohexene]], can be seen as coupling an unfavourable reaction (elimination) to a favourable one (burning of coal or other provision of heat) such that the total entropy change of the universe is greater than or equal to zero, making the ''total'' Gibbs free energy difference of the coupled reactions negative.

In traditional use, the term "free" was included in "Gibbs free energy" to mean "available in the form of useful work".&lt;ref name="Perrot" /&gt; The characterization becomes more precise if we add the qualification that it is the energy available for ''non-volume'' work{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reiss | first = Howard | title = Methods of Thermodynamics | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1965 | isbn = 0-486-69445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (An analogous, but slightly different, meaning of "free" applies in conjunction with the Helmholtz free energy, for systems at constant temperature).  However, an increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment "free", referring to ''G'' as simply "Gibbs energy".  This is the result of a 1988 [[IUPAC]] meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the adjective "free" was supposedly banished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glossary of Atmospheric Chemistry Terms (Recommendations 1990) |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/publications/pac/1990/pdf/6211x2167.html |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

==History==
{{see also|Thermodynamic free energy#History|l1=Thermodynamic free energy}}
The quantity called "free energy" is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term ''affinity'', which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the ''force'' that caused [[chemical reaction]]s.

In 1873, [[Willard Gibbs]] published ''A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces'', in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact.  By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies composed of part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]-[[entropy]]-[[internal energy]] graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e., "necessarily stable", "neutral", and "unstable", and whether or not changes would ensue.  Further, Gibbs stated:&lt;ref name=Gibbs1873&gt;J. W. Gibbs, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces", ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 2, Dec. 1873, pp. 382–404.&lt;/ref&gt;

|align="left"|
If we wish to express in a single equation the necessary and sufficient condition of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] for a substance when surrounded by a medium of constant [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', this equation may be written:

:{{nowrap|1=''δ''(''ε'' − ''Tη'' + ''pν'') = 0}}

when ''δ'' refers to the variation produced by any variations in the [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the parts of the body, and (when different parts of the body are in different states) in the proportion in which the body is divided between the different states.  The condition of stable equilibrium is that the value of the expression in the parenthesis shall be a minimum. 
|}

In this description, as used by Gibbs, ''ε'' refers to the [[internal energy]] of the body, ''η'' refers to the [[entropy]] of the body, and ''ν'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the body.

Thereafter, in 1882, the German scientist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] characterized the affinity as the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a reversible cell.  The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free, or available, energy of the system (''Gibbs free energy'' ''G'' at ''T'' = constant, ''P'' = constant or ''Helmholtz free energy'' ''F'' at ''T'' = constant, ''V'' = constant), whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system ([[internal energy]]).  Thus, ''G'' or ''F'' is the amount of energy "free" for work under the given conditions.

Until this point, the general view had been such that: "all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish".  Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy.  According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] led to the replacement of the term "affinity" by the term "free energy" in much of the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Leicester1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|title=The Historical Background of Chemistry|year=1971|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-61053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

==Graphical interpretation==
Gibbs free energy was originally defined graphically.  In 1873, American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]] published his first thermodynamics paper, "Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids", in which Gibbs used the two coordinates of the entropy and volume to represent the state of the body. In his second follow-up paper, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces", published later that year, Gibbs added in the third coordinate of the energy of the body, defined on three figures. In 1874, Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] used Gibbs' figures to make a 3D energy-entropy-volume [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface]] of a fictitious water-like substance.&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell, Elizabeth Garber, Stephen G. Brush, and C. W. Francis Everitt (1995), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA248 Maxwell on heat and statistical mechanics: on "avoiding all personal enquiries" of molecules]'', Lehigh University Press, {{ISBN|0-934223-34-3}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in order to understand the very difficult concept of Gibbs free energy one must be able to understand its interpretation as Gibbs defined originally by section AB on his figure 3 and as Maxwell sculpted that section on his [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|3D surface figure]].

[[File:Gibbs-Maxwell surfaces.png|750px|center|thumb|American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]]' 1873 figures two and three (above left and middle) used by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1874 to create a three-dimensional [[entropy]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[energy]] '''[[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface]]''' diagram for a fictitious water-like substance, transposed the two figures of Gibbs (above right) onto the volume-entropy coordinates (transposed to bottom of cube) and energy-entropy coordinates (flipped upside down and transposed to back of cube), respectively, of a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinates]]; the region AB being the first-ever three-dimensional representation of Gibbs free energy, or what Gibbs called "available energy"; the region AC being its capacity for [[entropy]], what Gibbs defined as "the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume.]]

==Definitions==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|thumb|[[Willard Gibbs]]’ 1873 '''available energy''' (free energy) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body.  MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. Q''ε'' and Q''η'' are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ''ε'' ([[internal energy]]) and ''η'' ([[entropy]]), respectively.  AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' (Gibbs free energy) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
The Gibbs free energy is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;G(p,T) = U + pV - TS,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same as
:&lt;math&gt;G(p,T) = H - TS,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''U'' is the [[internal energy]] (SI unit: [[joule]]),
: ''p'' is [[pressure]] (SI unit: [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]),
: ''V'' is [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
: ''T'' is the [[temperature]] (SI unit: [[kelvin]]),
: ''S'' is the [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin),
: ''H'' is the [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule).

The expression for the infinitesimal reversible change in the Gibbs free energy as a function of its "natural variables" ''p'' and ''T'', for an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]], subjected to the operation of external forces (for instance, electrical or magnetic) ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', which cause the external parameters of the system ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to change by an amount d''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', can be derived as follows from the first law for reversible processes:

:&lt;math&gt;T\,\mathrm{d}S= \mathrm{d}U + p\,\mathrm{d}V - \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i + \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\mathrm{d}a_i + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(TS) - S\,\mathrm{d}T = \mathrm{d}U + \mathrm{d}(pV) - V\,\mathrm{d}p - \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i + \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\mathrm{d}a_i + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(U - TS + pV) = V\,\mathrm{d}p - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i - \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\mathrm{d}a_i + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = V\,\mathrm{d}p - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i - \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\mathrm{d}a_i + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] of the ''i''th [[chemical species|chemical component]]. (SI unit: joules per particle&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01032.html Chemical Potential], IUPAC Gold Book.&lt;/ref&gt; or joules per mole&lt;ref name="Perrot" /&gt;)
: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[particle number|number of particles]] (or number of moles) composing the ''i''th chemical component.

This is one form of '''Gibbs fundamental equation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Müller | first = Ingo | title = A History of Thermodynamics – the Doctrine of Energy and Entropy | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-46226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the infinitesimal expression, the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in Gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles. In other words, it holds for an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] or for a [[Closed system|closed]], chemically reacting system where the ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are changing. For a closed, non-reacting system, this term may be dropped.

Any number of extra terms may be added, depending on the particular system being considered. Aside from [[mechanical work]], a system may, in addition, perform numerous other types of work.  For example, in the infinitesimal expression, the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount −d''l'' under a force ''f'' would result in a term ''f'' d''l'' being added.  If a quantity of charge −d''e'' is acquired by a system at an electrical potential Ψ, the electrical work associated with this is −Ψ d''e'', which would be included in the infinitesimal expression.  Other work terms are added on per system requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Katchalsky | first = A.  |author2=Curran, Peter F.| title = Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1965 | id = CCN 65-22045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance, measured in [[Mole (unit)|moles]], to form ''molar Gibbs free energy''. The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the [[voltage]] of an [[electrochemical cell]], and the [[equilibrium constant]] for a [[reversible reaction]]. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a "dynamic" quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic{{clarify|reason=What is enthalpic force? No reference to it in Wikipedia's enthalpy article.|date=March 2015}} and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.

[[File:Thermodynamics_Gibbs_E0_Ecell_pH.png|thumb|upright=1.9|Relation to other relevant parameters]]

The temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an [[ideal gas]] is given by the [[Gibbs–Helmholtz equation]], and its pressure dependence is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \frac{G^\circ}{N} + kT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the volume is known rather than pressure, then it becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \frac{G^\circ}{N} + kT\ln \frac{V^\circ}{V},&lt;/math&gt;

or more conveniently as its [[chemical potential]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \mu = \mu^\circ + kT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

In non-ideal systems, [[fugacity]] comes into play.

==Derivation==
The Gibbs free energy [[total differential]] [[Thermodynamic potential#Natural variables|natural variables]] may be derived by [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]] of the [[internal energy]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\,\mathrm{d}S - p \,\mathrm{d}V + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d} N_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of ''G'' from above is
:&lt;math&gt;G = U + p V - T S&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the total differential, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = \mathrm{d}U + p\,\mathrm{d}V + V\,\mathrm{d}p - T\,\mathrm{d}S - S\,\mathrm{d}T.&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing d''U'' with the result from the first law gives&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}G &amp;= T\,\mathrm{d}S - p\,\mathrm{d}V + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i + p \,\mathrm{d}V + V\,\mathrm{d}p - T\,\mathrm{d}S - S\,\mathrm{d}T\\
&amp;= V\,\mathrm{d}p - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d} N_i.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The natural variables of ''G'' are then ''p'', ''T'', and {''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

===Homogeneous systems===

Because ''S'', ''V'', and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variables]], an [[Thermodynamic potentials#Euler integrals|Euler integral]] allows easy integration of d''U'':&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/opensys/opensys.html |title=Open Systems |accessdate=2007-10-11 |last=Salzman |first=William R. |date=2001-08-21 |work=Chemical Thermodynamics |publisher=[[University of Arizona]]  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707224025/http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/opensys/opensys.html |archivedate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U = T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Because some of the natural variables of ''G'' are intensive, d''G'' may not be integrated using Euler integrals as is the case with internal energy. However, simply substituting the above integrated result for ''U'' into the definition of ''G'' gives a standard expression for ''G'':&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G &amp;= U + p V - TS\\
  &amp;= (T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i) + p V - T S\\
  &amp;= \sum_i \mu_i N_i.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result applies to homogeneous, macroscopic systems, but not to all thermodynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1740312| last = Brachman | first = M.

==Gibbs free energy of reactions==
The system under consideration is held at constant temperature and pressure, and is closed (no matter can come in or out). The Gibbs energy of any system is {{tmath|1=G=U+PV-TS}} and an infinitesimal change in ''G'', at constant temperature and pressure yields:

:&lt;math&gt;dG=dU+PdV-TdS&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[first law of thermodynamics]], a change in the internal energy ''U'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''&amp;delta;Q'' is energy added as heat, and ''&amp;delta;W'' is energy added as work. The work done on the system may be written as ''&amp;delta;W'' = &amp;minus;''PdV'' + ''&amp;delta;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', where &amp;minus;''PdV'' is the mechanical work of compression/expansion done on the system and ''&amp;delta;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is all other forms of work, which may include electrical, magnetic, etc. Assuming that only mechanical work is done,

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-PdV&lt;/math&gt;

and the infinitesimal change in ''G'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;dG=\delta Q-TdS&lt;/math&gt;

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that for a closed system, &lt;math&gt;TdS \ge \delta Q&lt;/math&gt;, and so it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;dG \le 0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for a system which is not in equilibrium, its Gibbs energy will always be decreasing, and when it is in equilibrium (i.e. no longer changing), the infinitesimal change ''dG'' will be zero. In particular, this will be true if the system is experiencing any number of internal chemical reactions on its path to equilibrium.

==Useful identities to derive the Nernst equation==
{{confusing section|small=no|reason=the physical situation is not explained. Also, the circle notation is not well explained (even in the one case where it is attempted). It's just bare equations|date=March 2015}}

During a reversible electrochemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure, the following equations involving the Gibbs free energy hold:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G = \Delta_\text{r} G^\circ + R T \ln Q_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[chemical equilibrium]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -R T \ln K_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; (for a system at chemical equilibrium),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G = w_\text{elec,rev} = -nFE&lt;/math&gt; (for a reversible electrochemical process at constant temperature and pressure),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -nFE^\circ&lt;/math&gt; (definition of ''E''°),

and rearranging gives
:&lt;math&gt;nFE^\circ = RT \ln K_\text{eq},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;nFE = nFE^\circ - R T \ln Q_\text{r}r,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = E^\circ - \frac{R T}{n F} \ln Q_\text{r},&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the cell potential resulting from the reaction to the equilibrium constant and [[reaction quotient]] for that reaction ([[Nernst equation]]),

: ''E°'' = [[Standard electrode potential|standard cell potential]].

Moreover, we also have:
:&lt;math&gt;K_\text{eq} = e^{-\frac{\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ}{RT}},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -RT(\ln K_\text{eq}) = -2.303\,RT(\log_{10} K_\text{eq}),&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the equilibrium constant with Gibbs free energy.  This implies that at equilibrium
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{r} = K_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G=0&lt;/math&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics and metabolism==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
A chemical reaction will (or can) proceed spontaneously if the change in the total entropy of the universe that would be caused by the reaction is nonnegative. As discussed in the overview, if the temperature and pressure are held constant, the Gibbs free energy is a (negative) proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe. It is "negative" because ''S'' appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for ''G'', so the Gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy. Thus, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously. However, in biological systems (among others), energy inputs from other energy sources (including the Sun and exothermic chemical reactions) are "coupled" with reactions that are not entropically favored (i.e. have a Gibbs free energy above zero). Taking into account the coupled reactions, the total entropy in the universe increases. This coupling allows endergonic reactions, such as photosynthesis and DNA synthesis, to proceed without decreasing the total entropy of the universe. Thus biological systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

The [[standard Gibbs free energy of formation]] of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of that substance from its component elements, at their [[standard state]]s (the most stable form of the element at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 100 [[kilopascal|kPa]]). Its symbol is Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚.

All elements in their standard states (diatomic [[oxygen]] gas, [[graphite]], etc.) have standard Gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero, as there is no change involved.
:{{math|1= Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' = Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚ + ''RT'' ln ''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;; 
::''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[reaction quotient]].
:At equilibrium, Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' = 0, and ''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'', so the equation becomes Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚ = −''RT'' ln ''K'' (where ''K'' is the [[equilibrium constant]]).

Heat is transferred to and from matter by the principal energy carriers. The state of energy stored within matter, or transported by the carriers, is described by a combination of classical and [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The energy is also transformed (converted) among various carriers.
The [[heat transfer]] processes (or kinetics) are governed by the rates at which various related physical phenomena occur, such as (for example) the rate of particle collisions in [[classical mechanics]]. These various states and kinetics determine the heat transfer, i.e., the net rate of energy storage or transport. Governing these process from the atomic level (atom or molecule length scale) to macroscale are the [[laws of thermodynamics]], including [[conservation of energy]].

Heat is thermal energy associated with temperature-dependent motion of particles. The macroscopic energy equation for infinitesimal volume used in heat transfer analysis is&lt;ref name=EHTAppB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaviany|first=M.|title=Essentials of heat transfer : principles, materials, and applications|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107012400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = -\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \sum_{i,j} \dot s_{i-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''q''' is heat flux vector, -''ρc&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''∂T''/''∂t'') is temporal change of internal energy (''ρ'' is density, ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[specific heat capacity]] at constant pressure, ''T'' is temperature and ''t'' is time), and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\dot s&lt;/math&gt; is the energy conversion to and from thermal energy (''i'' and ''j'' are for principal energy carriers).  So, the terms represent energy transport, storage and transformation.  Heat flux vector '''q''' is composed of three macroscopic fundamental modes, which are [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] ('''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = -''k''∇''T'', ''k'': thermal conductivity), [[convection]] ('''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ρc&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'''''u'''''T'', '''u''': velocity), and [[radiation]] ('''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;2\pi\textstyle\int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;'''s''' ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' sin''θdθdω'', ''ω'': angular frequency, ''θ'': polar angle, ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'': spectral, directional radiation intensity, '''s''': unit vector), i.e., '''q''' = '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; + '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Once states and kinetics of the energy conversion and thermophysical properties are known, the fate of heat transfer is described by the above equation. These atomic-level mechanisms and kinetics are addressed in heat transfer physics. The microscopic thermal energy is stored, transported, and transformed by the principal energy carriers: phonons (''p''), electrons (''e''), fluid particles (''f''), and photons (''ph'').&lt;ref name=HTPReview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=V.

Thermophysical properties of matter and the kinetics of interaction and energy exchange among the principal carriers are based on the atomic-level configuration and interaction.&lt;ref name=GernerBook /&gt;     Transport properties such as thermal conductivity are calculated from these atomic-level properties using classical and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]].&lt;ref name=HTPbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oligschleger1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oligschleger|first=C.|author2=Schön, J.|title=Simulation of thermal conductivity and heat transport in solids|journal=Physical Review B|year=1999|volume=59|issue=6|pages=4125–4133|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.59.4125|arxiv = cond-mat/9811156 |bibcode = 1999PhRvB..59.4125O }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quantum states of principal carriers (e.g.. momentum, energy) are derived from the [[Schrödinger equation]] (called first principle or ''ab initio'') and the interaction rates (for kinetics) are calculated using the quantum states and the quantum [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] (formulated as the [[Fermi golden rule]]).&lt;ref name=Pisani1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Pisani|first=C.|title=Quantum-mechanical ''ab-initio'' calculation of the properties of crystalline materials|year=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540616450}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Variety of ''ab initio'' (Latin for from the beginning) solvers (software) exist (e.g., [[ABINIT]], [[CASTEP]], [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], [[Q-Chem]], [[Quantum ESPRESSO]], [[SIESTA (computer program)|SIESTA]], [[VASP]], [[WIEN2k]]). Electrons in the inner shells (core) are not involved in heat transfer, and calculations are greatly reduced by proper approximations about the inner-shells electrons.&lt;ref name=Sholl2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Sholl|first=D.

The quantum treatments, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium ''ab initio'' molecular dynamics (MD), involving larger lengths and times are limited by the computation resources, so various alternate treatments with simplifying assumptions have been used and kinetics.&lt;ref name=Marx2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=D.|title=''Ab initio'' molecular dynamics : basic theory and advanced methods|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0521898638|edition=1. publ., repr.|author2=Hutter, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In classical (Newtonian) MD, the motion of atom or molecule (particles) is based on the empirical or effective interaction potentials, which in turn can be based on curve-fit of ''ab initio'' calculations or curve-fit to thermophysical properties. From the ensembles of simulated particles, static or dynamics thermal properties or scattering rates are derived.&lt;ref name=Haile1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Haile|first=J.M.|title=Molecular dynamics simulation : elementary methods|year=1997|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471184393|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frenkel2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=D|title=Understanding molecular simulation from algorithms to applications|year=2002|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0122673511|edition=2nd|author2=Smit, B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At yet larger length scales (mesoscale, involving many mean free paths), the [[Boltzmann transport equation]] (BTE) which is based on the classical Hamiltonian-statistical mechanics is applied. BTE considers particle states in terms of position and momentum vectors ('''x''', '''p''') and this is represented as the sate occupation probability.  The occupation has equilibrium distributions (the known boson, fermion, and Maxwell–Boltzmann particles)  and transport of energy (heat) is due to nonequilibrium (cause by a driving force or potential). Central to the transport is the role of scattering which turn the distribution toward equilibrium). The scattering is presented by the relations time or the mean free path.  The relaxation time (or its inverse which is the interaction rate) is found from other calculations (''ab initio'' or MD) or empirically.  BTE can be numerically solved with [[Monte Carlo method]], etc.&lt;ref name=Lundstrom2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Lundstrom|first=M.|title=Fundamentals of Carrier Transport|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521637244|edition=2. ed., digitally pr. version.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the length and time scale the proper level of treatment (''ab initio'', MD, or BTE). Heat transfer physics analyses may involve multiple scales (e.g., BTE using interaction rate from ''ab initio'' or classical MD) with states and kinetic related to thermal energy storage, transport and transformation.

So, heat transfer physics covers the four principal energy carries and their kinetics from classical and quantum mechanical perspectives. This enables multiscale (''ab initio'', MD, BTE and macroscale) analyses, including low-dimensionality and size effects.&lt;ref name=ChenBook /&gt;

==Phonon==

[[Phonon]] (quantized lattice vibration wave) is a central thermal energy carrier contributing to heat capacity (sensible heat storage) and conductive heat transfer in condensed phase, and plays a very important role in thermal energy conversion. Its transport properties are represented by the phonon conductivity tensor '''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (W/m-K, from the Fourier law  '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;''k,p''&lt;/sub&gt; = -'''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;⋅∇ ''T'') for bulk materials, and the phonon boundary resistance ''AR&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' [K/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)] for solid interfaces, where ''A'' is the interface area. The phonon specific heat capacity ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,p&lt;/sub&gt;'' (J/kg-K) includes the quantum effect.  The thermal energy conversion rate involving phonon is included in &lt;math&gt;\dot{s}_{i\mbox{-}j}&lt;/math&gt;.  Heat transfer physics describes and predicts, ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,p&lt;/sub&gt;'', '''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or conductance ''G&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'') and &lt;math&gt;\dot{s}_{i\mbox{-}j}&lt;/math&gt;, based on atomic-level properties.

For an equilibrium potential ⟨''φ''⟩&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; of a system with ''N'' atoms, the total potential ⟨''φ''⟩ is found by a Taylor series expansion at the equilibrium and this can be approximated by the second derivatives (the harmonic approximation) as

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad \qquad \langle\varphi\rangle = \langle\varphi\rangle_\mathrm{o} + \sum_i\sum_\alpha\frac{\partial\langle\varphi\rangle}{\partial d_{i\alpha}}|_\mathrm{o}d_{i\alpha} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\sum_{\alpha,\beta}\frac{\partial^2\langle\varphi\rangle}{\partial d_{i\alpha}\partial d_{j\beta}}|_\mathrm{o}d_{i\alpha}d_{j\beta}+ \frac{1}{6}\sum_{i,j,k}\sum_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}\frac{\partial^3\langle\varphi\rangle}{\partial d_{i\alpha}\partial d_{j\beta}\partial d_{k\gamma}}|_\mathrm{o} d_{i\alpha}d_{j\beta}d_{k\gamma}+... + &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\qquad \qquad  \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \  \approx \langle\varphi\rangle_\mathrm{o} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\sum_{\alpha,\beta}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}d_{i\alpha}d_{j\beta}, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the displacement vector of atom ''i'', and Γ is the spring (or force) constant as the second-order derivatives of the potential. The equation of motion for the lattice vibration in terms of the displacement of atoms ['''d'''(''jl'',''t''): displacement vector of the ''j''-th atom in the ''l''-th unit cell at time ''t''] is

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad \qquad m_j\frac{d^2\mathbf{d}(jl,t)}{dt^2} = -\sum_{j'l'} \boldsymbol{\Gamma} \binom{j \ j^\prime}{l \ l^\prime}\cdot \mathbf{d} (j^\prime l^\prime, T), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the atomic mass and '''Γ''' is the force constant tensor. The atomic displacement is the summation over the [[normal mode]]s  ['''s'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;: unit vector of mode ''α'', ''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'': angular frequency of wave, and '''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;: wave vector]. Using this plane-wave displacement, the equation of motion becomes the eigenvalue equation&lt;ref name=AMSolidStatePhysics&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashcroft|first=N. W.; Mermin, N.

where '''M''' is the diagonal mass matrix and '''D''' is the harmonic dynamical matrix. Solving this eigenvalue equation gives the relation between the angular frequency ''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the wave vector '''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, and this relation is called the phonon [[Phonon#Dispersion relation|dispersion relation]].  Thus, the phonon dispersion relation is determined by matrices '''M''' and '''D''', which depend on the atomic structure and the strength of interaction among constituent atoms (the stronger the interaction and the lighter the atoms, the higher is the phonon frequency and the larger is the slope ''dω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''/''d''κ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'').

The energy of quantum-harmonic oscillator is ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''κ'',''α''&lt;/sub&gt; [''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''κ'',''α'') + 1/2]''ħω&lt;sub&gt;p,α&lt;/sub&gt;''('''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;), and thus the quantum of phonon energy ''ħω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The phonon dispersion relation gives all possible phonon modes within the [[Brillouin zone]] (zone within the [[primitive cell]] in [[reciprocal space]]), and the phonon [[density of states]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the number density of possible phonon modes). The phonon [[group velocity]] ''u&lt;sub&gt;p,g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the dispersion curve, ''dω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''/''d'''''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Using the phonon density of states and this occupancy distribution, the phonon energy is ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') = '''∫'''''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'')''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,T'')''ħω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;dω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the phonon density is ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') = '''∫'''''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'')''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,T'')''dω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Thus, the larger the carrier density, heat capacity and speed, and the less significant the scattering, the higher is the conductivity. For phonon ''λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the interaction (scattering) kinetics of phonons and is related to the scattering relaxation time ''τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' or rate   (= 1/''τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') through ''λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''= ''u&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. Phonons interact with other phonons, and with electrons, boundaries, impurities, etc., and ''λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' combines these interaction mechanisms through the [[Matthiessen's rule|Matthiessen rule]]. At low temperatures, scattering by boundaries is dominant and with increase in temperature the interaction rate with impurities, electron and other phonons become important, and finally the phonon-phonon scattering dominants for ''T''  &gt;  0.2''T&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''.

This model is widely tested with pure nonmetallic crystals, and the overall agreement is good, even for complex crystals.

Based on the kinetics and atomic structure consideration, a material with high crystalline and strong interactions, composed of light atoms (such as diamond and graphene) is expected to have large phonon conductivity. Solids with more than one atom in the smallest [[unit cell]] representing the lattice have two types of phonons, i.e., acoustic and optical. (Acoustic phonons are in-phase movements of atoms about their equilibrium positions, while optical phonons are out-of-phase movement of adjacent atoms in the lattice.) Optical phonons have higher energies (frequencies), but make smaller contribution to conduction heat transfer, because of their smaller group velocity and occupancy.

Phonon transport across hetero-structure boundaries (represented with ''R&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[Interfacial thermal resistance|phonon boundary resistance]]) according to the boundary scattering approximations are modeled as acoustic and diffuse mismatch models.&lt;ref name=SwartzBoundary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swartz|first=E.|author2=Pohl, R.|title=Thermal boundary resistance|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=1989|volume=61|issue=3|pages=605–668|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.61.605|bibcode = 1989RvMP...61..605S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger phonon transmission (small ''R&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'') occurs at boundaries where material pairs have similar phonon properties (''u&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', etc.), and in contract large ''R&lt;sub&gt;p,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' occurs when some material is softer (lower cut-off phonon frequency) than the other.

{{see also|Thermoelectric effect}}

Quantum electron energy states for electron are found using the electron quantum Hamiltonian, which is generally composed of kinetic (-''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') and potential energy terms (''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''). Atomic orbital, a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] describing the wave-like behavior of either an [[electron]] or a pair of electrons in an [[atom]], can be found from the [[Schrödinger equation]] with this electron Hamiltonian. [[Hydrogen-like atom]]s (a nucleus and an electron) allow for closed-form solution to Schrödinger equation with the electrostatic potential (the [[Coulomb law]]). The Schrödinger equation of atoms or atomic ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the Coulomb interactions among electrons. Thus, numerical techniques are used, and an [[electron configuration]] is approximated as product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals (isolate electron orbitals). Molecules with multiple atoms (nuclei and their electrons) have [[molecular orbital]] (MO, a mathematical function for the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule),  and are obtained from simplified solution techniques such as  [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO). The molecular orbital is used to predict chemical and physical properties, and the difference between highest occupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]]) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ([[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]]) is a measure of [[Excited state|excitability]] of the molecules.

In a [[crystal structure]] of  metallic solids, the [[free electron model]] (zero potential, ''φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0) for the behavior of [[valence electron]]s is used. However, in a [[Crystal structure|periodic lattice (crystal)]], there is periodic crystal potential, so the electron Hamiltonian becomes&lt;ref name=KittelSolidStatePhysics /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad \mathrm{H}_e = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla^2 + \varphi_c(\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron mass, and the periodic potential is expressed as ''φ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''x'') = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; ''φ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''exp[''i''('''g'''∙'''x''')] ('''g''': reciprocal lattice vector).  The time-independent Schrödinger equation with this Hamiltonian is given as (the eigenvalue equation)

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad \mathrm{H}_e \psi_{e,\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}) = E_e(\boldsymbol{\kappa}_e) \psi_{e,\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the eigenfunction ''ψ&lt;sub&gt;e,κ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron wave function, and eigenvalue ''E&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''('''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;), is the electron energy ('''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;: electron wavevector).  The relation between wavevector, '''κ'''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; and energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' provides the [[electronic band structure]].  In practice, a lattice as [[Many-body problem|many-body systems]]  includes interactions between electrons and nuclei in potential, but this calculation can be too intricate. Thus, many approximate techniques have been suggested and one of them is [[density functional theory]] (DFT), uses functionals of the spatially dependent [[Electronic density|electron density]] instead of full interactions. DFT is widely used in ''ab initio'' software ([[ABINIT]], [[CASTEP]], [[Quantum ESPRESSO]], [[SIESTA (computer program)|SIESTA]], [[VASP]], [[WIEN2k]], etc.). The electron specific heat is based on the energy states and occupancy distribution (the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]).  In general, the heat capacity of electron is small except at very high temperature when they are in thermal equilibrium with phonons (lattice). Electrons contribute to heat conduction (in addition to charge carrying) in solid, especially in metals. Thermal conductivity tensor in solid is the sum of electric and phonon thermal conductivity tensors '''K''' = '''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; + '''K'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The other contribution ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,trans&lt;/sub&gt; is the net energy transferred in moving a carrier divided by ''qT'' (''q'': carrier charge). The electron's contributions to the Seebeck coefficient are mostly in ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,pres&lt;/sub&gt;. The ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,mix&lt;/sub&gt; is usually dominant in lightly doped semiconductors. The change of the entropy-of-mixing upon adding an electron to a system is the so-called Heikes formula

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad  \alpha_\mathrm{S,mix} = \frac{1}{q}\frac{\partial S_\mathrm{mix}}{\partial N} = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}}{q}\mathrm{ln}(\frac{1 - f_e^\mathrm{o}}{f_e^\mathrm{o}}),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = ''N''/''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ratio of electrons to sites (carrier concentration). Using the chemical potential (''µ''), the thermal energy (''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') and the Fermi function, above equation can be expressed in an alternative form, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,mix&lt;/sub&gt; =  (''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''q'')[(''E&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''µ'')/(''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'')].
Extending the Seebeck effect to spins, a ferromagnetic alloy can be a good example. The contribution to the Seebeck coefficient that results from electrons’ presence altering the systems spin entropy is given by ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,spin&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;spin&lt;/sub&gt;/''q'' = (''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''q'')ln[(2''s'' + 1)/(2''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; +1)], where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s'' are net spins of the magnetic site in the absence and presence of the carrier, respectively. Many vibrational effects with electrons also contribute to the Seebeck coefficient. The softening of the vibrational frequencies produces a change of the vibrational entropy is one of examples. The vibrational entropy is the negative derivative of the free energy, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad  S_\mathrm{vib} = -\frac{\partial F_\mathrm{mix}}{\partial T} = 3Nk_\mathrm{B}T\int_0^\omega\{\frac{\hbar\omega}{2k_\mathrm{B}T}\mathrm{coth}(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2k_\mathrm{B}T}) - \mathrm{ln}[2\mathrm{sinh}(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2k_\mathrm{B}T})]\}D_p(\omega)d\omega,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ω'') is the phonon density-of-states for the structure. For the high-temperature limit and series expansions of the hyperbolic functions, the above is simplified as ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,vib&lt;/sub&gt; = (Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;/''q'') = (''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''q'')∑''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(-Δ''ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'').

The Seebeck coefficient derived in the above Onsager formulation is the mixing component ''α''&lt;sub&gt;S,mix&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates in most semiconductors. The vibrational component in high-band gap materials such as B&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is very important.&lt;br /&gt;
Considering the microscopic transport ( transport is a results of nonequilibrium),

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad \mathbf{j}_e = -\frac{e_c}{\hbar^3}\sum_p\mathbf{u}_ef_e^\prime = -\frac{e_c}{\hbar^3k_\mathrm{B}T}\sum_p\mathbf{u}_e\tau_e(-\frac{\partial f_e^\mathrm{o}}{\partial E_e})(\mathbf{u}_e\cdot\mathbf{F}_{te}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad  \mathbf{q}=\frac{1}{\hbar^3}\sum_p(E_e-E_\mathrm{F})\mathbf{u}_ef_e^\prime = \frac{1}{\hbar^3k_\mathrm{B}T}\sum_p \mathbf{u}_e\tau_e(-\frac{\partial f_e^\mathrm{o}}{\partial E_e})(E_e-E_\mathrm{F})(\mathbf{u}_e\cdot\mathbf{F}_{te}),&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron velocity vector, ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''’ (''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) is the electron nonequilibrium (equilibrium) distribution, ''τ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron scattering time, ''E&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron energy, and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''te''&lt;/sub&gt; is the electric and thermal forces from ∇(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''e&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ∇(1/''T'').
Relating the thermoelectric coefficients to the microscopic transport equations for ''j&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and q, the thermal, electric, and thermoelectric properties are calculated. Thus, ''k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases with the electrical conductivity σe and temperature ''T'', as the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]] presents [''k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''/(''σ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') = (1/3)(''πk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''e&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.44×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W-Ω/K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;].   Electron transport (represented as ''σ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a function of carrier density ''n&lt;sub&gt;e,c&lt;/sub&gt;'' and electron mobility ''μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''σ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''e&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;e,c&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'').   ''μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is determined by electron scattering rates &lt;math&gt;\dot{\gamma}_e&lt;/math&gt; (or relaxation time, &lt;math&gt;\tau_e = 1/\dot{\gamma}_e &lt;/math&gt; ) in various interaction mechanisms including interaction with other electrons, phonons, impurities and boundaries.

Electrons interact with other principal energy carriers. Electrons accelerated by an electric field are relaxed through the energy conversion to phonon (in semiconductors, mostly optical phonon), which is called [[Joule heating]]. Energy conversion between electric potential and phonon energy is considered in [[thermoelectrics]] such as Peltier cooling and thermoelectric generator.  Also, study of interaction with photons is central in [[Optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] applications (i.e. [[light-emitting diode]], [[solar photovoltaic cells]], etc.). Interaction rates or energy conversion rates can be evaluated using the Fermi golden rule (from the perturbation theory) with ''ab initio'' approach.

== Fluid particle ==

Fluid particle is the smallest unit (atoms or molecules) in the fluid phase (gas, liquid or plasma) without breaking any chemical bond. Energy of fluid particle is divided into potential, electronic, translational, vibrational, and rotational energies. The heat (thermal) energy storage in fluid particle is through the temperature-dependent particle motion (translational, vibrational, and rotational energies). The electronic energy is included only if temperature is high enough to ionize or dissociate the fluid particles or to include other electronic transitions. These quantum energy states of the fluid particles are found using their respective quantum Hamiltonian. These are H''&lt;sub&gt;f,t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -(''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m'')∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, H''&lt;sub&gt;f,v&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -(''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m'')∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + Γ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 and H''&lt;sub&gt;f,r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -(''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'')∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for translational, vibrational and rotational modes. (Γ: [[Hooke's law|spring constant]], ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'': the [[moment of inertia]] for the molecule). From the Hamiltonian, the quantized fluid particle energy state ''E&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition functions]] ''Z&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' [with the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics|Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) occupancy distribution]]] are found as&lt;ref name=CareyBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=V.

Here, ''g&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the degeneracy, ''n'', ''l'', and  ''j'' are the transitional, vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, ''T&lt;sub&gt;f,v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the characteristic temperature for vibration (= ''ħω&lt;sub&gt;f,v&lt;/sub&gt;''/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, : vibration frequency), and ''T&lt;sub&gt;f,r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rotational temperature [= ''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)]. The average specific internal energy is related to the partition function through ''Z&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'',  &lt;math&gt; e_f = (k_\mathrm{B}T^2/m)(\partial \mathrm{ln}Z_f/\partial T)|_{N,V}.&lt;/math&gt;

With the energy states and the partition function, the fluid particle specific heat capacity ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the summation of contribution from various kinetic energies (for non-ideal gas the potential energy is also added). Because the total degrees of freedom in molecules is determined by the atomic configuration, ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,f&lt;/sub&gt;''  has different formulas depending on the configuration,&lt;ref name=CareyBook /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad  \mathrm{nonlinear,\ polyatomic\ ideal\ gas }  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ c_{v,f} = \frac{R_g}{M}\{3+ \textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{3N_o-6}\displaystyle (\frac{T_{f,v}}{T})^2\frac{\mathrm{exp}(T_{f,v,i}/T)}{[\mathrm{exp}(T_{f,v,i}/T)-1]^2}\} .&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the gas constant (= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;: the Avogadro constant) and ''M'' is the molecular mass (kg/kmole). (For the polyatomic ideal gas, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of atoms in a molecule.) In gas, constant-pressure specific heat capacity ''c&lt;sub&gt;p,f&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a larger value and the difference depends on the temperature ''T'', volumetric thermal expansion coefficient ''β'' and the isothermal compressibility κ [''c&lt;sub&gt;p,f&lt;/sub&gt;''  – ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,f&lt;/sub&gt;''  = ''Tβ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;κ''), ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' : the fluid density].  For dense fluids that the interactions between the particles (the van der Waals interaction) should be included, and ''c&lt;sub&gt;v,f&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;p,f&lt;/sub&gt;'' would change accordingly.
The net motion of particles (under gravity or external pressure) gives rise to the convection heat flux '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;p,f&lt;/sub&gt;'''''u'''''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;T''. Conduction heat flux '''q'''''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ideal gas is derived with the gas kinetic theory or the Boltzmann transport equations, and the thermal conductivity is

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \qquad \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  k_{f} = \frac{1}{3}n_fc_{p,f}\langle u_f^2\rangle\tau_{f\mbox{-}f},&lt;/math&gt;

where ⟨''u&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⟩&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the RMS ([[root mean square]]) thermal velocity (3''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''m'' from the MB distribution function, ''m'': atomic mass) and ''τ&lt;sub&gt;f-f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relaxation time (or intercollision time period) [(2&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''π d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⟨''u&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; from the gas kinetic theory, ⟨''u&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩: average thermal speed (8''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''πm'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''d'': the collision diameter of fluid particle (atom or molecule), ''n&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'': fluid number density].

''k&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also calculated using [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), which simulates [[Motion (physics)|physical movements]] of the fluid particles with the [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton equations of motion]] (classical) and [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]] (from ''ab initio'' or empirical properties). For calculation of ''k&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', the equilibrium MD with [[Green–Kubo relations]], which express the transport coefficients in terms of integrals of time correlation functions (considering fluctuation), or nonequilibrium MD (prescribing heat flux or temperature difference in simulated system) are generally employed.

Fluid particles can interact with other principal particles. Vibrational or rotational modes, which have relatively high energy, are excited or decay through the interaction with photons.

Photon is the quanta of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic (EM) radiation]] and energy carrier for [[Thermal radiation|radiation heat transfer]]. The EM wave is governed by the classical [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]], and the [[Quantization of the electromagnetic field|quantization of EM wave]] is used for phenomena such as the [[Black-body radiation|blackbody radiation]] (in particular to explain the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]). The quanta EM wave (photon) energy of angular frequency ''ω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''E&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = ħω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'', and follows the Bose–Einstein distribution function (''f&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'').

Blackbody radiation among various types of photon emission employs the [[photon gas]] model with thermalized energy distribution without interphoton interaction. From the linear dispersion relation (i.e., dispersionless), phase and group speeds are equal (''u&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  ''d ω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dκ'' = ''ω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''/''κ'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'': photon speed) and the Debye (used for dispersionless photon) density of states is ''D&lt;sub&gt;ph,b,ω&lt;/sub&gt;dω'' = ω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dω&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''/''π''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Photons have the largest range of energy and central in a variety of energy conversions. Photons interact with electric and magnetic entities. For example, electric dipole which in turn are excited by optical phonons or fluid particle vibration, or transition dipole moments of electronic transitions. In heat transfer physics, the interaction kinetics of phonon is treated using the perturbation theory (the Fermi golden rule) and the interaction Hamiltonian. The photon-electron interaction is&lt;ref name=Bartolo2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Bartolo|first=B.|title=Optical interactions in solids|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-9814295741|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''ab initio'' calculations based on the first principles along with EM theory, various radiative properties such as dielectric function ([[electrical permittivity]], ''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,ω&lt;/sub&gt;''), spectral absorption coefficient (''σ&lt;sub&gt;ph,ω&lt;/sub&gt;''), and the complex refraction index (''m&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;''), are calculated for various interactions between photons and electric/magnetic entities in matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=H.|author2=Ruan, X.|title=Ab initio calculations of thermal radiative properties: The semiconductor GaAs|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|year=2009|volume=53|issue=7–8|pages=1308–1312|doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2009.12.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=H.|author2=Qiu, B. |author3=Zhang, Y. |author4= Ruan, X. |title=A first-principles molecular dynamics approach for predicting optical phonon lifetimes and far-infrared reflectance of polar materials|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|year=2012|volume=113|issue=13|pages=1683–1688|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2012.04.018|bibcode = 2012JQSRT.113.1683B }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the imaginary part (''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,c,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'') of complex dielectric function (''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,r,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''i'' ''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,c,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'') for electronic transition across a bandgap is&lt;ref name=ZhangBook /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

In another example, for the far IR regions where the optical phonons are involved, the dielectric function (''ε&lt;sub&gt;e,ω&lt;/sub&gt;'') are calculated as  &lt;br /&gt;

'''''Home Power''''' is a bi-monthly [[United States|American]] [[magazine]]. It is based in [[Ashland, Oregon]]. Circulation is greater than 100,000.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/03/09/home.power.idg/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104051932/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/03/09/home.power.idg/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-04 |title=Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment &amp; Video News - CNN.com |work=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published since 1987, ''Home Power'' has promoted a goal of reducing the use of [[fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] for electricity generation by replacing fossil fuel generation capacity with currently available [[renewable electricity]] alternatives. Solar, wind, and hydro systems information is covered at a homeowner's [[do-it-yourself]] level with expert advice and examples. ''Home Power'' also promotes and presents information on energy efficient building and design practices. [[Electric vehicle]]  information is also featured and its integration with renewable electricity systems and solar panels.

== History ==
Richard and Karen Perez started ''Home Power'' in 1987. From the start the magazine itself has been published with the use of alternative energy resources. Its publishers live the lifestyle they espouse. Today, ''Home Power'' is a recognized leading provider of detailed information for renewable energy installation. Its authors and editors are cited in other industry publications and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2007-10-01/Home-Power-Turns-20.aspx|title=Home Power Magazine Turns 20|work=Mother Earth News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its founding, ''Home Power'' focused on off-grid systems and Do-It-Yourself ([[DIY]]) information for homeowners. Focusing on "home scale" renewable systems, the magazine will not typically cover utility scale renewable energy issues such as large wind farms or utility scale solar installations.  The magazine recognizes the up-tick in interest in, and expansion of, the grid-tied solar electric systems market for homeowners. Today the magazine covers both DIY systems and professionally installed grid-tied systems on its web site and print editions and in its articles, editorials and advertising. It also covers broader subjects related to home-scale energy production, including green building, energy efficiency, and alternative transportation.

A controversial topic ''Home Power'' was once in support of (and coined the term for)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Renewable-Energy/2001-02-01/Guerrilla-Solar.aspx|title=The Guerrilla Solar Movement|work=Mother Earth News}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "Guerrilla Solar", (see [[Solar Guerrilla]]) or solar power installations by homeowners that are grid tied which are not permitted by the utilities they are tied to.  This non-inspected practice has fallen out of favor given the current cooperation of utilities with homeowners wishing to install solar, and states' enactment of [[net-metering]] regulations. ''Home Power'' still covers the topic in its coverage of micro-inverters and small systems that can safely and legally be tied to the grid. 

''Home Power'' also has a web presence. The web site complements the print edition with most past articles in html format, convenient because they are often referred to in current issues.

Because ''Home Power'' covers off-grid [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] it is a popular magazine in the [[prepper]] community.

The ''Home Power'' website states: "Home Power Inc. will be publishing the final edition of Home Power magazine in November 2018. This November/December issue (HP188) will end the magazine’s 31-year publishing run..."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.homepower.com/subscribe-and-save?template=subscribe End of publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent initiatives ==
To fill the growing need for reliable information for [[renewable energy]] systems professionals ''Home Power'' has also come out with an industry trade magazine: ''[[SolarPro]]''.

==Etymology==

The word "jackfruit" comes from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''jaca'', which in turn is derived from the [[Malayalam]] language term ''chakka'' (Malayalam ''chakka pazham'').&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=malayalam&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pradeepkumar  |first1=T. |last2=Jyothibhaskar |first2=B.

[[Henry Yule]] translated the book in [[Jordanus]] Catalani's (f. 1321–1330) ''Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East''.&lt;ref name=jordanus&gt;{{cite book |author=Friar Jordanus, 14th century, as translated from the Latin by Henry Yule |date=1863 |title=Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East |url=https://archive.org/stream/mirabiliadescrip00jord#page/13/mode/1up |publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]] |page=13 |access-date=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common English name "jackfruit" was used by physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]] in his 1563 book ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]''.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition, 1989, online edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2000 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/33/J0003300.html |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |publisher=Bartleby |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130162835/http://www.bartleby.com/61/33/J0003300.html |archive-date=2005-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, botanist [[Ralph Randles Stewart]] suggested it was named after [[William Jack (botanist)|William Jack]] (1795–1822), a Scottish botanist who worked for the [[East India Company]] in [[Bengal]], [[Sumatra]], and [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Ralph R. |authorlink=Ralph Randles Stewart |date=1984 |title=How Did They Die? |journal=Taxon |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=48–52 |doi=10.2307/1222028 |jstor=1222028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botanical description ==

=== Shape, trunk and leaves ===
[[File:Flora Sinensis - Jackfruit.JPG|thumb|Jackfruit tree illustrated from one of the earliest natural history books about China by Jesuit Missionary author [[Michael Boym]] in 1656.]]

Artocarpus heterophyllus grows as an [[Evergreen|evergreen tree]] that has a relatively short trunk with a dense treetop. It easily reaches heights of 10 to 20 meters and trunk diameters of 30 to 80 centimeters. It sometimes forms [[buttress root]]s. The bark of the jackfruit tree is reddish-brown and smooth. In the event of injury to  the bark, a milky juice is released.

The leaves are [[Alternate leaf|alternate]] and spirally arranged. They are gummy and thick and are divided into a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] and a leaf blade. The petiole is 1 to 3 inches long. The leathery leaf blade is 7 to 15 inches  long, and 3 to 7 inches wide and is oblong to [[Ovate (leaf)|ovate]] in shape.

In young trees, the leaf edges are irregularly lobed or split. On older trees, the leaves are rounded and dark green, with a smooth leaf margin. The leaf blade has a prominent main [[Leaf vein|nerve]] and starting on each side six to eight lateral nerves. The [[stipule]]s are egg-shaped at a length of 1.5 to 8 centimeters.

=== Flowers and fruit ===
[[File:Jackfruit - Kerala's official fruit.jpg|alt=Jackfruit - Kerala's official fruit|thumb|Jackfruit on the tree showing the tree bark.]]
[[File:Artocarpus heterophylla flowers.JPG|thumb|Flower buds of a jackfruit tree]]
[[File:Jack Fruit Opened.jpg|thumb|Opened jackfruit]]The inflorescences are formed on the trunk, branches or twigs ([[Cauliflory|caulifloria]]). Jackfruit trees are [[Plant reproductive morphology|monoecious]], that is there are both female and male flowers on a tree. The inflorescences are [[Peduncle (anatomy)|pedunculated]], cylindrical to ellipsoidal or pear-shaped, to about 10-12 centimeters long and 5-7 centimeters wide.

Inflorescences are initially completely enveloped in egg-shaped cover sheets which rapidly slope off.

The flowers are very small, there are several thousand flowers in an inflorescence, which sit on a  fleshy [[rachis]] .&lt;ref&gt;D. KN G Pushpakumara: Floral and Fruit Morphology and Phenology of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae). In: Sri Lankan J. Agric. Sci. Vol. 43, 2006, pp. 82-106, online (PDF), on researchgate.net, accessed May 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  The male flowers are greenish, some flowers are sterile. The male flowers are hairy and the [[perianth]] ends with two 1 to 1.5 millimeters membrane. The individual and prominent [[stamen]]s are straight with yellow, roundish anthers. After the pollen distribution, the stamens become ash-gray and fall off after a few days. Later all the male inflorescences also fall off. The greenish female flowers, with hairy and tubular perianth, have a fleshy flower-like base. The female flowers contain an ovary with a broad, capitate or rarely bilobed scar. The blooming time ranges from December until February or March.

The ellipsoidal to roundish fruit is a multiple fruit formed from the fusion of the ovaries of multiple flowers. The fruits grow on a long and thick stem on the trunk. They vary in size and ripen from an initially yellowish-greenish to yellow, and then at maturity to yellowish-brown. They possess a hard, gummy shell with small pimples surrounded with hard, hexagonal [[tubercle]]s. The very large and variously shaped fruit have a length of 30 to 100 centimeters and a diameter of 15 to 50 centimeters and can weigh 10-25 kilograms or more.

The fruits consist of a fibrous, whitish core ([[rachis]]) about 5-10 centimeters thick. Radiating from this are many 10 centimeter long individual fruits. They are elliptical to egg-shaped, light brownish [[achene]]s with a length of about 3 centimeters and a diameter of 1.5 to 2 centimeters.

There may be about 100-500 seeds per fruit. The seed coat consists of a thin, waxy, parchment-like and easily removable testa (husk) and a brownish, membranous [[Seed#Seed coat|tegmen]]. The [[cotyledon]]s are usually unequal in size, the [[endosperm]] is minimally present.&lt;ref&gt;N. Haq: Jackfruit Artocarpus heterophyllus. International Center for Underutilized Crops, 2006, {{ISBN|0-85432-785-1}} , p. 4-11, 72 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit matures during the rainy season from July to August. The bean-shaped achenes of the jackfruit are coated with a firm yellowish [[aril]] (seed coat, flesh), which has an intense sweet taste at maturity of the fruit. [3] The pulp is enveloped by many narrow strands of fiber (undeveloped [[perianth]]), which run between the hard shell and the core of the fruit and are firmly attached to it. When pruned, the inner part (core) secretes a very sticky, milky liquid, which can hardly be removed from the skin, even with soap and water. To clean the hands after "unwinding" the pulp an oil or other solvent is used. For example, street vendors in Tanzania, who sell the fruit in small segments, provide small bowls of kerosene for their customers to cleanse their sticky fingers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

An average fruit consists of 27% edible seed coat, 15% edible seeds, 20% white pulp (undeveloped perianth, rags) and bark and 10% core.

==As food==
[[File:Jackfruit Flesh.jpg|thumb|right|Jackfruit flesh]]
Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle flavoring.&lt;ref name=Jackfruit/&gt; It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice as ''[[es teler]]'' in Indonesia or ''[[halo-halo]]'' in the Philippines. For the traditional breakfast dish in southern India, ''[[idli]]s'', the fruit is used with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit ''[[dosa]]s'' can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter. Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried, or [[Freeze-drying#Food industry|freeze-dried]] and sold as jackfruit chips.

The [[seed]]s from ripe fruits are edible, and are said to have a milky, sweet taste often compared to [[Brazil nut]]s. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted. When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts. In Java, the seeds are commonly cooked and seasoned with salt as a snack. They are quite commonly used in curry in India in the form of a traditional lentil and vegetable mix curry.

===Aroma===
Jackfruit has a distinctive sweet and fruity aroma. In a study of flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main [[Volatile organic compound|volatile compounds]] detected were [[ethyl isovalerate]], propyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, isobutyl isovalerate, [[3-methylbutyl acetate]], [[1-butanol]], and [[2-methylbutan-1-ol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ong |first1=B.T. |last2=Nazimah |first2=S.A.H. |last3=Tan |first3=C.P. |last4=Mirhosseini |first4=H. |last5=Osman |first5=A. |last6=Hashim |first6=D.

The flesh of the jackfruit is starchy and fibrous and is a source of dietary fiber. The pulp is composed of 74% water, 23% [[carbohydrates]], 2% [[protein]], and 1% [[fat]]. In a 100-g portion, raw jackfruit provides {{convert|95|kcal|kJ|order=flip|abbr=on}} and is a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (25% DV). It contains moderate levels (10-19% DV) of [[vitamin C]] and [[potassium]], with no other nutrients in significant content.

The jackfruit also provides a potential part of the solution for tropical countries facing problems with [[food security]],&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; such as several countries of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000106577/venture-in-rare-jackfruit-turns-farmer-s-fortunes-around |title=Venture in rare jackfruit turns farmers' fortunes around |website=Standard Online |publisher=Standard Group Ltd. |author=Mwandambo, Pascal |date=11 March 2014 |access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jackfrucht Fruchtfleisch 1.jpg|thumb|Packaged jackfruit chunks, seasoned with paprika, tomato and other herbs and spices. When prepared in this way, jackfruit has the look and texture of meat.]]

The flavor of the ripe fruit is comparable to a combination of apple, pineapple, mango, and banana.&lt;ref name=Jackfruit/&gt;&lt;ref name=janick&gt;{{cite book |title=The encyclopedia of fruit &amp; nuts |author1=Janick, Jules |author2=Paull, Robert E. |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varieties are distinguished according to characteristics of the fruit flesh. In [[Indochina]], the two varieties are the "hard" version (crunchier, drier, and less sweet, but fleshier), and the "soft" version (softer, moister, and much sweeter, with a darker gold-color flesh than the hard variety). Unripe jackfruit has a mild flavor and meat-like texture and is used in [[curry]] dishes with spices in many cuisines. The skin of unripe jackfruit must be peeled first, then the remaining jackfruit flesh is chopped in a labor-intensive process&lt;ref name="Labor-intensive preparation"&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=1031973100978692096 |user=@GeneforTexas |title=Look for this thread later when we do:   "You don't know Jackfruit." |author=Gene Wu |date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; into edible portions and cooked before serving.

The cuisines of many Asian countries use cooked young jackfruit.&lt;ref name=janick /&gt; In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food. The boiled young jackfruit is used in salads or as a vegetable in spicy curries and side dishes, and as fillings for [[cutlet]]s and chops. It may be used by [[vegetarian]]s as a substitute for meat. It may be cooked with coconut milk and eaten alone or with meat, shrimp or smoked pork. In southern India, unripe jackfruit slices are deep-fried to make chips.

====South Asia====
[[File:Baby jack fruit curry-Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|Jackfruit in a Sri Lankan curry]]

In Bangladesh, the fruit is consumed on its own. The unripe fruit is used in curry, and the seed is often dried and preserved to be later used in curry.&lt;ref name="The Daily Star"/&gt; In India, two varieties of jackfruit predominate: ''muttomvarikka'' and ''sindoor''. ''Muttomvarikka'' has a slightly hard inner flesh when ripe, while the inner flesh of the ripe ''sindoor'' fruit is soft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Morpho-Molecular Characterization of Jackfruit. ''Artocarpus heterophyllus''|date=2015|author= Ashwini. A|publisher=Kerala Agricultural University|url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/5810030062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sweet preparation called ''[[chakkavaratti]]'' (jackfruit jam) is made by seasoning pieces of ''muttomvarikka'' fruit flesh in [[jaggery]], which can be preserved and used for many months. The fruits are either eaten alone or as a side to rice. The juice is extracted and either drunk straight or as a side. The juice is sometimes condensed and eaten as candies. The seeds are either boiled or roasted and eaten with salt and hot chilies. They are also used to make spicy side dishes with rice. Jackfruit may be ground and made into a paste, then spread over a mat and allowed to dry in the sun to create a natural chewy candy.

====Southeast Asia====
In Indonesia and Malaysia, jackfruit is called ''nangka''. The ripe fruit is usually sold separately and consumed on its own, or sliced and mixed with shaved ice as a sweet concoction dessert such as ''[[es campur]]'' and ''[[es teler]]''. The ripe fruit might be dried and fried as ''[[kripik]] nangka'', or jackfruit cracker. The seeds are boiled and consumed with salt, as it contains edible starchy content; this is called ''beton''. Young (unripe) jackfruit is made into curry called ''[[gulai]] nangka'' or stewed called ''[[gudeg]]''.

In the Philippines, jackfruit is called ''langka'' in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and ''{{lang|ceb|nangkà}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Nangkà|last      = Wolff|first     = John U. |encyclopedia     = A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan|year      = 1972 |url       = http://seapdatapapers.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=seap&amp;cc=seap&amp;idno=seap085b&amp;node=seap085b%3A11&amp;view=image&amp;seq=168&amp;size=200|page= 698|volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. The unripe fruit is usually cooked in coconut milk and is eaten with rice. The ripe fruit is often an ingredient in local desserts such as ''[[halo-halo]]'' and the Filipino [[turon (food)|turon]]. The ripe fruit, besides also being eaten raw as it is, is also preserved by storing in syrup or by drying. The seeds are also boiled before being eaten.

Thailand is a major producer of jackfruit, which are often cut, prepared, and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags or boxes without syrup) and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe.

In Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit ''[[chè]]'', a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative ''bubur cha cha''. The Vietnamese also use jackfruit purée as part of pastry fillings or as a topping on ''[[xôi]] ngọt'' (a sweet version of sticky rice portions).

Jackfruits are found primarily in the eastern part of Taiwan. The fresh fruit can be eaten directly or preserved as dried fruit, candied fruit, or jam. It is also stir-fried or stewed with other vegetables and meat.

====Americas====
In Brazil, three varieties are recognized: ''jaca-dura'', or the "hard" variety, which has a firm flesh, and the largest fruits that can weigh between 15 and 40&amp;nbsp;kg each; ''jaca-mole'', or the "soft" variety, which bears smaller fruits with a softer and sweeter flesh; and ''jaca-manteiga'', or the "butter" variety, which bears sweet fruits whose flesh has a consistency intermediate between the "hard" and "soft" varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seagri.ba.gov.br/jaca.htm General information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413050157/http://www.seagri.ba.gov.br/jaca.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}, Department of Agriculture, State of Bahia&lt;/ref&gt;

====Africa====
From a tree planted for its shade in gardens, it became an ingredient for local recipes using different fruit segments. The seeds are boiled in water or roasted to remove toxic substances, and then roasted for a variety of desserts. The flesh of the unripe jackfruit is used to make a savory salty dish with smoked pork. The jackfruit arils are used to make jams or fruits in syrup, and can also be eaten raw.

== Wood and manufacturing==
[[File:Jackfruit Tree Kerala.jpg|thumb|Jackfruit tree]]

The golden yellow timber with good grain is used for building furniture and house construction in India. It is termite-proof and is superior to teak for building furniture. The wood of the jackfruit tree is important in Sri Lanka and is exported to Europe. Jackfruit wood is widely used in the manufacture of furniture, doors and windows, in roof construction,&lt;ref name="Jackfruit"/&gt; and fish sauce barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baodanang.vn/english/danang-attractions/201402/nam-o-fish-sauce-village-2310357/ |title=Nam O fish sauce village |newspaper=Danang Today |date=2014-02-26 |access-date=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wood]] of the tree is used for the production of musical instruments. In Indonesia, hardwood from the trunk is carved out to form the barrels of drums used in the ''[[gamelan]]'', and in the Philippines, its soft wood is made into the body of the ''[[kutiyapi]]'', a type of boat [[lute]]. It is also used to make the body of the Indian string instrument ''[[veena]]'' and the drums ''[[mridangam]]'', ''[[thimila]]'', and ''[[kanjira]]''.

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Jackfruit Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|Developing jackfruit]]

The jackfruit has played a significant role in Indian agriculture for centuries.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Jackfruit leaves.jpg|thumb|Jackfruit leaves]]

In terms of taking care of the plant, minimal pruning is required; cutting off dead branches from the interior of the tree is only sometimes needed.&lt;ref name=Jackfruit/&gt; In addition, twigs bearing fruit must be twisted or cut down to the trunk to induce growth for the next season.&lt;ref name="Jackfruit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morton |first1=Julia |title=Jackfruit|url=https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/jackfruit_ars.html |publisher=Center for New Crops &amp; Plant Products, Purdue University Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branches should be pruned every three to four years to maintain productivity.&lt;ref name="Jackfruit"/&gt;

Some trees carry too many mediocre fruits and these are usually removed to allow the others to develop better to maturity.

Stingless bees such as ''[[Tetragonula iridipennis]]'' are jackfruit pollinators, so play an important role in jackfruit cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Kothai, S. (2015). "Environmental Impact on Stingless Bee Propolis (Tetragonula iridipennis) Reared from Two Different Regions of Tamilnadu — A Comparative Study". International Journal of ChemTech Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production and marketing===
In 2017, India produced 1.4 million [[tonne]]s of jackfruit, followed by [[Bangladesh]], [[Thailand]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Benjamin Elisha Sawe|title=World Leaders In Jackfruit Production|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-leaders-in-jackfruit-production.html|publisher=WorldAtlas|accessdate=23 May 2018|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing of jackfruit involves three groups: producers, traders, and [[wholesale|middlemen]], including wholesalers and retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haq |first=Nazmul |date=2006 |title=Jackfruit: Artocarpus heterophyllus |location=Southampton, UK |publisher=Southampton Centre for Underutilised Crops |url=http://www.cropsforthefuture.org/publication/Monographs/Jackfruit%20monograph.pdf |page=129 |isbn=978-0-85432-785-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005003119/http://www.cropsforthefuture.org/publication/Monographs/Jackfruit%20monograph.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[marketing channel]]s are rather complex. Large farms sell immature fruit to wholesalers, which helps cash flow and reduces risk, whereas medium-sized farms sell the fruit directly to local markets or retailers.

===Commercial availability===
Outside of its countries of origin, fresh jackfruit can be found at food markets throughout Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Jackfruit/&gt;&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/23/jackfruit-miracle-crop-climate-change-food-security | title=Jackfruit heralded as 'miracle' food crop | publisher=The Guardian, London, UK | date=23 April 2014 | accessdate=17 October 2016 | author=Goldenberg, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also extensively cultivated in the Brazilian coastal region, where it is sold in local markets. It is available canned in sugary syrup, or frozen, already prepared and cut. Jackfruit industries are established in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into products such as flour, noodles, ''[[papad]]'', and ice cream.&lt;ref name=gold/&gt; It is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export.

Outside of countries where it is grown, jackfruit can be obtained year-round, both canned or dried. Dried jackfruit chips are produced by various manufacturers.

==Invasive species==
In Brazil, the jackfruit can become an [[invasive species]] as in Brazil's [[Tijuca Forest]] National Park in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The Tijuca is mostly an artificial [[secondary forest]], whose planting began during the mid-19th century; jackfruit trees have been a part of the park's flora since it was founded.

Recently, the species has expanded excessively, and its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals, such as the [[common marmoset]] and [[coati]]. The seeds are dispersed by these animals; this allows the jackfruit to compete for space with native tree species. Additionally the supply of jackfruit as a ready source of food has allowed the marmoset and coati populations to expand. Since both prey opportunistically on birds' eggs and nestlings, increases in marmoset or coati population are detrimental for local bird populations.

[[File:Evaporation ponds Kesterson national wildlife refuge.jpg|thumb|Evaporation ponds in the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge]]
The '''Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge''' was an artificial [[wetland]] environment, created using agricultural [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farmland in [[California]]'s [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]].

The [[irrigation]] water is transported to the valley from sources in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] via the [[California Aqueduct]].  Minerals from these sources are carried in the water and concentrated by evaporation from aqueducts, canals, and fields. This has resulted in an exceptionally high accumulation of [[selenium]] and other minerals in the wetlands.  Wildlife in this region suffered deformities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/ducklrg.gif |accessdate=February 15, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029064607/http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/ducklrg.gif |archivedate=October 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to selenium poisoning, drawing the attention of news media and leading to the closure of the refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/0elemap.htm |accessdate=February 15, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310041621/http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/gips/0elemap.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tragedy at Kesterson Reservoir: Death of a Wildlife Refuge Illustrates Failings of Water Law|url=http://elr.info/sites/default/files/articles/15.10386.htm|publisher=Environmental Law Reporter|accessdate=12 June 2016|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quo Vadis-HABA.jpg|thumb|In a ''Klotski'' puzzle, the largest block must be moved to the bottom middle location so that it can be slid over the border, without any of the other blocks being removed in this way.]]

'''Klotski''' (from [[Polish language|Polish]] ''klocki''—wooden blocks) is a [[sliding block puzzle]] thought to have originated in the early 20th century. The name may refer to a specific layout of ten blocks, or in a more global sense to refer to a whole group of similar sliding-block puzzles where the aim is to move a specific block to some predefined location.

==Rules==
Like other sliding-block puzzles, several different-sized block pieces are placed inside a box, which is generally in 4×5 size. Among the blocks, there is a special one (usually the largest) which must be moved to a special area designated by the game board. The player is not allowed to remove blocks, and may only slide blocks horizontally and vertically. Common goals are to solve the puzzle with a minimum number of moves or in a minimum amount of time.

==Naming==
[[Image:Bricks-Forget-Me-Not-small.png|right|204px|thumb|A screenshot of the "forget me not" level in the Windows Entertainment Pack version of the game]]The earliest known reference of the name ''Klotski'' originates from the computer version for [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]] by ZH Computing in 1991, which was also included in Microsoft [[Windows Entertainment Pack]]. The sliding puzzle had already been trademarked and sold under different names for decades, including ''Psychoteaze''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSwhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA899&amp;lpg=PA899&amp;dq=psychoteaze&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6UCkKOndS1&amp;sig=vydTvvTAqdo32XbZKtd3UoVrX9c&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gfoiUMa6HPGwiQer74GgBg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=psychoteaze&amp;f=false |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries.

There was no known widely used name for the category of sliding puzzles described before ''Klotski'' appeared.

==History==

A significant precursor of the Klotzki puzzle is the 19th century [[15-puzzle]], where fifteen wooden squares had to be rearranged. The 15-puzzle enjoyed immense popularity in western countries during the late 19th century. Around this time, patents appeared for puzzles using differently shaped blocks. Henry Walton filed {{US patent|516035}} in 1893 for a sliding puzzle of identically-shaped rectangles, which according to [[Edward Hordern]], is the first known sliding puzzle with rectangular blocks. Frank E. Moss filed {{US patent|668386}} in 1900 for a sliding puzzle of six squares and four rectangles, which is one of the first known occurrences of sliding puzzle with non-equal blocks.

[[File:Dad's Puzzle.png|thumb|upright|The layout of the ''Pennant Puzzle'']]
Lewis W. Hardy obtained copyright for a game named ''Pennant Puzzle'' in 1909, manufactured by OK Novelty Co., Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Enlisted in Section 5.A.1 of {{cite book| last=Singmaster |first=David |date=2004 |title=Sources in Recreational Mathematics - An Annotated Bibliography|edition=8th Preliminary| publisher=South Bank University }} ([http://www.puzzlemuseum.com/singma/singma-index.htm Available online] at the Puzzle Museum)&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this puzzle is identical to Klotski, and only its default blocks and arrangement are different. Hardy also filed {{US patent|1017752}} in 1907, which is about a sliding-block puzzle similar to ''Pennant Puzzle'', but with a slightly different combination of blocks and a different goal—not must only the largest block be moved to a specific location, but all of the other blocks must achieve a specific configuration as well. The patent was granted in 1912.

John Harold Fleming obtained patent for a puzzle in 1934 in [[England]], with almost identical configuration as described in this page. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=411515 |status=patent |title= An improved puzzle, and means therefor |gdate=1934-06-07 |pridate=1932-12-07 |assign1=John Harold Fleming |class=A63F9/08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puzzle concerned has the same blocks and almost identical placement as forget-me-not, only that the unique horizontal 2×1 block is placed at the bottom instead of beneath the 2×2 block. The patent included a 79-step solution.

It is said that the game was already known in [[Japan]] around the 10th year of the [[Shōwa period]], i.e. around 1935.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The first account of occurrence of Klotski in [[China]] is in [[Shaanxi Province]], where Lín Dé Kuān of [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] noted children in a village playing a version of Klotski made with pieces of paper in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn=9787030139856 | author=Wú Hè Líng | title=七巧板、九连环和华容道 | year=2004}} (translation: Tangram, Baguenaudier and Klotski)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest books about standard Klotski was written by the Chinese professor Jiāng Cháng Yīng of Northwestern Polytechnical University in 1949，in his book 科学消遣. (translation: ''Science Pastime'') This book has been republished as {{cite book| isbn=7-5612-0971-1 | title=科学思维锻炼与消遣 | year=1997}} (translation: ''Scientific mindset training and pastime'')

It is still unknown which version of the puzzle is the original. There are many confusing and conflicting claims, and several countries claim to be the ultimate origin of this game.

==Solving==
The minimum number of moves for the original puzzle is 81, which is verified by computer to be the absolute minimum for the default starting layout, if you consider sliding a single piece to any reachable position to be a single move.

The first published 81-step solution is by [[Martin Gardner]], in the February 1964 issue of [[Scientific American]]. In the article he discussed the following puzzles (with [[Edward Hordern]] classification code in parentheses): Pennant Puzzle (C19), L'Âne Rouge (C27d), Line Up the Quinties (C4), Ma's Puzzle (D1) and a form of Stotts' Baby Tiger Puzzle (F10).

For earliest published solutions (not optimal solution), currently known is from Chinese educator Xǔ Chún Fǎng, in his book 數學漫談. (translation: ''Mathematics Tidbits''; [[:zh:開明書店|Kāi Mínɡ Shū Diàn]], March 1952) His solution involves 100 steps.

==Variation==
There are several variations of this game, some with names specific to the culture of certain countries, some with different arrangement of blocks.

It is still unknown whether these variations affected each other and how.

===Other names===
The following variations basically have the same layout and block arrangement, varying only in name (human, animal, or others), usually with some sort of story behind the names. It is completely unknown whether they share the same origin, though this is highly possible as they are identical to each other.

====Huarong Dao====
[[Image:HuaRongDao.jpg|thumb|upright|The Chinese wooden game ''Huarong Dao(華容道)'', thought to date from the 1930s, follows the same pattern as ''Klotski''.]]
''Huarong Dao'' (alternatively named ''Huarong Path'' or ''Huarong Trail'', Chinese name: 華容道) is the Chinese variation, based on a fictitious story in the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' about the warlord [[Cao Cao]] retreating through Huarong Trail (in present-day [[Jianli County]], [[Jingzhou]], [[Hubei]]) after his defeat at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in the winter of 208/209 CE during the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]]. He encountered an enemy general, [[Guan Yu]], who was guarding the path and waiting for him. Guan Yu spared Cao Cao and allowed the latter to pass through Huarong Trail on account of the generous treatment he received from Cao in the past. The largest block in the game is named "Cao Cao".

====Daughter in the box====
[[Image:Hakoiri3.jpg|thumb|right|A Daughter in the Box （箱入り娘） board]]
The ''Daughter in the Box'' (Japanese name: ''hakoiri musume'') wood puzzle depicts an "innocent young girl, who knows nothing of the world" trapped in a building. The largest piece is named "daughter", and other blocks are given names of other family members (like father, mother and so on).

Another Japanese variation uses the names of [[shogi]] pieces.

====L'âne rouge====
In France it is well known as ''L'âne rouge''. It features a red donkey (the largest piece) trying to escape a maze of fences and pens to get to its carrots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.comcast.net/~l-whiting/attbi/30YearsAgo.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121228071229/http://home.comcast.net/~l-whiting/attbi/30YearsAgo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-28 |title=3 0 + Y e a r s A g o |publisher=Home.comcast.net |date=1928-03-27 |accessdate=2013-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no known and documented record of its first existence in France.

====Khun Chang Khun Phaen====
This is a variation from Thailand. [[Khun Phaen]] is a famous character in Thai legend, and the game is named after the epic poem ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]'', in which the character is imprisoned. The game depicts Khun Phaen breaking out of the prison by overcoming its nine sentries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1261&amp;part=index&amp;refpage=monthindex.php |title=Mathematics Enrichment :: Khun Phaen Escapes to Freedom |publisher=nrich.maths.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a slight difference between ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' and the standard layout – the two middle 1×1 blocks are moved to bottom. Other than that, all other blocks are the same. The origin of this variation is unknown.

===Other block arrangements===
In this context, the "basic" arrangement is assumed to be a 4×5 area laid out as follows:-
* In the left-hand column, two 1×2 blocks with a 1×1 block beneath.
* In the right-hand column, two 1×2 blocks with a 1×1 block beneath.
* In the middle two columns, a 2×2 block at the top, with a horizontal 2×1 block beneath it, two 1×1 blocks beneath that, leaving a 2×1 empty space at the bottom.

This is used globally as the "basic" game of Klotski. It is coded C27d in [[Edward Hordern|Hordern]] classification of sliding puzzle games.

====Pennant Puzzle====

Coded as C19 in Hordern classification, it is first copyrighted in 1909 by Lewis. W. Hardy in United States.  Standard Trailer Co. has it copyrighted under the name ''Dad's Puzzler'' in 1926 (also in US).  Its arrangement is different:
# The default location of all blocks are different from Klotski. For example, the largest square block is in upper left corner.
# It is in 4×5 area, with one 2×2, two 1×2, four 2×1, two 1×1 pieces.
# The exit of block is not at the bottom middle, but bottom left.

Other than these, the game rules are the same as Klotski. The minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle is 59.

====Ma's Puzzle====
''Ma's Puzzle'' is copyrighted by Standard Trailer Co. at 1927. It was the first sliding puzzle to use non-rectangular shape. Its goal is to join its 2 L-shaped pieces together, either anywhere or top right corner of the board.

===Computerized version===
The first known graphical version of Klotski was created for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] by ZH Computing in 1991. It was later in the same year included in the third Microsoft [[Windows Entertainment Pack]]. Many versions of Klotski followed, either freely available or commercially available. For example, one is included in the [[GNOME]] desktop environment. Some include blocks which have special effects.

The '''La Barrancosa Dam''', formerly known as '''Jorge Cepernic Dam''' and previously, '''La Barrancosa Dam''', is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] being built on the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]] about {{Convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Puerto Santa Cruz]] in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina]]. It was renamed after the former governor of Santa Cruz [[Jorge Cepernic]]. A consortium led by China's [[Gezhouba Group]] was awarded the contract to build the Jorge Cepernic Dam and the [[Néstor Kirchner Dam]] upstream in August 2013. The consortium will also fund the construction. Both dams are expected to cost nearly US$4.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/08/22/china-will-build-and-finance-two-dams-in-patagonia-equivalent-to-10-of-argentine-power-demand | title=China will build and finance two dams in Patagonia equivalent to 10% of Argentine power demand | date=22 August 2013 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be built by the firm ''Electroingeniería'', led by Osvaldo Acosta and Gerardo Ferreyra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/economia/Represas-Kirchner-y-Cepernic--La-ultima-gran-joya-de-los-reyes-de-la-obra-publica-20130803-0029.html Represas Kirchner y Cepernic | La última gran joya de los reyes de la obra pública] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and its power station will have an installed capacity of 600 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.obraspublicas.gov.ar/documentos/Libros_Respresas/Libro_Ingles.pdf | title=Hydroelectric Projects in the Santa Cruz River | work=Water and Energy National and Regional Integration | agency=Government of Argentina |page=95| accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 machines arrived in Santa Cruz for the construction of the dams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151009200506/http://www.minplan.gob.ar/noticia/21931/arribaron-maquinas-para-las-represas-kirchner-cepernic.html Ministerio de Planificación - Arribaron máquinas para las Represas Kirchner-Cepernic &lt;nowiki&gt;[web.archive.org]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life-cycle engineering''' (LCE) is an approach to assess the environmental impacts in conjunction with economic impacts under consideration of technical boundary conditions. Scope of the assessment is usually the whole life cycle of a product consisting of production, use phase and end of life.
The [[environmental impact]]s are assessed using environmental [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA). The economic impacts are assessed according to the [[Whole-life cost|life cycle costing]] (LCC) approach. Technical boundary conditions are taken into account providing some limitations on the model, thus verifying the technical feasibility.

LCE aims to deliver a consistent standard of living for future generations that can be maintained indefinitely. Not only does LCE aim to reduce negative impacts on the environment but it can also be used to reduce [[Cost|economic costs]] for businesses and every day society. 

One aspect of LCE for businesses is the extension of a part of a [[Product life cycle|products life-cycle]]. The method of involving incremental innovation within production can be seen as a main way to achieve this. The combination of innovation together with technology allows for the function of products to be pushed further, allowing designers to improve the quality of how products meet expanding customer needs. 
The key themes are economic, social, environmental and technological. All these themes are interlinking and can be influenced by life cycle engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10373">This list of countries by of electrification rate sorts countries by the share of their inhabitants with access to [[electricity]]. Access to electricity is considered one of the prerequisites for a modern life. In 2016, 87.4% of the world population had access to electricity. Worldwide, there are major differences between urban and rural regions in the degree of electrification

This page '''lists large-scale rooftop photovoltaic installation projects'''. [[Photovoltaic arrays]] in buildings are often either integrated into them, or mounted on to their roofs. Arrays are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure. In 2010, more than four-fifths of the 9,000 MW of solar PV operating in Germany was installed on rooftops.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld.com"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/06/germany-to-raise-solar-target-for-2010-adjust-tariffs Germany To Raise Solar Target for 2010 &amp; Adjust Tariffs | Renewable Energy News Article]. Renewableenergyworld.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the large-scale stations are not installed on the roofs, but rather integrated are ground-mounted. Most rooftop applications are done in small and medium-sized installations for consumption within the buildings that host the arrays. There are many significant installation projects which have been completed and many are under construction or proposed.

The following lists the rooftop photovoltaic installation projects that are larger than 1 MW in total installation size. It does not include rooftop installations of non-building structures such as detached [[carport]]s and [[tunnel]]s.

==Rooftop photovoltaic power stations==
Many photovoltaic power stations are installed at the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|ground level]]. There are some large rooftop installations for the sole purpose of being power stations by connecting the systems directly to the grid to deliver electricity to customers. Many of these stations are installed on properties of non-utility companies such as warehouses through roof-area [[lease agreement]]s and [[power purchase agreement]]s between utility companies and property owners.&lt;ref name="njboom"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/08/25/25greenwire-solar-industrys-boom-in-nj-casts-shadow-over-p-52495.html Solar Industry's Boom in N.J.

==Net-metering rooftop installations==
The followings are the large rooftop installation projects with the main purpose of using the generated electricity as the supplemental power. When the systems generate electricity more than the host buildings can consume, the excess electricity is fed back to the grid to ''bank'' with the utility company through [[net metering]]. Below are large multi-site installation projects with total size of rooftop units of 1 MW or larger.

==Single-site installations==
Each installation may be done on a single roof structure or on multiple buildings within the same site or campus.

==Multi-site installations==
Some property owners who have many smaller buildings located in multiple sites within the same area may take advantage of installing many medium-size systems in one project to achieve the large-scale power generation to offset their total power usage. The sites of the same owner are normally connected into the same monitoring system for easy maintenance of the overall system.

The '''Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak''' ('''MAST''') experiment was a [[nuclear fusion]] experiment in operation at [[Culham Centre for Fusion Energy]], [[Oxfordshire]], England, from December 1999 to September 2013.

It followed the highly successful [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak]] (START) experiment (1991-1998) and is followed by MAST-Upgrade (2016 - ), which re-uses many of MAST's components and services. MAST used the same innovative [[spherical tokamak]] design as START,  which has shown itself to be more efficient than the conventional [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] design, adopted by [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) and [[ITER]]. START proved to exceed even the most optimistic predictions and the purpose of MAST is to confirm the results of its forerunner by using a larger more purpose-built experiment.

It was fully commissioned by [[EURATOM]]/[[UKAEA]] and took two years to design and a further two years to construct. It includes a [[neutral beam injector]] similar to that used on START and uses the same merging compression technique instead of the conventional direct induction. [[Merging compression]] provides a valuable saving of central solenoid flux, which can then be used to further ramp up the plasma current and/or maintain the required current flat-top.

Its plasma volume is about 8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Density ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Image to right shows plasma in the MAST reactor, displaying its almost circular outer profile. The extensions off the top and bottom are plasma flowing to the ring divertors, a key feature of modern tokamak designs.

==Objectives==

* Studies in a new regime, to provide improved understanding of tokamaks, and improved [[ITER]] design (e.g. effects of plasma shaping).
* To investigate the potential of the spherical tokamak route to [[fusion power]].

==Timeline==
* ~1995 design starts
* ~1997 construction starts
* 1999 First plasma
* 2013 Oct. Final plasma (#30471) before shutdown for upgrade.&lt;ref name=MNLP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/news_detail.aspx?id=239 |title=News: It's goodbye to MAST - and hello to MAST Upgrade |publisher=Ccfe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The magnetic field coils are not superconducting and (for longer runs after upgrade 1a) need to be cooled to -20&amp;nbsp;°C before each pulse.&lt;ref name=MUpgIM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/mastupgrade_model.aspx |title=MAST Upgrade: MAST Upgrade model |publisher=Ccfe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
From 1999 to 2013 it made 30471 plasmas (in pulses up to 0.5 sec). Research by [[Melanie Windridge]] ''et al'' during this period demonstrated non-linear instability at large vertical displacements in the MAST tokamak. Windridge concluded that MAST plasmas may be more vulnerable to vertical disruptions than other tokamaks because of the magnetic field structure and the lack of a close-fitting wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Windridge|first1=M.

==MAST Upgrade==
Researchers are carrying out a major upgrade to significantly enhance the device's capabilities in an attempt to address its primary objectives.  The first stage "1a" should be completed during 2017.&lt;ref name=MUpg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/mast_upgrade_project.aspx |title=Research: MAST Upgrade |publisher=Ccfe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plasma physics experiments planned towards the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/mast_upgrade_news.aspx |title=MAST Upgrade: MAST Upgrade news |publisher=Ccfe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first upgrade '1a' :
* Toroidal magnetic field will be increased from 0.55 Tesla to 0.84 Tesla
* Energy deposited in plasma at high current will be increased from 2.5 megajoules to 10-20 megajoules
* Max Pulse length at high current/field will be increased from 0.5 seconds to 2–4 seconds
* Plasma current will be increased from 1,300,000 amps to 2,000,000 amps
It will be the first tokamak to use a [[Super-X divertor]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Metabolic wastes''' or '''excretements''' are [[Chemical substance|substance]]s left over from [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes (such as [[cellular respiration]]) which cannot be used by the [[organism]] (they are surplus or [[toxicity|toxic]]), and must therefore be [[excretion|excreted]]. This includes [[nitrogen]] compounds, [[water]], [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[phosphate]]s, [[sulphate]]s, etc. [[Animal]]s treat these compounds as excretes. [[Plant]]s have [[Chemistry|chemical]] "machinery" which transforms some of them (primarily the nitrogen compounds) into useful substances, and it has been shown by [[Brian J. Ford]] that [[Abscission|abscised]] the parent plant. In this way, Ford{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Not doubtful about factuality—just flagging that a certain unspecified Ford is being mentioned without any citation explaining which Ford he or she is.}} argues that the shed leaf acts as an ''excretory'' (an organ carrying away excretory products).

All the metabolic wastes are excreted in a form of [[water]] [[solution|solutes]] through the excretory [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] ([[nephridia]], [[Malpighian tubule]]s, [[kidney]]s), with the exception of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is excreted together with the [[water vapor]] throughout the [[lung]]s. The elimination of these compounds enables the chemical [[homeostasis]] of the organism.

==Nitrogen wastes==
{{Further information|Urea#Physiology|Urea cycle}}
The nitrogen compounds through which excess nitrogen is eliminated from organisms are called '''nitrogenous wastes''' ({{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|dʒ|ᵻ|n|ə|s}}) or '''nitrogen wastes'''. They are [[ammonia]], [[urea]], [[uric acid]], and [[creatinine]]. All of these substances are produced from [[protein metabolism]]. In many animals, the [[urine]] is the main route of [[excretion]] for such wastes; in some, the [[feces]] is.

===Ammonotelism===
Ammonotelism is the excretion of ammonia and ammonium ions. Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) forms with the oxidation of amino groups.(-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are removed from the proteins when they convert into carbohydrates. It is a very toxic substance to tissues and extremely soluble in water. Only one nitrogen atom is removed with it. A lot of water is needed for the excretion of ammonia, about 0.5 L of water is needed per 1 g of nitrogen to maintain ammonia levels in the excretory fluid below the level in body fluids to prevent toxicity. Thus, the marine organisms excrete ammonia directly into the water and are called '''ammonotelic'''.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chris M. Wood |author2=R.S. Munger |author3=D.P. Toews |year=1989|title=Ammonia, urea, and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; distribution and the evolution of  ureotelism in amphibians|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=144|pages=215&amp;ndash;233|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/144/1/215.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Ammonotelic animals include [[protozoan]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[platyhelminth]]s, [[cnidarian]]s, [[porifera]]ns, [[echinoderm]]s, and other aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref name="sree"&gt;{{cite book|author =S. Sreekumar|title =Basic Physiology|publisher =PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year =2010|page=180&amp;ndash;181|isbn = 9788120341074|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IxYR9wTeXQgC&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=cdNbQGQcv-&amp;dq=Ammonotelic&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ureotelism===
The excretion of urea is called ureotelism. Land animals, mainly [[amphibian]]s and [[mammal]]s, convert ammonia into urea, a process which occurs in the [[liver]] and kidney. These animals are called '''ureotelic'''.&lt;ref name=sree /&gt; Urea is a less toxic compound than ammonia; two nitrogen atoms are eliminated through it and less water is needed for its excretion. It requires 0.05 L of water to excrete 1 g of nitrogen, approximately only 10% of that required in ammonotelic organisms.

===Uricotelism===
Uricotelism is the ridding of excess nitrogen using [[uric acid]]. This method is used by [[bird]]s and [[diapsid]]s, [[insect]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[snake]]s, and these animals are  '''uricotelic'''.&lt;ref name=sree /&gt; Uric acid is less toxic than ammonia or urea. It contains four nitrogen atoms and only a small amount of water (about 0.001 L per 1 g of nitrogen) is needed for its excretion. Uric acid is the least soluble in water and can be stored in cells and body tissues without toxic effects. A single molecule of uric acid can remove four atoms of nitrogen making uricotelism more efficient than ammonotelism or ureotelism.&lt;ref name=sree/&gt;

Uricotelic organisms typically have white pasty excreta. Some mammals including humans excrete uric acid as a component of their urine but it is only a small amount.

==Water and gases==
These compounds form during the [[catabolism]] of carbohydrates and [[lipid]]s in condensation reactions, and in some other metabolic [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] of the amino acids.  Oxygen is produced by plants and some bacteria in photosynthesis, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a waste product of all animals and plants.  Nitrogen gases are produced by denitrifying bacteria and as a waste product, and bacteria for decaying yield ammonia, as do most invertebrates and vertebrates.  Water is the only liquid waste from animals and photosynthesizing plants.&lt;ref name="excretion"&gt;"excretion." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solids==
[[Nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s are wastes produced by [[nitrifying bacteria]], just as sulfur and sulfates are produced by [[sulfur-reducing bacteria]] and [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]. Insoluble iron waste can be made by [[iron bacteria]] by using soluble forms.  In plants, resins, fats, waxes, and complex organic chemicals are exuded from plants, e.g., the latex from rubber trees and milkweeds. Solid waste products may be manufactured as organic pigments derived from breakdown of pigments like hemoglobin, and inorganic salts like carbonates, bicarbonates, and phosphate, whether in ionic or molecular form, are excreted as solids.&lt;ref name="excretion"/&gt;

[[Animal]]s dispose of solid waste as [[feces]].

A '''Next Generation Nuclear Plant''' (NGNP) is a [[generation IV reactor|generation IV]] [[Very high temperature reactor|very-high-temperature reactor]] (VHTR) that could be coupled to a neighboring [[hydrogen production|hydrogen production facility]]. It could also produce electricity and supply process heat.

[[File:Oxyfuel CCS fossil fuel power plant operation.png|thumb|right|Oxyfuel CCS power plant operation]]
'''Oxy-fuel combustion''' is the process of burning a fuel using pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant. Since the nitrogen component of air is not heated, fuel consumption is reduced, and higher flame temperatures are possible. Historically, the primary use of oxy-fuel combustion has been in welding and cutting of metals, especially steel, since oxy-fuel allows for higher flame temperatures than can be achieved with an air-fuel flame.&lt;ref name="Royal Society of Chemistry"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Markewitz |first1=Peter |last2=Leitner |first2=Walter |last3=Linssen |first3=Jochen |last4=Zapp |first4=Petra |last5=Müller |first5=Thomas |last6=Schreiber |first6=Andrea |title=Worldwide innovations in the development of carbon capture technologies and the utilization of CO2 |journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |date=2012-03-01 |volume=6 |pages=7281–7385 |doi=10.1039/C2EE03403D |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2012/ee/c2ee03403d#!divAbstract |accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently research being done in firing fossil-fueled power plants with an oxygen-enriched gas mix instead of air. Almost all of the nitrogen is removed from input air, yielding a stream that is approximately 95% oxygen. Firing with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature, so the mixture is diluted by mixing with recycled [[flue gas]], or [[staged combustion]].  The recycled flue gas can also be used to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler areas. Oxy-fuel combustion produces approximately 75% less flue gas than air fueled combustion and produces exhaust consisting primarily of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (see figure).

==Economy and efficiency==
The justification for using oxy-fuel is to produce a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rich flue gas ready for [[carbon sequestration|sequestration]]. Oxy-fuel combustion has significant advantages over traditional air-fired plants. Among these are:

* The mass and volume of the flue gas are reduced by approximately 75%.
* Because the flue gas volume is reduced, less heat is lost in the flue gas.
* The size of the flue gas treatment equipment can be reduced by 75%.
* The flue gas is primarily CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, suitable for sequestration.
* The concentration of pollutants in the flue gas is higher, making separation easier.
* Most of the flue gases are condensable; this makes compression separation possible.
* Heat of condensation can be captured and reused rather than lost in the flue gas.
* Because nitrogen from air is absent, [[nitrogen oxide]] production is greatly reduced.

Economically speaking this method costs more than a traditional air-fired plant. The main problem has been separating oxygen from the air. This process needs lots of energy, nearly 15% of production by a coal-fired power station can be consumed for this process. However, a new technology which is not yet practical called [[chemical looping combustion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerplantccs.com/ccs/cap/con/of/of.html|title=Oxy Fuel CO2 Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technology Method - Power Plant CCS|website=www.powerplantccs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to reduce this cost. In chemical looping combustion, the oxygen required to burn the coal is produced internally by oxidation and reduction reactions, as opposed to using more expensive methods of generating oxygen by separating it from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/advanced-combustion/clc|title=chemical-looping-combustion {{!}} netl.doe.gov|website=www.netl.doe.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present in the absence of any need to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, oxy-fuel is not competitive. However, oxy-fuel is a viable alternative to removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gas from a conventional air-fired [[fossil fuel]] plant. However, an [[oxygen concentrator]] might be able to help, as it simply removes nitrogen.

In industries other than power generation, oxy-fuel combustion can be competitive due to higher sensible heat availability. Oxy-fuel combustion is common in various aspects of metal production.

The glass industry has been converting to oxy-fuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 2800 degrees F, which is not attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for air-fuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream. Historically, glass furnace regenerators were large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace. When the flue duct is thoroughly heated, air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet, releasing its heat into the incoming air, and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with air-fuel only. Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals, and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air. By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators, and especially with the added benefit of [[nitrogen oxide]] reduction, which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions, oxy-fuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion also reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release at the glass plant location, although this may be offset by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process.

Oxy-fuel combustion may also be cost effective in the incineration of low BTU value hazardous waste fuels. It is often combined with [[staged combustion]] for [[nitrogen oxide]] reduction, since pure oxygen can stabilize combustion characteristics of a flame.

==Pilot plants==
There are pilot plants undergoing initial proof-of-concept testing to evaluate the technologies for scaling up to commercial plants, including

=== White Rose plant ===
One case study of oxy-fuel combustion is the attempted White Rose plant in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The planned project was an oxy-fuel power plant coupled with air separation to capture two million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The carbon dioxide would then be delivered by pipeline to be sequestered in a saline aquifer beneath the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/white-rose-ccs-project|title=White Rose CCS Project {{!}} Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|website=www.globalccsinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late 2015 and early 2016, following withdrawal of funding by the Drax Group and the U.K. government, construction was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/white_rose.html|title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT|website=sequestration.mit.edu|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforeseen loss of the federal CCS Commercialisation Programme, along with decreased subsidies for renewable energy, left the White Rose Plant with insufficient funds to continue development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''perovskite''' is any material with the same type of [[crystal structure]] as [[calcium titanium oxide]] (CaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), known as the ''perovskite structure'', or &lt;sup&gt;XII&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;2+VI&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the oxygen in the [[cubic crystal system|edge centers]].&lt;ref name="Min"&gt;{{cite book |title=Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin  |first1=Hans-Rudolf |last1=Wenk |first2=Andrei |last2=Bulakh |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52958-7 |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskites take their name from the [[Perovskite|mineral]], which was first discovered in the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] mountains of [[Russia]] by Gustav Rose in 1839 and is named after Russian mineralogist [[L. A. Perovski]] (1792–1856). The general chemical formula for perovskite compounds is ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where 'A' and 'B' are two [[cation]]s of very different sizes, and X is an [[anion]] that bonds to both. The 'A' atoms are larger than the 'B' atoms. The ideal cubic structure has the B [[cation]] in 6-fold coordination, surrounded by an [[octahedron]] of [[anion]]s, and the A cation in 12-fold [[cuboctahedron|cuboctahedral]] coordination. The relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent, so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions, in which the coordination numbers of A cations, B cations or both are reduced.

Natural compounds with this structure are [[perovskite]], [[loparite]], and the [[silicate perovskite]] bridgmanite.&lt;ref name="Min"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-45900.html Bridgemanite] on [[Mindat.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The perovskite structure is adopted by many [[oxide]]s that have the chemical formula ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the idealized cubic [[unit cell]] of such a compound, type 'A' atom sits at cube corner positions (0, 0, 0), type 'B' atom sits at body-center position (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and oxygen atoms sit at face centred positions (1/2, 1/2, 0). (The diagram shows edges for an equivalent unit cell with A in the body center position, B at the corners, and O at mid-edge positions).

The relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent, so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions, in which the coordination numbers of A cations, B cations or both are reduced. Tilting of the BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra reduces the coordination of an undersized A cation from 12 to as low as 8. Conversely, off-centering of an undersized B cation within its octahedron allows it to attain a stable bonding pattern. The resulting electric dipole is responsible for the property of [[ferroelectricity]] and  shown by perovskites such as BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that distort in this fashion.

The [[orthorhombic]] and [[tetragonal]] phases are most common non-cubic variants.

Complex perovskite structures contain two different B-site cations. This results in the possibility of ordered and disordered variants.

==Common occurrence==

The most common mineral in the Earth is bridgmanite, a magnesium-rich silicate which adopts the perovskite structure at high pressure. As pressure increases, the SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedral units in the dominant silica-bearing minerals become unstable compared with SiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8−&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral units. At the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle, the most abundant material is a perovskite-structured mineral with the formula (Mg,Fe)SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with the second most abundant material likely the rocksalt-structured (Mg,Fe)O oxide, [[periclase]].&lt;ref name="Min"/&gt;

At the high pressure conditions of the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|lower mantle]], the [[pyroxene]] [[enstatite]], MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, transforms into a denser perovskite-structured [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]; this phase may be the most common mineral in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[QI]]: The Book of General Ignorance|last=John Lloyd|authorlink=John Lloyd (producer)|author2=John Mitchinson|author2-link=John Mitchinson (researcher) |chapter=What's the commonest material in the world|isbn=0-571-23368-6|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phase has the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure (GdFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-type structure) that is stable at pressures from ~24 GPa to ~110 GPa. However, it cannot be transported from depths of several hundred km to the Earth's surface without transforming back into less dense materials. At higher pressures, [[silicate perovskite|MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite]] transforms to [[post-perovskite]].

Although the most common perovskite compounds contain oxygen, there are a few perovskite compounds that form without oxygen. Fluoride perovskites such as NaMgF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are well known. A large family of metallic perovskite compounds can be represented by RT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M (R: rare-earth or other relatively large ion, T: transition metal ion and M: light metalloids). The metalloids occupy the octahedrally coordinated "B" sites in these compounds. RPd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, RRh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B and  CeRu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C are examples. MgCNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a metallic perovskite compound and has received lot of attention because of its superconducting properties. An even more exotic type of perovskite is represented by the mixed oxide-aurides of Cs and Rb,  such as Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AuO, which contain large alkali cations in the traditional "anion" sites, bonded to O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and Au&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anions.

==Materials properties==

Perovskite materials exhibit many interesting and intriguing properties from both the theoretical and the application point of view. [[Colossal magnetoresistance]], [[ferroelectricity]], [[superconductivity]], [[charge ordering]], spin dependent transport, high thermopower and the interplay of structural, magnetic and transport properties are commonly observed features in this family. These compounds are used as sensors and catalyst electrodes in certain types of [[SOFC|fuel cells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=A|display-authors=4|author2=FT Ciacchi |author3=S Giddey |author4=C Munnings |author5=SPS Badwal |author6=JA Kimpton |author7=D Fini |title=Mixed ionic electronic conducting perovskite anode for direct carbon fuel cells|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2012|volume=37|issue=24|pages=19092–19102|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.141|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319912022082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and are candidates for memory devices and [[spintronics]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Mixed-valence manganites| author =  J.

Many [[superconductor|superconducting]] [[ceramic]] materials (the [[high temperature superconductors]]) have perovskite-like structures, often with 3 or more metals including copper, and some oxygen positions left vacant. One prime example is [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] which can be insulating or superconducting depending on the oxygen content.

Chemical engineers are considering a cobalt-based perovskite material as a replacement for platinum in catalytic converters in diesel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Building a cheaper catalyst|author =  Alexandra Witze|journal =  Science News Web Edition|date = 2010|url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/57618/title/Building_a_cheaper_catalyst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Physical properties of interest to [[materials science]] among perovskites include [[superconductivity]], [[magnetoresistance]], [[ionic conductivity]], and a multitude of dielectric properties, which are of great importance in microelectronics and [[telecommunication]]. Because of the flexibility of bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure there are many different types of distortions which can occur from the ideal structure. These include tilting of the [[octahedra]], displacements of the cations out of the centers of their coordination polyhedra, and distortions of the octahedra driven by [[Electronics|electronic]] factors ([[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn-Teller distortions]]).&lt;ref name=Lufaso&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768103026661|title=Jahn–Teller distortions, cation ordering and octahedral tilting in perovskites|date=2004|last1=Lufaso|first1=Michael W.|last2=Woodward|first2=Patrick M.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|volume=60|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the methylammonium halides studied so far the most common is the methylammonium lead triiodide ({{chem|CH|3|NH|3|PbI|3}}). It has a high [[charge carrier]] mobility and charge carrier lifetime that allow light-generated electrons and holes to move far enough to be extracted as current, instead of losing their energy as heat within the cell. {{chem|CH|3|NH|3|PbI|3}} effective diffusion lengths are some 100&amp;nbsp;nm for both electrons and holes.&lt;ref name=sci1310&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodes | first1 = G. | title = Perovskite-Based Solar Cells | doi = 10.1126/science.1245473 | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156 | pages = 317–318 | year = 2013 | pmid =  24136955|bibcode = 2013Sci...342..317H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methylammonium halides are deposited by low-temperature solution methods (typically [[spin-coating]]). Other low-temperature (below 100&amp;nbsp;°C) solution-processed films tend to have considerably smaller diffusion lengths. Stranks et al. described [[nanostructure]]d cells using a mixed methylammonium lead halide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) and demonstrated one amorphous thin-film solar cell with an 11.4% conversion efficiency, and another that reached 15.4% using [[vacuum evaporation]]. The film thickness of about 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;nm implies that the electron and hole diffusion lengths were at least of this order. They measured values of the diffusion length exceeding 1&amp;nbsp;µm for the mixed perovskite, an order of magnitude greater than the 100&amp;nbsp;nm for the pure iodide. They also showed that carrier lifetimes in the mixed perovskite are longer than in the pure iodide.&lt;ref name=sci1310/&gt; Liu et. al applied Scanning Photo-current Microscopy to show that the electron diffusion length in mixed halide perovskite along (110) plane is in the order of 10&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shuhao|last2=Wang|first2=Lili|last3=Lin|first3=Wei-Chun|last4=Sucharitakul|first4=Sukrit|last5=Burda|first5=Clemens|last6=Gao|first6=Xuan P.

For {{chem|CH|3|NH|3|PbI|3}}, [[open-circuit voltage]] (V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) typically approaches 1&amp;nbsp;V, while for {{chem|CH|3|NH|3|PbI|(I,Cl)|3}} with low Cl content, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1.1&amp;nbsp;V has been reported. Because the [[band gap]]s (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) of both are 1.55&amp;nbsp;eV, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;-to-E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; ratios are higher than usually observed for similar third-generation cells. With wider bandgap perovskites, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; up to 1.3&amp;nbsp;V has been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=sci1310/&gt;

The technique offers the potential of low cost because of the low temperature solution methods and the absence of rare elements. Cell durability is currently insufficient for commercial use.&lt;ref name=sci1310/&gt;

Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells can be manufactured in simplified device architectures (without complex nanostructures) using only vapor deposition.  This technique produces 15% solar-to-electrical power conversion as measured under simulated full sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature12509| title = Efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells by vapour deposition| journal = Nature| volume = 501| issue = 7467| pages = 395–398| year = 2013| last1 = Liu | first1 = M. | last2 = Johnston | first2 = M.

=== Lasers ===

Also in 2008 researchers demonstrated that perovskite can generate [[laser]] light. LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; doped with [[neodymium]] gave laser emission at 1080&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=

=== Light-emitting diodes ===
Due to their high photoluminesence [[quantum efficiency|quantum efficiencies]], perovskites may be good candidates for use in [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stranks|first=Samuel D.|last2=Snaith|first2=Henry J.|date=2015-05-01|title=Metal-halide perovskites for photovoltaic and light-emitting devices |url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v10/n5/abs/nnano.2015.90.html |journal= Nature Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=391–402|doi=10.1038/nnano.2015.90|pmid=25947963|issn=1748-3387|bibcode=2015NatNa..10..391S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the propensity for [[Carrier generation and recombination|radiative recombination]] has mostly been observed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

=== Photoelectrolysis ===

In September 2014, researchers at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, reported achieving water electrolysis at 12.3% efficiency in a highly efficient and low-cost water-splitting cell using perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;ref name=Science-Luo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jingshan Luo|display-authors=etal|title=Water photolysis at 12.3% efficiency via perovskite photovoltaics and Earth-abundant catalysts|journal=Science|date=26 September 2014|volume=345|issue=6204|pages=1593–1596|doi=10.1126/science.1258307|pmid=25258076|bibcode = 2014Sci...345.1593L }}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PO-harvest&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvesting hydrogen fuel from the Sun using Earth-abundant materials|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-09-harvesting-hydrogen-fuel-sun-earth-abundant.html|accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=Phys.org|date=Sep 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pitchstone''' is a dull black glassy [[volcanic rock]] formed when [[felsic]] [[lava]] or [[magma]] cools quickly.  It is similar to [[obsidian]] but is defined by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] as having a higher water content.&lt;ref name=ballin /&gt; It is a volcanic glass; however, unlike a glass, pitchstone has an irregular hackly fracture not a [[conchoidal fracture]]. That is due to its coarser (than obsidian) crystal structure. Pitchstone has a [[resinous]] [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], or silky in some cases, and a variable composition. Its colour may be mottled, streaked, or uniform brown, red, green, gray, or black. It is an [[extrusive]] rock that is very resistant to [[erosion]].

The pitchstone [[ridge]] of [[An Sgùrr (Eigg)|An Sgùrr]] on the Isle of [[Eigg]], [[Geology of Scotland|Scotland]], was possibly formed as a lava flow in a valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=C.H.

'''Plymouth Voyager''' is a nameplate for a range of vans that were marketed by the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division of [[Chrysler]].  From 1974 to 1983, the Voyager was a full-size van, sold as the counterpart of [[Dodge Sportsman]] (later the Dodge Ram Wagon).  For 1984, the Voyager became a [[Chrysler minivans|Chrysler minivan]] sold alongside the [[Dodge Caravan]]; as a minivan, three generations of the Voyager were sold from 1984 to 2000.  Following the closure of the Plymouth division in 2000, the Voyager was marketed under the Chrysler brand (as a lower-trim version of the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]), where it was sold through 2003.      

From 1988 to 2016, Chrysler used the [[Chrysler Voyager]] name for export-market minivans; during the existence of the Plymouth brand, export-market Voyagers were produced with the body and trim of the Dodge Caravan.  When including the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan with their rebadged Chrysler, Lancia, and Volkswagen variants, the [[Chrysler minivans]] collectively rank as the [[List of automobile sales by model|13th best-selling automotive model line]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web

The Plymouth Voyager minivan was assembled by Chrysler at its [[Windsor Assembly]] facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada); from 1987 to 2000, the Voyager was also assembled at [[Saint Louis Assembly]] (Fenton, Missouri).  The full-size Plymouth Voyager van was assembled at the now-closed [[Pillette Road Truck Assembly]] facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada).

From 1974 to 1983, the Plymouth Voyager was the Plymouth counterpart of the [[Dodge Sportsman]] (the Dodge Ram Wagon after 1980).  The first truck marketed by Plymouth since 1942, the Voyager was introduced alongside the 1975  [[Plymouth Trail Duster]] (a counterpart of the [[Dodge Ramcharger]]).  As with the Sportsman, the Voyager was produced with 12-15 passenger seating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mclellansautomotive.com/photos/B28439.jpg 1974 Plymouth Voyager promotional postcard (McLellan's Automotive)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/reader-rides/4979/ Readers' Rides; 1974 Plymouth Voyager (Grassroots Motorsports)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Canadian Fargo vans, Plymouth badged the Voyager with "Plymouth" lettering centered in the grille instead of Dodge lettering on the hood.  In 1978, the lettering was moved to the hood.  Initially located on the driver side, the Plymouth lettering was centered for 1979, as the grille was enlarged and restyled.  For 1979 and 1980, the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Royal Sportsman were largely indistinguishable; latter examples of the Voyager are distinguished by the lack of large "RAM" badging on the door.    

In contrast to its Dodge counterpart, the Plymouth Voyager was equipped with a V8 engine as standard equipment.  However, the Voyager was only offered with the 318 and 360 V8s (the 400 and 440 V8 engines were available in Dodge vans prior to 1979).  {{clear}}

==Background==
[[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for a modern minivan during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company.  [[Henry Ford II]] had rejected Iaccoca's and Sperlich's idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974, then rumored to carry the name "Maxivan". Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler Corporation, and together they created the T115 minivan — a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known colloquially as the "Magic-wagons" (a term used in advertising).

The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the [[Renault Espace]] (the first MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a [[Talbot]] (which was made up of Chrysler Europe's disposed assets) in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html The Matra/Renault Espace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind — effectively creating the modern [[minivan]] segment in the US.

[[File:'87-'88 Plymouth Voyager.jpg|thumb|left|1987-1990 Plymouth Voyager SE]]
In 1984, Chrysler marketed the [[badge engineering|rebadged]] Plymouth variant of its new minivan as the Voyager, using the Chrysler's S platform,  derived from the K-platform ([[Plymouth Reliant]] and [[Dodge Aries]]). The Voyager shared components with the K-cars including portions of the interior, e.g., the Reliant's instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the Voyager a car-like ease of entry. The Voyager was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1985.&lt;ref name="allpar"&gt;{{cite journal  | url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html  | title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan | journal=[http://www.allpar.com/ Allpar]  | accessdate=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with ''SE'' or ''LE'' trim.

First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade ''SE'', and high-end ''LE'', the latter bearing [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling. A sportier ''LX'' model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES.

Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions.

===Seating===
1984-1986 Voyagers could be equipped for five, six, seven passengers, with an eight-passenger variant available only in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1986 Plymouth full-line"&lt;/ref&gt; Five-passenger seating, standard on all trim levels, consisted of two front bucket seats and an intermediate three-passenger bench seat. In 1985, on base and SE models, the front buckets could be replaced by a 40/60 split three-passenger bench seat, bringing the total number of occupants to six. Seven-passenger seating was an option on SEs and LEs, with dual front buckets, an intermediate two-passenger bench, and a rear three-passenger bench. Eight-passenger seating was available on SE models only, with both the additional middle two-passenger bench and three-passenger front bench. Depending on configuration, the base model could seat up to six, the SE could seat up to eight, and the LE could seat up to seven.

The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable, and the large three-seat bench could also be installed in the 2nd row location via a second set of attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five-passenger seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were very intuitive and easy to operate.

On base models, the front buckets were low-back items, upholstered with plain cloth or vinyl. On SEs, the buyer could choose between low-back buckets with deluxe cloth or high-back buckets in upgraded vinyl. LEs came standard with high-back front buckets, upholstered in either luxury cloth or luxury vinyl.

In 1985 and 1986, there was also a five-passenger version with a back seat that could be folded flat with the pull of a handle into a bed that filled the rear compartment from the back of the front seats to the rear. This option was known as the Magic Camper. The Magic Camper back seat had an extra rear-facing cushion that formed the back-most section of the bed when folded flat and the seat, though very heavy, was removable. The Magic Camper option included a tent that attached magnetically to the side of the vehicle allowing access in and out of the sliding side door.

For 1987 the six- and eight-passenger options were withdrawn, leaving seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models.

[[File:87-90 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE.jpg|thumb|1987-1990 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE]]

For the first 3 years of production, two [[inline-4]] engines with 2 barrel [[carburetors]] were offered. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] was borrowed from the Chrysler [[Chrysler K Platform|K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] engine later offered in the Chrysler [[Chrysler K Platform|K-cars]] was only offered in the Voyager for the 1987 model year, and would remain the base powerplant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6L]] engine was available producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower.

At launch, the Voyager's low [[power-to-weight ratio|horsepower to weight ratio]] had not been much of a concern. Its main competitors were the [[Toyota Van]] and the [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Vanagon]], both of which offered similar performance. In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with the new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

A [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the base 2.5L producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was available in 1989 and 1990. Also in 1989, revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. In 1990, a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3L V-6]] was added to the option list. Sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled as a result, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

===Transmissions===
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with all [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 [[Liter|L]] (this was a rare combination). [[V6 engine|V-6]] engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated [[TorqueFlite]], until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine.

[[File:91-95 Plymouth Voyager.jpg|thumb|left|1992-1993 Plymouth Voyager]]

The Plymouth Voyager was modified for 1991 with new sheet metal. The S platform was still used, though renamed the "AS platform". These were the last Voyagers that were derived from the [[Chrysler K platform]].

Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. 1991 Voyagers were available in base, mid-grade ''SE'', high-end ''LE'', and high-end sporty ''LX''. The LX which was available only on short-wheelbase Voyagers, was marketed as a sport-luxury minivan and came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, [[Automotive lighting|fog lamps]], and wide array of power-operated features.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1991 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years various trim packages were offered on SE models. The "Sport Wagon" package available from 1993–1995 featured accent color (gray) bumpers and [[molding (automotive)|molding]], fog lamps, and special aluminum wheels.&lt;ref name="Used Plymouth Prices"&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/used/plymouth/index.html "Used Plymouth Prices"], retrieved on 2010–08–23.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Rallye" package offered in 1995, took the place of the departed ''LX'' model. It was more luxury-oriented, with lower body two-tone paint — regardless of upper body color, the lower body was painted "Driftwood Beige" — silver aluminum wheels, and special badging.&lt;ref name="Used Plymouth Prices"/&gt; The [[font]] first used for the Rallye's badging was adopted for all of Plymouth's badging from 1996 onward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/model/m/1991-voyager.html "1991-1995 Chrysler minivans: Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar], retrieved on 2010–08–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interiors were more differentiated in this generation than on the first with a redesigned dashboard for 1994 featured a passenger-side front airbag.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and a seating package, marketed as "Quad Command" seating package, available on SE, LE, and LX models. Quad command replaced the 2nd row bench with two individual bucket seats with a center aisle to the 3rd row bench. Interior options varied with trim levels and packages. Cloth seating was standard on all models; leather seating was a standalone extra-cost option on LE and LX models.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Only badging and minor cosmetics differentiated the Voyager from its [[Dodge Caravan]] rebadged variant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared the Voyager's headlamps and taillights along with its own chrome waterfall grille.

===Innovations===
This generation of vans brought additional innovations, including:
* "Quad Command" bucket seating (1990)
* Available [[All-wheel drive]] (1990)
* Available [[anti-lock brakes]] (1990)
* First driver's side [[airbag]] in a minivan (1991), made standard (1991), and first dual front airbags (1993)
* Integrated child safety seats (1991), improved design with recliners (1993)
* First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards (1993)

The turbocharged engine and Convert-A-Bed feature were dropped.&lt;ref name="allpar"/&gt;

{{clear}}

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1991: Second-generation minivans released. A driver's side airbag was made standard for this year. Integrated child safety seats in the second row bench were optional on 1992 Voyagers. The Grand Voyager was available with a lower-cost powertrain. A {{Convert|142|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.0 L V6 and a 3-speed automatic could be substituted for the standard {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.3 L V6 with its 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual transmission could once again be paired with the base engine, which was now the 2.5 liter four instead of the original 2.2 liter four.
* 1993: On 7-passenger models, the optional "Quad Command" bucket seats replaced the middle bench seat. The right bucket tilted forward to ease entry and exit to the rearmost bench. The front shoulder belts became height-adjustable and rear shoulder belts had lower anchor points and the horn button was black.
* 1994: New bumpers and body moldings, and a redesigned dashboard appeared on all 1994 Voyagers. New safety features which included a passenger-side airbag and side door-guard beams enabled the Voyager to meet all passenger car safety requirements through 1998. A cassette player became standard on all models but the base, and a CD player was available on all models. Under the hood, a {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.8 L V6 was a new option for top-of-the-line Grand Voyager LE models. The 3.3 L V6 had been upgraded to produce {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as well. For 1994 the "10 Year Anniversary Edition" was an option on Voyager ''SE'' models; it had unique two-tone paint and badges.
* 1995: No major changes were made for 1995, except for the new ''Rallye'' option package available on ''SE'' models. Rallye models came with special silver-accent wheels and special two-toned paint on the lower body.

The 1996 Plymouth Voyager was completely redesigned from the ground up. Gone were its [[Chrysler K platform|K-car]] underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed [[cab-forward]] design. The third generation redesign used the [[Chrysler S platform|Chrysler NS platform]] and included a driver's-side sliding door, a minivan first. The Voyager was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724084058/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1996_10best_cars-10best_cars "1996 10Best Cars"], retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars "1997 10Best Cars"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730194234/http://www.caranddriver.sg/features/archive/1997_10best_cars-10best_cars |date=2012-07-30 }}, retrieved on 2010–08–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Chrysler's new corporate strategy to better focus the Plymouth brand on entry-level vehicles, [[United States|U.S.]] market third generation Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were mostly available in base trim, better-equipped ''SE'' models and high-end ''LE'' models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock W |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation (1st Edition) |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''LX'' model was discontinued for the third generation, having been replaced by the Chrysler Town &amp; Country SX and LX. A Rallye option package, carried over from the previous generation, was available on the SE model.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1996 Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt;  It was renamed "Expresso" for 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysler Corporation Factory Sales Brochure "1998 Plymouth Voyager"&lt;/ref&gt; All-wheel drive models were discontinued in the US market, remaining available in others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.chryslerminivan.net/archive/index.php/t-20059.html?s=8c1afb82b8d13cba4d035de2ec8a2a5c "Chart of Available Trim Levels"], retrieved on 2017-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unavailable in all Voyager models were fog lights, auto-dimming rear view mirrors, and a memory function for the power driver's seat in vans with that option.

Base Voyagers and Voyager SEs were easily distinguished by their body-side moldings. Base models used a narrow accent color strip and SE models used a wide accent color strip with a "Plymouth" badge above it on either front door. If equipped with the Rallye or Expresso packages, the "Plymouth" badge is replaced with a "Rallye" or "Expresso" badge. LEs were identical to the Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan LE aside from the front bumper, grille, wheels which were shared with the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]], and badging. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheetmetal was no longer flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yates, Brock W |title=The Critical Path: Inventing and Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation (1st Edition) |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation Voyagers introduced a new system of rear seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning&amp;mdash; marketed as "Easy-Out Roller Seats". All Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped with this feature. When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench seats) were latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1996: As running changes during this model year, the Pentastar front logo and rear badging carried over from the previous generation were replaced with the new "sailboat" logo and script font, while the front interior door panels were redesigned, losing the discrete grab handles in favor of ones integrated into the armrests.
* 1997: A CD player was a new option. Other than that, only minimal changes.
* 1998: Grocery bag hooks were added to the rearmost bench. The Rallye package was renamed Expresso and now included new wheel covers (if equipped with steel wheels), a standard CD player and a body-colored grille). SE models with optional low-back seats and LE models received updated cloth upholstery. As a running change during this model year, the HVAC vents on the driver's side and in the center of the dashboard were changed to a more conventional design.
* 1999: The 3.8 L V6 was made available for SE models; it was already available on the LE model, Caravan and Town &amp; Country. A small [[cargo net]] between the front seats, additional standard equipment, integrated child-safety seats and second-row buckets were added to the Voyager this year. Air conditioning was made standard on ''SE'' models. In Canada, the 3.0L V6 was made standard equipment. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year-only 15th anniversary "Platinum Edition", to mark Caravan's 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels, and included Platinum Metallic paint, and fender badges.
* 2000: Now standard on all models was air conditioning, power windows, and power locks (the latter two standard on ''SE'' models only). A dealer-installed rear-seat video entertainment system was newly available on all models. The 2000 model year offered packages which included the "2000+" and "Millennium" package; however these were little more than unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment.

In 1999, Plymouth's demise was announced, resulting in the 2000 Voyager/Grand Voyager models in the US doing double duty as both [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouths]] and [[Chrysler]]s.

===Crash test results===
The 1996-2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (twin of the Voyager/Grand Voyager) received a "Marginal" rating in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s 40&amp;nbsp;mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded "Acceptable", but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal-impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

'''Private wire''' systems are localised [[electricity grid]]s, that although connected to the local distribution networks have privately owned central plant that produces [[electricity]].  This enables it to operate a stand-alone supply in the event of the national grid failing.  This provides localised energy security.

== Event ==
On July 27, 2013, a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] owned by [[PTT Global Chemical Plc|PTTGC Plc]], a [[Thailand|Thai]] state-owned oil company, burst while oil was being transferred from an undersea well to a tanker.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; PTTGC then followed the operation procedures for oil spill management. The Company used boats and airplanes to spray oil-spill dispersants, 0,612 litres of Slickgone NS and 6,930 litres of Super-Dispersant 25, which are permitted by the Department of Pollution Control to be used in Thailand, because they have low toxicity, are biodegradable and do not bio-accumulate or cause mutation and degeneration. It released also a boom to contain the spilled oil within the area. However, the boom did not work well due to bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pttgcgroup.com/en/news/press/244/5/investigation-committee-confirms-oil-slick-volume-of-54000-litres-pttgc-follows-operation-procedure-reasonable-volume-of-dispersant-used Investigation committee confirms oil slick volume of 54,000 litres, PTTGC follows operation procedure, reasonable volume of dispersant used.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 28 July 2013, the oil leak (from a pipeline) {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the beach at Ko Samet's Coconut Bay&lt;ref name="investvine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/thai-oil-spill-romantic-island-is-disaster-zone-video/|title=Thai oil spill: Romantic island is 'disaster zone' (video)|first=Arno|last=Maierbrugger|work=Inside Investor|date=31 July 2013|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ao Phrao) resulted in the beach being closed and its tourists evacuated, after [[spillage]] reached the beach.&lt;ref name="investvine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/362045/work-gangs-battle-to-clean-oil-slick-from-beach-at-popular-koh-samet-island-in-rayong|title=Work gangs battle to clean oil slick from beach at popular Koh Samet island in Rayong - Bangkok Post: news|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August 2013 media said that the crude oil spill had occurred {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} off of Thailand's mainland, "when a floating hose transferring oil from a tanker to a [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]] refinery pipeline broke sending, PTT says, {{convert|50000|L|oilbbl|abbr=on}} of oil spewing into the coastal waters".&lt;ref name=Slickexplanation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/362925/no-slick-explanation-for-huge-ptt-oil-spill|title=No slick explanation for huge PTT oil spill|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two beaches have been closed due to uncertainty about water toxicity.&lt;ref name="PCD delays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/PCD-delays-disclosure-of-results-on-Samet-water-30212748.html|title=PCD delays disclosure of results on Samet water|date=16 August 2013|work=The Nation|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ko Samet is a popular tourist island, not far from Bangkok, {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Ban Phe', Rayong. Concerns have been growing about the oil spill and the inconsistent information released.

Ko Samet is close to Rayong and Map Ta Phut, and they have had a long history of environmental problems since they opened in 1990. About 25,000 people live in the Map Ta Phut municipality. In 1997, the pollution came to public attention when 1,000 pupils and teachers at a local school suffered from illnesses after inhaling toxic emissions and had to be hospitalized. An independent test carried out in 2005 demonstrated that airborne cancerous toxic chemicals released by Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate exceeded safety standards of developed nations by 60 to 3,000 times.&lt;ref name="asiancorrespondent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/26595/the-environmental-problems-at-map-ta-phut/|title=The environmental problems at Map Ta Phut - Asian Correspondent|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil spill is in part connected to the oil operations at Map Ta Phut. Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant is reported to have said "In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all. Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution—you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you." Map Ta Phut was closed down in 2009 by the previous Prime Minister, Abhisit Vejjaijiva due to safety concerns. The New York Times reported "Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem."

Two days after the oil spill was discovered, PTT closed their War Room down according to Bangkok Post, and they have consistently since then tried to play down the effects of the spill. A week later they were saying it was safe to go to the beach and that it was clean. Greenpeace is concerned with the use of dispersants and the oil has sunk to the bottom and the full effects of the spill have yet to be understood. Mercury levels have also been reported to be 21 times safe limits. The dispersants also have negative effects and can cause cancers, kidney and liver problems. Some people swimming in the sea have reported dizziness. Bangkok Post reported "In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts."

== Estimates ==
Official reports said {{convert|50000|L|oilbbl|abbr=on}} of oil were spilled, but critics of the oil company and the government say that the spill was much larger and warned of health risks posed both by the spill and by the chemicals being used to disperse the oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A higher estimate of the oil spill has been performed by Somporn Chuai-aree of Prince Songkhla University: "as low as {{convert|108000|L|oilbbl|abbr=on}} or as high as {{convert|190000|L|oilbbl|abbr=on}}".&lt;ref name=Slickexplanation /&gt; This estimate is believed by associate professor Siwat Pongniumchan from the National Institute of Development Administration (Nida), who disbelieves previous estimates.&lt;ref name=Slickexplanation /&gt;

A 14 August 2013 [[Bangkok Post]] article said that "Fishery Department director-general Wimol Jantrarotai said [[Chulalongkorn University]] lab tests on seafood found metal contamination in samples from fish markets near Koh Samet."&lt;ref name=Mercury&gt;{{cite news|title=Tests find mercury in Ao Phrao sea water|url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/364487/dangerous-mercury-levels-found-at-ao-phrao|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil company's information sheet given to media (on the beach) on 31 July, said that the [[oil dispersant]] used is "Slickgone NS".&lt;ref name=Airpollution /&gt;

On 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that "authorities and more than 500 PTT employees have been struggling to prevent the slick spreading at the beach. They have tried to contain the spill, which has stretched almost {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the bay, using [[containment boom]]s to prevent further environmental damage in the area."&lt;ref name=Insurance&gt;{{cite news|title=PTTGC faces Samet spill legal action|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that "[[Mercury (element)|mercury]] levels found in sea water off Ao Phrao beach on Koh Samet were 29 times higher than safety standards allow, according to the Pollution Control Department.&lt;ref name="Mercury"/&gt; Furthermore "Niphon Phungsuwan, a marine expert from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, said more than 70% of coral at Ao Phrao had been bleached."

Bangkok Post reports "PTTGC has remained silent about what chemicals it is using but also said they could pose a hazard to the environment and people's health." &lt;ref name="alarm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/362251|title=Alarm bells sound over oil spill dispersant use|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts. "The use of dispersants is a solution that creates new and worse problems," Ms Arpa said. The main ingredients of Corexit include 2-Butoxyethanol which can comprise up to 60% of the dispersant and is known to harm the blood, kidneys, liver and central nervous system.&lt;ref name="alarm"/&gt; Some people swimming near Ko Samet have reported dizziness, and two beaches have been closed. Swimming is not recommended until more is known and the full environmental impacts have been independently verified. As of 20 August 2013, tourists are recommended to use caution if and when going swimming in the water, and to be careful of seafood for now. They should report dizziness of feeling unwell to the relevant authorities or to their embassy.

On 31 August 2013 Bangkok Post said that the level of [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (TPH) "still exceeds safety standards".&lt;ref name=TPH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/367260/chemicals-linger-off-koh-samet|title=Chemicals linger off Koh Samet|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance==
On 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that "The company PTTGC has insurance coverage of US$50 million with Dhipaya Insurance."

Roméite is a honey-yellow mineral crystallizing in the [[Cubic (crystal system)|hexoctahedral]] [[crystal system]]. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5-6.0.  It occurs in [[Algeria]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Europe]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United States]] in [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[iron]]-[[manganese]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] and in [[hydrothermal]] [[antimony]]-bearing [[vein (geology)|veins]].

Its type locality is [[Prabornaz Mine]], [[Saint-Marcel, Italy|Saint-Marcel]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[Italy]].  It was named after [[Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l'Isle]].  Brugger, et al. (1997) used [[infrared]] [[spectroscopy]] to measure water content in Roméite crystals.

She also successfully battled the area's main air polluter—the government-owned [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] (PREPA)-- forcing the public utility to dramatically reduce the lever of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere and forcing it to pay a $7 million federal fine.

The 2008 Goldman Environmental Prize, which includes a $150,000 monetary grant, was awarded to seven recipients in [[San Francisco, California]] on April 14, 2008.

'''Sino-Myanmar pipelines''' refers to the oil and natural gas pipelines linking [[Myanmar]]'s deep-water port of [[Kyaukphyu]] ([[Sittwe]]) in the [[Bay of Bengal]] with [[Kunming]] in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] of [[China]].

==History==
Talks between China and Myanmar on the feasibility of the project began in 2004. In December 2005, [[PetroChina]] signed a deal with Myanmar's Government to purchase natural gas over a 30-year period.&lt;ref name=jamestown&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this agreement, the parent company of PetroChina, [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC), signed on 25 December 2008 a contract with the [[Daewoo|Daewoo International]]-led consortium to purchase natural gas from the [[Shwe gas field]] in A-1 offshore block.&lt;ref name=reuters251208&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan to build the oil and gas pipelines was approved by China's National Development and Reform Commission in April 2007.&lt;ref name=downstream&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2008, China and Myanmar agreed to build a US$1.5&amp;nbsp;billion oil pipeline and US$1.04&amp;nbsp;billion natural gas pipeline. In March 2009, China and Myanmar signed an agreement to build a natural gas pipeline, and in June 2009 an agreement to build a crude oil pipeline.&lt;ref name=downstream190609&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shwe, Shwe-Phyu, and Mya areas in the A-1 and A-3 blocks, estimated to hold 127–218&amp;nbsp;bcm of natural gas in total, are operated by a group led by [[Daewoo|Daewoo International Corp.]]&lt;ref name="bloomberg2"/&gt;  The operators group also includes [[Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise]]&lt;!-- this is not misspelling but official name --&gt;, [[GAIL]], and [[Korea Gas Corporation]].

The total project of pipelines is expected to cost US$2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;

In July 2014 CNPC celebrated the first anniversary of the launch of the Myanmar-China natural gas pipeline by announcing that nearly two billion cubic metres of gas has been piped from Indian Ocean plays onto the Asian continent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilandgastechnology.net/pipeline-news/myanmar-china-pipeline-ships-187bn-cubic-metres-gas&lt;/ref&gt;

A railway that will connect Muse and Lashio is part of the project. The railway will be 80 miles long and will include 41 bridges, 36 underground tunnels and 7 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mizzima.com/business/5212-burma-china-sign-railway-pact-to-transport-gas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001123331/http://mizzima.com/business/5212-burma-china-sign-railway-pact-to-transport-gas.html |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
A number of protests in Burma and abroad took place against the construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=MBT&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyaw Min|title=China-Myanmar Gas Pipeline Becomes Fully Operational|url=http://mmbiztoday.com/articles/china-myanmar-gas-pipeline-becomes-fully-operational|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=Myanmar Business Today|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pipelines have sparked protests over environmental and safety concerns, and inadequate compensation arrangements for local residents. Critics have also said the contract, which was signed under the [[State Peace and Development Council|military regime]], should be revisited and that Burma should not be exporting gas when three-quarters of the population lack electricity.&lt;ref name=MmT/&gt;

==Operating company==
The project will be implemented jointly by [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) and Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise&lt;!-- this is not misspelling but official name --&gt; (MOGE). CNPC will hold a 50.9% stake and manage the project, and MOGE will own the rest.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt;

The '''Solar Electric Light Fund''' (SELF) is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit whose mission is to design and implement [[solar energy]] solutions to assist those living in [[energy poverty]] with their economic, educational, health care, and agricultural development. Since 1990, SELF has completed projects in more than 20 countries, using solar energy to power [[drip irrigation]] in [[Benin]], health care in [[Haiti]], [[telemedicine]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]], online learning in [[South Africa]], and [[microenterprise]] development in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox non-profit

==Methodology==
SELF believes that energy access is essential to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. SELF's Whole Village Development Model takes an integrated approach to community empowerment by using a mix of solar energy solutions to improve the lives of the 1.5 billion people who don't have access to electricity around the world.  By working closely with communities and adhering to its principles of SELF Determination, SELF Help and SELF Reliance, it seeks to provide benefits in:
* [[Education]]: powering lights, computers and wireless internet services.
* [[Health]]: powering facility lights, labs, diagnostic equipment and [[vaccine refrigerators]].
* Water &amp; Agriculture: powering water wells and pumps for clean drinking water and year-round crop irrigation.
* Enterprise: powering centers for small businesses and providing electricity for machinery and equipment.
* [[Community]]: electrifying homes, community centers and street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation===

SELF was founded in 1990 by Neville Williams, an award-winning journalist and author ({{underline|Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World}}), who had experience actively promoting solar power as a staffer with the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] during the Carter administration.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Neville (2005). Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World. New Society Publishers. {{ISBN|0-86571-537-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For much of the 1990s, SELF's primary mission was to deliver solar home systems – 50-watt units installed at the household level that could generate enough power to run a few compact fluorescent lights, a radio, and a small black and white television for four or five hours each evening.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/history/&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity generated by the solar panel is stored in a battery, which then provides power at night and during rainy weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/story/chapter05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909200050/http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/story/chapter05.html |archivedate=2013-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early projects, SELF used funds donated by private philanthropies to buy home-size [[photovoltaic system]]s in bulk on the open market, usually enough for one small village at a time. SELF then sold the systems to villagers in developing areas, in partnership, where possible, with in-country nonprofit agencies. Each participating household made a 20 percent down payment on a solar energy system and paid off the balance – usually between $300 and $400 – over several years. The buyers'payments were pooled in a local revolving loan fund from which their neighbors could borrow to buy their own solar power gear. SELF used a portion of the proceeds on the equipment to establish a local dealership and train residents as solar installers and technicians. The revolving loan funds made it possible for villagers to finance the continued dissemination of solar systems in their areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/history-continued/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focusing on the Home &amp; Creating SELCO===

Over time, SELF began to evolve more elaborate project structures. In a joint venture with local partners in [[India]], SELF formed a for-profit subsidiary using India's [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] to tap [[World Bank]] funds set aside specifically for photovoltaic installations. In part, the company used the money to finance rural co-ops' bulk purchase of solar-energy systems for their members, to install the systems, and to train local technicians. The company then repaid the World Bank's loan from funds collected from the co-ops.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/history-continued/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, SELF decided to launch a for-profit affiliate, the [[Solar Electric Light Company]], or SELCO, based in [[Bangalore]], India, whose goal would be to sell solar home systems in the states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Neville Williams stepped down from his role with SELF to run SELCO, and SELF's board of directors appointed Robert A. Freling as the new executive director.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/history-continued/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, SELCO has sold, serviced, and financed over 115,000 solar systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.selco-india.com/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding Services===

Beginning in 2000, SELF embarked on its next generation of projects that would seek to harness solar energy for things such as advancing water pumping and purification, purveying electrification to rural schools and health clinics, providing power to small businesses and micro-enterprises, and facilitating communication access.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/history-continued/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first opportunity to fulfill this expanded vision was found in [[South Africa]], where SELF had been working on a project to install solar home systems in the [[Valley of a Thousand Hills]], in the province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. SELF installed a 1.5-kilowatt solar array, which generated enough electricity to power approximately 20 PCs donated by Dell Computers and a small satellite dish that delivered Internet access to Myeka High School. This was the first solar-powered computer lab built in South Africa, and the pass rate at Myeka High School jumped from 30 percent to 70 percent within a year and a half of installation.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/archive-south-africa/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whole Village Development Model===

In 2003, SELF found the opportunity to implement a "Whole-Village" approach when the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) invited SELF to carry out a solar electrification project in [[Nigeria]]. With support from the DOE, SELF equipped three villages in [[Jigawa State]], in northern Nigeria, with solar power systems for a community water-pumping system, a health clinic, a primary school, street lighting, a portable irrigation pump, and a micro-enterprise center.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/archive-nigeria/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, SELF has continued to implement this model in other project countries.

===Past Projects===

SELF has worked in over 20 countries, using solar energy to power health clinics, schools, community centers, water pumps, mosques, drip irrigation, streetlights, and micro-enterprise centers. In addition to its current project sites, SELF has worked in [[Bhutan]], [[Brazil]], [[Burundi]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kenya]], [[Lesotho]], the [[Navajo Nation]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/past-projects/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===[[Benin]]===

In partnership with the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] (ICRISAT) and Association pour le Developpement Economique Social et Culturel de Kalalé (ADESCA), SELF has installed a total of eleven of its Solar Market Gardens™ (SMG), an innovative, unique solar-powered drip irrigation system, for women farming collectives in [[Dunkassa]] and Bessassi, two villages in the arid, northern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/03/120314-solar-drip-irrigation-in-benin-africa/&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-year study conducted by [[Stanford University]]'s Program on Food Security and the Environment department appearing in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] found that SELF's SMGs, "significantly augments both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season, and is cost effective compared to alternative technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Jennifer, Lennart Woltering, Marshall Burke, Rosamond Naylor, and Dov Pasternak, "Solar-powered drip irrigation enhances [[food security]] in the [[Sudano-Sahel]]," http://www.pnas.org/content/107/5/1848&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the SMGs, SELF has also installed three community water wells, streetlights, and solar systems to power two schools and a health center. In 2014, SELF finished the installation of a solar micro-grid that will power a micro-enterprise center in Bessassi, and construction of a second micro-enterprise center in Dunkassa is nearing completion. SELF's future plans include replicating the potable water pumping stations in two more villages, assessing the potential for vaccine refrigerators at solar-electrified clinics, preparing for a pilot internet café, and planning a solar home lantern program.

===[[Haiti]]===

After the [[2010 earthquake]], SELF and [[Partners In Health]] teamed to develop the Rebuilding Haiti Initiative to fully power eight health centers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pih.org/news/entry/solar-power-to-build-back-better/{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELF has also installed 100 solar powered streetlights in tent camps to increase safety, and in collaboration with [[NRG Energy, Inc.]] and the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]], SELF has completed the Sun Lights the Way: Brightening [[Boucan-Carré]] project by installing solar systems to power a [[fish farm]], 20 schools, a Solar Market Garden™, and a microenterprise center.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/haiti/&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this project has increased the quality of education for students in remote areas and has contributed to ensuring year-round food security.

In 2013, SELF solarized an additional seven schools to serve nearly 2,000 students, and also installed 20 solar-powered streetlights around Boucan-Carré in dangerous areas. Currently, SELF is installing two solar micro-grids that will provide electricity to 15,000 people in [[Port-à-Piment]], [[Côteaux]], [[Roche-à-Bateaux]], and Fe-Yo-Bien, to be completed in 2015.

===[[Colombia]]===

With support from Acción Social (a governmental agency in Colombia) and [[Microsoft]], SELF conducted a week-long site assessment and determined that deploying solar electric systems for the indigenous [[Arhuaco]], Kogi and Wiwa communities in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of northern Colombia is feasible. The project, a part of the Cordon Ambiental y Tradicional de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta initiative led by Acción Social, is intended to power the health and educational facilities in the villages, along with community lighting systems at select locations.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/2011SELF_Annual_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SELF was selected as a Grand Challenges Explorations winner, an initiative funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], for groundbreaking research in solar powered direct-drive freezers to support global health and development. To support immunization efforts at two remote village health posts in the mountains of Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, SELF successfully field-tested three solar powered direct-drive vaccine refrigerators and the first commercially available direct-drive, battery-free vaccine icepack freezer.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/colombia/&lt;/ref&gt; Following the tests, the fridge and freezer were donated to the village of Sabana Crespo.

SELF is also working on plans to install a solar energy based microgrid in the village of Sabana Crespo to power coffee facilities, the village general store, a health care clinic which includes a new laboratory, and the village's school and cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://self.org/colombia/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spice''' is a [[seed]], [[fruit]], [[root]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], or other [[plant]] substance primarily used for [[flavor]]ing, [[color]]ing or [[preservative|preserving]] food. Spices are distinguished from [[herb]]s, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for [[flavor]]ing or as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]]. Many spices have [[antimicrobial]] properties. This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more [[infectious disease]]s, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling.&lt;ref name="ThomasDaoust2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Frédéric |last2=Daoust |first2=Simon P. |last3=Raymond |first3=Michel |title=Can we understand modern humans without considering pathogens? |journal=Evolutionary Applications |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=2012 |pages=368–379 |issn=1752-4571 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00231.x|pmid=25568057 |pmc=3353360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spices are sometimes used in [[medicine]], [[Sacred rite|religious rituals]], [[cosmetics]] or [[perfume]] production.{{Example needed}}

==History==
{{main|Spice trade}}

===Early history===

The spice trade developed throughout [[South Asia]] and [[Middle East]] by at earliest 2000 BCE with [[cinnamon]] and [[black pepper]], and in [[East Asia]] with herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|mummification]] and their demand for exotic spices and herbs helped stimulate world trade. The word ''spice'' comes from the Old French word ''espice'', which became ''epice'', and which came from the Latin root ''spec'', the noun referring to "appearance, sort, kind": ''[[species]]'' has the same root. By 1000 BCE, medical systems based upon herbs could be found in [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[India]]. Early uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.&lt;ref name=ABCp14&gt;{{cite book |last=Murdock |first=Linda | title=A Busy Cook's Guide to Spices: How to Introduce New Flavors to Everyday Meals | publisher=Bellwether Books | year=2001 | isbn=9780970428509 | page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clove|Cloves]] were used in [[Mesopotamia]] by 1700 BCE.{{refn |group=note |A team of archaeologists led by [[Giorgio Buccellati]] excavating the ruins of a burned-down house at the site of [[Terqa]], in modern-day [[Syria]], found a ceramic pot containing a handful of cloves. The house had burned down around 1720 BC and this was the first evidence of cloves being used in the west before Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Connell |first=John |title=The Book of Spice: From Anise to Zedoary |publisher=Pegasus Books | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-68177-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The ancient Indian [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] [[Ramayana]] mentions cloves. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had cloves in the 1st century CE, as [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote about them.&lt;ref name="Duke 2002 p. 7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Duke |first=J.A. |title=CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-4200-4048-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPTLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |accessdate=2017-05-09 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written records of spices come from ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian cultures. The Ebers Papyrus from Early Egyptians that dates from 1550 &lt;small&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/small&gt; describes some eight hundred different medicinal remedies and numerous medicinal procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food and Culture|last=Woodward|first=Penny|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Katz|volume=2|location=|pages=187–195|chapter=Herbs and Spices|quote=|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians believe that [[nutmeg]], which originates from the [[Banda Islands]] in [[Southeast Asia]], was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burkill |first=I.H. |title=A Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Co-Operatives |location=Kuala Lumpur |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian merchants traveled around China, India, the Middle East, and the east coast of Africa. [[Arab]] merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle East and India. This resulted in the Egyptian [[port city]] of [[Alexandria]] being the main trading center for spices. The most important discovery prior to the European spice trade were the monsoon winds (40 CE). Sailing from Eastern spice cultivators to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans.&lt;ref name=ABCp14/&gt;

In the story of [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice merchants. In the biblical poem [[Song of Solomon]], the male speaker compares his beloved to many forms of spices.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Le livre des merveilles de Marco Polo-pepper.jpg|thumb|left|"The Mullus" Harvesting pepper. Illustration from a French edition of ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]''.]]
Spices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;sup&gt;[[Spice#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; the most common being [[black pepper]], [[cinnamon]] (and the cheaper alternative [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]]), [[cumin]], [[nutmeg]], [[ginger]] and [[cloves]]. Given [[medieval medicine]]'s main theory of [[humorism]], spices and herbs were indispensable to balance "humors" in food,&lt;sup&gt;[[Spice#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; a daily basis for good health at a time of recurrent [[pandemic]]s. In addition to being desired by those using [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medieval medicine]], the European elite also craved spices in the [[Middle Ages]]. An example of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the [[King of Aragon]], who invested substantial resources into bringing back spices to [[Spain]] in the 12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in [[wine]], and was not alone among [[European Monarchs|European monarchs]] at the time to have such a desire for spice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Paul|date=2015-06-05|title=Health, wellness and the allure of spices in the Middle Ages|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114008058|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|series=Potent Substances: On the Boundaries of Food and Medicine|volume=167|pages=47–53|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2014.10.065|pmid=25450779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spices were all imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] had the monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian [[maritime republics]] and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It has been estimated that around 1,000&amp;nbsp;tons of pepper and 1,000&amp;nbsp;tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adamson, Melitta Weiss|title=Food in Medieval Times|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32147-4|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most exclusive was [[saffron]], used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into obscurity in European cuisine include [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]], a relative of [[cardamom]] which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, [[long pepper]], [[nutmeg|mace]], [[spikenard]], [[galangal]] and [[cubeb]].

===Early Modern Period===
[[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and other valuable products from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main reasons that [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed to [[India]] in 1499.&lt;sup&gt;[[Spice#cite note-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt; When [[Vasco da Gama|Gama]] discovered the pepper market in [[India]], he was able to secure peppers for a much cheaper price than the ones demanded by [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At around the same time, [[Christopher Columbus]] returned from the [[New World]].  He described to [[investor]]s new spices available there.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|&lt;nowiki&gt;citation needed]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]''&lt;/sup&gt;

Another source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th century was the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusans]] from the maritime republic of [[Dubrovnik]] in southern Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, page 453, Gil Marks, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010. {{ISBN|9780470391303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military prowess of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (1453–1515) allowed the Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the island of [[Socotra]] in the mouth of the [[Red Sea]] and, in 1507, [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Since becoming the [[viceroy]] of the [[Indies]], he took [[Goa]] in India in 1510, and [[Malacca]] on the [[Malay peninsula]] in 1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with [[Thailand|Siam]], [[China]], and the [[Maluku Islands]].

With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including [[allspice]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[vanilla]], and [[chocolate]]. This development kept the spice trade, with America as a late comer with its new seasonings, profitable well into the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Contemporary history===
One issue with spices today is dilution, where spices are blended to make inferior quality powdered spices, by including roots, skins and other [[wiktionary:admixture|admixture]] in production of spice powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://regencyspices.hk/spicetrade/2014/09/03/the-dark-truth-behind-powdered-spices-garlic/ | title =The Dark Truth Behind Powdered Spices: Garlic | publisher = Regency Spices for China Business Limited| date =2014-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as [[ginger]], is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example [[turmeric]], and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.

To grind a whole spice, the classic tool is [[mortar and pestle]]. Less labor-intensive tools are more common now:  a [[microplane]] or fine [[grater]] can be used to grind small amounts; a [[blade grinder|coffee grinder]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Other types of coffee grinders, such as a [[burr mill]], can grind spices just as well as coffee beans.&lt;/ref&gt; is useful for larger amounts. A frequently used spice such as black pepper may merit storage in its own hand grinder or [[Burr mill#Manual burr grinders|mill]].

The flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that [[oxidize]] or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus, flavor is maximized by storing a spice whole and grinding when needed. The shelf life of a whole dry spice is roughly two years; of a ground spice roughly six months.&lt;ref name=GE714&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Spice Capades |episodelink=List of Good Eats episodes#Season 7 |series=Good Eats |serieslink=Good Eats |credits=Host: [[Alton Brown]] |network=Food Network |airdate=January 14, 2004 |season=7 |number=14 |ref=GE714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "flavor life" of a ground spice can be much shorter.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Nutmeg]], in particular, suffers from grinding and the flavor will degrade noticeably in a matter of days.&lt;/ref&gt; Ground spices are better stored away from light.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Light contributes to oxidation processes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some flavor elements in spices are soluble in water; many are soluble in oil or fat. As a general rule, the flavors from a spice take time to infuse into the food so spices are added early in preparation. This contrasts to [[herb]]s which are usually added late in preparation.&lt;ref name=GE714/&gt;

===Salmonella contamination===
A study by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of shipments of spices to the United States during fiscal years 2007-2009 showed about 7% of the shipments were contaminated by [[Salmonella]] bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dorena|first=Jane M.|author2=Daria Kleinmeiera |author3=Thomas S. Hammacka |author4=Ann Westerman |title=Prevalence, serotype diversity, and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in imported shipments of spice offered for entry to the United States, FY2007–FY2009|journal=Food Microbiology|date=June 2013|volume=34|issue=2|pages=239–251|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2012.10.002|pmid=23541190|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002012002171|accessdate=August 28, 2013|quote=Shipments of imported spices offered for entry to the United States were sampled during the fiscal years 2007–2009. The mean shipment prevalence for Salmonella was 0.066 (95% CI 0.057–0.076)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most spices are cooked before being served salmonella contamination often has no effect, but some spices, particularly pepper, are often eaten raw and present at table for convenient use. Shipments from Mexico and India, a major producer, were the most frequently contaminated.&lt;ref name=NYT82713&gt;{{cite news |title=Salmonella in Spices Prompts Changes in Farming |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/world/asia/farmers-change-over-spices-link-to-food-ills.html |accessdate=August 28, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 27, 2013|author=Gardiner Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with newly developed radiation sterilization methods, the risk of Salmonella contamination is now lower.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Nutrition==
Because they tend to have strong flavors and are used in small quantities, spices tend to add few calories to food, even though many spices, especially those made from seeds, contain high portions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate by weight. However, when used in larger quantity, spices can also contribute a substantial amount of minerals and other [[micronutrient]]s, including iron, magnesium, calcium, and many others, to the diet. For example, a teaspoon of [[paprika]] contains about 1133 IU of [[Vitamin A]], which is over 20% of the recommended daily allowance specified by the US FDA.&lt;ref name="usda-paprika"&gt;[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/247?qlookup=paprika&amp;fg=&amp;format=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;max=25&amp;new=1 USDA National Nutrient Database: Nutrient data for 02028, Spices, paprika], Retrieved August 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Most herbs and spices have substantial [[antioxidant]] activity, owing primarily to [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds, especially [[flavonoids]], which influence nutrition through many pathways, including affecting the absorption of other nutrients. One study found [[cumin]] and fresh [[ginger]] to be highest in antioxidant activity.&lt;ref name="NinfaliMea2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ninfali |first1=Paolino |last2=Mea |first2=Gloria |last3=Giorgini |first3=Samantha |last4=Rocchi |first4=Marco |last5=Bacchiocca |first5=Mara |title=Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=257–66 |issn=0007-1145 |doi=10.1079/BJN20041327 |pmid=15788119}}&lt;/ref&gt; These antioxidants can also act as natural preservatives, preventing or slowing the spoilage of food, leading to a higher nutritional content in stored food.

==Production==
[[India]] contributes 75% of global spice production.

The '''stalagmometric method''' is one of the most common methods for measuring [[surface tension]]. The principle is to measure the weight of drops of a fluid of interest falling from a capillary [[glass tube]], and thereby calculate the surface tension of the fluid. We can determine the weight of the falling drops by counting them. From it we can determine the surface tension.

== Stalagmometer ==
[[Image:Stalagmometer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A stalagmometer, straight form.]]
A stalagmometer is a device for investigating surface tension using the stalagmometric method. It is also called a stactometer or stalogometer. The device is a capillary glass tube whose middle section is widened. The volume of a drop can be predetermined by the design of the stalagmometer. The lower end of the tube is narrowed to force the fluid to fall out of the tube as a drop.&lt;ref name="name2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="name4"&gt;http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/galleries/instrument/2.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In an experiment, the drops of fluid flow slowly from the tube in a [[vertical direction]]. The drops hanging on the bottom of the tube start to fall when the volume of the drop reaches a maximum value that is dependent on the characteristics of the solution. At this moment, the weight of the drops is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium state]] with the surface tension. Based on Tate’s law:&lt;ref name="name3"&gt;T. Tate, Phil. Mag. 22, 176 (1864).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ mg=2\pi r \sigma&lt;/math&gt;

The drop falls when the weight (mg) is equal to the circumference (2πr) multiplied by the surface tension (σ). The surface tension can be calculated provided the radius of the tube (r) and mass of the fluid droplet (m) are known. Alternatively, since the surface tension is proportional to the weight of the drop, the fluid of interest may be compared to a reference fluid of known surface tension (typically water):

&lt;math&gt;\frac {m_1}{\sigma_1}=\frac {m_2}{\sigma_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the equation, m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represent the mass and surface tension of the reference fluid and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the mass and surface tension of the fluid of interest. If we take water as a reference fluid,

&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\sigma_{H_2O}\times\frac {m}{m_{H_2O}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the surface tension of water is known which is 72 dyne/cm, we can calculate the surface tension of the specific fluid from the equation. The more drops we weigh, the more precisely we can calculate the surface tension from the equation.&lt;ref name="name2" /&gt; The stalagmometer must be kept clean for meaningful readings. There are commercial tubes for stalagmometric method in three sizes: 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 (ml). The 2.5-ml size is suitable for small volumes and low viscosity, that of 3.5 (ml) for relatively viscous fluids, and that of 5.0 (ml) for large volumes and high viscosity. The 2.5-ml size is suitable for most fluids.&lt;ref name="name5"&gt;http://www.wilmad-labglass.com/group/1632&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modified method ==
The stalagmometric method was improved by S. V. Chichkanov and colleagues,&lt;ref name="name1" /&gt; who measured the weight of a fixed number of drops rather than counting the drops. This method for determining the surface tension may be more precise than the original method, especially for fluids whose surface is highly active.

'''Tantalum''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ta''' and [[atomic number]] 73. Previously known as ''tantalium'', its name comes from ''[[Tantalus]]'', a villain from Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]] [[transition metal]] that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the [[refractory metals]] group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for [[platinum]]. Its main use today is in [[tantalum capacitor]]s in [[electronics|electronic]] equipment such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[DVD player]]s, [[video game systems]] and [[Personal computer|computers]].
Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar [[niobium]], occurs in the [[mineral]] groups [[tantalite]], [[columbite]] and [[coltan]] (a mix of columbite and tantalite, though not recognised as a separate mineral species).&lt;ref name="mindat.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org|title=Mindat.org - Mines, Minerals and More|website=www.mindat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Tantalum is a rare metal, comprising {{val|8|e=-9}}% of the universe, making it one-fifteenth as abundant in the universe as gold (which makes up {{val|6|e=-8}}%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptable.com/#Property/Abundance/Universe|title=Dynamic Periodic Table|website=www.ptable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantalum also comprises {{val|1.5|e=-4}}% of the earth's crust, making it more abundant than other metals in [[Period (periodic table)#Period 6|the sixth period]], such as [[rhenium]] (abundance {{val|2.6|e=-7}}%), [[osmium]] (abundance {{val|1.8|e=-7}}%), and [[iridium]] (abundance {{val|4|e=-8}}%), but not as abundant as [[barium]] (abundance {{val|3.4|e=-2}}%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptable.com/#Property/Abundance/Crust|title=Dynamic Periodic Table|website=www.ptable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==History==

The name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological [[Tantalus]], the father of [[Niobe]] in [[Greek mythology]]. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally ''tantalized'' him. (If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Social Sciences|volume = 1|issue = 4|pages = 238–239|date = 2005|first = Sule|last = Aycan|title = Chemistry Education and Mythology|doi = 10.3844/jssp.2005.238.239|url = http://thescipub.com/PDF/jssp.2005.238.239.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anders Ekeberg wrote "This metal I call ''tantalum'' ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=1138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] of [[potassium heptafluorotantalate]] away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, a process that was discovered by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] in 1866. This method has been supplanted by [[solvent extraction]] from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book|title = Extractive Metallurgy of Niobium|first = C.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Tantalum is dark (blue-gray),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Tantalum | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=5o3Lr2Swz8sC&amp;pg=PA204 | isbn = 978-0-86516-573-1 | title = Classical Mythology &amp; More: A Reader Workbook | author1 = Colakis, Marianthe | author2 = Masello, Mary Joan | date = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to [[corrosion]] by [[acid]]s; in fact, at temperatures below 150&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive [[aqua regia]]. It can be dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]] or acidic solutions containing the [[fluoride]] ion and [[sulfur trioxide]], as well as with a solution of [[potassium hydroxide]]. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017&amp;nbsp;°C (boiling point 5458&amp;nbsp;°C) is exceeded among the elements only by [[tungsten]], [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]] for metals, and [[carbon]].

Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is relatively [[Ductility|ductile]] and soft; it has [[body-centered cubic]] structure ([[space group]] ''Im3m'', lattice constant ''a'' = 0.33058&amp;nbsp;nm), [[Knoop hardness test|Knoop hardness]] 200–400 HN and electrical resistivity 15–60 µΩ⋅cm. The beta phase is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is [[tetragonal]] (space group ''P42/mnm'', ''a'' = 1.0194&amp;nbsp;nm, ''c'' = 0.5313&amp;nbsp;nm), Knoop hardness is 1000–1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170–210 µΩ⋅cm. The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750–775&amp;nbsp;°C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase, and the beta phase usually exists as thin films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electronic structure of β-Ta films from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations|date=2019|last1=Magnuson|first1=M.|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=470|page=607–612|last2=Greczynski|first2=G.|last3=Eriksson|first3=F.|last4=Hultman|first4=L.|last5=Hogberg|first5=H.|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.11.096}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained by magnetron

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of tantalum}}

Natural tantalum consists of two [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta (0.012%) and &lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;Ta (99.988%). &lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;Ta is a [[stable isotope]]. &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta (''m'' denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: [[isomeric transition]] to the [[ground state]] of &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;Ta, [[beta decay]] to &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;[[Tungsten|W]], or electron capture to &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;[[Hafnium|Hf]]. However, radioactivity of this [[nuclear isomer]] has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its [[half-life]] of 2.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years has been set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hult|first1=Mikael|last2=Wieslander|first2=J.

It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages= 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

Tantalum has been examined theoretically as a "[[Salted bomb|salting]]" material for [[nuclear weapon]]s ([[cobalt]] is the better-known hypothetical salting material). An external shell of &lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;Ta would be irradiated by the intensive high-energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon. This would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope &lt;sup&gt;182&lt;/sup&gt;Ta, which has a [[half-life]] of 114.4 days and produces [[gamma ray]]s with approximately 1.12 million electron-volts (MeV) of energy apiece, which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the [[nuclear fallout]] from the explosion for several months. Such "salted" weapons have never been built or tested, as far as is publicly known, and certainly never used as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Win|first1=David Tin|last2=Al Masum|first2=Mohammed|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction|date=2003|journal=Assumption University Journal of Technology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=199–219|url=http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2003/apr2003/aujt6-4_article07.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantalum can be used as a target material for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short-lived isotopes including &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Li, &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Rb, and &lt;sup&gt;160&lt;/sup&gt;Yb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mis.triumf.ca/science/planning/yield/target/Ta|title=Tantalum Target  Yields - ISAC Yield Database - TRIUMF : Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics|website=mis.triumf.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical compounds==
Tantalum forms compounds in oxidation states -III to V. Most commonly encountered are oxides of Ta(V), which includes all minerals.  The chemical properties of Ta and Nb are very similar.

===Oxides, nitrides, carbides, sulfides===
[[Tantalum pentoxide]] (Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most important compound from the perspective of applications. Oxides of tantalum in lower oxidation states are numerous, including many [[defect structures]], are lightly studied or poorly characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantalates, compounds containing [TaO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; or [TaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are numerous. [[Lithium tantalate]] (LiTaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) adopts a  perovskite structure. [[Lanthanum]] tantalate (LaTaO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) contains isolated {{chem|TaO|4|3−}} tetrahedra.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|date=2007|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017770-1|edition=102nd|location=|pages=|language=German|author=Holleman, A. F.|author2=Wiberg, E.|author3=Wiberg, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the cases of other [[refractory metals]], the hardest known compounds of tantalum are nitrides and carbides. [[Tantalum carbide]], TaC, like the more commonly used [[tungsten carbide]], is a hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microstructure of amorphous tantalum nitride thin films|first=S.|last=Tsukimoto| author2= Moriyama, M.| author3= Murakami, Masanori| journal=Thin Solid Films|date=1961|volume= 460|issue=1–2|pages=222–226|doi=10.1016/j.tsf.2004.01.073|bibcode = 2004TSF...460..222T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best studied chalcogenide is TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a layered [[semiconductor]], as seen for other [[transition metal dichalcogenide]]s.   A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms [[quasicrystal]]s.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

===Halides===
Tantalum halides span the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3.  Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0&amp;nbsp;°C. The anion [TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is used for its separation from niobium.&lt;ref name="ICE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Staff-Industry Collaborative Report: Tantalum and Niobium|first=Donald J.|last=Soisson|author2=McLafferty, J.

Tantalum is estimated to make up about 1&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&lt;ref name="Emsley"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first= John|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 978-0-19-850340-8|chapter = Tantalum|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]&lt;ref name="Aguly"/&gt; of the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Earth's crust by weight]]. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials: [[tantalite]] (a series consisting of tantalite-(Fe), tantalite-(Mn) and tantalite-(Mg)) [[microlite]] (now a group name), [[wodginite]], [[euxenite]] (actually euxenite-(Y)), and [[polycrase]] (actually polycrase-(Y)).&lt;ref name="mindat.org"/&gt; Tantalite ([[iron|Fe]], [[manganese|Mn]])Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as [[columbite]] ([[iron|Fe]], [[manganese|Mn]]) (Ta, [[niobium|Nb]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or [[niobite]]). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of [[Gravity separation|gravitational separation]] the best method. Other minerals include [[samarskite]] and [[fergusonite]].

The primary mining of tantalum is in [[Australia]], where the largest producer, [[Global Advanced Metals]], formerly known as [[Talison Minerals]], operates two mines in Western Australia, [[Greenbushes, Western Australia|Greenbushes]] in the Southwest and [[Wodgina mine|Wodgina]] in the [[Pilbara]] region.

Some other countries such as [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Mozambique]] mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] as a by-product of the [[tin]] mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) found, but a small percentage of tantalite also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS2006"&gt;{{cite web|publisher = US Geological Survey|last = Papp|first = John F.|title = 2006 Minerals Yearbook Nb &amp; Ta|date = 2006|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/niobium/#pubs|accessdate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World tantalum mine production has undergone an important geographic shift since the start of the 21st century when production was predominantly from Australia and Brazil. Beginning in 2007 and through 2014, the major sources of tantalum production from mines dramatically shifted to the DRC, Rwanda, and some other African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2015/3079/fs20153079.pdf | title = Shift in Global Tantalum Mine Production, 2000–2014 | last1 = Bleiwas | first1 = Donald I. | last2 =Papp| first2 = John F.| last3 =Yager | first3 = Thomas R. | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future sources of supply of tantalum, in order of estimated size, are being explored in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], [[Greenland]], [[China]], [[Mozambique]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[Finland]], and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Mining Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Mining Journal|author = M.

It is estimated that there are less than 50 years left of tantalum resources, based on extraction at current rates, demonstrating the need for increased [[recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-much-is-left |title=How much is left?|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status as a conflict resource==
{{See also|Coltan mining and ethics|Coltan#Ethics of mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo}}
Tantalum is considered a [[conflict resource]]. [[Coltan]], the industrial name for a [[columbite]]–[[tantalite]] mineral from which niobium and tantalum are extracted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanb.org/coltan Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center: Coltan] Retrieved 2008-01-27&lt;/ref&gt; can also be found in [[Central Africa]], which is why tantalum is being linked to [[Second Congo War|warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]). According to an October 23, 2003 [[United Nations]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = S/2003/1027|date = 2003-10-26|url = https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/2003/1027|accessdate =2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = International Rescue Committee|title = Special Report: Congo|url = http://www.rescue.org/special-reports/special-report-congo-y|accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since [[World War II]].

The [[United States Geological Survey]] reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.&lt;ref name="USGS2006"/&gt;

The stated aim of the ''Solutions for Hope Tantalum Project'' is to "source conflict-free tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Solutions for Hope' Tantalum Project Offers Solutions and Brings Hope to the People of the DRC|url=http://solutions-network.org/site-sfhtantalum/|website=Solutions Network|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production and fabrication ==
[[File:Tantalum world production.svg|thumb|upright=1|Time trend of tantalum production until 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140 U.S. Geological Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604121254/http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/ |date=2013-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite. First, the mineral is [[crusher|crushed]] and concentrated by [[gravity separation]]. This is generally carried out near the [[mining|mine]] site.

=== Refining ===
The refining of tantalum from its ores is one of the more demanding separation processes in industrial metallurgy.  The chief problem is that tantalum ores contain significant amounts of [[niobium]], which has chemical properties almost identical to those of Ta. A large number of procedures have been developed to address this challenge.

In modern times, the separation is achieved by [[hydrometallurgy]].&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solvent extraction technology for the separation and purification of niobium and tantalum: A review|author1=Zhaowu Zhu|author2=Chu Yong Cheng|journal=Hydrometallurgy|volume=107|year=2011|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.hydromet.2010.12.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraction begins with [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] the ore with [[hydrofluoric acid]] together with [[sulfuric acid]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. This step allows the tantalum and niobium to be separated from the various non-metallic impurities in the rock.  Although Ta occurs as various minerals, it is conveniently represented as the pentoxide, since most oxides of tantalum(V) behave similarly under these conditions.  A simplified equation for its extraction is thus:

: Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 14 HF   →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Completely analogous reactions occur for the niobium component, but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under the conditions of the extraction.
: Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 HF   →   2 H[NbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
These equations are simplified: it is suspected that bisulfate (HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and chloride compete as ligands for the Nb(V) and Ta(V) ions, when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used, respectively.&lt;ref name=Chang/&gt;  The tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then removed from the [[aqueous]] solution by [[Liquid–liquid extraction|liquid-liquid extraction]] into [[organic solvents]], such as [[cyclohexanone]], [[octanol]], and [[methyl isobutyl ketone]]. This simple procedure allows the removal of most metal-containing impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium), which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of their [[fluoride]]s and other complexes.

Separation of the tantalum ''from'' niobium is then achieved by lowering the [[ionic strength]] of the acid mixture, which causes the niobium to dissolve in the aqueous phase.  It is proposed that [[oxyfluoride]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] is formed under these conditions.  Subsequent to removal of the niobium, the solution of purified H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] is neutralised with aqueous [[ammonia]] to precipitate hydrated tantalum oxide as a solid, which can be [[calcination|calcined]] to [[tantalum pentoxide]] (Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agulyanski|first=Anatoly|title=Chemistry of Tantalum and Niobium Fluoride Compounds|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080529028|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of hydrolysis, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] can be treated with [[potassium fluoride]] to produce [[potassium heptafluorotantalate]]:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]  + 2 KF   →   K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] + 2 HF
Unlike H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;], the potassium salt is readily crystallized and handled as a solid.

K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] can be converted to metallic tantalum by [[reduction-oxidation|reduction]] with [[sodium]], at approximately 800&amp;nbsp;°C in [[molten salt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okabe|first=Toru H.|author2=Sadoway, Donald R. |title=Metallothermic reduction as an electronically mediated reaction|journal=Journal of Materials Research|date=1998|volume=13|issue=12|pages=3372–3377|doi=10.1557/JMR.1998.0459|bibcode = 1998JMatR..13.3372O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]  +  5 Na   →   Ta + 5 NaF + 2 KF

In an older method, called the [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|Marignac]] process, the mixture of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] was converted to a ''mixture'' of  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;], which was then be separated by [[Fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]], exploiting their different water solubilities.

=== Electrolysis ===
{{See also|FFC Cambridge process}}

Electrolysis using a modified version of the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form, tantalum electrolysis operates on non-liquid powdered oxides. The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current. The cathode uses powdered metal oxide. The anode is made of carbon. The molten salt at {{convert|1000|C|F}} is the electrolyte. The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3–4% of annual global demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21571847-exotic-useful-metals-such-tantalum-and-titanium-are-about-become-cheap |title=Manufacturing metals: A tantalising prospect |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-02-16 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabrication and metalworking ===

All [[welding]] of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of [[argon]] or [[helium]] in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not [[solderable]]. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely [[ductile]] and can be readily formed as metal sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/aboutthecodes/484/nfpa484-2002.pdf|title = NFPA 484 – Standard for Combustible Metals, Metal Powders, and Metal Dusts – 2002 Edition|date = 2002-08-13|access-date = 2016-02-12|website = National Fire Protection Association|publisher = NFPA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Electronics===
[[File:Tantal-Perle-Wiki-07-02-25-P1040364b.jpg|thumb|upright|Tantalum electrolytic capacitor]]
The major use for tantalum, as the metal powder, is in the production of electronic components, mainly [[capacitor]]s and some high-power [[resistor]]s. [[tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective [[oxide]] surface layer, using tantalum powder, pressed into a pellet shape, as one "plate" of the capacitor, the oxide as the [[dielectric]], and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other "plate". Because the [[Relative static permittivity|dielectric layer]] can be very thin (thinner than the similar layer in, for instance, an aluminium electrolytic capacitor), a high [[capacitance]] can be achieved in a small volume. Because of the size and weight advantages, tantalum capacitors are attractive for [[portable telephone]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[automotive electronics]] and [[cameras]].&lt;ref name="USGSCR08"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/niobium/mcs-2008-tanta.pdf|title = Commodity Report 2008: Tantalum|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-10-24|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alloys===
Tantalum is also used to produce a variety of [[alloy]]s that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of [[superalloy]]s for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, [[nuclear reactor]]s, missile parts, heat exchangers, tanks, and vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.admatinc.com/tantalum/sheetplate/|title=Tantalum Products: Tantalum Sheet &amp; Plate {{!}} Admat Inc|work=Admat Inc.|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSCR08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = New applications for tantalum and tantalum alloys|journal = JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society|volume = 52|issue = 3|date = 2000|doi = 10.1007/s11837-000-0100-6|page=40|first = R. W.|last = Buckman Jr.|bibcode = 2000JOM....52c..40B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as [[aluminium]]. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = R.|last = Cohen|date = 2006|title = Applications of porous tantalum in total hip arthroplasty|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|volume = 14|pmid=17077337|last2 = Della Valle|first2 = C. J.|last3 = Jacobs|first3 = J. J.|issue = 12|pages = 646–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantalum is inert against most acids except [[hydrofluoric acid]] and hot [[sulfuric acid]], and hot [[alkaline]] solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property makes it a useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum.&lt;ref name="Balke"&gt;{{cite journal|page= 1166|journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry|volume = 20|issue = 10|title = Columbium and Tantalum|first = Clarence W.|last = Balke|doi=10.1021/ie50310a022|date= 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantalum was extensively used in the production of [[ultra high frequency]] [[Vacuum tube|electron tubes]] for radio transmitters. Tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helped to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes when used for internal parts such as grids and plates.&lt;ref name="ICE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balke"/&gt;

===Other uses===
[[File:Tantalio.png|thumb|320x320px|[[Bi-metallic coin|Bimetallic]] coins minted by the Bank of [[Kazakhstan]] with silver ring and tantalum center.]]

The high melting point and oxidation resistance lead to the use of the metal in the production of [[vacuum furnace]] parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as [[thermowell]]s, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, [[shaped charge]] and [[explosively formed penetrator]] liners have been constructed from tantalum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Microstructure of high-strain, high-strain-rate deformed tantalum|first = Sia|last = Nemat-Nasser|author2 = Isaacs, Jon B.|author3 = Liu, Mingqi|journal = Acta Materialia|volume = 46|page= 1307|date = 1998|doi = 10.1016/S1359-6454(97)00746-5|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0734-743X(01)00135-X|title = The penetration resistance of a titanium alloy against jets from tantalum shaped charge liners|date = 2001|last1 = Walters|first1 = William|author2 = Cooch, William|author3 = Burkins, Matthew|journal = International Journal of Impact Engineering|volume = 26|page= 823|last4 = Burkins|first4 = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-471-64952-6|author = Russell, Alan M.|author2 = Lee, Kok Loong| date = 2005|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|location = Hoboken, NJ|title = Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals|url = https://books.google.com/?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PP128#PPA218|page = 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--http://www.meyersgroup.ucsd.edu/papers/journals/Meyers 176.pdf LE Murr, S Pappu, C Kennedy, CS Niou, M Meyers – Tantalum, 1996 http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/274177-TGUy10/webviewable/274177.pdf--&gt; It is also occasionally used in precious [[watch]]es e.g. from [[Audemars Piguet]], [[F.P.

== Environmental issues ==
Tantalum receives far less attention in the environmental field than it does in other geosciences. Upper Crust Concentrations (UCC) and the Nb/Ta ratio in the upper crust and in minerals are available because these measurements are useful as a geochemical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=TH.|date=1995|title=Significance of Nb/Ta as an indicator of geochemical processes in the crust-mantle system|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=120|issue=3–4|pages=347–359|bibcode=1995ChGeo.120..347G|doi=10.1016/0009-2541(94)00145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest values for UCC and the Nb/Ta(w/w) ratio in the upper crust stand at 0.92 ppm and 12.7 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Z.|last2=Gao|first2=S.|date=2008|title=Upper crustal abundances of trace elements: a revision and update|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=253|issue=3–4|pages=205|bibcode=2008ChGeo.253..205H|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little data is available on tantalum concentrations in the different environmental compartments, especially in natural waters where reliable estimates of ‘dissolved’ tantalum concentrations in seawater and freshwaters have not even been produced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filella|first=M.|date=2017|title=Tantalum in the environment|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=173|pages=122–140|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some values on dissolved concentrations in oceans have been published, but they are contradictory. Values in freshwaters fare little better, but, in all cases, they are probably below 1&amp;nbsp;ng L&lt;sup&gt;−1,&lt;/sup&gt;since ‘dissolved’ concentrations in natural waters are well below most current analytical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filella|first=M.|last2=Rodushkin|first2=I.|date=2018|title=A concise guide for the determination of less-studied technology-critical elements (Nb, Ta, Ga, In, Ge, Te) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in environmental samples|journal=Spectrochimica Acta Part B|volume=141|pages=80–84|doi=10.1016/j.sab.2018.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis requires pre-concentration procedures that, for the moment, do not give consistent results. And in any case, tantalum appears to be present in natural waters mostly as particulate matter rather than dissolved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Values for concentrations in soils, bed sediments and atmospheric aerosols are easier to come by.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Values in soils are close to 1 ppm and thus to UCC values. This indicates detrital origin. For atmospheric aerosols the values available are scattered and limited. When tantalum enrichment is observed, it is probably due to loss of more water-soluble elements in aerosols in the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlastelic|first=I.|last2=Suchorski|first2=K.|last3=Sellegri|first3=K.|last4=Colomb|first4=A.|last5=Nauret|first5=F.|last6=Bouvier|first6=L.|last7=Piro|first7=J-L.|date=2015|title=The high field strength element budget of atmospheric aerosols (puy de Dôme, France)|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=167|pages=253–268|jstor=|bibcode=2015GeCoA.167..253V|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2015.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory. The metal is highly [[biocompatible]]&lt;ref name="Gerald L.

People can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''''The Petroleum Dictionary''''' is a dictionary covering terms used in the American oil industry. It was compiled by Lalia Phipps Boone and was first published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=Donoghue/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

==Overview==
''The Petroleum Dictionary'' contains short definitions for around 6,000 terms used in the oil industry in America, with a particular focus on [[slang]]. It is intended as a record of the history of these colloquialisms, rather than a reference work for individuals in the petroleum industry.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in the ''[[Journal of Geology]]'', G. Frederick Shepherd from the [[General American Oil Company of Texas]] commented on the incomplete nature of the dictionary, describing it as "an excellent start...but not the end point". As an example, he highlighted the fact that it contains only 68 of the 573 abbreviations listed by Rinehart Oil News Company in a guide to language used in oil reports. He attributed these omissions partly to the fact that the work underwent more detailed reviewing by language specialists rather than industry technicians.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; Shepherd, however, did praise Boone for her detailed and interesting research into the history of words, and her inclusion of a number of [[euphemisms]], which made the dictionary "remarkable for its freshness and occasional spice".&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

Maurice Merrill, comparing the Dictionary with a similar work entitled ''Manual of Oil and Gas Terms'', noted the absence of legal terms in Boone's work, suggesting that for individuals within the oil industry, the ''Manual of Oil and Gas Terms'' was a preferable reference work.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

In the ''[[Southwestern Historical Quarterly]]'', reviewer David Donoghue highlighted several "errors of the inexcusable variety", and suggested that the dictionary had "little to offer" to the "oil fielder who is seriously interested in what makes the business go".&lt;ref name=Donoghue/&gt;

'''Thiophosphates''' (or '''phosphorothioates''', '''PS''') are [[chemical compound]]s and anions with the general [[chemical formula]] {{chem|PS|4−''x''|O|''x''|3−}} (''x'' = 0, 1, 2, or 3) and related derivatives where organic groups are attached to one or more O or S.  Thiophosphates feature tetrahedral phosphorus(V) centers.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Organic==
{{main article|Organothiophosphate}}
Organothiophosphates are a subclass of [[organophosphorus compounds]] that are structurally related to the inorganic thiophosphates. Common members have formulas of the type (RO)&lt;sub&gt;3−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;PS and related compounds where RO is replaced by RS.  Many of these compounds are used as [[insecticides]], some have medical applications, and some have been used as [[oil additive]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;J. Svara, N. Weferling, T. Hofmann "Phosphorus Compounds, Organic" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2006. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a19_545.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are modified oligonucleotides where one of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. They are the basis of [[antisense therapy]], e.g., the drugs [[fomivirsen]] (Vitravene), [[oblimersen]], [[alicaforsen]], and [[mipomersen]] (Kynamro).&lt;ref&gt;Kurreck, J., "Antisense technologies. Improvement through novel chemical modifications", European Journal of Biochemistry 2003, 270, 1628-1644.{{DOI|10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03555.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inorganic==
The simplest thiophosphates have the formula [PS&lt;sub&gt;4−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.  These trianions are only observed at very high pH, instead they exist in protonated form with the formula  [H&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(3−''n'')−&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Monothiophosphate===
[[File:Thiophosphate-ion-3D-balls.png|thumb|155px|Ball-and-stick model of the hypothetical monothiophosphate trianion.]]

Monothiophosphate is the anion [PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]].  A common salt is [[sodium monothiophosphate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S). Monothiophosphate is used in research as an analogue of phosphate in [[biochemistry]]. Monothiophosphate esters are biochemical [[reagent]]s used in the study of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Dithiophosphates===
Dithiophosphate has the formula [PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]]. [[Sodium dithiophosphate]], which is colorless, is the major product from the reaction of [[phosphorus pentasulfide]] with [[NaOH]]:&lt;ref&gt;R. Klement "Phosphorus" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1., p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;
:P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6 NaOH   →   2 Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

'''Dithiophosphoric acid''' is obtained by treatment of barium dithiophosphate with [[sulfuric acid]]:
:Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   3 BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Both Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and especially H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are prone toward hydrolysis to their monothio derivatives.

===Tri- and tetrathiophosphates===
Trithiophosphate is the anion [POS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.  Tetrathiophosphate is the anion [PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.

===P&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;: binary thiophosphates and polyphosphates===
There are a number of these anions known. There has been interest in compounds containing these anions due to their potential application as [[fast ion conductor]]s for use in solid state batteries. The binary thiophosphates do not exhibit the extensive diversity of the analogous P-O anions but contain similar structural features, for example P is 4 coordinate, P−S−P links form and there are P−P bonds. One difference is that ions may include polysulfide fragments of 2 or more S atoms whereas in the P−O anions there is only the  reactive −O−O−, peroxo, unit. 
*{{chem|PS|3|−}} is the analogue of the [[nitrate]] ion, {{chem|NO|3|−}} (there is no {{chem|PO|3|−}} analogue); it was isolated as the tetraphenylarsonium salt&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=509–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{chem|PS|4|3−}} is the sulfur analogue of {{chem|PO|4|3−}}, and like {{chem|PO|4|3−}} is tetrahedral.
*{{chem|P|2|S|7|4−}} the pyrothiophosphate ion consisting of two corner sharing PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, analogous to the [[pyrophosphate]]s.&lt;ref name = "Corbridge6th"&gt;Phosphorus: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Technology, Sixth Edition, 2013,  D.E.C. Corbridge, CRC Pres, Taylor Francis Group, {{ISBN|978-1-4398-4088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{chem|P|2|S|10|4−}} An ion which can be visualised either as two PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra joined by a [[disulfide]] link or a pyrothiophosphate where the bridging −S− is replaced by −S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;−.&lt;ref name="AitkenCanlas2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aitken|first1=Jennifer A.|last2=Canlas|first2=Christian|last3=Weliky|first3=David P.|last4=Kanatzidis|first4=Mercouri G.|title=[P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;: A Novel Polythiophosphate Anion Containing a Tetrasulfide Fragment|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=40|issue=25|year=2001|pages=6496–6498|issn=0020-1669|doi=10.1021/ic010664p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is therefore similar to the isoelectronic [[aluminium chloride|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] dimer. The oxygen analogue, dimetaphosphate {{chem|P|2|O|6|2−}}, in contrast, is not known, the metaphosphates favour polymeric structures of chains or rings.&lt;ref name = "Corbridge6th"/&gt;
*{{chem|P|2|S|8|2−}} and {{chem|P|2|S|10|2−}} are related to {{chem|P|2|S|6|2−}} but their two bridging −S− atoms are replaced by −S−S− in {{chem|P|2|S|8|2−}} and by an −S−S−S− bridge in {{chem|P|2|S|10|2−}}.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg|pages=734-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-axis acceleration switch was designed to obtain acceleration data more effectively than a conventional [[accelerometer]] in order to more accurately characterize the forces and shocks responsible for TBI.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While miniature accelerometers require a constant power draw, the three-axis acceleration switch only draws current when it senses an acceleration event, using up less energy and allowing the use of smaller batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The three-axis acceleration switch has shown to exhibit an expected battery lifetime that is about 100 times better than that of a digital accelerometer. In return, however, the acceleration switch has a lower resolution than that of a digital or analog accelerometer.

One potential application of the three-axis acceleration switch is in studying the head impacts of players in high-risk contact sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the size of conventional accelerometers, measuring the acceleration requires the device to be implemented inside the player’s helmet, which is designed to mitigate the collision forces and thus may not accurately reflect the true level of injury potential. In contrast, the miniature nature of the acceleration switch makes it easier for the switch to be affixed directly onto the participant’s head.

In [[chemistry]], the '''trigonal prismatic molecular geometry''' describes the shape of compounds where six atoms, groups of atoms, or [[ligand]]s are arranged around a central atom, defining the vertices of a [[triangular prism]].

==Examples==
[[Hexamethyltungsten]] (W(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) was the first example of a molecular trigonal prismatic complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other [[transition metal]]s have trigonal prismatic hexamethyl complexes, including both neutral molecules such as Mo(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Re(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and ions such as {{chem|Ta(CH|3|)|6|−}} and {{chem|Zr(CH|3|)|6|2−}}.&lt;ref name=HS545&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex Mo(S−CH=CH−S)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is also trigonal prismatic, with each [[1,2-Ethenedithiol|S−CH=CH−S]] group acting as a [[bidentate]] ligand with two sulfur atoms binding the metal atom.&lt;ref name=HS545/&gt; Here the coordination geometry of the six sulfurs around the molybdenum is similar to that in the extended structure of [[molybdenum disulfide]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8336">A '''venturi flume''' is a critical-flow open [[flume]] with a constricted flow which causes a drop in the hydraulic grade line, creating a critical depth.&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/venturi-flume|title=Venturi flume: Definition from Answers.com|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt1302.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212103500/http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt1302.html |archive-date=2008-12-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in [[flow measurement]] of very large flow rates, usually given in millions of cubic units. A venturi meter would normally measure in millimetres, whereas a venturi flume measures in metres.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|title=Instrumentation Fundamentals for Process Control|author=de Sa, D.O.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781560329015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUc6kZEe7s4C|page=9|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement of [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] with venturi flumes requires two measurements, one upstream and one at the throat (narrowest cross-section), if the flow passes in a subcritical state through the flume.&lt;ref name="iitm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/IIT-MADRAS/Hydraulics/pdfs/Unit13/13_1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015001907/http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/IIT-MADRAS/Hydraulics/pdfs/Unit13/13_1.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 October 2009|date=17 September 2006|title=Hyraulics – Measuring Flumes|author=Prof. B.S. Thandaveswara|publisher=Indian Institute of Technology Madras|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the flumes are designed so as to pass the flow from sub critical to supercritical state while passing through the flume, a single measurement at the throat (which in this case becomes a critical section) is sufficient for computation of discharge. To ensure the occurrence of critical depth at the throat, the flumes are usually designed in such way as to form a [[hydraulic jump]] on the downstream side of the structure. These flumes are called 'standing wave flumes'

==Comparison with weirs==
Venturi flumes have two advantages over [[weir]]s where the critical depth is created by a vertical constriction. First, the [[hydraulic head]] loss is smaller in flumes than in weirs. Second, there is no dead zone in flumes where [[sediment]] and [[debris]] can accumulate; such a dead zone exists upstream of the weirs.

==Parshall flume==

{{mergeto|Parshall flume|discuss=Talk:Parshall flume#Merger proposal|date=June 2018}}
[[image:Parshall Flume.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a Parshall flume, showing free-flow and submerged flow operating regimes]]

A modified version of the Venturi flume is the Parshall flume. Named after it creator, Dr. [[Ralph L. Parshall]] of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, the Parshall flume is a fixed [[hydraulic structure]] used in measuring [[volumetric flow rate]] in surface water, wastewater treatment plant, and industrial discharge applications. The Parshall flume accelerates flow through a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and a drop in the floor at the flume throat. Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow.

The free-flow discharge can be summarized as

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H^n&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* ''C'' is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
* ''H'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' varies with flume size (e.g. 1.55 for a 1-inch flume)

When the downstream depth is high enough that the transition to subcritical flow advances upstream into the throat and the hydraulic jump disappears, the flume is operating in a "submerged flow" regime, and the discharge is instead given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H^n - Q_E&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;Q_E&lt;/math&gt; is the "submergence correction", and is found using pre-determined tables for a particular flume geometry.

The Parshall flume is an empirically calibrated device, so interpolation between listed sizes is not an accurate way to make intermediate size flumes. The flumes are not scale models of each other. 22 standard sizes of Parshall flumes have been developed, covering flow ranges from 0.005 cfs [0.1416&amp;nbsp;l/s] to 3,280 cfs [92,890&amp;nbsp;l/s].&lt;ref name="Parshall Flume Sizes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openchannelflow.com/products/flumes/parshall |title=Parshall Flumes for Flow Measurement |publisher=openchannelflow.com|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Submergence transitions for Parshall flumes range from 50% (1”-3” sizes) to 80% (10’-50’ sizes),&lt;ref name="Submergence Transition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openchannelflow.com/products/flumes/parshall/flow-characteristics |title=Flow Characteristics of Parshall Flumes|publisher=openchannelflow.com|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; beyond which point level measurements must be taken at both the primary and secondary points of measurement and a submergence correction must be applied to the flow equations.

Under laboratory conditions Parshall flumes can be expected to exhibit accuracies to within +/-2%, although field conditions make accuracies better than 5% doubtful.

Not all Parshall flumes have the energy-recovering divergence section. These flumes, called "Montana flumes", or "short-section Parshall flumes", must instead have a free-spilling discharge at all expected flow rates, which increases the drop along the whole flume system. The measurement calculations are the same as for free-flow in a standard Parshall flume, but submerged flow cannot be adjusted for.&lt;ref name="Montana Flumes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openchannelflow.com/blog/article/montana-flume-whats-in-a-name |title=Montana Flumes - What are they? |publisher=openchannelflow.com|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the Venturi and Parshall flume include: reduction of the inlet converging angle, lengthening the throat section, reduction of the discharge divergence angle, and introducing a drop through the throat (and subsequent partial recovery in the discharge section).&lt;ref name="The Improved Venturi Flume"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitool.library.colostate.edu///exlibris/dtl/d3_1/apache_media/L2V4bGlicmlzL2R0bC9kM18xL2FwYWNoZV9tZWRpYS8xODU0MA==.pdf|title=The Improved Venturi Flume|publisher=digitool.library.colostate.edu|accessdate=2015-04-21}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===
* Parshall flumes require a drop in elevation through the flume. To accommodate the drop in an existing channel either the flume must be raised above the channel floor (raising the upstream water level) or the downstream channel must be modified.
* As with [[weirs]], flumes can also have an effect on local fauna. Some species or certain life stages of the same species may be blocked by flumes due to relatively slow swim speeds or behavioral characteristics.
* In earthen channels, upstream bypass and downstream scour may occur.
* Parshall flumes below 3-inches in size should not be used on unscreened sanitary flows.

===Standards===
*ASTM D1941 – 91(2013) Standard Test Method for Open Channel Flow Measurement of Water with the Parshall Flume
*ISO 9826:1992 Measurement of Liquid Flow in Open Channels – Parshall and SANIIRI Flumes

A venturi flume is similar to the Parshall flume, without the contoured base, but the cross section is usually rectangular, the inlet shorter, and there is a general taper on the outlet similar to the [[Venturi effect|venturi meter]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;  Because of their size, it is usual for these meters to be open to their surroundings just like a river or stream and therefore this type of measurement is referred to as open-channel flow measurement. Parshall flumes are much more efficient than standard flumes and generate a standard wave to effect a measurement.

A good example can be found via google earth: 50°58'41.34"N, 5°51'36.81"E, eye altitude 200&amp;nbsp;m. This is in the 'Geleenbeek', near Geleen in the Netherlands.

The '''W and Z&amp;nbsp;bosons''' are together known as the '''weak''' or more generally as the '''[[Vector boson|intermediate vector boson]]s.''' These [[elementary particle]]s [[force carrier|mediate]] the [[weak interaction]]; the respective symbols are {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}}.  The W bosons have either a positive or negative [[electric charge]] of 1 [[elementary charge]] and are each other's [[antiparticle]]s.  The Z boson is electrically [[neutral particle|neutral]] and [[Real neutral particle|is its own antiparticle]].  The three particles have a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of 1.  The W bosons have a magnetic moment, but the Z has none.  All three of these particles are very short-lived, with a [[half-life]] of about {{val|3|e=-25|u=s}}.  Their experimental discovery was a triumph for what is now known as the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]].

The W&amp;nbsp;bosons are named after the '''''w'''''eak force. The [[physicist]] [[Steven Weinberg]] named the additional particle the "Z&amp;nbsp;particle",&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;[[Steven Weinberg]] [http://.cumt.edu.cn/jpkc/dxwl/zl/zl1/Physical%20Review%20Classics/particle/066.pdf A Model of Leptons], Phys. Rev. Lett. 19, 1264–1266 (1967) – the electroweak unification paper.&lt;/ref&gt; and later gave the explanation that it was the last additional particle needed by the model. The W&amp;nbsp;bosons had already been named, and the Z bosons have '''''z'''''ero electric charge.&lt;ref name="SW1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg |first=Steven|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: the search for the fundamental laws of nature|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Press|page=94|isbn=0-09-922391-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two '''W&amp;nbsp;bosons''' are verified mediators of [[neutrino]] absorption and emission.  During these processes, the W boson charge induces electron or positron emission or absorption, thus causing [[nuclear transmutation]].  The Z&amp;nbsp;boson is not involved in the absorption or emission of electrons and positrons.

The '''Z&amp;nbsp;boson''' mediates the transfer of momentum, spin and energy when neutrinos scatter ''[[Elastic scattering|elastically]]'' from matter (a process which conserves charge). Such behavior is almost as common as inelastic neutrino interactions and may be observed in [[bubble chamber]]s upon irradiation with neutrino beams.  Whenever an electron is observed as a new free particle suddenly moving with kinetic energy, it is inferred to be a result of a neutrino interacting directly with the electron, since this behavior happens more often when the neutrino beam is present.  In this process, the neutrino simply strikes the electron and then scatters away from it, transferring some of the neutrino's momentum to the electron. 

Because neutrinos are neither affected by the [[strong force]] nor the [[electromagnetic force]], and because the [[gravitational force]] between subatomic particles is negligible, such an interaction can only happen via the weak force.  Since such an electron is not created from a nucleon, and is unchanged except for the new force impulse imparted by the neutrino, this weak force interaction between the neutrino and the electron must be mediated by an electromagnetically neutral, weak-force boson particle. Thus, this interaction requires a Z&amp;nbsp;boson.

== Basic properties ==
These bosons are among the heavyweights of the elementary particles. With [[mass]]es of {{val|80.4|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|91.2|u=GeV/c2}}, respectively, the W and Z bosons are almost 80&amp;nbsp;times as massive as the [[proton]] – heavier, even, than entire [[iron]] [[atom]]s. Their high masses limit the range of the weak interaction. By way of contrast, the [[photon]] is the [[force carrier]] of the electromagnetic force and has zero mass, consistent with the infinite range of [[electromagnetism]]; the hypothetical [[graviton]] is also expected to have zero mass. (Although [[gluon]]s are also presumed to have zero mass, the range of the [[color force]] is limited for different reasons; ''see [[color confinement]]''.)

All three bosons have [[spin (physics)|particle spin]] ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The emission of a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} or {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson either raises or lowers the electric charge of the emitting particle by one unit, and also alters the spin by one unit. At the same time, the emission or absorption of a W boson can change the type of the particle – for example changing a [[strange quark]] into an [[up quark]]. The neutral Z boson cannot change the electric charge of any particle, nor can it change any other of the so-called "[[charge (physics)|charges]]" (such as [[strangeness]], [[baryon number]], [[charm (quantum number)|charm]], etc.). The emission or absorption of a Z boson can only change the spin, momentum, and energy of the other particle. (See also ''[[weak neutral current]]''.)

== Weak nuclear force ==
[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Feynman diagram]] for beta decay of a [[neutron]] into a [[proton]], [[electron]], and [[electron antineutrino]] via an intermediate heavy [[W boson]] ]]
The W and Z bosons are carrier particles that mediate the weak nuclear force, much as the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force.

===W bosons===
The W bosons are best known for their role in [[nuclear decay]]. Consider, for example, the [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]].

: {{nuclide|link=yes|Cobalt|60}} &amp;rarr; {{nuclide|link=yes|Nickel|60}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron antineutrino}}

This reaction does not involve the whole cobalt-60 [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], but affects only one of its 33 neutrons. The neutron is converted into a proton while also emitting an electron (called a [[beta particle]] in this context) and an electron antineutrino:

: {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Neutron0}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron antineutrino}}

Again, the neutron is not an elementary particle but a composite of an [[up quark]] and two [[down quark]]s (udd). It is in fact one of the down quarks that interacts in beta decay, turning into an up quark to form a proton (uud). At the most fundamental level, then, the weak force changes the [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]] of a single quark:

: {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} + {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}

which is immediately followed by decay of the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} itself:

: {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron antineutrino}}

===Z boson===
{{anchor|Z_boson}}
The Z boson is its own antiparticle.  Thus, all of its [[flavour quantum numbers]] and [[charge (physics)|charges]] are zero. The exchange of a Z boson between particles, called a [[neutral current]] interaction, therefore leaves the interacting particles unaffected, except for a transfer of [[momentum]]. {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} boson interactions involving [[neutrino]]s have distinctive signatures: They provide the only known mechanism for [[elastic scattering]] of neutrinos in matter; neutrinos are almost as likely to scatter elastically (via Z boson exchange) as inelastically (via W boson exchange). The first prediction of Z bosons was made by Brazilian physicist [[José Leite Lopes]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lopes |first=J. Leite |date=September 1999 |title=Forty years of the first attempt at the electroweak unification and of the prediction of the weak neutral boson |journal=Brazilian Journal of Physics |issn=0103-9733 |doi=10.1590/S0103-97331999000300024 |volume=29 |issue=3 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-97331999000300024|bibcode=1999BrJPh..29..574L }}&lt;/ref&gt; by devising an equation which showed the analogy of the weak nuclear interactions with electromagnetism. Steve Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam later used these results to develop the electroweak unification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1979|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973. Weak neutral currents via Z boson exchange were confirmed shortly thereafter (also in 1973), in a neutrino experiment in the [[Gargamelle]] [[bubble chamber]] at [[CERN]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The discovery of the weak neutral currents|publisher=CERN Courier|url=http://www.cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29168/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicting the W and Z ==

Following the spectacular success of [[quantum electrodynamics]] in the 1950s, attempts were undertaken to formulate a similar theory of the weak nuclear force. This culminated around 1968 in a unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]], and [[Abdus Salam]], for which they shared the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;[http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1979/ Nobel Prize in Physics for 1979] (see also [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] on Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[electroweak theory]] postulated not only the W bosons necessary to explain beta decay, but also a new Z boson that had never been observed.

The fact that the W and Z bosons have mass while photons are massless was a major obstacle in developing electroweak theory. These particles are accurately described by an SU(2) [[gauge theory]], but the bosons in a gauge theory must be massless. As a case in point, the [[photon]] is massless because electromagnetism is described by a U(1) gauge theory.  Some mechanism is required to break the SU(2) symmetry, giving mass to the W and Z in the process. One explanation, the [[Higgs mechanism]], was forwarded by the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]]. It predicts the existence of yet another new particle; the [[Higgs boson]].  Of the four components of a [[Goldstone boson]] created by the Higgs field, three are "eaten" by the W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; bosons to form their longitudinal components, and the remainder appears as the spin 0 Higgs boson.

The combination of the SU(2) gauge theory of the weak interaction, the electromagnetic interaction, and the Higgs mechanism is known as the [[Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model]]. Today it is widely accepted as one of the pillars of the Standard Model of particle physics, particularly given the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson by the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] and [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] experiments.

The model predicts that W and Z bosons have the following masses:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M_W &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}vg \\ 
M_Z &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} v\sqrt{g^2+{g'}^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where g is the SU(2) gauge coupling, g' is U(1) gauge coupling, and v is the Higgs [[vacuum expectation value]].

== Discovery ==
[[File:CERN-20060225-24.jpg|thumb|The [[Gargamelle]] [[bubble chamber]], now exhibited at CERN]]
Unlike beta decay, the observation of neutral current interactions that involve particles {{em|other than neutrinos}} requires huge investments in [[particle accelerator]]s and [[detector]]s, such as are available in only a few [[high-energy physics]] laboratories in the world (and then only after 1983). This is because Z-bosons behave in somewhat the same manner as photons, but do not become important until the energy of the interaction is comparable with the relatively huge mass of the Z boson.

The discovery of the W and Z bosons was considered a major success for CERN. First, in 1973, came the observation of neutral current interactions as predicted by electroweak theory. The huge Gargamelle bubble chamber photographed the tracks of a few electrons suddenly starting to move, seemingly of their own accord. This is interpreted as a neutrino interacting with the electron by the exchange of an unseen Z boson. The neutrino is otherwise undetectable, so the only observable effect is the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction.

The discovery of the W and Z bosons themselves had to wait for the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]], where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by [[Carlo Rubbia]] and [[Simon van der Meer]]. The actual experiments were called [[UA1 experiment|UA1]] (led by Rubbia) and [[UA2 experiment|UA2]] (led by [[Pierre Darriulat]]),&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;[http://library.web.cern.ch/library/Archives/isad/isaua2.html The UA2 Collaboration collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force on the accelerator end ([[stochastic cooling]]). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, a most unusual step for the conservative [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;[http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1984/ 1984 Nobel Prize in physics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0}} bosons, together with the photon ({{SubatomicParticle|Photon}}), comprise the four [[gauge boson]]s of the [[electroweak interaction]].

== Decay ==
The W and Z bosons decay to [[fermion]]–[[antifermion]] pairs but neither the W nor the Z bosons can decay into the higher-mass [[top quark]].  Neglecting phase space effects and higher order corrections, simple estimates of their [[branching fraction]]s can be calculated from the [[coupling constant]]s.

=== W bosons ===
'''W bosons''' can decay to a [[lepton]] and neutrino or to an [[quark#Electric charge|up-type quark and a down-type quark]].  The [[decay width]] of the W boson to a [[quark]]–[[antiquark]] pair is proportional to the corresponding squared [[CKM matrix]] element and the number of quark [[color charge|colours]], ''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  The decay widths for the W bosons are then proportional to:

| {{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Bottom antiquark}}
| 3&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;cb&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Here, {{SubatomicParticle|Electron+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Tauon+}} denote the three flavours of [[lepton]]s (more exactly, the positive charged [[antiparticle|antilepton]]s).  {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Tauon neutrino}} denote the three flavours of neutrinos.  The other particles, starting with {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Down antiquark}}, all denote [[quark]]s and antiquarks (factor ''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is applied).  The various ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the corresponding [[CKM matrix]] coefficients.

[[Unitary matrix|Unitarity]] of the CKM matrix implies that 
|''V''&lt;sub&gt;ud&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''V''&lt;sub&gt;us&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''V''&lt;sub&gt;ub&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;
|''V''&lt;sub&gt;cd&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''V''&lt;sub&gt;cs&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''V''&lt;sub&gt;cb&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Therefore, the leptonic [[branching ratio]]s of the W boson are approximately ''B''({{SubatomicParticle|Electron+}}{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''({{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}}{{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''({{SubatomicParticle|Tauon+}}{{SubatomicParticle|Tauon neutrino}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|9}}.  The hadronic branching ratio is dominated by the CKM-favored {{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|down antiquark}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|strange antiquark}} final states.  The sum of the [[hadron]]ic branching ratios has been measured experimentally to be {{val|67.60|0.27|s=%}}, with ''B''(l&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ν&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|10.80|0.09|s=%}}.&lt;ref name="Beringer2012" /&gt;

=== Z bosons ===
'''Z bosons''' decay into a fermion and its antiparticle. As the Z boson is a mixture of the pre-[[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] W&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; bosons (see [[Weinberg angle|weak mixing angle]]), each [[feynman diagram|vertex factor]] includes a factor ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Q''&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;W;&lt;/sub&gt; where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the third component of the [[weak isospin]] of the fermion, ''Q ''is the [[electric charge]] of the fermion (in units of the [[elementary charge]]), and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Weinberg angle|weak mixing angle]].  Because the weak isospin is different for fermions of different [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]], either [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)#Right handed singlets, left handed doublets|left-handed or right-handed]], the coupling is different as well.

The '''relative''' strengths of each coupling can be estimated by considering that the [[decay rate]]s include the square of these factors, and all possible diagrams (e.g. sum over quark families, and left and right contributions).  This is just an estimate, as we are considering only tree-level diagrams in the [[Fermi theory]].

Here, L and R denote either the left- or right-handed chirality of the fermions, respectively.  (The right-handed neutrinos do not exist in the standard model.  However, in some extensions beyond the standard model they do.)  The notation ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is used.
