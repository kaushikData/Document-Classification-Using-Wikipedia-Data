[[Canonization|Saint]] '''Abraham of Smolensk''' (1150 or 1172 - {{circa}} 1222) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[monk]] and [[priest]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://catholicsaints.info/saint-abraham-of-smolensk/|title=Saint Abraham of Smolensk|date=24 July 2012|publisher=Saints SQPN|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resided at the Bogoroditzkaja [[convent]] and was regarded as a miracle worker. He engaged in extensive preaching and biblical studies and is viewed as a notable figure in the pre-[[Mongol]] [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=CO&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1087|title=St. Abraham of Smolensk|date=|publisher=Catholic Online|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
The saint was said to be born either in 1150 or 1172 to nobles; he was orphaned in his childhood and then decided to abandon his fortune to pursue the austere and poor religious life.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

He is described as being a man of stern and militant character who kept the idea of the [[Last Judgement]] in the minds of himself and others. He was popular among [[Laity|the faithful]] as he worked for the sick and the troubled. He was noted for his tenderness with those coming to him for his help and his advice.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CO/&gt; He was less popular with the other priests who were jealous of his successes.&lt;ref name=CO/&gt; This tension led to several moral and theological charges being brought against him and it led to the local bishop taking action against him which cast a cloud over his character for some time and an order for him to stop preaching. But his withdrawal made him no friends either for there were clerics who kept on viewing him with suspicion.

The bishop later reopened the case against him and acquitted him against the charges leveled against him while making him the [[abbot]] of the smaller and impoverished convent of the Mother of God in the area.&lt;ref name=CO/&gt; He spent the rest of his life there and died there circa 1222. His disciple Ephraem's biographical account of the late saint has survived.

==Sainthood==
He is venerated as a saint in both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Pope Paul III]] canonized him as a saint in 1549.

'''Fadl Allah Abu Taghlib al-Ghadanfar ʿUddat al-Dawla''' ({{lang-ar|فضل الله أبو تغلب الغضنفر عدة الدولة}}), usually known simply by his ''[[kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]'' as '''Abu Taghlib''', was the third [[Hamdanid]] ruler of the [[Emirate of Mosul]], encompassing most of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]].

His reign was troubled, being marked by conflicts with some of his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the [[Buyids]] for influence in [[Baghdad]], and attacks by the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[John I Tzimiskes]]. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, [['Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar]], were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of [[Shiraz]] under [['Adud al-Dawla]], and he fled to the [[Fatimid]]-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of [[Damascus]], and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.

==Life==

===Origin and background===
[[File:Hamdanid family tree.svg|thumb|300px|Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty]]
Abu Taghlib was the eldest son of al-Hasan, better known by his ''[[laqab]]'' of [[Nasir al-Dawla]], who had established the [[Hamdanids]] as masters of a practically independent emirate encompassing the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] and centred on [[Mosul]]. Nasir al-Dawla engaged in repeated  attempts to gain control over the [[Abbasid]] caliphs at [[Baghdad]], but in the end was forced to concede defeat to the more powerful [[Buyids]], recognize their suzerainty and pay them tribute.&lt;ref name="EI2-127"&gt;Canard (1971), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 268–271&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Nasir al-Dawla's younger brother Ali, better known as [[Sayf al-Dawla]], managed to establish his control over northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] from his two capitals [[Aleppo]] and [[Mayyafariqin]], and through his clashes with the [[Byzantine Empire]] quickly overshadowed his brother. However, the last decade of Sayf al-Dawla's rule, until his death in February 967, was marked by heavy military defeats at the hands of the Byzantines, who occupied much of his domains, and internal turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1971), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 273–280&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this context that Abu Taghlib is first mentioned in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.&lt;ref name="EI2-127"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign===
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids]]
Abu Taghlib, surnamed ''al-Ghadanfar'' ("The Lion"), succeeded his father as emir and head of the Jaziran branch of the Hamdanid family, but almost immediately his authority was contested by a younger half-brother, Hamdan. Nasir al-Dawla had entrusted the latter with the governance of [[Nisibis]], [[Maridin]] and [[Rahba]] shortly before his deposition, and may have intended to name him as his heir over Abu Taghlib. Hamdan was indeed the only son of Nasir al-Dawla to protest his father's deposition, and refused to recognize Abu Taghlib. With the aid of the new Buyid emir of Iraq, [['Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar]], Abu Taghlib prevailed over Hamdan, who fled to Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1971), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraemer89"&gt;Kraemer (1992), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Abu Taghlib used the conditions of near-anarchy prevailing in Syria at the time and after Sayf al-Dawla's death to expand his territory at the expense of his cousin, [[Sa'd al-Dawla]]. Upon Sayf al-Dawla's death, Abu Taghlib  seized [[Raqqa]] and [[Rafiqa]], and by 971 he had extended his control over all of [[Diyar Bakr]] and [[Diyar Mudar]], once part of Sayf al-Dawla's domain, uniting the entire Jazira under his rule. Sa'd al-Dawla, deprived of his own capital and lacking any power to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1971), pp. 127–128, 129&lt;/ref&gt; As ruler of the Jazira, Abu Taghlib was one of the richest rulers of the region; [[Ibn Hawkal]]'s descriptions attest to the wealth derived from the many Hamdanid estates, and [[Ibn Miskawayh]], who was tasked with inventorying the family's mountain strongholds after the Buyid dissolution of the Hamdanid emirate in 979, writes of the immense cash reserves stored there.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2005), pp. 262–263 esp. note 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations with the Buyids were initially good, as Abu Taghlib, unlike his father, had no direct claim on Baghdad, and Bakhtiyar himself was too preoccupied with affairs in Iraq and elsewhere to focus his attention on the Jazira. However, the Buyid prince offered refuge to Hamdan and other disgruntled members of the Hamdanid clan (including another of Abu Taghlib's brothers, [[Abu Tahir Ibrahim]]) and intervened in the Hamdanid family quarrels.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"&gt;Canard (1971), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy272"&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in 970 Hamdan was restored in Rahba thanks to Buyid pressure, only to be chased away again in 971. The exiled prince now urged Bakhtiyar to make war on Abu Taghlib: in 973 the Buyids once again occupied Mosul, while Abu Taghlib with his army outflanked them and threatened Baghdad. The conflict ended in a negotiated settlement in 974 that included in its provisions the award of the ''laqab'' of ''ʿUddat al-Dawla'' ("Instrument [[al-Dawla|of the Dynasty]]") to Abu Taghlib by the caliph and the restoration of Hamdan to his domains.&lt;ref name="Kraemer89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy272"/&gt; During the same period, Abu Taghlib also faced the attacks of the Byzantines, who under Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] penetrated deep into the Jazira, forcing the Hamdanids to pay tribute. The devastating raids of 972 were partly avenged through the defeat and capture of the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[Melias (Domestic of the Schools)|Melias]] at [[Amid]] in 973, but in 974 Tzimiskes himself raided the Jazira in retaliation.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2005), pp. 308, 325–326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer (1992), pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iraq Ninth Century.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries]]
In 973–975, Abu Taghlib supported Bakhtiyar in his own struggles to safeguard his power. Thus he once again marched on Baghdad during the rebellion of the Turkish military commander, [[Sabuktakin]], although it was the intervention of the Buyid emir of [[Shiraz]], [['Adud al-Dawla]], that decided the conflict for Bakhtiyar. As a result of his assistance, in 975 Abu Taghlib secured a revision of the earlier treaty which freed him from the payment of tribute.&lt;ref name="Kraemer89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; In 976, following the death of Tzimiskes, Abu Taghlib agreed to support the bid for the Byzantine throne of the rebel general [[Bardas Skleros]], with whom he concluded a treaty whereby the Hamdanid ruler supplied Skleros with light cavalry in exchange for an unspecified marriage agreement.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2005), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In 977, as Bakhtiyar found himself driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned again to the Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in exchange for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near [[Samarra]] by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 272, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area.&lt;ref name="Kennedy272"/&gt; The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of [[Armenian Highland|Armenia]]; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in [[Anzitene]], trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]]. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy272"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2005), pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and death===
With the Buyid troops completing their conquest of the Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al-Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the [[Syrian Desert]] to the [[Fatimid]]-controlled south of Syria.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy272"/&gt; There he became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of [[Damascus]], but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of [[Lake Tiberias]]. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of [[Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah]], a [[Tayy]] chief and ruler of [[Ramla]]. Hoping to sow dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the [[Banu Uqayl]], and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.&lt;ref name="EI2-128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gil (1997), pp. 354–356&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jazira remained under Buyid control until 989, when Abu Taghlib's brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim, who had submitted to the Buyids, were installed as governors to oppose the power of the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] chieftain Badh, who had taken control of Mosul. In this fight, the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Badh, the Banu Uqayl turned on the Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the [[Uqaylid Dynasty]] as the rulers of the Jazira.&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1971), pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;

Its subject matter and style resemble those of the earliest Surahs revealed at [[Mecca]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of suras in the Quran|Quran Verses in Chronological Order]]&lt;/ref&gt; but it contains a pointer which indicates that it was sent down in the period when the disbelievers of Makkah had resolved to oppose Muhammad, and made it lawful for themselves to commit tyranny and excess against him.

==Theme and subject matter==
According to an interpretation expounded on in the ''[[tafsir|tafsīr]]'' (commentary) written by [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] (d. 1979) entitled ''[[Tafhim al-Qur'an]]'',&lt;ref name="Tafhim al-Qur'an"&gt;Maududi, S., [http://www.englishtafsir.com/Quran/90/index.html ''Tafhim al-Qur'an'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Its theme is to explain the true position of man in the world and of the world in relation to man and to tell that God has shown to man both the highways of good and evil, has also provided for him the means to judge and see and follow them, and now it rests upon mans own effort and judgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and reaches felicity or adopts the path of vice and meets with doom.

First, the city of Makkah and the hardships being faced therein by Muhammad and the state of the children of Adam have been cited as a witness to the truth that this world is not a place of rest and ease for man, where he might have been born to enjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and struggle. If this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah [[An-Najm]] (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa: there is nothing for man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain that in this world the future of man depends on his toil and struggle, effort and striving.

After this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all in this world and that there is no superior power to watch what he does and to call him to account, has been refuted.

Then, taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance held by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what wrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for himself in the world. The person who for ostentation and display squanders heaps of wealth, not only himself prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire him for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is watching over his deeds, sees by what methods he obtained the wealth and in what ways and with what motives and intention he spent it.

Then Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge and the faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before him both the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is man's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the abyss to scaling the cliff.

Then, Allah has explained what the steep road is by following which man can ascend to the heights. It is that he should give up spending for ostentation, display and pride and should spend his wealth to help the orphans and the needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion and joining the company of believers should participate in the construction of a society which should fulfill the demands of virtue and righteousness patiently and should be compassionate to the people. The end of those who follow this way is that they would become worthy of Allah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those who follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which there is no escape.

[[Sayyid Qutb]] (d. 1966), who was an [[Egypt]]ian author, [[Islamist]], and leading intellectual of the [[Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood]], surmised the overall theme of ''Surat Al-Lail'' in the introduction to his extensive Quranic commentary, ''[[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]]'' (In the shades of the Qur'an) by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This short sūrah touches on a great many facts which are of central importance to human life. Its style is characterized by powerful allusions. Numerous facts of this nature are not easily combined in any form of concise writing except that of the Qur’ān, with its unique ability to hit the right chords with such swift and penetrating strokes.

—[[Sayid Qutb]], ''[[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]]''

The '''Amami rabbit''' (''Pentalagus furnessi''; {{IPA-ryu|ʔosaɡi|[[Amami language|Amami]]:}}), or {{nihongo||アマミノクロウサギ 奄美野黒兔|Amamino kuro usagi|lit. "Amami wild black rabbit"}}, also known as the '''Ryukyu rabbit''', is a primitive, dark-furred [[rabbit]] which is only found in [[Amami Ōshima]] and [[Tokunoshima|Toku-no-Shima]], two small islands between southern [[Kyūshū]] and [[Okinawa]] in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] (but actually closer to Okinawa) in [[Japan]]. Often called a [[living fossil]], the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small Japanese islands where they live today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Robinson, T. |author2=Yang, F. |author3=Harrison, W. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2002|title= Chromosome painting refines the history of genome evolution in hares and rabbits (order Lagomorpha)|pmid=12438803|journal= Cytogenetic and Genome Research |pages= 223–227|volume=96|issue=1–4|doi=10.1159/000063034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

=== Diet ===
The&amp;nbsp;amami rabbit feeds on over 29 species of plants, which incorporates 17 species of shrubs and 12 species of [[herbaceous plant]]s, consuming mostly the sprouts, young [[shoot]]s and [[acorn]]s .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fnlFAQAAIAAJ|title=The Wild Mammals of Japan|last=Ohdachi|first=Satoshi D.|last2=Ishibashi|first2=Yasuyuki|last3=Iwasa|first3=Masahiro A.|date=2009|publisher=Shoukadoh Book Sellers|isbn=9784879746269|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also eats [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[cambium]] of a wide variety of plant species.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9d8_AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:354072446X&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWzrKj8czUAhWIro8KHV1qDBsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lagomorph Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation|last=Alves|first=Paulo C.|last2=Ferrand|first2=Nuno|last3=Hackländer|first3=Klaus|date=2007-12-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540724469|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is observed that the amami rabbit also feeds on the bark of stems and twigs of shrub plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During summer, the amami rabbit primarily feeds on pampas grass, and during winter, they primarily eat the acorns of the pasania tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kNo5AQAAIAAJ|title=Endangered wildlife of the world|last=Corporation|first=Marshall Cavendish|date=February 1993|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morphology ===
The Amami rabbit has short feet and hind legs, a somewhat bulky body, and rather large and curved claws used for digging and sometimes climbing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Its ears are significantly smaller compared to those of other hares or rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GMuxDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42&amp;dq=amami+rabbit+Its+ears+are+also+significantly+smaller+than+those+of+other+rabbits+or+hares&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE4JKL_cfUAhWKPo8KHSV9BqsQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=amami%20rabbit%20Its%20ears%20are%20also%20significantly%20smaller%20than%20those%20of%20other%20rabbits%20or%20hares&amp;f=false|title=The Way of the Hare|last=Taylor|first=Marianne|date=2017-06-15|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472909909|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fur|pelage]] is thick, wooly and dark, brown on top and becomes more reddish-brown on the sides.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9d8_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=center+for+conservation+of+amami+wildlife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi42u_fsMTUAhUISI8KHaGKDnkQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=center%20for%20conservation%20of%20amami%20wildlife&amp;f=false|title=Lagomorph Biology: Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation|last=Alves|first=Paulo C.|last2=Ferrand|first2=Nuno|last3=Hackländer|first3=Klaus|date=2007-12-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540724469|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has heavy, long and very strong claws, being nearly straight on the forefeet and curved on the hindfeet &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The eyes are also small compared to more common rabbits and hares. The average weight is 2.5–2.8&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Yamada, F. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yamada, F.  |author2=Cervantes, F. |year=2005|title= Pentalagus fernessi|journal= Mammalian Species|pages=1–5|doi=10.1644/782.1|volume=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution and habitat===
The ideal habitat for these rabbits is in an area between mature and young forests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They use the dense mature forests as protection and for the presence of [[pampas grass]], in the summer, and [[acorn]]s, in the winter, for their diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hhNj4HFV-toC|title=Walker's Mammals of the World|last=Nowak|first=Ronald M.|date=1999-04-07|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801857898|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watari|first=Yuya|last2=Nishijima|first2=Shota|last3=Fukasawa|first3=Marina|last4=Yamada|first4=Fumio|last5=Abe|first5=Shintaro|last6=Miyashita|first6=Tadashi|date=2013|title=Evaluating the "recovery level" of endangered species without prior information before alien invasion|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=3|issue=14|pages=4711–4721|doi=10.1002/ece3.863|issn=2045-7758|pmc=3867906|pmid=24363899|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"/&gt;

Using fecal pellet counts and resident surveys, the number of rabbits is estimated at 2000–4800 left on Amami Island and 120–300 left on Tokuno Island.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Pentalagus_furnessi/|title=Pentalagus furnessi (Amami rabbit)|last=|first=|date=|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504084842/http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Pentalagus_furnessi/|archive-date=2017-05-04|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
This species is a [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May and once in September–December, having one or two young each time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the day, the mother digs a hole in the ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the entrance to the hole, while watching for [[predator]]s (such as venomous [[snake]]s), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_kWcAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1105564967&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG3Mu1rczUAhUIt48KHQu6A4kQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rabbits, Pikas and Dwarf Rabbits|last=Dixon|first=Kristina|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781105564963|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/reference/amami_rabbit/|title=Amami Rabbit - Redorbit|last=redOrbit|first=|date=|work=Redorbit|access-date=2017-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619104655/http://www.redorbit.com/reference/amami_rabbit/|archive-date=2017-06-19|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a [[pika]].&lt;ref name="Yamada, F. 2005"/&gt;

==Endangered species==

===Threats===
Before 1921, hunting and trapping were another cause of decline in population numbers. In 1921, Japan declared the Amami rabbit a "natural monument" which prevented it from being hunted.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Then in 1963, it was changed to a "special natural monument" which prevented it from being trapped as well.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author =Sugimura, K.|author2 =Sato, S.|author3 =Yamado, F.|author4 =Abe, S.|author5 =Hirakawa, H.|author6 =Handa, Y.|last-author-amp =yes |year=2000|title= Distribution and abundance of the Amami rabbit Pentalagus furnessi in the Amami and Tokuno Islands, Japan|journal=  Oryx|pages=198–206|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3008.2000.00119.x|volume=34|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat destruction, such as forest clearing for commercial logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, is the most detrimental activity on the distribution of these rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/28162-rabbits.html|title=Rabbits: Habits, Diet &amp; Other Facts|last=|first=|date=|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520070853/https://www.livescience.com/28162-rabbits.html|archive-date=2017-05-20|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"/&gt; There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Gielen, D. |author2=Kurihara, R. |author3=Moriguchi, Y. |last-author-amp=yes|year=2002|title= The Environmental Impacts of Japanese Tourism and Leisure|journal= Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy &amp; Management |pages= 397–424|doi=10.1142/S146433320200111X|volume=4|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amami rabbit also faces huge threats from the invasive predators, being a major cause for the decline in population size.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16559/0|title=Pentalagus furnessi (Amami Rabbit, Ryukyu Rabbit)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iucnredlist.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311224658/http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16559/0|archive-date=2017-03-11|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of Amami, the [[small Asian mongoose|small Indian mongoose]] (''Herpestes javanicus'') was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Hays, W. |author2=Conant, S. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2007|title= Biology and Impacts of Pacific Island Invasive Species. 1. A Worldwide Review of Effects of the Small Indian Mongoose, Herpestes javanicus (Carnivora: Herpestidae)|doi=10.1353/psc.2007.0006|journal=  Pacific Science |pages=3–16|volume=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"/&gt;

===Conservation===
In July 2008, the Amami Rangers for [[nature conservation]] obtained a photograph of a [[feral]] cat carrying a rabbit [[Cadaver|corpse]] (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3uzwAAAAMAAJ|title=World directory of national parks and other protected areas|last=Secretariat|first=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|last2=Parks|first2=International Commission on National|date=1975|publisher=IUCN|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"/&gt;

Suggested conservation work for the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on the southern end of Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.&lt;ref name="Sugimura, K. 2000"/&gt;

The Lagomorph Specialist Group of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] proposed a plan of conservation in 1990.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Fumio|last2=Cervantes|first2=Fernando A.|date=2005-12-01|title=Pentalagus furnessi|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i1545-1410-782-1-1.pdf|journal=Mammalian Species|pages=1–5|doi=10.1644/782.1|issn=0076-3519|via=|access-date=18 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315232504/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i1545-1410-782-1-1.pdf|archive-date=15 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Amami-Oshima Island, the Amami Wildlife Conservation Center of the Ministry of the Environment was established in 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It restarted a mongoose eradication program in 2005 and designated the Amami rabbit as endangered in 2004 for Japan.&lt;ref name="Yamada, F. 2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1209">'''Anterior shoulder''' in [[obstetrics]] refers to that shoulder of the [[fetus]] that faces the [[pubic symphysis]] of the mother during delivery. Depending upon the original [[Position (Obstetrics)|position]] of the fetus, either the left or the right shoulder can be the anterior shoulder. It is known as the anterior shoulder as it faces the [[anterior]] of the mother.

'''Añaterve''' was the [[Guanches|Guanche]] [[mencey]] (king) of [[Menceyato de Güímar]] at the time of the conquest of [[Tenerife]] in the 15th century.

==Kingship and European invasion==
Añaterve a Berber, was the king of Güímar, which territory had an evangelizing mission since the mid-15th century.

Añaterve was the first mencey to join the peace pact with the [[Europeans]]. The peace agreement was signed with the governor of [[Gran Canaria]], [[Pedro de Vera]] in 1490 before being quickly ratified by the mencey with [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] in 1494 shortly after the first landing of the conquering army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1 La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496)]&lt;/ref&gt; The mencey of Güímar actively collaborated with the conquerors, providing auxiliary troops and supplies throughout the campaign.

==Later years==
After the conquest in 1496, Añaterve was taken, along with six other menceyes, to [[Spain]] by Alonso Fernández de Lugo to be presented to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. He then returned to Tenerife to live under Spanish rule. His later history is not known before dying in military action.

The '''Badoon''' are a fictional [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]] [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien species]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are notable for living under strict [[Sex segregation|gender segregation]], resulting in two separate societies; the '''Brotherhood of Badoon''' (ruled by a "Brother Royal") and the '''Sisterhood of Badoon''' (ruled by a [[Queen regnant|Queen]]).

The Brotherhood live on the planet Moord&lt;ref name=ohmu2&gt;''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #2, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in the Lomora&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 1 #30, Nov 1992&lt;/ref&gt; star system while the Sisterhood reside on the Badoon homeworld of Lotiara&lt;ref name=ohmu2/&gt; ([[Capella (star)|Capella]] II, also known as "Swampworld"&lt;ref name=def8&gt;''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' v1 #28, by [[Steve Gerber]], Oct 1975&lt;/ref&gt;), 42.2 light years from [[Earth]].

==Publication history==
The Badoon first appeared in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #2 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]].

==Fictional history==
[[File:Female Badoon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Female Badoon from ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #28 (Oct 1975). Art by [[Sal Buscema]].]]
The Badoon are older than the [[Kree]] and the [[Skrull]]s. There was a natural hatred between the two genders, and they fought each other in long gender wars. The males quickly won, and placed the weaker females in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/skrulls-badoon-part-marvel-cinematic-universe.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the males developed technology and abandoned Lotiara, returning only when their mating drive made it necessary. The males became conquerors of worlds, while the females became [[Pacifism|pacifists]], content to remain in peace on their homeworld and ignorant of the males' star-spanning empire.&lt;ref name=def8/&gt;

Among the Brotherhood's conquest attempts are the [[Gamora|Zen Whoberi]], and the extra-dimensional world of [[Arkon|Polemachus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Men|Uncanny X-Men Annual]]'' #5, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; They have been known to form alliances with the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] (against the [[Shi'ar]] and Earth's superhumans&lt;ref&gt;''Contest of Champions'' v2 #1-5, Sep-Nov 1999&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Kree]] (against the Skrulls&lt;ref name=surferv3-27&gt;''[[Silver Surfer]]'' v3 #27, by [[Steve Englehart]], Sep 1989&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Byrrah]] of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref name="Sub-Mariner #50-51"&gt;''Sub-Mariner'' #50-51&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also responsible for killing a woman who would have become the universe's greatest peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel'' v4 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Badoon invasion attempts of Earth have been overcome by the [[Silver Surfer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Namor]],&lt;ref name="Sub-Mariner #50-51"/&gt; and the [[New Warriors]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; They were also opposed by the combined forces of the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Arkon]] in order to liberate Arkon's homeworld and prevent an invasion of the Shi'ar empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #5 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Annihilation Wave]] the Badoon Empire controlled 37.7% of the Milky Way Galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;''Annihilation Prologue'' #1 (May, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Badoon are considered a minor species. The time traveler [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]] warned the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] that they need to take the Badoon seriously, as soon they'll become the greatest military threat in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2 #7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inhumans]] and the [[Kree]] later form an alliance with the Badoon alongside the Centaurians, the [[Dire Wraith]]s, and the [[Kymellian]]s. They were put through the same experimental procedure so that they cannot be harmed by the [[Terrigen Mist]]s. The Badoons' procedure had them going through Amphogenesis upon injecting one drop of the diluted water from the dormant Amphogen (a mutagenic substance).&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #577&lt;/ref&gt; The Badoons were present on Earth's moon upon [[Black Bolt]]'s return and when the prophecy of the four cities is known.&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and Abilities==
The Badoons have no powers or abilities.

===Badoon's Technology===
[[File:Monster of Badoon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Monster of Badoon. Art by [[Brent Anderson]].]]
The Brotherhood are capable of [[faster-than-light]] [[Space exploration|space travel]] and also possess personal [[Cloaking device|cloaking]] technology. They employ a hand-held particle gun called the "basic weapon." Although males typically wear minimal clothing, some soldiers wear an explosive "frag-[[G-string|thong]]"&lt;ref name=surferv3-27/&gt; that destroys approximately ten surrounding enemies once a Badoon is shot down.

There is also a large, muscular [[cyborg]]-like being sometimes used in personal combat called the "Monster of Badoon."&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' v1 #2, by [[Stan Lee]], Oct 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The Badoon will bolster their forces with Zom soldiers: the corpses of victims turned into cyborg warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #7 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known Badoons==
* '''Aladi No Eke''' - Queen of the Badoon contingent of Universal Inhumans.
* '''Brother Royal''' - Member of the Brotherhood of the Badoon. He commands the "Monster of Badoon."
* '''Czar-Doon''' - A Badoon that worked with Thanos. In an earlier life, he was a member of [[Yondu]]'s Ravagers.
* '''Dara Ko Eke''' - A Badoon who is a member of the Universal Inhumans' Light Brigade. She operates under the alias of '''All-Knowing'''.
* '''L'Matto''' - A Badoon that was one of the hosts to [[Captain Universe]]. He wielded the Enigma Power to prevent the Guardians of the Galaxy from exterminating the Badoons.
* '''Droom''' - Leader of the Brotherhood in the 31st century.
* '''Tolaria''' - Leader of the Sisterhood in the 31st century.
* '''Drang'''
* '''Yur'''

==Other versions==

===Earth-691===
The Brotherhood are most closely associated with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'s [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|'Multiverse' timeline]] of [[Earth-691]]. In this reality, Earth fought a war with them in the 30th century until both Earth and its solar system colonies were conquered in the year 3007, and many races were nearly all wiped out. The Guardians of the Galaxy were made up of different species, and put together by [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]]. The human [[Michael Korvac]], joined the Badoon and became a cyborg. The Solar System was liberated by the intervention of the Sisterhood in 3014.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marvel Presents]]'' #3, by Steve Gerber, Feb 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all information about the Sisterhood comes from the Guardians of the Galaxy's encounters with them in this timeline. Recent stories [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|as of 2008]] have depicted the Sisterhood who exist in the Earth-616 reality as being as warlike as the Brotherhood, suggesting that this origin story does not apply to the "mainstream" version of the Sisterhood.

===Earth-93112===
In the [[Earth-93112]] timeline, the Badoon [[Earth-93112#Master Ecclaw of "Earth-93112"|Ecclaw]] was one of the last survivors of the Intergalactic Alliance destroyed by the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who is best known as the mentor of the superhero [[Maxam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' #41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers Forever===
In another timeline, the Badoon were conquered by [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Badoon are mentioned in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Hulk's Day Out." The Avengers battle the Badoon-Cylek, a genetic parasitic experiment that the Badoon left behind on the Blue Area of the Moon which was causing weather phenomena on Earth. It was first traced to the moon after a fragment of it was vomited out of the Hulk. During the fight on the Moon, the Hulk was able to defeat the Badoon-Cylek by ripping it out of the Moon.

'''Cadwallader William Evan''' ( – 21 August 1876), generally referred to as Rev. C. W. Evan, was a Congregationalist minister in colonial South Australia, the first to serve at the [[Pilgrim Uniting Church|Stow Memorial Church]], [[Flinders Street, Adelaide]].

==History==
Evan was born in Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43010928 |title=Death of Rev. C. W, Evan |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=11 October 1876 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; educated at [[Airedale College]], [[Yorkshire]], and  graduated B.A. from [[London University]]. In 1855 he was serving as pastor for the Independent Church at [[Saint Peter Port]], [[Guernsey]], when he was approached by the Revs. Thomas Binney and George Smith, who had been charged by the Congregational church of Freeman Street, Adelaide, with recruiting a young minister to act as coadjutor (assistant) to the aged and ailing Rev. [[T. Q. Stow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158105479 |title=New Congregational minister |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |location=SA |date=15 September 1855 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived on the ''James Baines'' on 27 October 1855, and preached his first sermons at the Freeman Street chapel on 4 November 1855. In 1861, responding to his deteriorating health [[Charles Manthorpe]] was brought in as co-pastor.

Rev. Evan was involved in the planning and erection of the Stow Memorial Church as a replacement for the Freeman Street chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39120717 |title=Stow Memorial Church |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 January 1864 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in mid-1863, and opened in April 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28796655 |title=Opening of Stow Memorial Church |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 April 1867 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evan and his family lived at Hagen House, [[East Terrace, Adelaide|East Terrace]], where on 2 January 1869 his wife Ellen (née Pearce) gave birth to a daughter, her eighth child, and died on 21 January 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31985992 |title=Mrs. C. W. Evan |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=22 January 1869 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suffered ill health and was forced to retire, being replaced by the Rev. [[Colmer B. Symes|C. B. Symes]] in March 1872. He returned to England, but died aboard the ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|SS Torrens]]'' before disembarkation.

==Family==
C. W. Evan and his wife Ellen had eight children, among them 
*[[Mostyn Evan]] (22 September 1861 – 25 December 1924)
*Cadwallader Burton Evan ( – 16 July 1933) assisted his father&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47544645 |title=Memorial to Mr. and Mrs. Burton Evan |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 March 1934 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Winifred Maude Evan, who married Arthur Webb Pettit on 28 July 1897.

'''Trudie Adams''' disappeared from [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport Surf Life Saving Club]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the early hours of 25 June 1978, after attending a dance. She left the dance early before [[hitchhiking]], at which point she entered a [[Holden]] panel van on [[Barrenjoey Road]], and has not been seen since.

The '''Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure''' is a possibly [[Aztec]] [[scapolite]] figurine of a woman giving childbirth in a [[Childbirth positions#Squatting position|squatting position]]. Housed in the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] collection, United States, the figurine is considered by several scholars to be a [[pre-Columbian art]]work, while others believe it was made in modern times, possibly in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="jsa"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://jsa.revues.org/8623|title=The Dumbarton Oaks Tlazolteotl: looking beneath the surface|work=[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]|author=Jane MacLaren Walsh| date=2008| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine measures 20.2&amp;nbsp;cm in height.

Birthing figures, while common in [[New Spain|Colonial Mexican]] manuscripts, are rare in Aztec three-dimensional art. Women, however, occupied a prominent position in the [[Aztec mythology]].

==Provenance==
Early mentions of the figurine come from [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]], who first saw it in a [[Paris]] antique store.&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-stone-figure-at-dumbarton-oaks-tells-an-intriguing-story/2014/01/13/495c2b98-7c85-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html|title=Local Intriguing story behind a stone figure at Dumbarton Oaks|work=[[The Washington Post]]| author=John Kelly|date=Jan 13, 2014| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine was later bought by French obstetrician and collector Alban Ribemont-Dessaignes.&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt; In 1947, the figure was acquired by [[Robert Woods Bliss]], the founder of [[Dumbarton Oaks]].&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt;

==Authenticity==
The first scholarly article about the figurine was written by [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]] in 1899 and called it "absolutely unique in the history of Mexican art".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; In 1906, Hamy published an article in the ''[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]'' writing that the figurine is of [[pre-Columbian Mexican]] origin and represents the Aztec goddess Ixcuina, also known as [[Tlazolteotl]]. Scholars such as [[Pal Kelemen]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], [[John Alden Mason]], [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[Jeffrey Quilter]] also considered the figurine to be authentic.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; Others, such as [[Claude-François Baudez]] and [[Esther Pasztory]], question the figurine's stylistic features. The authenticity was also questioned on the basis of technical virtuosity compared to the technical limitations of pre-Columbian artisans.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; According to [[Jane MacLaren Walsh]], "the essential nature of the sculpture is almost completely anomalous with regard to the accepted canon of Mexica art, and does not in fact resemble any other Mesoamerican art form" and "the choice of stone, the complicated carving in the round, the birthing position, the facial expression of the mother, the somewhat grotesque realism, the lack of iconographic detail all point to a highly [[idiosyncratic]] work".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt;

'''Extended cognition''' is the view that [[mental process]]es and [[mind]] extend beyond the body to include aspects of the [[physical environment|environment]] in which an organism is embedded and the organism's interaction with that environment.&lt;ref name=Rupert/&gt; [[Cognition]] goes beyond the manipulation of symbols to include the [[emergence]] of order and structure evolving from active engagement with the world.&lt;ref name=VanGelder/&gt; 

==Overview==
As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt;
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

This contrasts with the view of the mind as a processing center that creates mental representations of reality and uses them to control the body's behaviour. The field of extended cognition focuses upon the processes involved in this creation, and subsumes these processes as part of consciousness. Which is no longer confined to the brain or body, but involves interaction with the environment. At a 'low' level, like [[motor learning]] and [[haptic perception]],&lt;ref name=Morasso/&gt; the body is involved in cognition, but there is a 'high' level where cultural factors play a role.&lt;ref name=Ratner/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGann/&gt; This view of cognition is sometimes referred to as {{'}}'''[[enaction]]'''{{'}} to emphasise the role of interplay between the organism and its environment and the [[Cybernetics|feedback processes]] involved in developing an awareness of, and a reformation of, the environment.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt; For example Japyassú and Laland argue that some spider's web is something between part of its sensory system and an additional part of its cognitive system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10071-017-1069-7|pmid = 28176133|pmc = 5394149|title = Extended spider cognition|journal = Animal Cognition|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 375–395|year = 2017|last1 = Japyassú|first1 = Hilton F|last2 = Laland|first2 = Kevin N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24661">'''Folate targeting''' is a method utilized in [[biotechnology]] for [[drug delivery]] purposes.  This [[Trojan Horse]] process, which was created by Drs. Christopher P. Leamon and Philip S. Low, involves the attachment of the [[vitamin]], folate ([[folic acid]]), to a molecule/drug to form a "folate conjugate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leamon CP, Low PS |title=Delivery of macromolecules into living cells: a method that exploits folate receptor endocytosis |journal=Proc.

Molecules as diverse as small radiodiagnostic imaging agents to large [[DNA]] [[plasmid]] formulations have successfully been delivered inside FR-positive cells and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leamon CP |title=Folate-targeted drug strategies for the treatment of cancer |journal=Curr Opin Investig Drugs |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=1277–86 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19037834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Low PS, Kularatne SA |title=Folate-targeted therapeutic and imaging agents for cancer |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=256–62 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19419901|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.03.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Folic acid]] (FA, folate or vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), is a vital [[nutrient]] required by all living cells for [[nucleotide]] [[biosynthesis]] and for the proper [[Metabolism|metabolic]] maintenance of 1-carbon [[Metabolic pathway|pathways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clifford AJ, Arjomand A, Dueker SR, Schneider PD, Buchholz BA, Vogel JS |title=The dynamics of folic acid metabolism in an adult given a small tracer dose of 14C-folic acid |journal=Adv.

From a mechanistic perspective, the FR functions to concentrate [[Exogeny|exogenous]] ligands (e.g. folates and folate-drug conjugates) into the cell cytosol by endocytosis.&lt;ref name="KamenCapdevila" /&gt;  The term [[endocytosis]] refers to the process whereby the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]] [[Invagination|invaginates]] and eventually forms a distinct intracellular compartment.  The endocytic vesicles (endosomes) rapidly become acidified to allow the FR to release its ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0167-4889(96)00041-9 |vauthors=Lee RJ, Wang S, Low PS |title=Measurement of endosome pH following folate receptor-mediated endocytosis |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1312 |issue=3 |pages=237–42 |date=July 1996 |pmid=8703993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the empty FR returns to the cell surface where it can participate in another round of ligand-mediated endocytosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamen BA, Wang MT, Streckfuss AJ, Peryea X, Anderson RG |title=Delivery of folates to the cytoplasm of MA104 cells is mediated by a surface membrane receptor that recycles |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=263 |issue=27 |pages=13602–9 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3417674 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3417674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of vitamin-mediated drug targeting in plants led to the hypothesis that folate-targeted therapies could be of clinical use.&lt;ref name="Low"/&gt; After proteins covalently bonded to biotin were successfully transported into plant cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, a similar technique was attempted with folate and animal cells.&lt;ref name="Low"/&gt; Targeted drug therapy is advantageous because it deposits the drug at the specific location where it can be most useful in treating the disease. Similarly, folate-targeted imaging therapy helps visualize areas where the FR is expressed at higher levels. With greater control over where exogenous agents are delivered, diagnostic and treatment therapies are more effective and cause fewer side effects.

==Methods of drug delivery==
Specificity of folate conjugates for the FR has been shown by competition tests with free folate. When this ligand, known to bind the FR, is added in excess of the folate conjugate, it outcompetes the conjugate, indicating that the folate conjugate specifically binds the FR, and not other receptors, in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Addition of an enzyme that frees the folate receptor from the cell membrane and addition of antibodies to the FR also reverse the internalization of folate conjugates, providing further evidence that folate conjugates bind the FR with specificity.&lt;ref name="Low"/&gt;

While some drugs and radioimaging agents are delivered to cells as folate conjugates in a one-to-one folate-to-conjugate ratio, folate-targeted liposomes allow for the delivery of larger amounts of chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name="Low"/&gt; In this technique, drug particles are enveloped in a plasma membrane-bound vesicle. Folate is attached to polyethylene glycol bound to the phosphate heads of membrane phospholipids, thus directing the liposomes to FRs of tumor cells, by which they are engulfed.&lt;ref name="Low"/&gt;

==Folate-targeted chemotherapy==
To date, four distinct FA-drug conjugates have entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer:

''[[Vintafolide]] (EC145)'' represents a novel water-soluble FA conjugate of the powerful microtubule destabilizing agent, desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH; a derivative of the natural product, [[vinblastine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leamon CP, Reddy JA, Vlahov IR |title=Comparative preclinical activity of the folate-targeted Vinca alkaloid conjugates EC140 and EC145 |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=1585–92 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17551919 |doi=10.1002/ijc.22853|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EC145 was found to produce marked anti-tumor effect against well-established, subcutaneous FR-positive [[Patient derived tumor xenografts|tumor xenografts]] using well tolerated regimens.&lt;ref name=Reddy07/&gt; EC145 also represents the first FA-drug conjugate to be evaluated in clinical trials,&lt;ref name=Sausville07/&gt; and it is currently (2009) being tested in a multi-national randomized Phase 2b trial in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ([[Doxil]]).

''EC0225'' represents the "first in class" multi-drug, FA-targeted agent to be reported. It is a molecule constructed with a single FA moiety and extended by a hydrophilic peptide-based spacer that is, in turn, linked to ''Vinca'' alkaloid and mitomycin units via 2 distinct disulfide-containing linkers.&lt;ref name="Leamon2007" /&gt; Animals bearing well-established human tumor xenografts were found to completely respond to EC0225 therapy with dosing regimens that were approximately 3-fold less intensive to that required for EC145.  A Phase 1 trial for EC0225 is in progress.

''BMS-753493'' is a molecule born from a collaboration between scientists at Endocyte Inc. and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). It represents a FA conjugate that was constructed with a semi-synthetic analog of Epothilone A.&lt;ref name=Covello08/&gt;  BMS-753493 is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials sponsored by BMS.

''EC0489'' is the latest folate-targeted chemotherapeutic to enter clinical trials sponsored by Endocyte. This molecule is actually a derivative of EC145 (see above) that was designed to have limited non-specific clearance properties through the liver. By reducing hepatic clearance, less drug will transit through the biliary excretion route; as a consequence, less off-target toxicities (predicted from preclinical tests) are expected.

==Activated macrophage targeting==
Macrophages are the human body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens. Normally, they circulate in the bloodstream in a dormant state, but at a site of inflammation due to injury or autoimmune disease, they become activated, changing shape and expressing different cell surface markers.&lt;ref name="Wei"/&gt; The upregulated expression of the FR makes activated macrophages a useful tool in folate-targeted therapy. Activated, TNF-alpha producing macrophages express the beta isoform of the FR, and they are targetable with folate conjugates ''in vivo''. For example, &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-EC20 was reported to concentrate in the livers, spleens and arthritic extremities of adjuvant-induced arthritic rats via a folate-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turk MJ, Breur GJ, Widmer WR |title=Folate-targeted imaging of activated macrophages in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=1947–55 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12124880 |doi=10.1002/art.10405|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of folate-drug conjugates for inflammation therapy is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yi YS, Ayala-López W, Kularatne SA, Low PS |title=Folate-targeted hapten immunotherapy of adjuvant-induced arthritis: comparison of hapten potencies |journal=Mol.

'''Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock''' (27 September 1739 – 22 March 1767) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and the eldest son of the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|4th Duke of Bedford]] and his second wife Hon. Gertrude Leveson-Gower.

From 1759 to 1761, he sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Armagh Borough (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Armagh Borough]] and then in the [[British House of Commons]] for [[Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedfordshire]] until 1767.

He was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the [[Bedford Level Corporation]] in 1761, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=History of the Drainage of the Great Level of the Fens Called ..., Volume 1|first = Samuel|last= Wells|page=500}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Tavistock died in 1767, after falling from his horse while out hunting. On 8 June 1764, he had married [[Elizabeth Russell, Marchioness of Tavistock|Lady Elizabeth Keppel]], the youngest child of the [[Willem Anne van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle|2nd Earl of Albemarle]]. They had three sons:

*[[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] (1765–1802)
*[[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford]] (1766–1839)
*[[Lord William Russell (aristocrat)|Lord William Russell]] (1767–1840)

Their eldest son succeeded his grandfather as 5th [[Duke of Bedford]] in 1771.

'''Fu Da-ren''' ({{zh|t=傅達仁}}; 3 April 1933 – 7 June 2018) was a Taiwanese television presenter who received a [[Golden Bell Award]] in 1980.

Fu Da-ren was raised in an orphanage established by [[Soong Mei-ling]] after his father, [[Republic of China Army]] Major General {{ill|Fu Chung-kuei|zh|傅忠貴}} (1885－1938), was killed in action during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first1=Howard |last1=Lin |title=Crowds mark 111th anniversary of Madame Chiang Kai-shek's birth |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/search/200803190036.aspx |accessdate=7 June 2018 |agency=Central News Agency |date=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hsu |first1=Chloe |last2=Hsu |first2=Elizabeth |title=Lee Teng-hui's benefits as ex-president may be stripped |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201508210021.aspx |accessdate=7 June 2018 |agency=Central News Agency |date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several catchphrases familiar to athletes and sports fans in Taiwan were popularized by Fu during his broadcasting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EDITORIAL: Remembering a broadcast legend |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2018/06/13/2003694778 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fu was Christian.&lt;ref name="peaceatlast"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lai |first1=Julianna |title=Peace at last: Frank Fu Da-ren’s parting gift |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/07/10/2003696414 |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gates of Heaven''''' is a 1978 [[documentary film]] by [[Errol Morris]] about the [[pet cemetery]] business.  It was made when Morris was unknown and did much to launch his career.

==Synopsis==
The film, like Morris' other works, is unnarrated and the stories are told purely through interviews. It is divided into two main sections.  The first concerns Floyd "Mac" McClure and his lifelong quest to allow pets to have a graceful burial. McClure's business associates and his competitor, a manager of a [[rendering (industrial)|rendering plant]], are interviewed. Eventually the business fails and the 450 animals have to be dug up and transported to the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park. This operation is run by John "Cal" Harberts and his two sons. This business is far more successful, and continues to operate today, run by Cal's son Dan Harberts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/05.31.06/bubbling-well-0622.html Three Feet Under. Metroactive. Retrieved November 28, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Noted director [[Werner Herzog]] pledged that he would eat the shoe he was wearing if Morris' film on this improbable subject was completed and shown in a public theater. When the film was released Herzog lived up to his wager and the consumption of his footwear was made into the short film ''[[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe]]''. ''Gates of Heaven'' launched Morris' career and is now considered a classic. In 1991, [[Roger Ebert]] named it one of the ten best films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ten-greatest-films-of-all-time Ten Greatest Films of All Time. Roger Ebert's Journal. Retrieved Mar 1, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roger Ebert wrote that the film is an "underground legend," and in 1997 put it in his list of [[The Great Movies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971109/REVIEWS08/401010320/1023  | title=Gates of Heaven   | publisher=''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' |date=November 9, 1997  | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

File:Example_krig.png|[[Spatial Analysis]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the '''gray ooze''' is an [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ooze]]. It resembles a thick, [[viscous]] puddle of gray sludge, roughly 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;inches thick and up to 14 feet across, and often closely resembles wet stone or an amorphous rock formation.

==Publication history==
The gray ooze first appeared in the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' set]] (1974), and also appeared in the supplement ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'' (1976).

The gray ooze appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|D&amp;D Basic Set]]'' (1977, 1981, 1983) and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).

The gray ooze appeared in first edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in the original ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

The gray ooze appeared in second edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;[[David Cook (game designer)|Cook, David]], et al. ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in the ''Monstrous Manual'' (1993) under the "ooze" entry.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Doug, ed. ''[[Monster Manual|Monstrous Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The psionic variant of the grey ooze appeared in ''[[The Complete Psionics Handbook]]'' (1991). The creature was expanded on in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' Annual #4 (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jonathan M. "Ecology of the Gray Ooze: Ooze There?" Dragon Annual #4 (TSR, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The gray ooze appeared in the third edition ''Monster Manual'' (2000) under the "ooze" entry,&lt;ref&gt;[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Monte Cook]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and the version 3.5 ''Monster Manual'' (2003).

==Characteristics and habits==
Gray oozes, like most oozes, are underground dwelling, mindless scavengers who drag themselves around caves and sewers and absorb and digest whatever they find. Unlike some other oozes, it cannot move on ceilings or walls, and hence is left to slide its way along floors. The gray ooze attacks by striking like a snake until prey is either dead or unconscious, and it then moves on top of them to digest them from within. It is immune to cold and fire. The gray ooze's acidic secretions corrode metal at an alarming rate, and in addition to giving the creature a method of destroying opponent's weapons and armor, blacksmiths also sometimes use jarred gray oozes to meld ore into the right shape. Gray oozes reproduce by breaking small driplets off of themselves after a meal, which later grow into gray oozes themselves.

Gray oozes cannot speak.

They are [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Neutral|neutral]] in alignment.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:KarenAnnQuinlan.jpg|thumb|Quinlan's high school graduation photo in 1972]] --&gt;

{{Main article|Karen Ann Quinlan}}
Karen Ann Quinlan was 21 years old in 1975. After a night of drinking alcohol and ingesting [[tranquilizer]]s, Quinlan passed out and ceased breathing for two 15-minute periods. After it was determined that she was in a [[persistent vegetative state]], her father, Joseph Quinlan, wished to remove her from the [[medical ventilator]]. Quinlan's primary physician and the hospital both refused.

==Legal case==

Quinlan's father retained attorneys Paul W. Armstrong, a Morris County, New Jersey, Legal Aid attorney, and James M.

In [[physics]], '''interaction energy''' is the contribution to the total [[energy]] that is caused by an [[interaction]] between the objects being considered.

The interaction energy usually depends on the relative position of the objects. For example, &lt;math&gt;Q_1 Q_2 / (4 \pi \epsilon_0 \Delta r)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] interaction energy between two objects with charges &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Supermolecular interaction energy==
A straightforward approach for evaluating the interaction energy is to calculate the difference between the energies of isolated objects and their assembly. In the case of two objects, ''A'' and ''B'', the interaction energy can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{int} = E(A,B) - \left( E(A) + E(B) \right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;E(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E(B)&lt;/math&gt; are the energies of the isolated objects (monomers), and &lt;math&gt;E(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; the energy of their interacting assembly (dimer).

For larger system, consisting of ''N'' objects, this procedure can be generalized to provide a total many-body interaction energy:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{int} = E(A_{1}, A_{2}, .., A_{N}) - \sum_{i=1}^{N} E(A_{i})&lt;/math&gt;.

By calculating the energies for monomers, dimers, trimers, etc., in an N-object system, a complete set of two-, three-, and up to N-body interaction energies can be derived.

The supermolecular approach has an important disadvantage in that the final interaction energy is usually much smaller than the total energies from which it is calculated, and therefore contains a much larger relative uncertainty. In the case where energies are derived from quantum chemical calculations using finite atom centered basis functions, [[basis set superposition error]]s can also contribute some degree of artificial stabilisation.

'''Intersubband transitions''' are [[dipole]] and are allowed optical [[Excited state|excitation]]s between the [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] [[electron]]ic [[energy level]]s within the [[conduction band]] of [[semiconductor]] [[heterostructure]]s.
Intersubband transitions when coupled with an [[optical resonator]] form new, mixed-state [[photons]]. This mixing is referred to as an 'intersubband cavity-polariton'.
These transitions exhibit an [[Avoided crossing|anticrossing]] in energy with a separation known as '[[Vacuum Rabi oscillation|vacuum-Rabi splitting]]', similar to [[level repulsion]] in [[atomic physics]].

'''Joseph Howell Flournoy''', known as '''J. Howell Flournoy''' (October 21, 1891 &amp;ndash; December 14, 1966), was the [[sheriff]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]] based in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] in northwestern [[Louisiana]], from 1940 until his death in office. His 26-year tenure as the Caddo Parish sheriff has yet to be surpassed.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caddohistory.com/historical_facts.html|title=Historical Facts|publisher=caddohistory.com|accessdate=December 31, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708111426/http://www.caddohistory.com/historical_facts.html|archivedate=July 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A native of [[Greenwood, Louisiana|Greenwood]] in southwestern Caddo Parish,&lt;ref name=lahist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site23.php|title=Flournoy, J. Howell|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (lahistory.org)|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flournoy was the son of James Patteson "Pat" Flournoy, Sr., the Caddo Parish sheriff from 1906–1916, who had previously been the Shreveport municipal auditor, parish tax assessor, and [[coroner]], at a time when medical examiners in Louisiana need not have been physicians.&lt;ref name=cpso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caddohistory.com/caddo_sheriff_template_page_4.html|title=The Beginnings of the Modern Sheriff's Office|publisher=caddohistory.com|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flournoy was the paternal grandson of 19th century Sheriff Alonzo Flournoy.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Flournoy was educated in [[State school|public schools]] in Shreveport and thereafter attended an unnamed business college. A [[Louisiana National Guard]]sman, Flournoy was a [[United States Army]] veteran of [[World War I]], with assignment on the Mexican border.  He was also as an instructor in a machine gun school at Camp Hancock, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and was commissioned a lieutenant.&lt;ref name=sjobit&gt;"Sheriff 26 Years – J. H. Flournoy Dies," ''[[Shreveport Journal]]'', December 14, 1966, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public career==

At seventeen, Flournoy became a deputy in the Caddo Parish sheriff's department, a position that he held from 1913–1928. He was hence a deputy under his father from 1913 to 1916, as were two of his brothers, James Flournoy, Jr., and George A. Flournoy.&lt;ref name=cpso/&gt; From 1928 to 1940, J. Howell Flournoy was a deputy Caddo Parish tax collector. In 1940, Flournoy was elected sheriff to succeed [[Thomas Roland Hughes]] in the same political cycle which brought [[Sam Houston Jones]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] to the [[governor of Louisiana|governorship]]. Hughes, known for his arrest of the controversial [[Blues music|blues]] musician [[Lead Belly]], had succeeded J. Pat Flournoy as sheriff in 1916. As sheriff, J. Howell Flournoy in 1940 organized the Caddo Parish [[Selective Service]] board and trained an internal security group in Shreveport during [[World War II]]. He spearheaded a measure to establish a pension and relief fund for sheriff's department employees.&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt; From 1950 until his death, except for one year, Flournoy headed the Louisiana Sheriff's Pension and Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt;

Flournoy often received commendations for his work in law enforcement from [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. The defunct ''[[Shreveport Journal]]'' afternoon newspaper referred to Flournoy, accordingly, "A well-known [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] and a spokesman for patriotism, Sheriff Flournoy spent his entire adult life striving to improve his department in all fields of duty and speaking out against anything or any group which he felt posed a threat to [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]. The sheriff and his department, ranked among the best and were often copied by other similar law agencies . . . he was also recognized for his well-known work with youth, including his Junior Rifle Program, nationally acclaimed.&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffersonian.name/g1962/G0962.pdf|title=Junior Rifle Clubs – Action, not Words|publisher=''[[Guns (magazine)|Guns]]'' magazine|date=September 1962|author=Robert Dyment|pages=31, 48|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flournoy was originally a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]ist though he hired the first African American deputies in Caddo Parish. When [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[William M. Rainach]] of [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]] telephoned Flournoy to inform him that one of the African-American deputies had spoken in support of [[racial integration]], Flournoy dismissed the man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnQbw5EyPREC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=J.+Howell+Flournoy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=feGoW9zTyn&amp;sig=Bp0uSNYW1RjhvBQUrnkQ2J6PNjM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mikeTYPTLcL58Ab16PyaDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=J.%20Howell%20Flournoy&amp;f=false|title=Adam Fairclough, Race and Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915–1972|publisher=[[Athens, Georgia]]: [[University of Georgia Press]], 2nd ed., 1995, {{ISBN|0-8203-3114-7}}|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Flournoy, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], broke party lines to endorse the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[U.S. president|presidential]] nominee, then [[U.S. Senator]] [[Barry M. Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]]. Joining Flournoy in support of Goldwater, who spoke in Shreveport on September 17, were former Governors [[Sam H. Jones|Sam Jones]] and [[Robert F. Kennon]], State Senator [[Jackson B. Davis]] of Shreveport, Louisiana Secretary of State [[Wade O. Martin, Jr.]], [[Lieutenant Governors of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Taddy Aycock|C. C. "Taddy" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]] in [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]], and the then mayor of Monroe, [[W. L. "Jack" Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shreveport Journal,'' September 17, 1964 (afternoon paper), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Flournoy hired [[Harold M. Terry]] (1925-2016) as a deputy, later the manager of the Junior Rifle Program and an expert [[marksman]]. Terry himself was sheriff from 1976 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oralhistory.ws/tpl/index3.php?view=profile&amp;client=5031 |title=Harold M.

In 1952, Flournoy hired [[George W. D'Artois]] as a deputy sheriff, a post he held for nine years. D'Artois stepped down in 1962 to run successfully for Shreveport public service commissioner, a position abolished in 1978 under the [[mayor-council]] [[Municipal charter|city charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvpN1t9TMrgC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=George+Wendell+D'Artois&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FLoGsv9uIL&amp;sig=M4vFHkw4ijLolZvKDlHRFDjmACg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w0-XU5b6FuqH8AHr-YCoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Wendell%20D'Artois&amp;f=false|title=Bill Keith, The Commissioner: A True Story of Deceit, Dishonor, and Death|publisher=[[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2009, pp. 80–89; {{ISBN|9781-58980-655-9}}|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

In 1965, Flournoy was named the "Outstanding Conservative of the Year" by the Americanism Forum of Shreveport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.lsus.edu/libarchives/tags.php?tag=1999|title=Flournoy, Sheriff J. Howell|publisher=scripts.lsus.edu|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received other honors from the Progressive Men's Club and the American Society of Safety Engineers. Flournoy was affiliated with the [[American Legion]], [[Lions International]], [[Chamber of Commerce]], [[Order of the Eastern Star]], the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[Masonic lodge]], and the [[Shriners]], a group which in the late 1920s located one of its children's hospital in Shreveport. He was president of the Caddo Rifle and Pistol Club from 1956 until his death. He was the first marshal of the Holiday in Dixie festival held each April in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt;

Flournoy was married to the former Mary Bridges, a native of [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]] near [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], who moved to Shreveport with her family in 1913.&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt; The Flournoys had one daughter,&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; Georgia Lou Flournoy Hodgson, who was living in [[Kuwait]] at the time of her father's death.&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt;

Flournoy was a member of the First [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|First Presbyterian Church]] of Shreveport until he helped to organize and then became an elder in the newer Broadmoor Presbyterian Church in the Broadmoor neighborhood of Shreveport.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt; He resided at 180 Preston Avenue in Broadmoor.&lt;ref&gt;William McCleary, "The Broadmoor Neighborhood: One of Shreveport's Older Communities", ''[[North Louisiana History]]'', Vol. XLII (Winter-Spring 2011), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Flournoy died at Schumpert Hospital in Shreveport of [[cardiovascular disease]] at the age of seventy-five.&lt;ref name=lahist/&gt;&lt;ref name=sjobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' uses material for its sketch of Sheriff Flournoy from scrapbooks in the archives at [[Louisiana State University in Shreveport]], which opened the year after Flournoy died.&lt;/ref&gt; Flournoy and his wife are interred at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=stobit&gt;Flournoy obituary, ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', December 15, 1966, p. 9-A&lt;/ref&gt;

Flournoy had announced two months before his death that he would not seek reelection in 1967. He endorsed as his preferred successor his chief deputy, [[James M. Goslin]], a Democrat originally from [[Calhoun, Louisiana|Calhoun]] in western [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]] who was reared in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] in north Louisiana.&lt;ref name=stobit/&gt; As chief deputy, Goslin served the remainder of Flournoy's term and was then elected sheriff outright in 1967 and again in 1971.

The '''Japanese punitive expedition to Taiwan in 1874''', referred to in Japan as the {{nihongo|'''Taiwan Expedition'''|台湾出兵|Taiwan Shuppei|lead=yes}} and in Taiwan and mainland China as the '''Mudan incident''' ({{zh|c=牡丹社事件}}), was a [[punitive expedition]] launched by the Japanese in retaliation for the murder of 54 [[Ryūkyū Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] sailors by [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aborigines near the southwestern tip of [[Taiwan]] in December 1871. The success of the expedition, which marked the first overseas deployment of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], revealed the fragility of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s hold on Taiwan and encouraged further Japanese adventurism.  Diplomatically, Japan's embroilment with China in 1874 was eventually resolved by a British arbitration under which Qing China agreed to compensate Japan for property damage. Some ambiguous wording in the agreed terms were later argued by Japan to be confirmation of Chinese renunciation of suzerainty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]], paving the way for ''de facto'' Japanese incorporation of Ryukyu in 1879.

==Background==
{{main article|Mudan Incident of 1871}}
In December 1871 a [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuan]] vessel was shipwrecked near the southern tip of Taiwan.  Fifty-four members of its crew of 66 were beheaded by the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aborigines. The remaining 12 crewmen were rescued by [[Han Chinese]] and were transferred to [[Tainan]] in southern Taiwan. The [[Taiwan under Qing rule|local Qing Chinese government]] officials transferred them to [[Fujian]] province in mainland China. From there, the [[Qing]] government arranged to send them back home.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=123}}

===Diplomacy===
When Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that the "wild"/"unsubjugated" aboriginals ({{zh|t=臺灣生番|p=Táiwān shēngfān}}) were outside its jurisdiction. This open renunciation of sovereignty led to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874 by the Japanese.

The [[Meiji government]] of Japan demanded that the Qing government of China punish leaders of the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] responsible for the murders of the Ryukyuan crew. The Japanese foreign minister [[Soejima Taneomi]] went to [[Beijing]] in June 1873, and was received in an audience by the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (in itself a diplomatic triumph); however, his request for compensation was first rejected because China considered it an internal affair since Taiwan was part of Fujian Province of China and the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] had a tributary relationship with China. When Soejima Taneomi claimed four of the victims murdered were from Oda Prefecture, present-day [[Okayama]] Prefecture, Japan and asked for compensation again, Chinese officials refused him on the grounds that most of the [[Taiwanese aboriginals]] were outside effective Chinese control, and were thus sometimes exempt from judicial action. [[Charles Le Gendre]], the French-born [[United States|American]] [[military advisor]] to the Japanese government, as well as [[Gustave Emile Boissonade]], legal advisor, urged that Japan take the matter into its own hands.

==Expedition==
[[File:Japanese Ironclad warship Ryujo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Japanese battleship Ryūjō (1864)|''Ryūjō'']] was the flagship of the Taiwan expedition.]]
[[File:Battle of Stonegate.jpg|thumb|right|The battle of Stone Gate, against the "Botan" aborigines, was the most serious encounter of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=James Huffman (historian)|last1=Huffman|first1=James L.|title=A Yankee in Meiji Japan|date=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742526211|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WngYfDz1pAMC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22Battle+of+Stone+gate%22&amp;sig=guaCIhA8Ik9ic8HVQKnOoIiUmWo&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Battle%20of%20Stone%20gate%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Japanese government agreed, and sent an expedition of 3,600 soldiers led by [[Saigō Tsugumichi]] in May 1874. The Japanese won a decisive victory at the Battle of Stone Gate on 22 May.  Thirty Taiwan tribesmen were either killed or mortally wounded in the battle, and a considerably greater number wounded.  Japanese casualties were 6 killed and 30 wounded.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=145–6}}

In November 1874 the Japanese forces withdrew from Taiwan after the Qing government agreed to an indemnity of 500,000 Kuping [[tael]]s, or about {{convert|18.7|t|ozt}} silver. [[Harry Smith Parkes|Sir Harry Parkes]], the British minister to Japan, characterised this transaction as "China's willingness to pay to be invaded".

== Aftermath ==
In 1875, the Qing authorities unsuccessfully attempted to bring the southeast coastal region of Taiwan under their control, despatching a column of 300 soldiers against the Paiwan.  The Chinese troops were ambushed and routed by the Paiwan and their well-armed fighters.  250 Chinese soldiers were killed, and the 50 survivors retreated to Takow ([[Kaohsiung]]).{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=168–9}}

==Legacy==
Although launched ostensibly to punish the local tribesmen for their murder of 54 Ryukyuan merchants, the 1874 punitive expedition to Taiwan served a number of purposes for Japan's new Meiji government. Japan had for some time begun claiming suzerainty, and later sovereignty, over the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], whose traditional suzerain had been China. The expedition demonstrated that China was not in effective control of Taiwan, let alone the Ryukyu Islands. Japan was emboldened to more forcefully assert its claim to speak for the Ryukyuan islanders. The settlement in 1874, brokered by the British, included a reference to Chinese recognition that the Japanese expedition was "in protection of civilians", a reference that Japan later pointed towards as Chinese renunciation of its rights over Ryukyu. In 1879 Japan referred the dispute to British arbitration, and the British confirmed Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyus, a result which was not recognised by China.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=359–360}} Nevertheless, Japan used this as the justification for taking ''de facto'' control over Ryukyu, moving the king of Ryukyu to Japan and incorporating Ryukyu as a prefecture of Japan. The ensuing Chinese protest led to the matter being submitted to US President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as arbitrator, during which Japan offered to split Ryukyu between Japan and China. This was refused by China, but a weakened China was unable in practice to stop the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands|Japanese annexation of the Ryukyus]].

The surrendering aborigines were given Japanese flags to fly over their villages that they viewed as a symbol of peace with Japan and protection from rival tribes, however, the Japanese viewed them as a symbol of jurisdiction over the aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.2/ah0202000388.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212014547/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.2/ah0202000388.html |archivedate=2010-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expedition also served as a useful rehearsal for future [[Japanese Invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese imperial ambitions]]. Taiwan was already being viewed as a potential Japanese colony in some circles in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eskildsen | first =  Robert | year = 2002

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the action also mollified those within the Meiji government who were pushing for a more aggressive foreign policy, and who were enraged by the government's refusal in 1873 to attack [[Korea]]. It is significant that the expedition took place shortly after the [[Saga Rebellion]], and was led by [[Saigō Tsugumichi|Saigō Jūdō]] ([[Saigō Takamori]]'s younger brother) and consisted largely of former [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] and [[Saga Domain|Saga]] ''samurai''.

More generally, the Japanese incursion into Taiwan in 1874 and the feeble Chinese response was a blatant revelation of Chinese weakness and an invitation to further foreign encroachment in Taiwan.  In particular, the success of the Japanese incursion was among the factors influencing the French decision to [[Keelung Campaign|invade Taiwan]] in October 1884, during the [[Sino-French War]].  The Qing court belatedly attempted to strengthen its hold on Taiwan, and the Chinese imperial commissioner [[Shen Baozhen|Shen Pao-chen]] made some improvements to the island's coastal defences during the second half of the 1870s.  Further substantial improvements were made by the Chinese governor [[Liu Mingchuan|Liu Ming-ch'uan]] in the 1880s, in the wake of the [[Keelung Campaign|French capture of Keelung]] during the [[Sino-French War]].  However, little was done to improve the poor quality of the Qing garrison of Taiwan, and both the French in 1884 and the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese in 1895]] were able to land successfully in Taiwan.

The '''Jordan Brown case''' involves Jordan Brown (born August 30th, 1997), who was initially charged at 11 as an adult in the fatal shooting of his father's fiancée, Kenzie Marie Houk, 26, in [[New Beaver, Pennsylvania]], which occurred on the morning of February 20, 2009. Jordan was interviewed by [[Pennsylvania State Police]] twice that day and arrested before sunrise the next morning. The [[Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Lawrence County]] [[District Attorney]]'s Office initially filed the charges in adult court because that is required in Pennsylvania [[homicide]] cases, regardless of a defendant's age. The  [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]]'s Office then took over prosecution of the case. After Brown had spent more than three years in a juvenile detention facility in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], while Pennsylvania courts deliberated his status, Brown was tried as a juvenile and found guilty of being delinquent by a judge on April 13, 2012. 

On May 8, 2013, the Superior Court vacated the finding of delinquency, citing "palpable abuse of discretion" and sent the case back to juvenile court.

Brown could have faced a [[life sentence]] without parole if he had been tried and convicted for murder as an adult, but he faced custody in a secure [[juvenile detention center]] until he reached the age of 21 because he was only 11 when the crime occurred. He was granted transfer of his case into the [[American juvenile justice system|juvenile court system]].

==Incident==
Kenzie Houk was eight months pregnant when she was shot in the back of the head while she was sleeping in bed in their western Pennsylvania farmhouse. Both she and her unborn son died as a result of the attack. Houk's 4-year-old daughter alerted nearby tree cutters roughly 45 minutes after Jordan Brown and Houk's 7-year-old daughter got on a school bus. The state Attorney General prosecutor asserted that Houk was killed by a youth-model [[Harrington &amp; Richardson]] [[20-gauge]] [[shotgun]], an Easter gift to Jordan from his father. Pennsylvania State Police found a spent [[shotgun shell]] near the path Brown walked with Houk's older daughter to get to their school bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/judge-declares-jordan-brown-guilty-of-murder/article_d6092175-2455-55b6-b3ca-bbd9a91cedd9.html | title = Judge declares Jordan Brown guilty of murder | publisher = [[Beaver County Times]] | date = April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/21/jordan-brown-killed-fathe_n_168862.html | title = Authorities: Jordan Brown Killed Father's Pregnant Girlfriend; 11-Year-Old Charged As Adult | publisher = [[Huffington Post]] | date = January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was arrested subsequently.

==Controversy==
The human-rights organization [[Amnesty International]] opposed the effort to try Jordan as an adult, citing the mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole penalty as a violation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/13-year-old-us-boys-murder-trial-could-violate-international-law-2011-01-24 | title = 13-year-old US boy's murder trial could violate international law | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition signed by nearly 4,000 people protested what it termed as denial of Brown's fifth and sixth amendment rights.

On weekends Jordan hunted alongside his father, Chris Brown, who purchased the youth-sized 20-gauge shotgun that state police believed was the murder weapon. The youth's father did not publicly discuss the case, until after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exonerated his son nine years later in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Jordan Brown was initially charged as an adult. Presiding Judge [[Dominick Motto]] of the [[Lawrence County, Pennsylvania]], [[Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas|Common Pleas Court]] initially denied decertification and transfer to juvenile court because Jordan would not admit his involvement in the crime. After [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's Superior Court]] ruled that Judge Motto violated Brown's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights, Judge Motto [[recused]] himself from the case, and Judge [[John W. Hodge]] granted the decertification petition and ruled that Brown should be tried as a juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/08/23/pennsylvania.boy.double.homicide/index.html?hpt=ju_c2 |title=Boy accused in pregnant woman's death to be tried as a juvenile |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The decertification ruling transferred Brown's case from adult court to Lawrence County's family court division regularly presided over by Judge Hodge, who handled the subsequent juvenile adjudication and dispositional hearings.  

Then what became an issue was whether Brown's eventual adjudication hearing (juvenile court trial) should be opened to the public, and whether he should provisionally be released while a decision in that matter was pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/26606079/detail.html | title=Lawyer Of Boy Accused Of Murder Fights To Have Him Tried In Juvenile System | publisher=WPXI.com | date=January 25, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6CrbfynJy?url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/lawyer-of-boy-accused-of-murder-fights-to-have-him/nGcZ8/ | archivedate = December 12, 2012 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.com/bct_news/news_details/article/1373/2011/january/15/court-will-hear-jordan-brown-arguments-at-next-session-1.html | title = Court will hear Jordan Brown arguments at next session | publisher= [[Beaver County Times]] | date = January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i33XokCw7Ozdy_hoN5yDkEri-84A?docId=CNG.0974f2ca1c91adea909b6017dc4d554e.9b1 |title= 13-year-old murder suspect faces US court appeal |first=Eric |last=Lidji | publisher=''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' (AFP) |date=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/12020/1204834-54.stm |title=Jordan Brown seeks release while awaiting court decision |publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Hodge held that Brown's juvenile hearing would not be open to the public or to the news media. The Pennsylvania Superior Court rejected an appeal by three area newspapers (''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', and ''[[New Castle News]]'') to overturn Hodge's ruling and open the hearing to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12054/1212051-455.stm | title=Media denied access to boy's juvenile case in '09 killing | publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After those newspapers decided not to pursue their appeal further, Judge Hodge was directed by another panel of the Superior Court to move swiftly to hold an adjudication hearing. Judge Hodge ruled that Jordan would not be released pending that hearing.

Following three days of testimony and legal argument, Judge Hodge issued his ruling on April 13, 2012, that Brown was responsible for first degree murder in the death of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and of homicide in the death of her unborn male child. Judge Hodge adjudicated the now-15-year-old Jordan Brown to be delinquent (the juvenile court equivalent of a guilty verdict).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://news.yahoo.com/judge-pa-boy-killed-dads-pregnant-fianc-e-204920885.html | title= Judge: Pa. boy killed dad's pregnant fiancée at 11 | publisher= Associated Press | date= April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Hodge would announce Brown's disposition (the equivalent of a juvenile sentence) at a later date. Under Pennsylvania law, an adjudicated juvenile offender cannot be held in custody past his 21st birthday. Brown could be held in a juvenile rehabilitative treatment facility only until he turned 21 in August 2018.

After his February 21, 2009 arrest, Jordan was placed in the Lawrence Country Jail, a facility for adults. But authorities transferred him to a juvenile center in March 2009 after his attorneys argued that the adult jail with its three cell blocks couldn't accommodate an 11-year-old boy.

On June 13, 2016, more than seven years after his arrest, Jordan Brown was released from juvenile custody, two months before his 19th birthday. Judge Hodge put Brown on probation in the custody of an uncle who lived in Ohio, just across the border from Lawrence County.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news |url= https://news.yahoo.com/judge-pa-boy-killed-dads-pregnant-fianc-e-204920885.html |title= Court rejects Pa. teen's appeal in '09 slaying; suspect now living in Ohio |publisher= WKBN News |date= September 2, 2016 |access-date= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He was to remain on juvenile court probation until he turned 21. His lawyers continued to file appeals in order to have his juvenile conviction (adjudication) overturned. Two years later that resulted in the July 18, 2018 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling.

==Possible retrial==
On May 8, 2013, Superior Court, in the second appeal that came before it in this case, ruled that "the juvenile court committed a palpable abuse of discretion in rendering a ruling that is plainly contrary to the evidence" and vacated the juvenile court's disposition of delinquency. The ruling in particular objected to the assumption, made by the juvenile court, that no one else but Jordan could have shot Houk. 

Judge Hodge issued a juvenile court opinion on April 19, 2015, again finding that Jordan was the individual who killed Kenzie Houk and her unborn child on the morning of February 20, 2009. His disposition order was dated May 18, 2012. And again a third appeal was taken to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. In a split panel decision dated September 1, 2016, titled ''In re J.B. III'', 147 A.3d 1204 (Pa.Super. 2016) (“''In re J.B. III''”), the Superior Court affirmed the juvenile court, and rejected claims that the juvenile court had improperly reassessed the evidence and made new credibility determinations in ruling on Brown's post-dispositional motions. 

A [[certiorari]] request for review was made to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which granted an appeal to consider Brown's claims that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the adjudication of the juvenile court, and that its adjudication was against the weight of the evidence.

== Conviction overturned ==
On July 18, 2018, the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] overturned his conviction in a 5-0 decision.&lt;ref name=overturns&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The two Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices who did not participate had previously ruled in Jordan's favor on his earlier appeal while they had served as judges in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The justices attacked the evidence as insufficient and said that the juvenile trial evidence pointing to a shotgun in Brown's bedroom as the murder weapon supported an equally-reasonable conclusion that it was not the murder weapon.&lt;ref name=overturns /&gt; [[Debra Todd|Justice Debra Todd]] wrote the Court's opinion and noted, "The Commonwealth’s evidence was, therefore, insufficient as a matter of law to overcome Appellant’s presumption of innocence, and the juvenile court’s adjudication of his delinquency for these serious crimes must be reversed."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Joseph James Nechvatal''' (born 15 January 1951)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-artists.org/artist/joseph-nechvatal|title=Joseph Nechvatal - the artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[post-conceptual]] [[digital artist]] and [[Aesthetics|art theoretician]] who creates computer-assisted paintings and [[computer animation]]s, often using custom-created [[computer virus]]es.

==Life and work==
[[File:BOtv2002.jpg|thumb|260px|Joseph Nechvatal ''birth Of the viractual'' 2001 computer-robotic assisted acrylic on canvas]]

Joseph Nechvatal was born in [[Chicago]]. He studied fine art and [[philosophy]] at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[Cornell University]] and [[Columbia University]], where he studied with [[Arthur Danto]] while serving as the [[archivist]] to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[La Monte Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/03/books/flawed-composition|title=BIOGRAPHY Flawed Composition - The Brooklyn Rail|author=Joseph Nechvatal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979, he exhibited his work in [[New York City]], primarily at [[Galerie Richard]], Brooke Alexander Gallery and [[Universal Concepts Unlimited]]. He has also solo exhibited in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-in-berlin.de/ausstellungs-text.php?id=11027 ART LABORATORY BERLIN ''bOdy pandemOnium. Immersion into Noise'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paris]], [[Chicago]], [[Cologne]], [[Atlanta]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Aalst, Belgium]], [[Youngstown]], [[Senouillac]], [[Lund]], [[Toulouse]], [[Turin]], [[Arles]] and [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="Joseph Nechvatal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/joseph-nechvatal/biography-links|title=Joseph Nechvatal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work in the early 1980s chiefly consisted of [[postminimalist]] gray graphite drawings that were often photomechanically enlarged.&lt;ref&gt;Milazzo &amp; Collins 1990, pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; During that period he was associated with the artist group [[Colab]] and helped establish the non-profit cultural space [[ABC No Rio]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moore and Marc Miller, eds. ''ABC No Rio Dinero: The Story of a Lower East Side Art Gallery'' New York: ABC No Rio with Collaborative Projects, 1985 with Joseph Nechvatal drawing on cover.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-book.php  ''ABC No Rio Dinero: The Story of a Lower East Side Art Gallery'' with Joseph Nechvatal drawing on cover]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he co-founded the [[avant-garde]] [[electronic art music]] audio project [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormick 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Nechvatal began work on an opera called ''[[XS: The Opera Opus]]'' (1984-6)&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhys Chatham]], ''Die Donnergötter'' (LP, CD), Table of the Elements/Radium 2006, CD Book, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[no wave]] musical composer [[Rhys Chatham]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp 1984, pp. 52-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began using computers to make "paintings" in 1986 &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nechvatal, ''Selected Writings''. Paris: Editions Antoine Candau, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and later, in his signature work, began to employ [[computer viruses]]. These "collaborations" with viral systems positioned his work as an early contribution to what is increasingly referred to as a [[post-human]] aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Popper 2007, pp. 120-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieser, Wolf. ''Digital Art''. Langenscheidt: h.f. ullmann. 2009 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991–1993 he was artist-in-residence at the [[Louis Pasteur]] [[wikt:Atelier|Atelier]] in [[Arbois]], France and at the [[La Saline Royale|Saline Royale]]/[[Claude Nicholas Ledoux|Ledoux]] Foundation's computer lab.There he worked on ''The Computer Virus Project'', which was an artistic experiment with [[computer viruses]] and computer [[animation]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 2006, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited at [[Documenta]] 8 in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Documenta GmbH., Museum Fridericianum Veranstaltungs GmbH, ''Volume 3 de Documenta 8: Kassel'' 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nechvatal, J. 1987. ''Theoretical Statement Concerning Computer Robotic Paintings'', Documenta 8 Catalogue, Vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Nechvatal obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in the philosophy of art and new technology concerning [[immersive virtual reality]] at [[Roy Ascott]]'s Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA), University of Wales College, Newport, UK (now the [[Planetary Collegium]] at the [[University of Plymouth]]). There he developed his concept of '''viractualism''', a [[conceptual art]] idea that strives "to create an interface between the biological and the technological."&lt;ref name="Paul 2006, pp. 57-58"&gt;Paul 2006, pp. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nechvatal, this is a new topological space.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Nechvatal, ''Towards an Immersive Intelligence: Essays on the Work of Art in the Age of Computer Technology and Virtual Reality  (1993-2006)''. Edgewise Press. New York, N.Y. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he extended his experimentation into viral [[artificial life]] through a collaboration with the programmer Stephane Sikora of music2eye in a work called the ''Computer Virus Project II'',&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2004, pp. 331-336 &amp; 485-486.&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the [[a-life]] work of [[John Horton Conway]] (particularly [[Conway's Game of Life]]), by the general [[cellular automata]] work of [[John von Neumann]], by the [[genetic programming]] [[algorithm]]s of [[John Koza]] and the [[auto-destructive art]] of [[Gustav Metzger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Metzger.html|title=Gustav Metzger (1926-)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he exhibited ''Computer Virus Project II'' works ([[digital painting]]s, [[digital print]]s, a [[digital audio]] installation and two ''live'' electronic virus-attack [[art installation]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|up29Rc-ksfM|Video on Joseph Nechvatal's Computer Virus Project 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a solo show called ''cOntaminatiOns'' at [[Château de Linardié]] in [[Senouillac]], France. In 2006 Nechvatal received a retrospective exhibition entitled ''Contaminations'' at the [[Butler Institute of American Art]]'s Beecher Center for Arts and Technology.&lt;ref name="Joseph Nechvatal"/&gt;

Dr. Nechvatal has also contributed to [[digital audio]] work with his [[noise music]] ''[[viral symphOny]]'', a collaborative sound symphony created by using his computer virus software at the Institute for Electronic Arts at [[Alfred University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.alfred.edu/iea/?page_id=159|title=Artist in Residence Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonhors.free.fr/kronik/Joseph_Nechvatal_viral_symphony.htm|title=Joseph Nechvatal :: Viral symphony :: IEA :: 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''viral symphOny'' was presented as a part of ''nOise anusmOs'' in New York in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Robert|title=Joseph Nechvatal: nOise anusmOs|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=June 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/06/artseen/joseph-nechvatal-noise-anusmos}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a limited edition CD recording of his sex farce poetry book ''Destroyer of Naivetés'' was released on Entr'acte label under the name of Cave Bacchus. Cave Bacchus is Nechvatal, [[Black Sifichi]] and [[Rhys Chatham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://entracte.co.uk/projects/cave-bacchus-e207-/ Cave Bacchus: Joseph Nechvatal, Black Sifichi, Rhys Chatham ''Destroyer of Naivetés'' Entr’acte CD (E207)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Nechvatal showed work in ''Noise'', an official collateral show of the ''55th [[Venice Biennale]] of Art'', that was based on his book ''Immersion Into Noise''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dearteassociazione.org/www.dearteassociazione.org/Testo_Catalogo_NOISE.html De Arte Association press statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 to 2013, Nechvatal taught art theories of [[immersive virtual reality]] and the viractual at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York City (SVA). A book of his collected essays entitled ''Towards an Immersive Intelligence: Essays on the Work of Art in the Age of Computer Technology and Virtual Reality  (1993–2006)'' was published by Edgewise Press in 2009. Also in 2009, his book ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Nechvatal. J. ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances'', [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]] (July 7, 2009) {{ISBN|3-8383-0445-4}} / {{ISBN|978-3-8383-0445-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, his book ''Immersion Into Noise'' was published by [[Open Humanities Press]] in conjunction with the [[University of Michigan]] Library's Scholarly Publishing Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ohp;idno=9618970.0001.001''Immersion Into Noise''] published by Open Humanities Press in conjunction with the [[University of Michigan]] Library's Scholarly Publishing Office. Ann Arbor. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he published (as editor) a book and CD/cassette tape with Punctum Books and Punctum Records on the [[noise music]] artist [[Minóy]] and in 2015 he published with Punctum Books a collection of his farcical erotic poetry entitled ''Destroyer of Naivetés''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://punctumbooks.com/category/titles/joseph-nechvatal/] Nechvatal's author page at Punctum Books&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, Nechvatal has regularly been publishing his [[art criticism]] as the Paris correspondent for [[Hyperallergic]] blogazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/about/ [[Hyperallergic]] Regular Contributors: Joseph Nechvatal (Paris correspondent)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|in the artist/theorist tradition of [[Robert Smithson]], Joseph Nechvatal is a pioneer in the field of digital image making who challenges our perceptions of nature by altering conventional notions of space and time, gender, and self. ...

===Viractualism===
'''Viractualism''' is an [[art theory]] concept developed by Nechvatal in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Paul, in her seminal book ''Digital Art'', discusses Nechvatal's concept of viractualism on page 58. One of the images she chooses to illustrate that section of the book is Nechvatal's painting entitled ''the birth Of the viractual'' (2001). Joe Lewis, in the March 2003 issue of [[Art in America]] (pp.123-124), discusses the viractual in his review ''Joseph Nechvatal at Universal Concepts Unlimited''.  John Reed in [[Artforum]] ''Web 3-2004 Critic's Picks'' discusses the concept in his piece ''#1 Joseph Nechvatal''. [[Frank Popper]] also writes about the viractual concept in his book ''From Technological to Virtual Art'' on page 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scan.net.au"&gt;[http://scan.net.au/scan/magazine/display.php?journal_id=56] ''Our Digital Noology: [[Catherine Perret]] in conversation with Joseph Nechvatal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viractualism is a [[conceptual art]] concept that indicates and initiates communions of the protoplasmic mass to [[Virtuality|virtual]] spatial conditions. [[Roy Ascott]], in his essay "The Architecture of Cyberception"*, has said, "... to inhabit both the real and virtual worlds at one and the same time, and to be both here and potentially everywhere else at the same time is giving us a new sense of self, new ways of thinking and perceiving which extend what we have believed to be our natural, genetic capabilities."  Ascott, R. 1994. "The Architecture of Cyberception" In Leonardo Electronic Almanac, Vol. 2, No. 8, [[MIT Press]] Journals, August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=330|title=CTheory.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from the Ph.D. research &lt;ref&gt;The title of the Ph.D. dissertation is "Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances : A Study of the Affinity Between Artistic Ideologies Based in Virtual Reality and Previous Immersive Idioms". A url introduction to the thesis, entitled "Frame and Excess", can be read on-line and the entire thesis downloaded in PDF at: [http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/ideals.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Nechvatal conducted in the philosophy of art and new technology concerning [[immersive virtual reality]] at [[Roy Ascott]]'s Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA), University of Wales College, Newport, UK (now the [[Planetary Collegium]] at the [[University of Plymouth]]). There he developed his concept of the '''viractual''', which strives to create an interface between the biological and the virtual.&lt;ref name="Paul 2006, pp. 57-58"/&gt; It is central to Nechvatal's work as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|NSyN_wlvA0g|Joseph Nechvatal 2009 Video Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thefishpond.in/himanshudamle/2009/viral-art/ Viral Art: consciousness in concurrency with mutation&lt;/ref&gt;

Nechvatal suggests that viractualism may be an entrainment/égréore conception helpful in defining our now third-fused inter-spatiality which is forged from the meeting of the virtual and the actual.&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt; - a concept close to the military's [[augmented reality]], which is the use of transparent displays worn as see-through glasses on which computer data is projected and layered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/ideals.htm Nechvatal's Ph.D. dissertation ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances: A Study of the Affinity Between Artistic Ideologies Based in Virtual Reality  and Previous Immersive Idioms'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the viractual span of liminality in viractualism, Nechvatal refers to two very different, yet complimentary, concepts: entrainment and égréore.[[Entrainment (physics)|Entrainment]], in electro-physics, is the coupling of two or more [[oscillator]]s as they lock into a commonly sensed interacting frequency. In [[alchemical]] terms an égréore (an old form of the word agréger) is a third concept or phenomenon which is established from conjoining two different elements together.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of the viractual conception is that virtual producing [[computer technology]] has become a noteworthy means for making and understanding [[contemporary art]] and that this brings artists to a place where one finds the emerging of the computed (the virtual) with the uncomputed corporeal (the actual).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nechvatal, "Towards an Immersive Intelligence: Essays on the Work of Art in the Age of Computer Technology and Virtual Reality (1993-2006)". Edgewise Press. 2009. pp. 53-58&lt;/ref&gt; This amalgamate - which tends to contradict some central techno clichés of our time - is what Nechvatal calls '''the viractual'''.&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt;
[[Digitization]] is a key [[metaphor]] for viractuality in the sense that it is the elementary translating procedure today. Nechvatal thinks that in every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the art practice away from conformisms that are about to overcome it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/oberlin.html] Paper read at [[Oberlin College]] in application for The Henry Luce Professorship in the Emerging Arts Position (2000) titled ''The Emerging Arts Lecture at Oberlin''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beehive.temporalimage.com/content_apps52/app_b.html] ''Viractualism defined at BeeHive'' Volume 5 : Issue 2  (12.2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham, Marchioness of Antrim, 18th Baroness de Ros of Helmsley''' (''née'' Manners; died 1649) was an English aristocrat. The daughter and heir of [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland]], she was known as the richest woman in [[British Isles|Britain]] outside of the royal family. She married first [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], the [[favourite]], and possibly lover, of King [[James I of England]]; and secondly, she married the [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]] [[Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim (1645 creation)|Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim]].

==Family==
Lady Katherine Manners was the only daughter of [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland]], by his first wife, Frances Knyvet (d.&amp;nbsp;before 26 November 1605), widow of Sir William Bevill of Killigarth or Kilkhampton, [[Cornwall]],{{sfn|N.M.S.|1981}} and third daughter and coheir of [[Sir Henry Knyvet]] of [[Charlton, Brinkworth|Charlton, Wiltshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/knyvet-henry-1537-98 Knyvet, Henry (c.1537-98), of Charlton, Wiltshire, History of Parliament]; retrieved 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; by Elizabeth Stumpe, the daughter of [[James Stumpe|Sir James Stumpe]] of [[Bromham, Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1949|p=262}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/stumpe-sir-james-1519-63 Stumpe, Sir James (by 1519-63), of Malmesbury and Bromham, Wiltshire, History of Parliament]; retrieved 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Katherine Manners was selected by   the formidably ambitious [[Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham]], to marry her son, George Villiers.  However, Manners was a strict [[Roman Catholic]], and the King refused to allow Villiers to marry her (almost the only occasion when he did not give the Villiers family whatever they asked for). In addition to this, the Earl of Rutland refused to accept the Countess of Buckingham’s demands for his daughter’s dowry. Manners converted to [[Protestantism]], to satisfy the Villiers family, which almost caused her father to call off the marriage.  Invited to visit the Countess of Buckingham, Katherine was forced to spend the night due to an attack of illness.  Believing his daughter’s honor to be compromised, the Earl of Rutland refused to receive her back, and demanded that George Villiers marry her immediately.  At this Villiers refused to marry her, but did a few weeks later, on 16 May 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Manners, Francis |volume=36 |pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duchess of Buckingham was one of the few women of rank of the time whose gentleness and womanly tenderness, devotion and purity of life, were conspicuous in the midst of the almost universal corruption and immorality of the Court. No scandal was ever breathed against her name, and the worst that was ever said of her was that by her influence she at one time nearly persuaded her husband to become a Roman Catholic, she herself having returned to her own faith soon after her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=William H. |first=Shaw |year=1882 |title=George Villiers, First Duke of Buckingham |publisher=B. H. Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the mother of [[Mary Villiers, Duchess of Richmond]] and of [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] (who inherited her title as 20th [[Baron de Ros]]). Katherine's first husband, Buckingham, was murdered in 1628 by [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]]. Upon the death of her father in 1632, without male heirs, she succeeded [[suo jure]] to the ancient barony of [[Baron de Ros|de Ros]]. In 1635 she married [[Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim (1645 creation)|Randal McDonnell, Earl of Antrim]], and went to live at [[Dunluce Castle]], [[County Antrim]], [[Ireland]]. Following the Catholic uprising in Ulster in 1641 the MacDonnell family moved south to [[Wexford]], then [[Waterford]], where Katherine died in 1649.

[[Image:Károly Bebo1.gif|thumb|right|Bebo's 1749 180cm sculpture of [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] at St. Michael Parish Church, in [[Mogyoród]]]]
'''Károly Bebo''' (c. 1712 &amp;ndash; April 1779) was an 18th-century [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[sculptor]], builder and decorator noted for his [[stucco]] work.

Bebo worked as steward at the Óbuda estate in the service of the Counts Zichy, and around 1740 worked in decoration and furnishing as a Rococo decorator with innovative ideas. His sculpture received much praise, most notably his work on the gold and white [[pulpit]] of the [[Jesuit]] church at [[Székesfehérvár]] in 1749 and his extensive wood carving at the parish church in [[Óbuda]] which he accomplished between 1748 and 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hungart.euroweb.hu/english/b/bebo/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511104948/http://hungart.euroweb.hu/english/b/bebo/index.html |archivedate=2006-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749 he was also able to model a 180&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft 10 in) sculpture of St. Michael at St. Michael Parish Church, in Mogyoród. Between 1759-62 he completed a carving of the altar at Kiscell's Trinitarian church. Toward his last years from 1771 he created the memorable stucco sculptures to represent The Presentation of Mary in the Temple on the altar of St. Anne's church in [[Buda]]. He died in [[Óbuda]] in 1779.

'''Mari Beylerian''' ({{lang-hy|Մառի Պեյլերեան}}; 1877, [[Constantinople]] &amp;ndash; 1915) was an [[Armenia]]n feminist activist, writer and public figure and a victim of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref name=rowe&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge Scholars Press| isbn = 978-1-904303-23-7| last = Rowe| first = Victoria| title = A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880-1922| date = 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvE4Ec-_oEC&amp;pg=PA135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
She finished the Esayan college of [[Constantinople]], then studied at the studio of Bera. She contributed to different journals included "Arevelk" and "[[Hunchak]]". Facing arrest for her participation in the 1895 Bab Ali demonstrations, Beylerian was forced to flee to Egypt from her native [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=rowe /&gt;

During her time in Alexandria she taught at a local Armenian school and between 1902-1903 she published the ''[[Artemis (journal)|Artemis]]'' Armenian women's journal. Beylerian accepted submissions not only from famous writers but from [[Armenian women]] throughout the [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora]]. She was especially interested in the role Armenian women would play in the development of [[national identity]]. Editorals authored by Beylerian explored several [[women's rights]] themes, including [[motherhood]]. She believed women's education and employment were central to Armenian national development.&lt;ref name=rowe /&gt;

Beylerian returned to Constantinople only after the [[Ottoman Constitution of 1908]] was put in place following the [[Young Turk Revolution]]. She continued to work as a teacher in [[Smyrna]] and [[Tokat]] until 1915 when she lost her life in Armenian genocide.&lt;ref name=rowe /&gt;

Much of the study of [[meme]]s focuses on groups of memes called '''meme complexes''', or '''memeplexes'''. Like the [[gene complex]]es found in biology, memeplexes are groups of memes that are often found present in the same individual. Applying the theory of [[Universal Darwinism]], memeplexes group together because memes will copy themselves more successfully when they are "teamed up". Examples include sets of memes like singing and guitar playing, or the [[Christmas tree]] and [[Christmas dinner]].

Unlike inherited gene complexes, memeplexes do not have to benefit the individuals expressing them in order to replicate. Rather, because memes and memeplexes replicate virally (i.e., by horizontal transmission), they can be beneficial, inconsequential, or pathogenic to their carriers -- memes and memeplexes do not have to be true or useful to replicate.

Philosopher [[Daniel C. Dennett]], evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and consciousness researcher [[Susan Blackmore]] (author of ''[[The Meme Machine]]'') are proponents of [[memetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes.html|title=Dan Dennett: Dangerous memes - TED Talk - TED.com|author=Dan Dennett|work=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/article,3001,QampA-with-Richard-Dawkins-after-lecture-at-UC-Berkeley,RichardDawkinsnet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822192817/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C3001%2CQampA-with-Richard-Dawkins-after-lecture-at-UC-Berkeley%2CRichardDawkinsnet |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monster Rancher Advance''''' (known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm Advance'''''|モンスターファーム アドバンス|Monsutā Fāmu Adobansu}}) is the first of the ''[[Monster Rancher]]'' games to be released on [[Game Boy Advance]].

==Gameplay==
Similar to the other Monster Rancher games, gameplay revolves around creating, raising, and fighting monsters. Due to the Game Boy Advance's limitations, players do not generate monsters by inserting disks into the console, but typing characters. Players can also create new monsters by combining 2 existing ones, just like the [[PlayStation]] versions. One of the differences between this and earlier Monster Ranchers is that Dino has been replaced with Zumms, as well as several species, such as Monols, having been omitted.

'''José Campos Torres''' (December 20, 1953 &amp;ndash; May 5, 1977) was a 23-year-old [[Mexican-American]] and [[Vietnam veteran]] who was ruthlessly beaten by several [[White people|White]] [[Houston Police Department]] (HPD) officers that subsequently led to his death. He was [[assault]]ed by a group of on-duty police officers after being arrested for [[Disorderly conduct#United States|disorderly conduct]] at a bar in Houston's Mexican-American [[East End, Houston|East End]] neighborhood. The officers [[conviction|convicted]] for the death of Torres, at the state level, received minimal sentencing; 1 year [[probation]] and a $1 fine. Torres' murder and sentencing sparked community outrage and lead to multiple community [[protest]]s, with one gathering escalating to a [[riot]]. His death lead to [[advocacy]] based {{nowrap|[[Nonprofit organization|non-profits]]}} and HPD official's negotiations leading to the addition of policies addressing {{nowrap|police-community}} racial relations.

After Torres' arrest at the bar, the officers took him to the city jail for booking.  But, he was struck so brutally that authorities refused to book him into the jail.  Instead the police officers were ordered, by a supervisor, to take Torres to a local hospital for immediate medical treatment. The officers did not comply with the supervisor's order. Three days later, on [[Mother's Day]], Sunday, May 8, 1977 his dead body was found severely beaten and floating in the [[Buffalo Bayou]], a creek on the outskirts of downtown Houston.

Terry W. Denson and Steven Orlando two of the arresting officers were [[Criminal charge|charged]] with murder following the discovery of Torres' body. Three other officers were fired from the HPD by Police Chief B.G. Bond, but no criminal charges were brought against the fired officers.  A rookie officer who was present at the scenes of Torres' [[torture]] and drowning was a key witness for the prosecution. Denson and Orlando were convicted for Torres' death and found guilty of [[negligent homicide]] (a [[misdemeanor]]), sentenced to one year of [[probation]] and a one dollar fine. The all white jury minimized criminal convictions and sentencing sparked community outrage leading to multiple protests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=2017_03710|title=Protests Against Police Brutality (1977)|last=KPRC-TV|first=|date=1977|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Murder of Joe Campos Torres#Moody Park Riot|1978 Moody Park Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=2017_03709|title=Moody Park Riot (1978)|last=KPRC-TV|first=|date=1978|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation of Torres' murder proved controversial.  Following the State of Texas convictions of the two former officers, the Torres case was reviewed at the federal level by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].  Which led to three of the officer's federal convictions, for violating Torres' [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].

Torres' murder generated significant newspaper articles across the United States, while national televised [[mainstream media]] has no history of 'special' reports nor any episodes reporting the circumstances leading to his murder. Newspaper outlets initially focusing on his assault and drowning soon turned their attention to the historic [[racism]], lack of HPD over watch and the reoccurring absence of state and federal investigations.

Torres' murder lead to a locally produced, 30-40 minute [[documentary]] entitled ''The Case of Joe Campos Torres'' revealing the murderous event and the repeated history of [[police misconduct]] in Houston. The year following his death, a poetic song by [[vocalist]] and [[activist]] [[Gil Scott-Heron]], titled "Poem for José Campos Torres" was created reflecting the struggles of racism and police criminal actions.

==Background==

Torres was born in a Houston [[barrio]] and was raised within [[poverty]].  Unfortunately, he only achieved an eighth-grade education level.  A side effect of the poverty, he experienced, led to his constant struggle with his social demeanor.&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nolan|first1=Joe|last2=Reyes|first2=Raul|title=Interactive: Joe Campos Torres {{!}} Torres Friends say he had his dreams—and his drawbacks|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/torres|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=Houston Chronicle|issue=Volume 76  No. 212|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC.]]|date=15 May 1977|page=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Misdemeanor Murder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Donald|title=The Valley of the Fallen and Other Places|date=2001|publisher=AtRandom.com|location=New York|isbn=0679647228|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Valley_of_the_Fallen.html?id=4jSxrRq_NlcC|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=en|chapter=The "Misdemeanor Murder" of Joe Campos Torres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to family and friends, his dream was to run and own a [[karate]] school.  He wanted to open the school near his East End Houston neighborhood, allowing him to teach young ones the art of self-defense.  To pursue his dream, he realized that he needed a [[General Education Diploma]] (GED), a driver's license and a job as a [[Overhead cable|lineman]] with a telephone company.&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UP 12 May 1977"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abilene Reporter-News from Abilene, Texas {{!}} Murder Charges Filed Against Police Officer|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/47645141/|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=United Press (UP)|publisher=Newspapers.com|date=12 May 1977|location=Houston (UP)|page=45|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Vargas, Torres' longtime friend, said that when Torres was 23 he was still lost emotionally and was fighting a sporadic problem with alcohol. Torres would occasionally become very [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]; friends and family say this would trigger his aggression, in wanting to fight. Torres' younger brothers, Gilbert, 20 and Ray, 16 acknowledged that Torres had an occasional problem with alcohol abuse. "Alcohol really got to him sometimes." Vargas said, "Sometimes when he drank a lot he wanted to fight . . . I didn't like to be around Joe when he was drinking. When he got drunk, he'd start practicing his karate.  He'd yell and kick and punch at the air."  When Torres was a teenager he got into a lot of fights, but had confided with Vargas and told him he knew the fighting would not get him anywhere.&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 12"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nolan|first1=Joe|last2=Reyes|first2=Raul|title=Interactive: Joe Campos Torres {{!}} Torres Friends say he had his dreams—and his drawbacks|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/torres|accessdate=25 December 2017|work=Houston Chronicle|issue=Volume 76  No. 212|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC.]]|date=15 May 1977|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres' father, José Luna Torres Jr., 46, said his son spent two years in the [[United States Army]] (U.S. Army). During his [[Military service|military&amp;nbsp;service]], he was accepted and undergoing [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] training at [[Fort Bragg]] [[North Carolina]].  While in ranger training, he was separated from the service in September 1976, under a '[[Military discharge#Types of discharge|general&amp;nbsp;discharge]].' It is reported his abuse of alcohol and anger outbursts are what ultimately led to his early release from the U.S. Army. His brother Gilbert said, "Before the service, Joe was bum and a [[Vagrancy (people)|drifter]], but after he got out he really cut down on the drinking . . . The normal Joe was different from the drunk Joe." He said, "The drunk Joe got rowdy easy and he [take] things the wrong way sometimes."&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lupe Salinas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salinas|first1=Lupe S.|title=U.S. Latinos and Criminal Injustice|date=1 July 2015|publisher=Michigan State University Press|isbn=9781628952353|page=236|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/us-latinos-and-criminal-injustice-lupe-s-salinas/1121923130?ean=9781628952353|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Wilson pg. 247"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Steven Harmon|title=The Rise of Judicial Management in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, 1955-2000|date=2002|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Ga.|isbn=9780820327280|page=247|chapter=Criminal Justice in the 1970s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Texas Monthly pg. 85"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Tom|title=Texas Monthly {{!}} Support Your Local Police (or else)|date=September 1977|volume= 5|issue= 9|page=85|url=https://books.google.sc/books?id=JiwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;vq=campos%20torres&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 December 2017|publisher=Emmis Communications|language=en|issn=0148-7736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just two weeks before his death, Torres found employment as a glass contractor earning $2.75 an hour. Vargas said, Torres had difficulty staying employed since his discharge from the U.S. Army. He said Torres resented his restriction to tedious, low paying jobs due to his low education level and nominal military skills.  Even though Torres had received, while in the military, training as a telecommunication's lineman not having his GED and a driver's license were barriers to employment with a potential telecommunications provider.&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Texas Monthly pg. 85"/&gt;

Vargas said, Torres' true passions were physical fitness and the art of karate. After his return from the U.S. Army he was working to receive a black belt (expert) rating in karate. In addition to his progress in karate, he also under went weight training and jogged, frequently attaching weights to his feet.&lt;ref name="Chron 15 May 1977 pg. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lydia Mendoza pg. 353"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendoza|first1=Lydia|last2=Nicolopulos|first2=James|last3=Strachwitz|first3=Chris|title=Lydia Mendoza a Family Autobiography|date=1993|publisher=Arte Público|location=Houston, Tex.|isbn=9781558850668|page=353|url=https://books.google.tt/books/about/Lydia_Mendoza.html?hl=pt-BR&amp;id=ll1aAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 December 2017|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
Torres had been arrested for disorderly conduct at a bar in Houston's predominantly Hispanic East End neighborhood.  The six police officers who responded took Torres to a spot called "The Hole" next to the Buffalo Bayou and beat him. The officers then took Torres to the city jail, who refused to process him due to his injuries. They were ordered to take him to [[Ben Taub Hospital]], but instead of doing so, the officers brought him back to the banks of Buffalo Bayou and pushed him into the water. Torres's body was found two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nation: End of the Rope | date = April 17, 1978 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916056-1,00.html | work = Time | accessdate = 2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Officers Terry W.

On the one year anniversary of José Campos Torres' murder a riot was started at [[Moody Park]] located in Houston's [[Near Northside, Houston|Near Northside]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=2017_03709|title=Moody Park Riot (1978)|last=KPRC-TV|first=|date=1978|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The riot broke out on the evening of Saturday, May 7, 1978 at approximately 7:30 pm, once a {{nowrap|[[Cinco de Mayo]]}} fiesta event ended at the park.  Between five and six thousand people attended the celebration.&lt;ref name="ABC13 May 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Houston history: An ugly Cinco de Mayo celebration|url=http://abc13.com/news/houston-history-an-ugly-cinco-de-mayo-celebration/1326991/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=ABC13 Houston|agency=KTRK-TV Houston|publisher=ABC Inc.|date=6 May 2016|location=HOUSTON (KTRK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police arrived at the park in response to a call for an incident of disorderly conduct.  It remains unclear on how the riot started.  Some reports reflect that the officers were making a few arrests and this is when people in the event began yelling, "No you are not taking them" and "You'll kill them the way you killed José Campos Torres".  The crowd's initial yelling immediately lead people to begin chanting in unison "Justice for Joe Torres" "Viva Joe Torres" and "A [[Chicano|Chicano's]] life is worth more than a dollar!" The crowd then began throwing bottles and rocks at the officers.&lt;ref name="ABC13 May 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moody Park Part 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Jack|title=Moody Park Part 2- The Riot {{!}} Houston Public Media|url=https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2008/05/07/10303/moody-park-part-2-the-riot/|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=Houston Public Media|publisher=University of Houston|date=7 May 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black-Brown Solidarity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Márquez|first1=John D.|title=Black-Brown Solidarity: Racial Politics in the New Gulf South|date=2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292753891|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02fKAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=travis+morales+moody+park&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en|chapter=Neoliberalism and Its Aftermath|quote=…all while chanting slogans like "Viva Joe Torres!"

The Fulton Village shopping center's stores at 2900 Fulton street, were [[looting|looted]] and set on fire.  Abe Weiner, an owner of a department store in the shopping center, said it took the fire department over an hour to respond to his emergency [[9-1-1]] call for help. Three large buildings and two smaller ones in the shopping center were looted and stripped by fires. The rioting escalated to over a {{nowrap|ten-block}} area adjacent to Moody Park. A total of six stores and one gasoline station were set on fire.&lt;ref name="ABC13 May 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moody Park Part 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chron Slideshow Image 9"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyd|first1=John|title=Remembering Joe Campos Torres and Houston's Moody Park riots|url=http://www.chron.com/houston/slideshow/Remembering-Joe-Campos-Torres-and-Houston-s-Moody-108489/photo-6757436.php|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=Houston Chronicle|date=April 28, 2015|language=en|quote=Image 9 of 37 - Caption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers were promptly deployed in [[Riot control#Equipment|riot gear]] to try and control the gathering of approximately 1,500 people according to police (other estimates reflect 150-300) who took part in the riot.&lt;ref name="Ethnicity in the Sunbelt - page 11"&gt;{{cite book|last1=León|first1=Arnoldo De|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFld7B52sSwC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=Joe+Campos+Torres+fighting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw6d7j3J3YAhVDjVQKHYsbB_0Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Joe%20Campos%20Torres%20fighting&amp;f=false|title=Ethnicity in the Sunbelt : Mexican Americans in Houston|date=2001|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=9781585441495|page=211|edition=1st Texas A &amp; M University Press|accessdate=22 December 2017|language=English-USA|chapter=XI Moderation and Inclusions, 1975 -1980s|quote=The mob of about 1,500 according to police (other estimates say 150-300) ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some rioters had flipped cars over and set them on fire, fourteen of the eighteen smashed and burned cars were police cars.&lt;ref name="Moody Park Part 2"/&gt; The property damage of businesses and police vehicles reached $500,000.

Vocalist and activist [[Gil Scott-Heron]], known as the "Godfather of Rap" and for his sociology charged spoken word performances in the '70s.  Scott-Heron's best-known recording is the 1971 released "The&amp;nbsp;Revolution&amp;nbsp;Will&amp;nbsp;Not&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;Televised", this artwork characterizes unashamed [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contreras|first1=Felix|title=Gil Scott-Heron Dies: Rhymes For La Revolución|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2011/05/29/136742644/gil-scott-heron-dies-rhymes-for-la-revoluci-n |publisher=NPR |date=May 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Stephen|title=The legendary godfather of rap returns|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8362518.stm|accessdate=16 December 2017|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott-Heron's artistry based on self-fortitude and resentment of racism spanned across racial cultures and was popular among both African-Americans and Latinos. In 1978, the year following Torres' murder, he targeted community awareness of the murder and created a poetic song focusing on America's systemic abuse of [[Asian-Americans]], African-Americans and Hispanics in the heartfelt "Poem&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;José&amp;nbsp;Campos&amp;nbsp;Torres."&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antiwar Songs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antiwar Songs (AWS) - José Campos Torres|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=39853&amp;lang=en|publisher=Antiwarsongs |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released as track 4 of the album titled; ''[[The&amp;nbsp;Mind&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Gil&amp;nbsp;Scott-Heron]].''&lt;ref name="Amazon Scott-Heron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind of Gil Scott-Heron|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Gil-Scott-Heron/dp/B000056VIS|website=amazon.com|publisher=Tvt|accessdate=16 December 2017|date=30 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the closing of the interview, Janie Torres, who was only a {{nowrap|10-year-old}} when her brother's life was taken, announced plans for an annual [[solidarity]] walk in memory of her brother. The walk is targeted across all generations with the focus on awareness of police racism across the nation.  The second annual walk and rally occurred on May 6, 2017 in Houston, Texas.  Janie plans on continuing to hold the walks annually, to be held on the yearly anniversaries of her brother's murder.  For social awareness she has posted the walk on a [[Facebook]] homepage; [https://www.facebook.com/solidaritywalkhouston/ "Joe Campos Torres Solidarity Walk For Past &amp; Future Generations"].&lt;ref name="Green Watch Television"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Browning|first1=Art|title=Joe Campos Torres, 40 years ago (GWTV 2017-04-26) Greenwatch TV|url=https://vimeo.com/channels/greenwatch/215862395|accessdate=30 November 2017|publisher=Green Watch Television (GWTV)|date=3 May 2017|location=Houston, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
====The Case of Joe Campos Torres====
The documentary ''The Case of Joe Campos Torres'' recounts the calendar of events and ensuing community-protest assemblies, community/police department discussions, along with the legal actions taken by the Torres family against the Houston Police Department and the City of Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 8:  The Case of Joe Campos Torres (Film)|url=https://doscentavos.net/2014/05/02/may-8-the-case-of-joe-campos-torres-film/|website=doscentavos.net|accessdate=30 November 2017|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared Histories Film Screening and Panel Discussion: The Case of Joe Campos Torres|url=http://www.artshound.com/event/shared-histories-film-screening-and-panel-discussion-the-case-of-joe-campos-torres/|website=Arts Hound|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmed around Houston, the documentary records the Latino communities reaction to what they witnessed as an act of racial injustice against their population. The documentary, approximately 30 – 40 minutes in length, replays raw [[footage]] taken from local news station's archives.  The footage is used as a reminder to viewers that before video cameras were able to bring police misconduct to light, the family of Torres had to rely on community support to help them find justice.&lt;ref name="The Venture"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruiz|first1=Raymond|title="The Case of Joe Campos Torres" debuts to a packed house - The Venture|url=https://www.theventureonline.com/2011/07/the-case-of-joe-campos-torres-debuts-to-a-packed-house/|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Venture|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced in 1977 by Tony Bruni and Houston's [[KPRC-TV]], Channel 2.  Carlos Calbillo both wrote and edited the film and it was reported by [[John Quiñones]], who is now with [[ABC News]] and hosts the series "[[What Would You Do? (ABC News series)|What Would You Do?]]".&lt;ref name="The Venture"/&gt;

In [[enzymology]], a '''nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase''' ({{EC number|2.7.7.1}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:ATP + nicotinamide ribonucleotide &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; diphosphate + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[nicotinamide ribonucleotide]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[diphosphate]] and [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]].

This enzyme participates in [[nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism]]. 

The human version of this protein is [[NMNAT1]]. 

==Belongs to==
This enzyme belongs to the family of [[transferase]]s, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing [[nucleotide]] groups ([[nucleotidyltransferase]]s).  The [[List of enzymes|systematic name]] of this enzyme class is '''ATP:nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase'''. Other names in common use include '''NAD+ pyrophosphorylase''', '''adenosine triphosphate-nicotinamide mononucleotide transadenylase''', '''ATP:NMN adenylyltransferase''', '''diphosphopyridine nucleotide pyrophosphorylase''', '''nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphorylase''', '''nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase''', and '''NMN adenylyltransferase'''.  

==Structural studies==

As of late 2007, 11 [[tertiary structure|structures]] have been solved for this class of enzymes, with [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] accession codes {{PDB link|1EJ2}}, {{PDB link|1GZU}}, {{PDB link|1HYB}}, {{PDB link|1KKU}}, {{PDB link|1KQN}}, {{PDB link|1KQO}}, {{PDB link|1KR2}}, {{PDB link|1M8F}}, {{PDB link|1M8G}}, {{PDB link|1M8J}}, and {{PDB link|1M8K}}.

This area was the location of the [[Bull's Head Tavern]], a place frequented by ships’ captains, drovers, and a variety of businessmen. Hachaliah Bailey of Somers, New York, regularly stayed at the Bull’s Head when he took his cattle to the abattoir, which was located nearby.

==Biography==
The first elephant brought to the United States was in 1796, aboard the ''[[Private Armed Ship America|America]]'' which set sail from [[Calcutta, India|Calcutta]] for New York on December 3, 1795.&lt;ref name="Goodwin(1951)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first=George G.|title=The Crowninshield Elephant : The surprising story of Old Bet, the first elephant ever to be brought to America|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/editors_pick/1951_10_pick.html|work=Pick from the Past|publisher=''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]''|accessdate=29 January 2013|date=October 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, it is not certain that this was Old Bet.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; The first references to Old Bet start in 1804 in [[Boston]] as part of a [[menagerie]].&lt;ref name=top/&gt; In 1808, while residing in [[Somers, New York]], [[Hachaliah Bailey]] purchased the menagerie elephant for $1,000 and named it "Old Bet".&lt;ref name=roadside&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/pet/oldbet.html |title=Old Bet |accessdate=2010-01-08 |quote= |publisher=[[RoadsideAmerica.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiegold|first=Marilyn|date=May 15, 1977|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/the-beast-that-put-somers-on-the-map.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613181833/http://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/the-beast-that-put-somers-on-the-map.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0|archivedate=June 13, 2017|accessdate=June 13, 2017|title=The Beast That Put Somers on the Map|work=Archives|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1816, Old Bet was killed while on tour near [[Alfred, Maine]] by local farmer Daniel Davis who shot her, and was later convicted of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithfulreaders.com/2012/06/03/elephants/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108204136/https://faithfulreaders.com/2012/06/03/elephants/|archivedate=November 8, 2016|date=June 3, 2012|last=Winship|first=Kihm|title=Elephants|work=Faithful Readers: The writing of Kihm Winship}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many people believe that the farmer thought it was sinful for people to pay to see an animal, another suspected reason is jealousy.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;&lt;ref name=roadside/&gt;

In 1821, the [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York announced that they had bought the hide and bones of Old Bet and would mount the remains at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historybuff.com/library/refelephant.html |title=The Elephant Comes to America |accessdate=2010-01-08 |quote=In 1821, the American Museum in New York announced that they had bought Old Bet and she would now be on permanent display at the museum. |publisher=HistoryBuff.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212035825/http://www.historybuff.com/library/refelephant.html |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant was memorialized in 1825 with a statue and the [[Elephant Hotel]] in Somers, New York.&lt;ref name=top/&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;&lt;ref name=roadside/&gt; In 1922 the elephant [[John L.

[[File:Hokusai Onryo.jpg|thumb|Onryō from the Kinsei-Kaidan-Shimoyonohoshi (近世怪談霜夜星)]]
In traditional beliefs of Japan and in literature, '''''onryō''''' ([[wiktionary:怨霊|怨霊]], literally "vengeful spirit", sometimes rendered "wrathful spirit")&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; refers to a ghost (''[[yūrei]]'') believed capable of causing harm in the world of the living, harming or killing enemies, or even causing natural disasters to exact [[Revenge|vengeance]] to redress the wrongs it received while alive then takes their spirits from their dying bodies.

The term overlaps somewhat with {{nihongo||御霊|[[goryō]]}}, except that in the cult of the ''goryō'', the acting agent need not necessarily be a wrathful spirit.&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt;

==Origin==
While the origin of ''onryō'' is unclear, belief in their existence can be traced back to the 8th century and was based on the idea that powerful and enraged souls of the dead could influence or harm the living people. The earliest ''onryō'' cult that developed was around [[Prince Nagaya]] who died in 729;&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; and the first record of possession by the ''onryō'' spirit affecting the health is found in the chronicle ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' (797), which states that "{{nihongo|[[Fujiwara Hirotsugu]]|[[:ja:藤原広嗣|藤原広嗣]]}}'s soul harmed [[Genbō]] to death" (Hirotsugu having died in a failed insurrection, named the "[[Fujiwara no Hirotsugu Rebellion]]", after failing to remove his rival, the priest Genbō, from power).&lt;ref&gt;For a source that identifies Hirotsugu as ''onryō'', see:{{Harvnb|Suzuki|2011|loc=135 (note 2 to Chapter 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A source that gives Hirotsugu as first example on record of "etiological possession" is {{Harvnb|McCullough|1973|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vengeance==
Traditionally in Japan, ''onryō'' driven by [[Revenge|vengeance]] were thought capable of causing not only their enemy's death, as in the case of Hirotsugu's vengeful spirit held responsible for killing the priest [[Genbō]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McCullough|first=William H.|title=Spirit Possession in the Heian Period|editor-last1=Ōta|editor-first1=Saburo (太田三郎)|editor-last2=Fukuda|editor-first2=Rikutaro (福田陸太郎)|journal=Studies on Japanese Culture (日本文化研究論集)|volume=1|year=1973|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLAdAQAAMAAJ}}; (Also printed in ''Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Kokusai Kaigi gijiroku'' (日本文化研究国際会議議事錄) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RN9YAAAAMAAJ Volume 1, 1973], pp. 350- (p.356)&lt;/ref&gt;), but causing natural disasters such as [[earthquake]]s, [[fire]]s, [[storm]]s, [[drought]], [[famine]] and [[Pandemic|pestilence]],&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; as in the case of [[Prince Sawara]]'s spirit embittered against his brother, the [[Emperor Kanmu]].&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yui|title=Medicine Master Buddha: The Iconic Worship of Yakushi in Heian Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgo7JV9vNCQC&amp;pg=PA29|pages=29–31|isbn=978-9004196018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, such vengeance exacted by supernatural beings or forces is termed {{nihongo||[[:ja:祟り|祟り]]|tatari}}.&lt;ref name="grappard"&gt;{{citation|last=Grappard|first=Allan G.|contribution=Religious practices|editor-last=Hall|editor-first=John Whitney|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiTWWfoyuyAC&amp;pg=PA560|pages=559–|isbn=978-0521223539|title=The Cambridge History of Japan|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Emperor Kanmu]] had accused his brother Sawara of plotting (possibly falsely to remove him as rival to the throne), and the latter who was exiled died by fasting. The reason that the Emperor moved the capital to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] thence to [[Kyoto]] was an attempt to avoid the wrath of his brother's spirit, according to a number of scholars.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; This not succeeding entirely, the emperor tried to lift the curse by appeasing his brother's ghost, by performing Buddhist rites to pay respect, and granting Prince Sawara the posthumous title of emperor.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

A well-known example of appeasement of the ''onryō'' spirit is the case of [[Sugawara no Michizane]], who had been politically disgraced and died in exile. Believed to cause the death of his calumniators in quick succession, as well as catastrophes (especially lightning damage), and the court tried to appease the wrathful spirit by restoring Michizane's old rank and position.&lt;ref name="grappard"/&gt; Michizane became deified in the cult of the [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]], with [[Tenman-gū]] shrines erected around him.

===Examples===
Possibly the most famous ''onryō'' is Oiwa, from the ''[[Yotsuya Kaidan]]''. In this story the husband remains unharmed; however, he is the target of the ''onryō''’s vengeance. Oiwa's vengeance on him isn't physical retribution, but rather psychological torment.

Other examples include:

*'''''How a Man's Wife Became a [[Vengeful ghost|Vengeful Ghost]] and How Her Malignity Was Diverted by a Master of Divination'''''
:In this tale from the medieval collection, ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'', an abandoned wife is found dead with a full head of hair intact and the bones still attached. The husband, fearing retribution from her spirit, asks a {{Nihongo|diviner|[[:ja:陰陽師|陰陽師]]|onmyōji}} for aid. The husband must endure while grabbing her hair and riding astride her corpse. She complains of the heavy load and leaves the house to "go looking" (presumably for the husband), but after a day she gives up and returns, after which the diviner is able to complete her exorcism with an incantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=S. W. (translator)|title=Ages ago; thirty-seven tales from the Konjaku monogatari collection|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1959|page=72|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nv-wAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One of the texts cited by Jones: {{citation|editor-last=Haga|editor-first=Yaichi (芳賀矢一)|chapter=卷第廿四/第20: 人妻成悪靈除其害陰陽師語 |work=攷証今昔物語集 (Kōshō konjaku monogatari shū)|volume=3 (下)|year=1921|page=106|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/945416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Of a Promise Broken'''''
:In this tale from the [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] area recorded by [[Lafcadio Hearn]], a [[samurai]] vows to his dying wife never to remarry.  He soon breaks the promise, and the ghost comes to first warn, then murder the young bride, ripping her head off. The watchmen who had been put to sleep chase down the apparition, and with a slash of the sword while reciting [[Buddhist]] prayer, destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hearn|first=Lafcadio|chapter=Of a Promise Broken|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15–26|title=A Japanese miscellany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Hisako (久子, "Eternal Child" or "Everlasting Child") from the third entry of the fighting game Killer Instinct, is an onryō who died while defending her village. She still haunts her old village and will take vengeance on anyone who desecrates it's ruins with her naginata. She has pale white skin, long black hair like most Onryo. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ultra-combo.com/characters/hisako/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2018 the asymetrical horror game, Dead By Daylight released The Spirit DLC. The Spirit is an onryō who returns from the dead after being brutally murdered by her Father.

==Physical appearance==
Traditionally,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} ''onryō'' and other ''[[yūrei]]'' (ghosts) had no particular appearance. However, with the rising of popularity of [[Kabuki]] during the [[Edo period]], a specific [[costume]] was developed.

Highly visual in nature, and with a single actor often assuming various roles within a play, Kabuki developed a system of visual shorthand that allowed the audience to instantly clue in as to which character is on stage, as well as emphasize the emotions and expressions of the actor.

A ghost costume consisted of three main elements:
* White burial [[kimono]], {{nihongo||[[:ja:白装束|白装束]]|shiroshōzoku}} or {{nihongo||[[:ja:死に装束|死に装束]]|shinishōzoku}} 
*Wild, unkempt long black hair
*Face make-up consisting of white foundation (''[[oshiroi]]'') coupled with face paintings (''[[kumadori]]'') of {{nihongo|blue shadows|藍隈|aiguma|extra2="[[indigo]] fringe"}}, much like villains are depicted in kabuki make-up artistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=日本博学倶楽部|title=「通」になれる古典芸能を楽しむ本: 落語・歌舞伎から能・狂言まで|publisher=PHP研究所|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpY2LFHGK34C&amp;pg=PT57|page=57|isbn=978-4569665498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Parker|first=Helen S.

Effective management of [[chronic pain|chronic (long-term) pain]], however, frequently requires the coordinated efforts of the management team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Thienhaus |first1= Ole |last2= Cole|first2= B.

Medicine treats [[injury]] and pathology to support and speed healing; and treats distressing symptoms such as pain to relieve [[suffering]] during treatment and healing. When a painful injury or pathology is resistant to treatment and persists, when pain persists after the injury or pathology has healed, and when medical science cannot identify the cause of pain, the task of medicine is to relieve suffering. Treatment approaches to chronic pain include [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] measures, such as [[analgesics]], [[antidepressant]]s and [[anticonvulsant]]s, interventional procedures, physical therapy, [[physical exercise]], application of ice and/or heat, and [[psychological]] measures, such as [[biofeedback]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].

==Uses==
[[Pain]] can have many causes and there are many possible treatments for it. In the nursing profession, one common definition of pain is any problem that is "whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | author = Pasero C, McCaffery M | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Pain: clinical manual | edition = | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 1999 | pages = | isbn = 0-8151-5609-X | oclc = | doi = | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different sorts of pain management address different sorts of pain.

Pain management includes patient communication about the pain problem.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Consumer Reports|title=Pain Relief: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/pain-relief/pain-relief-what-you-need-know/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=26 May 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To define the pain problem, a health care provider will likely ask questions such as these:&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt;
*How intense is the pain?
*How does the pain feel?
*Where is the pain?
*What, if anything, makes the pain lessen?
*When did the pain start?
After asking questions such as these, the health care provider will have a description of the pain.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; Pain management will then be used to address that pain.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
There are many types of pain management, and each of them have their own benefits, drawbacks, and limits.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt;

A common difficulty in pain management is communication.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; People experiencing pain may have difficulty recognizing or describing what they feel and how intense it is.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; Health care providers and patients may have difficulty communicating with each other about how pain responds to treatments.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; There is a continuing risk in many types of pain management for the patient to take treatment which is less effective than needed or which causes other difficulty and side effects.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; Some treatments for pain can be harmful if overused.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; A goal of pain management for the patient and their health care provider to identify the amount of treatment which addresses the pain but which is not too much treatment.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt;

Another problem with pain management is that pain is the body's natural way of communicating a problem.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; Pain is supposed to resolve as the body heals itself with time and pain management.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt; Sometimes pain management covers a problem, and the patient might be less aware that they need treatment for a deeper problem.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports pain relief April 2016"/&gt;

== Physical approach ==

=== Physical medicine and rehabilitation  ===
[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation]]  employs diverse physical techniques such as thermal agents and [[electrotherapy]], as well as therapeutic exercise and behavioral therapy, alone or in tandem with interventional techniques and conventional pharmacotherapy to treat pain, usually as part of an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary program.&lt;ref name="Geertzen JH, Van Wilgen CP."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geertzen JH, Van Wilgen CP, Schrier E, Dijkstra PU |title=Chronic pain in rehabilitation medicine |journal=Disability and rehabilitation |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=363–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16492632 |doi=10.1080/09638280500287437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TENS ===
[[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] has been found to be ineffective for [[lower back pain]], however, it might help with [[diabetic neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=pmid20042705&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Dubinsky RM, Miyasaki J |title=Assessment: efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in the treatment of pain in neurologic disorders (an evidence-based review): report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=173–6 |date=January 2010|pmid=20042705 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c918fc |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acupuncture ===
[[Acupuncture]] involves the insertion and manipulation of needles into specific points on the body to relieve pain or for therapeutic purposes. An analysis of the 13 highest quality studies of pain treatment with acupuncture, published in January 2009 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', was unable to quantify the difference in the effect on pain of real, [[Sham surgery|sham]] and no acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acupuncture treatment for pain: systematic review of randomised clinical trials with acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and no acupuncture groups|journal=BMJ|volume=338|issue=|year=2009|pmid=19174438|pmc=2769056|doi=10.1136/bmj.a3115 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/338/jan27_2/a3115|last1=Madsen|first1=MV|last2=Gøtzsche|first2=PC|last3=Hróbjartsson|first3=A|pages=a3115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light therapy ===
Research has not found evidence that [[light therapy]] such as [[low level laser therapy]] is an  effective therapy for relieving [[low back pain]].&lt;ref name = Chou&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou R, Huffman LH |title=Nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline |journal=Ann.

=== Interventional procedures ===
{{main|Interventional pain management}}
Interventional procedures - typically used for [[back pain|chronic back pain]] - include [[epidural|epidural steroid injections]], [[facet joint injection]]s, [[cordotomy|neurolytic blocks]], [[spinal cord stimulator]]s and [[intrathecal]] drug delivery system implants.

[[Pulsed radiofrequency]], [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]], direct introduction of medication and nerve [[ablation]] may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent [[nociception]] or the [[nociceptor]]s from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain.&lt;ref name="Varrassi G, Paladini A"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Varrassi G, Paladini A, Marinangeli F, Racz G |title=Neural modulation by blocks and infusions |journal=Pain Practice |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=34–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17309707 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2006.00056.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meglio M."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meglio M |title=Spinal cord stimulation in chronic pain management |journal=Neurosurg.

An [[intrathecal pump]] used to deliver very small quantities of medications directly to the spinal fluid. This is similar to epidural infusions used in [[Childbirth|labour]] and postoperatively.  The major differences are that it is much more common for the drug to be delivered into the spinal fluid (intrathecal) rather than epidurally, and the pump can be fully implanted under the skin. {{mcn|date=November 2018}}

A [[spinal cord stimulator]] is an implantable medical device that creates electric impulses and applies them near the dorsal surface of the spinal cord provides a [[paresthesia]] ("tingling") sensation that alters the perception of pain by the patient.{{mcn|date=November 2018}}

== Psychological approach ==

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) for pain helps patients with pain to understand the relationship between one's physiology (e.g., pain and muscle tension), thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. A main goal in treatment is cognitive restructuring to encourage helpful thought patterns, targeting a behavioral activation of healthy activities such as regular exercise and pacing. Lifestyle changes are also trained to improve sleep patterns and to develop better coping skills for pain and other stressors using various techniques (e.g., relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and even biofeedback).

Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy in the management of chronic low back pain, producing significant decreases in physical and psychosocial disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Turner J. A. |author2=Clancy S. | year = 1988 | title = Comparison of operant-behavioral and cognitive-behavioral group treatment for chronic low back pain | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 261–6 | doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.56.2.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the January 2012 issue of the ''Archives of Internal Medicine'' found CBT is significantly more effective than standard care in treatment of people with body-wide pain, like fibromyalgia. Evidence for the usefulness of CBT in the management of adult chronic pain is generally poorly understood, due partly to the proliferation of techniques of doubtful quality, and the poor quality of reporting in clinical trials. The crucial content of individual interventions has not been isolated and the important contextual elements, such as therapist training and development of treatment manuals, have not been determined. The widely varying nature of the resulting data makes useful [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] within the field very difficult.&lt;ref name = Eccleston1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eccleston C |title=Can 'ehealth' technology deliver on its promise of pain management for all? |journal=Pain |volume=152 |issue=8 |pages=1701–2 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21612868 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2011.05.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a [[systematic review]] of [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) evaluated the clinical effectiveness of psychological therapies for the management of adult chronic pain (excluding headaches). There is no evidence that [[behaviour therapy]] (BT) is effective for reducing this type of pain, however BT may be useful for improving a persons mood immediately after treatment. This improvement appears to be small, and is short term in duration.&lt;ref name=":williams2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Amanda C. de C.|last2=Eccleston|first2=Christopher|last3=Morley|first3=Stephen|date=2012-11-14|title=Psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain (excluding headache) in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|pages=CD007407|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23152245}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT may have a small positive short-term effect on pain immediately following treatment. CBT may also have a small effect on reducing [[disability]] and potential [[Exaggeration|catastrophizing]] that may be associated with adult chronic pain. These benefits do not appear to last very long following the therapy.&lt;ref name=":williams2012" /&gt; CBT may contribute towards improving the mood of an adult who experiences chronic pain, and there is a possibility that this benefit may be maintained for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=":williams2012" /&gt;

For children and adolescents, a review of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapy for the management of chronic and recurrent pain found that psychological treatments are effective in reducing pain when people under 18 years old have headaches. This beneficial effect may be maintained for at least three months following the therapy.&lt;ref name=":eccleston2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eccleston|first=Christopher|last2=Palermo|first2=Tonya M.|last3=de C Williams|first3=Amanda C.|last4=Lewandowski|first4=Amy|last5=Morley|first5=Stephen|last6=Fisher|first6=Emma|last7=Law|first7=Emily|date=2012-12-12|title=Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD003968|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003968.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=3715398|pmid=23235601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological treatments may also improve pain control for children or adolescents who experience pain not related to headaches. It is not known if psychological therapy improves a child or adolescents mood and the potential for disability related to their chronic pain.&lt;ref name=":eccleston2012" /&gt;

=== Hypnosis ===
A 2007 review of 13 studies found evidence for the efficacy of [[hypnosis]] in the reduction of pain in some conditions, though the number of patients enrolled in the studies was small, bringing up issues of power to detect group differences, and most lacked credible controls for placebo and/or expectation. The authors concluded that "although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain, considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic-pain conditions."&lt;ref name="Elkins2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Elkins|first1= G |last2= Jensen|last3=Jensen|first2= MP|last4= Patterson|first3= DR|title= Hypnotherapy for the Management of Chronic Pain|journal= International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|year= 2007|volume= 55|issue= 3|pages= 275–287|pmid= 17558718 |pmc= 2752362 |doi= 10.1080/00207140701338621}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283}}

Hypnosis has reduced the pain of some noxious medical procedures in children and adolescents,&lt;ref name="Accardi"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Accardi |first1=M. C. |last2=Milling |first2=L. S. |year=2009 |title=The effectiveness of hypnosis for reducing procedure-related pain in children and adolescents: A comprehensive methodological review |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=328–339|pmid=19255840 |doi=10.1007/s10865-009-9207-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in clinical trials addressing other patient groups it has significantly reduced pain compared to no treatment or some other non-hypnotic interventions.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/hypnosis.aspx |last=American Psychological Association |date=2 July 2004 |title=Hypnosis for the relief and control of pain |publisher=American Psychological Association |accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no studies have compared hypnosis to a convincing placebo, so the pain reduction may be due to patient expectation (the "placebo effect").&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=M. |last2=Patterson |first2=D. R. |year=2006 |title=Hypnotic treatment of chronic pain |journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=95–124|pmid=16404678 |doi=10.1007/s10865-005-9031-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of self hypnosis on chronic pain are roughly comparable to those of progressive muscle relaxation.&lt;ref name="Jensen"/&gt;

=== Mindfulness meditation ===
A meta-analysis of studies that used techniques centered around the concept of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], concluded, "Findings suggest that MBIs decrease the intensity of pain for chronic pain patients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reiner|first=K|author2=Tibi, L |author3=Lipsitz, JD |title=Do mindfulness-based interventions reduce pain intensity? A critical review of the literature.|journal=[[Pain Medicine (journal)|Pain Medicine]]|date=Feb 2013|volume=14|issue=2|pages=230–42|pmid=23240921|doi=10.1111/pme.12006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medications ==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends a ''[[pain ladder]]'' for managing analgesia. It was first described for use in [[cancer pain]], but it can be used by medical professionals as a general principle when dealing with analgesia for any type of pain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/ WHO | WHO's pain ladder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoMBRG"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=edited by L.A.|last2=Tansey|first2=E.M.|title=Innovation in pain management : the transcript of a Witness seminar held by the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL, London, on 12 december 2002|date=2004|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London|location=London|isbn=978-0-85484-097-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the treatment of chronic pain, whether due to malignant or benign processes, the three-step WHO Analgesic Ladder provides guidelines for selecting the kind and stepping up the amount of analgesia. The exact medications recommended will vary with the country and the individual treatment center, but the following gives an example of the WHO approach to treating chronic pain with medications. If, at any point, treatment fails to provide adequate pain relief, then the doctor and patient move onto the next step.

=== Mild pain ===
[[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), or a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) such as [[ibuprofen]].

=== Mild to moderate pain ===
Paracetamol, an NSAID and/or paracetamol in a combination product with a weak [[opioid]] such as [[tramadol]], may provide greater relief than their separate use.  Also a combination of opioid with acetaminophen can be frequently used such as Percocet, Vicodin, or Norco.

=== Moderate to severe pain ===
When treating moderate to severe pain, the type of the pain, acute or chronic, needs to be considered.  The type of pain can result in different medications being prescribed.  Certain medications may work better for acute pain, others for chronic pain, and some may work equally well on both.  Acute pain medication is for rapid onset of pain such as from an inflicted [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or to treat [[Surgery|post-operative pain]].  [[Chronic pain]] medication is for alleviating long-lasting, ongoing pain.

[[Morphine]] is the [[gold standard]] to which all [[narcotic]]s are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid), [[oxymorphone]] (Numorphan, Opana), [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan), [[hydromorphinol]] and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency.  [[Fentanyl]] has the benefit of less [[histamine]] release and thus fewer [[side effect]]s.  It can also be administered via [[transdermal patch]] which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). [[Oxycodone]] is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as [[OxyContin]], and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and [[ampule]]s are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or [[Pain#Breakthrough pain|breakthrough pain]]. [[Diamorphine]], [[methadone]] and [[buprenorphine]] are used less frequently.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Pethidine]], known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended {{By whom|date=October 2012}} for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. [[Pentazocine]], [[dextromoramide]] and [[dipipanone]] are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons.  In some countries potent synthetics such as [[piritramide]] and [[ketobemidone]] are used for severe pain, and [[tapentadol]] is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.

For moderate pain, [[tramadol]], [[codeine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], and [[hydrocodone]] are used, with [[nicocodeine]], [[ethylmorphine]] and [[propoxyphene]] and [[dextropropoxyphene]] less commonly.

Drugs of other types can be used to help opioids combat certain types of pain, for example, [[amitriptyline]] is prescribed for chronic muscular pain in the arms, legs, neck and lower back with an opiate, or sometimes without it and/or with an NSAID.

While [[opiate]]s are often used in the management of chronic pain, high doses are associated with an increased risk of [[opioid overdose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Dunn KM, Saunders KW, Rutter CM, etal |title=Overdose and prescribed opioids: Associations among chronic non-cancer pain patients |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=85–92 |date=January 2010|pmid=20083827 |pmc=3000551 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-152-2-201001190-00006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opioids ===

From the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s website: "According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], studies have shown that properly managed medical use of opioid analgesic compounds (taken exactly as prescribed) is safe, can manage pain effectively, and rarely causes addiction."&lt;ref&gt;FDA.gov "A Guide to Safe Use of Pain Medicine" February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opioid]] medications can provide short, intermediate or long acting analgesia depending upon the specific properties of the medication and whether it is formulated as an extended release drug. Opioid medications may be administered orally, by injection, via nasal mucosa or oral mucosa, rectally, transdermally, intravenously, epidurally and intrathecally. In chronic pain conditions that are opioid responsive a combination of a long-acting (OxyContin, MS Contin, Opana ER, Exalgo and Methadone) or [[Time release technology|extended release]] medication is often prescribed in conjunction with a shorter-acting medication (oxycodone, morphine or hydromorphone) for breakthrough pain, or exacerbations.

Most opioid treatment used by patients outside of healthcare settings is oral ([[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]], [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] or liquid), but [[Suppository|suppositories]] and skin patches can be prescribed. An opioid [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] is rarely needed for patients with chronic pain.

Although opioids are strong analgesics, they do not provide complete analgesia regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic in origin. Opioids are  efficacious analgesics in chronic malignant pain and modestly effective in nonmalignant pain management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink2=Howard Y. Chang|vauthors=Daubresse M, Chang HY, Yu Y, Viswanathan S, Shah ND, Stafford RS, Kruszewski SP, Alexander GC |title=Ambulatory diagnosis and treatment of nonmalignant pain in the United States, 2000-2010|journal=Medical Care |volume=51 |issue=10 |pages=870–8 |date=October 2013|doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182a95d86 |pmid=24025657 |pmc=3845222}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are associated adverse effects, especially during the commencement or change in dose. When [[opioids]] are used for prolonged periods [[drug tolerance]], [[chemical dependency]], [[Drug diversion|diversion]] and [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carinci AJ, Mao J |title=Pain and opioid addiction: what is the connection? |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=17–21 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20425210 |doi=10.1007/s11916-009-0086-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Starrels JL, Becker WC, Alford DP, Kapoor A, Williams AR, Turner BJ |title=Systematic review: treatment agreements and urine drug testing to reduce opioid misuse in patients with chronic pain |journal=Ann.

Clinical guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain have been issued by the [[American Pain Society]] and the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Included in these guidelines is the importance of assessing the patient for the risk of substance abuse, misuse, or addiction; a personal or family history of substance abuse is the strongest predictor of aberrant drug-taking behavior. Physicians who prescribe opioids should integrate this treatment with any psychotherapeutic intervention the patient may be receiving. The guidelines also recommend monitoring not only the pain but also the level of functioning and the achievement of therapeutic goals. The prescribing physician should be suspicious of abuse when a patient reports a reduction in pain but has no accompanying improvement in function or progress in achieving identified goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = King SA | year = 2010 | title = Guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain | url = http://www.searchmedica.com/resource.html?rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychiatrictimes.com%2Fopioid-related-disorders%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F10168%2F1567812&amp;q=chronic+pain&amp;c=ps&amp;ss=psychTimesLink&amp;p=Convera&amp;fr=true&amp;ds=0&amp;srid=1 | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 27 | issue = 5| page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly-used long-acting opioids and their parent compound:
* OxyContin (oxycodone)
* Hydromorph Contin (hydromorphone)
* MS Contin (morphine)
* M-Eslon (morphine)
* Exalgo (hydromorphone)
* Opana ER (oxymorphone)
* Duragesic (fentanyl)
* Nucynta ER (tapentadol)
* Metadol/Methadose (methadone)&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Hysingla ER (hydrocodone bitartrate)
* Zohydro ER (hydrocodone bicarbonate)
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Methadone can be used for either treatment of [[opioid use disorder|opioid addiction]]/detoxification when taken once daily or as a pain medication usually administered on an every 12-hour or 8-hour dosing interval.

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===
The other major group of analgesics are [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAID). [[Acetaminophen]]/paracetamol is not always included in this class of medications. However, acetaminophen may be administered as a single medication or in combination with other analgesics (both NSAIDs and opioids). The alternatively prescribed NSAIDs such as [[ketoprofen]] and [[piroxicam]] have limited benefit in chronic pain disorders and with long-term use are associated with significant [[adverse effect]]s. The use of selective NSAIDs designated as [[COX-2 inhibitor|selective COX-2 inhibitors]] have significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks which have limited their utilization.&lt;ref name="Munir MA, Enany N."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Munir MA, Enany N, Zhang JM |title=Nonopioid analgesics |journal=Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=97–111 |year=2007 |pmid=17164106 |doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2006.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballantyne JC."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ballantyne JC |last2=Gao |first2=Y.-J. |last3=Sun |first3=Y.-G. |last4=Zhao |first4=C.-S. |last5=Gereau |first5=R.

=== Antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs ===
Some [[antidepressant]] and [[antiepileptic]] drugs are used in chronic pain management and act primarily within the pain pathways of the central nervous system, though peripheral mechanisms have been attributed as well. These mechanisms vary and in general are more effective in [[neuropathy|neuropathic]] pain disorders as well as [[complex regional pain syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Jackson KC 2nd."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson KC |title=Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain |journal=Pain Practice |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2006 |pmid=17309706 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2006.00055.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannabinoids ===

Chronic pain is one of the most commonly cited reasons for the use of [[medical marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthonpot.com/2013/03/11/medical-marijuana-and-chronic-pain/ |title=Medical Marijuana and Chronic Pain |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 March 2013 |website=www.truthonpot.com |publisher=TruthOnPot.com |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} A 2012 Canadian survey of participants in their medical marijuana program found that 84% of respondents reported using medical marijuana for the management of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Philippe Lucas |title=It can't hurt to ask; a patient-centered quality of service assessment of health canada's medical cannabis policy and program |journal=Harm Reduct J |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=2 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22214382 |pmc=3285527 |doi=10.1186/1477-7517-9-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of medical marijuana's pain mitigating effects is generally conclusive. Detailed in a 1999 report by the [[Institute of Medicine]], "the available evidence from animal and human studies indicates that cannabinoids can have a substantial analgesic effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base|url= http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376|accessdate= 3 May 2013|year= 1999|publisher= Institute of Medicine|location= |isbn= 0-309-07155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 review study published in ''Fundamental &amp; Clinical Pharmacology'', various studies were cited in demonstrating that cannabinoids exhibit comparable effectiveness to opioids in models of acute pain and even greater effectiveness in models of chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Zogopoulos P, Vasileiou I, Patsouris E, Theocharis SE |title=The role of endocannabinoids in pain modulation. |journal=Fundam Clin Pharmacol. |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=Feb 2013 |pages=64–80  |pmid=23278562 |doi=10.1111/fcp.12008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other analgesics ===
Other drugs are often used to help analgesics combat various types of pain, and parts of the overall pain experience, and are hence called [[analgesic adjuvant]] medications. [[Gabapentin]]&amp;mdash;an anti-epileptic&amp;mdash;not only exerts effects alone on neuropathic pain, but can potentiate opiates.&lt;ref name=gabapentin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caraceni|first1=A|last2=Zecca|first2=E|last3=Martini|first3=C|last4=De Conno|first4=F|title=Gabapentin as an adjuvant to opioid analgesia for neuropathic cancer pain.|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=June 1999|volume=17|issue=6|pages=441–5|doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(99)00033-0|pmid=10388250}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; While perhaps not prescribed as such, other drugs such as Tagamet ([[cimetidine]]) and even simple grapefruit juice may also potentiate opiates, by inhibiting [[CYP450]] enzymes in the liver, thereby slowing metabolism of the drug.  In addition, [[orphenadrine]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[trazodone]] and other drugs with [[anticholinergic]] properties are useful in conjunction with opioids for neuropathic pain.  Orphenadrine and cyclobenzaprine are also [[muscle relaxant]]s, and therefore particularly useful in painful musculoskeletal conditions.  [[Clonidine]] has found use as an analgesic for this same purpose, and all of the mentioned drugs potentiate the effects of opioids overall.

==Society and culture==
The medical treatment of pain as practiced in [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] is called '''algology''' (from the Greek άλγος, [[algos]], "[[pain]]"). The Hellenic Society of Algology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hps-pain.gr&lt;/ref&gt; and the Turkish Algology-Pain Society&lt;ref&gt;http://www.algoloji.org.tr&lt;/ref&gt; are the relevant local bodies affiliated to the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] (IASP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schiller |first1=Francis |title=The History of Algology, Algotherapy, and the Role of Inhibition |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |date=1990 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=27–49 |jstor=23330469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Undertreatment ===
{{main|Undertreatment of pain}}
Undertreatment of pain is the absence of pain management therapy for a person in [[pain]] when treatment is [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]].

Consensus in [[evidence-based medicine]] and the recommendations of [[medical specialty]] organizations establish the guidelines which determine the treatment for pain which health care providers ought to offer.&lt;ref name="State of Pain Treatment 2011"&gt;{{Citation |author=Human Rights Watch |authorlink=Human Rights Watch |date=2 June 2011 |title=Global State of Pain Treatment: Access to Medicines and Palliative Care |publisher=Human Rights Watch |publication-place= |page= |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/06/02/global-state-pain-treatment/access-medicines-and-palliative-care |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For various social reasons, persons in pain may not seek or may not be able to access treatment for their pain.&lt;ref name="State of Pain Treatment 2011"/&gt; At the same time, health care providers may not provide the treatment which authorities recommend.&lt;ref name="State of Pain Treatment 2011"/&gt;

===In children===
{{Main|Pain management in children}}
Acute pain is common in children and adolescents as a result of injury, illness, or necessary medical procedures.&lt;ref name="AAP."&gt;{{cite journal |author=American Academy of Pediatrics |title= The Assessment and Management of Acute Pain in Infants, Children, and Adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=793–7 |year=2001 |doi=10.1542/peds.108.3.793 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/3/793.long|pmid=    11533354}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronic pain]] is present in approximately 15–25% of children and adolescents, and may be caused by an underlying disease, such as [[sickle cell anemia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or cancer or by [[functional disorder]]s such as migraines, [[fibromyalgia]], or complex regional pain.&lt;ref name="Weydert"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weydert, JA |title=The interdisciplinary management of pediatric pain: Time for more integration |journal=Techniques in regional anesthesia and pain management |volume=17 |issue=2013 |pages=188–94 |year=2013 |doi=10.1053/j.trap.2014.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Assessment
[[File:Children's pain scale.JPG|thumb|400x400px|Young children can indicate their level of pain by pointing to the appropriate face on a children's pain scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abnormalchildpsychology.org|title = Abnormal Child Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pain assessment in children is often challenging due to limitations in developmental level, cognitive ability, or their previous pain experiences. Clinicians must observe physiological and behavioral cues exhibited by the child to make an assessment. Self-report, if possible, is the most accurate measure of pain; self-report pain scales developed for young children involve matching their pain intensity to photographs of other children's faces, such as the Oucher Scale, pointing to schematics of faces showing different pain levels, or pointing out the location of pain on a body outline.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Medical Association|title=Pediatric Pain Management|url=http://www.ama-cmeonline.com/pain_mgmt/printversion/ama_painmgmt_m6.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires for older children and adolescents include the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) and the Children’s Comprehensive Pain Questionnaire, which are often utilized for individuals with chronic or persistent pain.&lt;ref name="AMA" /&gt;

;Nonpharmacologic

Caregivers may provide nonpharmacological treatment for children and adolescents because it carries minimal risk and is cost effective compared to pharmacological treatment. Nonpharmacologic interventions vary by age and developmental factors. Physical interventions to ease pain in infants include swaddling, rocking, or sucrose via a pacifier, whereas those for children and adolescents include hot or cold application, [[massage]], or [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name="Wente."&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wente SJK |title=Nonpharmacologic pediatric pain management in emergency departments: A systematic review of the literature |journal=Journal of Emergency Nursing |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=140–150 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2012.09.011 |pmid=    23199786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) aims to reduce the emotional distress and improve the daily functioning of school-aged children and adolescents with pain through focus on changing the relationship between their thoughts and emotions in addition to teaching them adaptive [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategies. Integrated interventions in CBT include [[relaxation training|relaxation technique]], [[mindfulness]], [[biofeedback]], and [[acceptance]] (in the case of chronic pain).&lt;ref name="Zagustin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zagustin TK |title=The role of cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain in adolescents |journal=PM&amp;R |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=697–704 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2013.05.009 |pmid= 23953015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many therapists will hold sessions for caregivers to provide them with effective management strategies.&lt;ref name=Weydert /&gt;

;Pharmacologic

Acetaminophen, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents]], and [[opioid|opioid analgesics]] are commonly used to treat acute or chronic pain symptoms in children and adolescents, but a pediatrician should be consulted before administering any medication.&lt;ref name="AMA" /&gt;

===Professional certification===
Pain management practitioners come from all fields of medicine.  In addition to medical practitioners, a pain management team may often benefit from the input of [[pharmacists]], [[physiotherapist]]s, [[clinical psychologist]]s and [[occupational therapist]]s, among others.  Together the multidisciplinary team can help create a package of care suitable to the patient.

Pain physicians are often fellowship-trained [[American Board of Medical Specialties|board-certified]] [[anesthesiology|anesthesiologists]], [[neurology|neurologists]], [[physiatry|physiatrists]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]]. [[Palliative care]] doctors are also specialists in pain management. The [[American Board of Anesthesiology]], the [[American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology]] (recognized by the [[AOABOS]]), the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Taking a Subspecialty Exam - American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology|url = http://www.abpn.com/become-certified/taking-a-subspecialty-exam/|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; each provide certification for a subspecialty in pain management following fellowship training which is recognized by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) or the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS). As the field of pain medicine has grown rapidly, many practitioners have entered the field, some non-ACGME board-certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACGME Sports, ACGME Pain, or Non-ACGME Sports and Spine: Which Is the Ideal Fellowship Training for PM&amp;R Physicians Interested in Musculoskeletal Medicine?|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255973276_ACGME_Sports_ACGME_Pain_or_Non-ACGME_Sports_and_Spine_Which_Is_the_Ideal_Fellowship_Training_for_PMR_Physicians_Interested_in_Musculoskeletal_Medicine|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
'''Propaganda of the deed''' (or '''propaganda by the deed''', from the French ''propagande par le fait'') is specific political action meant to be exemplary to others and serve as a catalyst for revolution.

It is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of [[insurrectionary anarchism]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and [[assassinations]] aimed at the [[ruling class]], but also had [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]], when dealing with the evolution of [[anarcho-pacifism]] in the early 20th century, reports that "the modern pacifist anarchists, ...have tended to concentrate their attention largely on the creation of [[intentional community|libertarian communities]] – particularly farming communities – within present society, as a kind of peaceful version of the propaganda by deed." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; These "deeds" were to ignite the "spirit of revolt" in the people by demonstrating the state was not omnipotent and by offering hope to the downtrodden, and also to expand support for anarchist movements as the state grew more repressive in its response.&lt;ref name="Merriman"/&gt; In 1881, the [[International Anarchist Congresses|International Anarchist Congress of London]] gave the tactic its approval.&lt;ref name="Abidor"/&gt;

==Anarchist origins==

===Various definitions===

One of the first individuals to conceptualise propaganda by the deed was the Italian revolutionary [[Carlo Pisacane]] (1818–57), who wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that "ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm "Letter to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) by Mikhail Bakunin]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, in a broader setting, has a rich heritage, as the words of [[Francis of Assisi]] reveal: "Let them show their love by the works they do for each other, according as the Apostle says: 'let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.{{' "}}

Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html "Action as Propaganda" by Johann Most, July 25, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not advocacy for mass murder, but a call for [[targeted killings]] of the representatives of capitalism and government at a time when such action might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of government repression or labor conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kill-the-banker-0000525-v21n12|title=When Revolution Came to America|last=Ketcham |first=Christopher |date= December 16, 2014|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |publisher= |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, he published ''The Science of Revolutionary Warfare'',&lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionäre Kriegswissenschaft: Eine Handbüchlein zur Anleitung Betreffend Gebrauches und Herstellung von Nitro-Glycerin, Dynamit, Schiessbaumwolle, Knallquecksilber, Bomben, Brandsätzen, Giften usw., usw.''

Berkman attempted propaganda by the deed when he tried in 1892 to kill industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] following the deaths by shooting of several [[Homestead Strike|striking]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/berkman/prison/chapter4.html ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist'' (1912) by Alexander Berkman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverly Gage, professor of U.S. history at [[Yale University]], elaborates on what the concept meant to outsiders and those within the anarchist movement:

{{Quote|To outsiders, the talk of bombing and assassination that suddenly pulsed through revolutionary circles in the late 1870s sounded like little more than an indiscriminate call to violence. To Most and others within the anarchist movement, by contrast, the idea of propaganda by deed, or the ''attentat'' (attack), had a very specific logic. Among anarchism's founding premises was the idea that capitalist society was a place of constant violence: every law, every church, every paycheck was based on force.  In such a world, to do nothing, to stand idly by while millions suffered, was itself to commit an act of violence. The question was not whether violence per se might be justified, but exactly ''how'' violence might be maximally effective for, in Most's words, annihilating the "beast of property" that "makes mankind miserable, and gains in cruelty and voracity with the progress of our so called ''civilization''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the 1880s, the slogan "propaganda of the deed" had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. In 1881, "propaganda by the deed" was formally adopted as a strategy by the anarchist London Congress.&lt;ref name="Merriman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Merriman|first=John M.|date=2016 |title=The Dynamite Club: How a Bombing in Fin-de-Siècle Paris Ignited the Age of Modern Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8mtCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=63 |isbn=978-0300217926}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, French anarchist [[Clément Duval]] achieved a form of propaganda of the deed, stealing 15,000 francs from the mansion of a Parisian socialite, before accidentally setting the house on fire. Caught two weeks later, he was dragged from the court crying "Long live anarchy!", and condemned to death. Duval's sentence was later commuted to hard labor on [[Devil's Island]], [[French Guiana]]. In the anarchist paper ''Révolte'', Duval famously declared that, "Theft exists only through the exploitation of man by man... when Society refuses you the right to exist, you must take it... the policeman arrested me in the name of the Law, I struck him in the name of Liberty".

As early as 1887, a few important figures in the anarchist movement had begun to distance themselves from individual acts of violence. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One &amp;#124; Robert Graham |publisher=Black Rose Books |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]’s ‘[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]’ of 1793–94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]’s imperialist expansion—in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France’s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad. {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85–129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July–August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .}}  &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KPD) and thus of institutional [[far-left politics|far-left political]] organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]] provided a more complex concept of propaganda when he said that,

{{Quote|Every person is likely to be open to a different kind of argument, so propaganda cannot be diversified enough if we want to touch all. We want it to pervade and penetrate all the utterances of life, social and political, domestic and artistic, educational and recreational. There should be propaganda by word and action, the platform and the press, the street corner, the workshop, and the domestic circle, acts of revolt, and the example of our own lives as free men. Those who agree with each other may co-operate; otherwise they should prefer to work each on his own lines to trying to persuade one the other of the superiority of his own method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Max_Nettlau__An_Anarchist_Manifesto.html Max Nettlau. "An Anarchist Manifesto"]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Later anarchist authors advocating "propaganda of the deed" included the German anarchist [[Gustav Landauer]], and the Italians [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Luigi Galleani]]. For Gustav Landauer, "propaganda of the deed" meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Landauer]], "Anarchism in Germany," 1895 [http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In "Weak Statesmen, Weaker People," he wrote that the state is not something "that one can smash in order to destroy. The state is a relationship between human beings... one destroys it by entering into other relationships."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Der Sozialist'', (1910)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Errico Malatesta described "propaganda by the deed" as violent communal insurrections that were meant to ignite the imminent revolution.  However, Malatesta himself denounced the use of terrorism and violent physical force, stating in one of his essays:

{{Quote|Violence (physical force) used to another's hurt, which is the most brutal form of struggle between men can assume, is eminently corrupting. It tends, by its very nature, to suffocate the best sentiments of man, and to develop all the antisocial qualities, ferocity, hatred, revenge, the spirit of domination and tyranny, contempt of the weak, servility towards the strong. And this harmful tendency arises also when violence is used for a good end. ... Anarchists who rebel against every sort of oppression and struggle for the integral liberty of each and who ought thus to shrink instinctively from all acts of violence which cease to be mere resistance to oppression and become oppressive in their turn are also liable to fall into the abyss of brutal force. ... The excitement caused by some recent explosions and the admiration for the courage with which the bomb-throwers faced death, suffices to cause many anarchists to forget their program, and to enter on a path which is the most absolute negation of all anarchist ideas and sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm "Violence as a Social Factor," (1895) by Malatesta]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

At the other extreme, the anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of "propaganda by the deed" from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of 'direct action', i.e., bombings and assassinations.&lt;ref name="GAL"&gt;Galleani, Luigi, ''La Fine Dell'Anarchismo?'', ed. Curata da Vecchi Lettori di Cronaca Sovversiva, University of Michigan (1925), pp. 61–62: Galleani's writings are clear on this point: he had undisguised contempt for those who refused to both advocate and ''directly participate'' in the violent overthrow of capitalism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAL2"&gt;Galleani, Luigi, ''Faccia a Faccia col Nemico'', Boston, MA: Gruppo Autonomo, (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of 'enemies of the people': capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen.&lt;ref name="GAL2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVR1"&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 51, 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive [[nitroglycerine]] in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, ''[[Cronaca Sovversiva]]''.&lt;ref name="AVR1"/&gt;  By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanists.  Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker [[Mario Buda]], said of him, "You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw".''&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), p. 132 (Interview of Charles Poggi)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegalism===
{{Main|Illegalism}}
Propaganda of the deed is also related to illegalism, an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 20th century as an outgrowth of [[anarchist individualism]]. The illegalists openly embraced [[crime|criminality]] as a lifestyle. Influenced by theorist [[Max Stirner]]'s concept of "egoism", the illegalists broke from anarchists like [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] who justified theft with a theory of [[individual reclamation]]. Instead, the illegalists argued that their actions required no [[Morality|moral]] basis&amp;nbsp;– illegal acts were taken not in the name of a higher ideal, but in pursuit of one's own desires. France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

===Relationship to revolution===
[[File:Bomb French Chamber 1893.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendition of the bomb thrown by the anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]] into the Chamber of Deputies of the French National Assembly in December, 1893]]Propaganda of the deed thus included stealing (in particular [[bank robbery|bank robberies]]&amp;nbsp;– named "expropriations" or "revolutionary expropriations" to finance the organization), rioting and [[general strike]]s which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression.  As early as 1911, [[Leon Trotsky]] condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. "The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses," he wrote in 1911, "Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise." [[Vladimir Lenin]] largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the ''ad hoc'' bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda of the deed, and organized violence coordinated by a professional [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] utilized for that specific end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Max Weber]] wrote that the state has a "[[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]]", or, in [[Karl Marx]]'s words, the state was only the repressive apparatus of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]]. Propaganda by the deed, including [[assassination]]s (sometimes involving bombs, named in French "''machines infernales''"&amp;nbsp;– "hellish machines", usually made with bombs, sometimes only several guns assembled together), were thus legitimized by part of the anarchist movement and the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] as a valid means to be used in [[class struggle]]. The predictable state responses to these actions were supposed to display to the [[people]] the inherently repressive nature of the bourgeois state, delegitimizing it (legitimacy being key). This would in turn bolster the revolutionary spirit of the people, leading to the overthrow of the state. This is the basic formula of the cycle protests-repression-protests, which in specific conditions may lead to an effective state of insurrection.

This cycle has been observed during the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] or in Paris in May 1968. However, it failed to achieve its revolutionary objective on the vast majority of occasions, thus leading to the abandonment by the vast majority of the anarchist movement of such bombings.  However, the state never failed in its repressive response, enforcing various ''[[lois scélérates]]'' which usually involved tough [[clampdown]]s on the whole of the [[labor movement]]. These harsh laws, sometimes accompanied by the proclamation of the [[state of exception]], progressively led to increased criticism among the anarchist movement of assassinations. The role of several ''[[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]'' and the use of deliberate [[strategy of tension|strategies of tension]] by governments, using such [[false flag]] terrorist actions as the Spanish [[La Mano Negra]], work to discredit this violent tactic in the eyes of most socialist libertarians. [[John Filiss]] and [[Jim Bell]] are two of the best known modern advocates, with the latter developing the concept of an [[assassination market]]{{mdash}}a market system for anonymously hiring and compensating political assassination.

==Justifications==
{{details|Anarchism and violence}}

The [[United Nations Security Council]], acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter&lt;ref&gt;Acting under Chapter VII means the Council is speaking with its mandatory authority in matters of world security to set the world's policy around this issue. (Comparable to the Pope speaking [[ex cathedra]].)&lt;/ref&gt; defined the term "[[terrorism]]" as consisting of "Criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act."&lt;ref name="UNSCR-1566-DefinitionOfTerrorism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/S-RES-1566(2004)/page_2|title=Definition of Terrorism|last=[[Security Council]]|first=[[United Nations Organization]]|date=October 2004|work=Security Council Resolution 1566 (2004)|publisher=UNdemocracy.org|page=2|language=Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of political violence is understood by its proponents in the frame of a general conception of the state as the control apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and of [[class struggle]] as a form of effective [[civil war]]. Thus, as anarchists often put it, "[[peace]] without [[justice]] isn't peace", but war between exploited and exploiters. In their eyes, this "social war" morally legitimizes the use of violence against broader "social violence." This view, of course, is not shared by pacifist libertarians. Rioting is thus justified as a means to enhance class consciousness and prepares the objective conditions for a popular uprising ([[Georges Sorel]], 1906).

Even those who are not opposed to the political use of violence for theoretical reasons (as pacifist anarchists are) may consider it unnecessary or [[strategy|strategically]] dangerous, in certain conditions. Many note that the events of 1970s showed clearly how terrorism may be used to influence politics in the frame of the "[[strategy of tension]]" by a state and its secret services, through [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] and [[false flag]] terrorist attacks. In Italy and other countries, the [[Years of lead (Italy)|Years of lead]] led to reinforced [[anti-terrorism legislation]], criticized by social activists as a new form of ''lois scélérates'' which were used to repress the whole of the socialist movement, not just militant groups. Many also note that the rare cases in which terrorism has achieved its revolutionary aims are mostly in the context of national liberation struggles, while the urban guerrilla movements have all failed ([[Gérard Chaliand]]).

==Armed propaganda==
'''Armed propaganda''' is a type of [[propaganda]] used by [[revolutionary]] organizations that uses destructive, but ideally not lethal violence to make a political point known to the public and eventually gain supporters for its cause. The term was used in the United States by the [[Weather Underground]] and the [[Black Panther Party]] to describe some of their bombings. Although armed propaganda can use guns or bombs, its proponents argue that its goal is debatably different from that of pure [[terrorism]].

===United States===
Dan Berger, in his book about the Weatherman organization, ''Outlaws in America'', describes the planning section for a townhouse bombing by the group, describing the action as "armed propaganda".&lt;ref name=db&gt;Berger, Dan, ''Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity'', AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}} p. 144;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The term has been applied to guerillas in Latin America in their revolutionary literature.&lt;ref name=Vahabzadeh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vahabzadeh|first1=Peyman|title=Guerrilla Odyssey: Modernization, Secularism, Democracy, and the Fadai Period of National Liberation In Iran, 1971–1979|date=2010|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=100|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3cCs4FFWMqgC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22armed+propaganda%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z_t_TdPag3&amp;sig=NFmhvkK3cJPcI8_KycFwHqHkQ0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi20cym5ZjKAhXEOiYKHZWpANI4ChDoAQggMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22armed%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran=== 
[[Bizhan Jazani]] used a translation of the term to describe armed struggle in Iran, particularly the [[Fadai]] guerrillas.&lt;ref name=Vahabzadeh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vahabzadeh|first1=Peyman|title=Guerrilla Odyssey: Modernization, Secularism, Democracy, and the Fadai Period of National Liberation In Iran, 1971–1979|date=2010|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=100|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3cCs4FFWMqgC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22armed+propaganda%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z_t_TdPag3&amp;sig=NFmhvkK3cJPcI8_KycFwHqHkQ0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi20cym5ZjKAhXEOiYKHZWpANI4ChDoAQggMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22armed%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Psions''' are a [[fictional]] [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] species in the [[DC Universe]]. The Psions first appeared in ''[[Tales of the New Teen Titans]]'' (vol. 1) #4 (September 1982) and were created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Pérez]]. The earliest uncredited appearance of the Psions was in ''[[The Witching Hour (DC Comics)|The Witching Hour]]'' #13 (March 1971) written by Marv Wolfman.

==Fictional biography==
===Origins===
Billions of years ago, on the planet [[Maltus (comics)|Maltus]], the Maltusian immortals studied all aspects of life. They took a local reptile for testing and discovered one part of the lizard's mind had the potential for much greater complexity. They enhanced the creatures and found the new developments were passed to each succeeding generation. The reptiles were released back into the wild to chart their survival rate.

The Maltusians eventually left their world in a great exodus. The enhanced reptiles evolved into the Psion race. The early Psions investigated the Maltusian labs and mimicked their creators. They went as far as cutting off their tails to look more like the Maltusians (and, as a result, disavowing their original background). After several [[millennia]], the Psions left Maltus to follow their creators, now known as the [[Guardians of the Universe]], who were on [[Oa]].

When the two discovered each other, things were not quite what the Psions expected. The Oans regretted their decision not to destroy their equipment before leaving Maltus. The Psions wished to learn more from the Guardians, but were forbidden to travel to Oa. Though the Psions had mastered the technology, they had gained little understanding. The Guardians felt responsible for the Psions and sent them to a distant galaxy where they could strive for comprehension. The Guardians ordered the Psions to stay within their assigned area so they would not be disturbed. The Guardians hoped the Psions would achieve their own greatness. The [[Green Lantern Corps]] would not be allowed to interfere with the Psions as part of the process. The Guardians' great hope has not come to fruition.

Discovering their creators and then feeling humiliated by the same, the Psions buried the truth. As a species they forgot their background and began anew their scientific work. As scientists, the Psions asked the questions all thinkers ask, such as "Where are we from?" Again and again, the Psions discovered the truth about their origins, and every time they suppressed the knowledge. The Psions refuse to acknowledge that their creators did not want them or believe in them. When hearing the truth, in pain, they go into shock and incapacitate themselves. This process also suppresses their knowledge of their genesis.

===Invasion===
The Psions were among the many alien races that took part in invading [[Earth]] after the Dominators became worried about humanity's ability to produce super-powered individuals. Part of their contribution to the war effort included creating sedatives for prisoners in the [[labor camp|Gulag]] that the [[Alliance (DC Comics)|Alliance]] maintained in deep space. A science team also worked out of Alliance Headquarters in conquered [[Australia]]. This team was killed when an effort to send a bomb through a [[Justice League International|JLI]] transporter backfired.

A Psion was part of the Paradocs crew during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover. While helping tend to a gravely injured [[Wonder Woman]], he openly stated she was most likely beyond saving and that he should start dissecting her. Fortunately, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] took over treatment for her daughter.

===Current status===
The Psions maintain vast floating laboratories where studies continue. There they exploit the life forms they found in the Vegan star system. Working with their science, they created the many species of Vega's twenty-five worlds, subconsciously replicating their own origins. Active against them are the [[Omega Men]], an interstellar group of rebels drawn from the Vegan worlds. Psion experiments accidentally created the Vegan goddess [[X'Hal]]. The Green Lantern Corps has been barred from entering or interfering within the Vegan star system due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} However, it is revealed in the fourth law of the rewritten book of Oa by the Guardians of the Universe that the Vega System is no longer outside of Green Lantern Corps' jurisdiction.[10]  

Green Lanterns [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] planned to breach Vegan space in order to retrieve recruit [[Soranik Natu]]. The mission was successful, thanks to the skills shown by Soranik, leading to the defeat of the Spider Guild.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==In other media==
===Miscellaneous===
* The Psions appear in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' issue #12. [[Batman]] and [[Adam Strange]] team up to save Rann and Christmas from them.

A '''Retropubic paravaginal repair''' is the surgical procedure to reattach the anterior lateral [[vagina|vaginal wall]] and its connective tissue to its normal position in the [[pelvis]] to correct [[pelvic organ prolapse]]. It may be necessary to preserve normal function of pelvic organs after the vagina has detached from its normal position and has moved along with underlying tissues away from the pelvic sidewall. A common finding in repairing this condition is that the [[arcus tendineus fasciae]] has become detached.The procedure is usually performed by a [[gynecology|gynecological]] [[surgeon]] using pelvic surgery techniques. 

Women who experience [[stress incontinence]] and who need a paravaginal repair often receive a Burch colposuspension to correct the problem.&lt;ref name= Baggish2016&gt;{{cite book | last = Baggish | first = Michael | title = Atlas of pelvic anatomy and gynecologic surgery | publisher = Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780323225526|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- pages 409-412 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">'''Spillover infection,''' also known as '''pathogen spillover''' and '''spillover event''', occurs when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population. The infection is transmitted from the reservoir population and may or may not be transmitted within the host population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = AG | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = CE | date = Nov 2004 | title = Pathogen spillover in disease epidemics | url = | journal = Am Nat | volume = 164 | issue = Suppl 5| pages = S79–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spillover zoonoses ==

Spillover is a common event; in fact, more than two thirds of human viruses are zoonotic &lt;ref&gt;Woolhouse M, Scott F, Hudson Z, Howey R, Chase-Topping M. Human viruses: discovery and emergence. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012) 367, 2864–2871&lt;/ref&gt;. Most spillover events result in self-limited cases with no further human to human transmission, as occurs, for example, with rabies, antrax, histoplasmosis or hidatidosis. Other zoonotic pathogens are able to be transmitted by humans to produce secondary cases and even to establish limited chains of transmission. Some examples are the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, the MERS and SARS coronaviruses or some avian flu viruses. Finally some few spillover events can result in the final adaptation of the microbe to the humans, who became a new stable reservoir, as occurred with the HIV virus resulting in the AIDS pandemic. In fact, most of the pathogens which are presently exclusive of humans were probably transmitted by animals sometime in the past &lt;ref&gt;Wolfe ND, Dunavan CP, Diamond J Origins of major human infectious diseases. Nature, 477: 279-283.&lt;/ref&gt;. If the history of mutual adaptation is long enough, permanent host-microbe associations can be established resulting in co-evolution, and even on permanent integration of the microbe genome in the human genome, as it is the case of endogenous viruses.  The closer the two species are in phylogenetic terms, the easier it is for microbes to overcome the biological barrier to produce successful spillovers.  For this reason, other mammals are the main source of zoonotic agents for humans.

'''''The Diary of Miss Idilia: A Tragic Tale of Young Love Lost''''' is a book edited by Genevieve Hill. It presents itself to be the original diary of a young girl who disappeared whilst on holiday with her parents in the German Rhineland in 1851. 

First published under the title ''''' Das verschwundene Mädchen : die Aufzeichnungen der Idilia Dubb''''' (''The missing girl: the records of Idilia Dubb'') by Bertelsmann in München in 2002, the diary was later translated into Dutch by Mistral in 2009, and published in English by Short Books in 2010. 

The authenticity of the diary and the historicity of the events described in it have been challenged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Taylor |publisher=The Spectator |date=17 February 2010 |title=I smell a rat |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5780333/i-smell-a-rat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

Idilia Dubb is a 17-year-old [[Scottish people|Scottish]] girl who disappears during a holiday, while on a family trip to [[Duchy of Nassau|Germany]] in 1851. After a lengthy search fails to find her, her parents return home. In 1860, work men at [[Lahneck Castle]] discovered her remains at the top of a tower. Lying next to her skeleton was a diary. In this diary Idilia records the horrors of her final days, due to a wooden staircase she climbed to the top of the tower had collapsed behind her, trapping her without help, food or water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Taylor |publisher=The Spectator |date=17 February 2010 |title=I smell a rat |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5780333/i-smell-a-rat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity== 

Questions have been raised about the authenticity of the diary. English publishers Short Books published the diary as non-fiction, but stated that its ‘authenticity can never be entirely verified’. 

In their review of the English edition for [[The Spectator]], Andrew Taylor wrote 'even the most credulous reader wouldn’t get too far here without smelling several large rats', citing the use of foreshadowing devices, anachronistic language, and the action-packed narrative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Taylor |publisher=The Spectator |date=17 February 2010 |title=I smell a rat |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5780333/i-smell-a-rat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Tollmann's bolide''', proposed by [[Edith Kristan-Tollmann]] and [[Alexander Tollmann]] in 1994,&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"&gt;Kristan-Tollmann, E. and A. Tollmann, 1994, ''The youngest big impact on Earth deduced from geological and historical evidence''. Terra Nova. v. 6, no. 2, pp. 209–217.&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothesis presented by [[Austria]]n [[geologist]] Alexander Tollmann and [[paleontologist]] Edith Kristan-Tollmann, suggesting that one or several [[bolide]]s ([[asteroid]]s or [[comet]]s) [[impact event|struck the Earth]] at 7640&amp;nbsp;BCE (±200), with a much smaller one at 3150&amp;nbsp;BCE (±200).  If true, this hypothesis explains early [[Holocene extinction event|Holocene extinctions]] and possibly legends of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Universal Deluge]].&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt;

The claimed evidence for the event includes [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] studies of [[tektites]],&lt;ref name="Glass1978"&gt;Glass, B.P., 1978, ''Australasian Microtektites and the Stratigraphic Age of the Australites'' Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. v. 89, no. 10, pp. 1455–1458.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Izokh1988"&gt;Izokh, E.P., 1988, ''Age-paradox and the Origin of Tektites'' in J. Konta, ed., 2nd international conference on natural glasses'' Abstracts – International Conference on Natural Glasses-Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1988. v. 2, pp. 379–384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrasadOthers1990"&gt;Prasad, N.S. and P.S. Rao, 1990, ''Tektites Far and Wide''. Nature. v. 347, no. 6291, pp. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; [[dendrochronology]], and [[ice core]]s (from Camp Century, [[Greenland]]) containing [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]] (indicating an energetic ocean strike) as well as [[nitric acid]]s (caused by extreme heating of air).

[[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]] in their book, ''[[Uriel's Machine]]'', argue that the 7640&amp;nbsp;BCE evidence is consistent with the dates of formation of a number of extant [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s and lakes in dry areas of [[North America]] and [[Asia]]. They argue that these lakes are the result remains of multiple-kilometer-high waves that penetrated deeply into continents as the result of oceanic strikes that they proposed occurred.

==Scientific evaluation==
[[Quaternary]] geologists, [[paleoclimatologist]]s, and planetary [[geologist]]s specializing in [[meteorite]] and [[comet]] impacts have rejected the Tollmann bolide hypothesis.&lt;ref name="DeutschOthers1993"&gt;Deutsch, A., C. Koeberl, J.D. Blum, B.M. French, B.P. Glass, R. Grieve, P. Horn, E.K. Jessberger, G. Kurat, W.U. Reimold, J. Smit, D. Stöffler, and S.R. Taylor, 1994, ''The impact-flood connection: Does it exist?'' Terra Nova. v. 6, pp. 644–650.&lt;/ref&gt; They reject this hypothesis because:

# The evidence offered to support the hypothesis can more readily be explained by more mundane and less dramatic geologic processes
# Many of the events alleged to be associated with this impact occurred at the wrong time (i.e., many of the events occurred hundreds to thousands of years before or after the hypothesized impacts); and
# There is a lack of any credible physical evidence for the cataclysmic environmental devastation and characteristic deposits that kilometer-high [[tsunamis]] would have created had they actually occurred.&lt;ref name="DeutschOthers1993"/&gt;

Much of the evidence used by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis to argue for catastrophic [[Holocene]] impacts can be just as well, in most cases even better, explained by more pedestrian geological processes. For example, the chemical composition of and the presence of [[volcanic ash]] with the specific acidity spikes in the [[Greenland]] [[ice cores]] presents clear evidence that they are [[volcanic eruption|volcanic]], not impact, in origin.&lt;ref name="HammerOthers1980"&gt;Hammer, C.U., H.B. Clausen, and W. Dansgaard, 1980, ''Greenland ice sheet evidence of post-glacial volcanism and its climatic impact''. Nature. v. 288, no. 5788, pp. 230–235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZielinskiOthers1996"&gt;Zielinski, G.A., P.A. Mayewski, L.D. Meeker, S. Whitlow, and M.S. Twickler, 1996, ''A 110,000 year record of explosive volcanism from the GISP2 (Greenland) ice core''. Quaternary Research. v. 45, no. 2, pp. 109–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the largest acidity spikes found in [[Antarctica]] ice cores are far too old, from 17,300 to 17,500 BP, to be associated with any [[Holocene]] impacts.&lt;ref name="HammerOthers1997"&gt;Hammer, C.U., H.B. Clausen and C. Langway, Jr., 1997, ''50,000 years of recorded global volcanism''. Climatic Change. v. 35, no. 1, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of modern [[salt lake]]s and [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s is readily explained by the concentration of salts and other [[evaporite]] minerals by the [[evaporation]] of water from stream-fed lakes lacking external outlets, called [[endorheic|"endorheic lakes"]], in arid climates. The composition of the salts and other evaporate minerals found in these lakes is consistent with their precipitation from dissolved material continually carried into the lakes by rivers and streams and subsequent concentration by evaporation instead of evaporation of sea water.&lt;ref name="EugesterOthers1980"&gt;Eugster, H.P., 1980, ''Geochemistry of Evaporitic Lacustrine Deposits''. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. v. 8, pp. 35–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpencerOthers1985"&gt;Spencer, R.J., Eugster, H.P., and Jones, B.F., 1985, ''Geochemistry of Great Salt Lake, Utah II: Pleistocene-Holocene evolution''. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. v. 49, no. 3, pp. 739–747.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HartOthers2004"&gt;Hart, W.F., J. Quade, D.B. Madsen, D.S. Kaufman, and C.G. Oviatt, 2004, ''The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of lacustrine carbonates and lake-level history of the Bonneville paleolake system''. Geological Society of America Bulletin. v. 116, no. 9–10, pp. 1107–1119.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a lake becomes salty or not simply depends on whether the lake lacks an outlet and the relative balance between water flowing into the lake and leaving the lake via evaporation.&lt;ref name="EugesterOthers1980"/&gt; Ocean water dumped into a lake as the result of a single catastrophic event, as suggested above, would contain an inadequate amount of dissolved minerals to produce, when evaporated, the vast quantities of salts and other evaporites found in the salt lakes, flats, and pans cited as evidence of a mega-[[tsunami]] by this hypothesis.

==Geological criticism==

===Isostatic rebound===
Many published papers&lt;ref name="Peltier1998"&gt;Peltier, W.R. 1998, ''Global glacial isostatic adjustment and coastal tectonics'' in I. Stewart and C. Vita-Finzi, eds., pp. 1–29. Coastal Tectonics. Special Publication no. 146, pp. 1–29. Geological Society of London, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peltier2002"&gt;Peltier, W.R., 2002, ''Global  glacial isostatic adjustment: Palaeogeodetic and space-geodetic tests of the ICE-4G (VM2) model''. Journal of Quaternary Science. v. 17, no. 5–6, pp. 491–510.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly demonstrate that [[isostatic depression]] of the [[Earth]]'s crust is not only real, but quite capable of submerging substantial portions of coastal areas adjacent to continental [[ice sheet]]s and resulting in the accumulations of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sediments]] and [[fossil]]s within them. A well-documented example of flooding caused by isostatic depression is the case of Charlotte, The Vermont Whale,&lt;ref name="CharlotteWhale"&gt;Wright, W.A., 2000, [http://www.uvm.edu/whale/ ''Charlotte, The Vermont Whale An Electronic Museum.''] University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont&lt;/ref&gt; a fossil whale found in the deposits of the former [[Champlain Sea]]. Like many similar marine deposits, the sediments, which accumulated within the Champlain Sea lack the physical characteristics; i.e. sedimentary structures, interlayering, and textures, that characterize sediments deposited by a mega-[[tsunami]]. In addition, many of these deposits and the fossils, which they contain, are far too old, by hundreds to thousands of years, to have been created by impact around either 9,640 BP or 5,150 BP. In case of the Champlain Sea, its sediments started to accumulate around 13,000 BP, almost 3,400 years before the oldest of the hypothesized Holocene bolide impacts.&lt;ref name="Hooper2001"&gt;Dr. Ken Hooper Virtual Natural History Museum Ottawa–Carleton Geoscience Centre, 2002, [http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/2001_champlain2_mb/history.htm ''History of the Champlain Sea.''] Dept. of Earth Sciences, Carleton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
As noted above, a significant amount of the physical evidence used by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt; to argue for this [[Holocene]] impact is either too old or too young to have been created by this hypothesized impact. In many cases, it is hundreds to thousands, and in one case hundreds of thousands, of years too old to be credible evidence of a Holocene impact. For example, the research&lt;ref name="Glass1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Izokh1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrasadOthers1990"/&gt; that dates the [[tektite]]s, which Tollmann bolide hypothesis regards as indicating the time of the hypothesized impact, is antiquated. Later research,&lt;ref name="SchneiderOthers1992"&gt;Schneider, D.A., D.V. Kent, G.A. Mello, 1992, ''A detailed chronology of the Australasian impact event, the Brunhes–Matuyama geomagnetic polarity reversal, and global climatic change''. Earth and Planetary Science Letters . v. 111, no. 2–4, pp. 395–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShoemakerOthers1999"&gt;Shoemaker E.M., and H.R. Uhlherr, 1999, ''Stratigraphic relations of australites in the Port Campbell Embayment, Victoria''. Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science. v. 34, no. 3, pp. 369–384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeeOthers2000"&gt;Lee, M.-Y., and K.-Y. Wei, 2000, ''Australasian microtektites in the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea: Implications for age, size, and location of the impact crater''. Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science. v. 35, pp. 1151–1155.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the tektites to be far too old, about 790,000 BP in case of the Australasian tektites, to have been associated with any of his hypothesized Holocene impacts. At this time, there exist no documented examples of Holocene tektites. In addition, the formation of salt lakes and salt flats is neither synchronous nor consistent with the hypothesized impacts having occurred about either 9,640&amp;nbsp;BP or 5,150&amp;nbsp;BP. For example, in case of [[Lake Bonneville]], [[Lake Lahontan]], [[Mono Lake]], and other [[Pleistocene]] [[pluvial lake]]s in the western United States, the transition to salt lakes and salt flats occurred at different times between 12,000 and 16,000&amp;nbsp;BP.&lt;ref name="BensonOthers2004"&gt;Benson, L., 2004, ''Western lakes'', in Gillespie, A.R., Porter, S.C., and Atwater, B., eds., p. 185–204. The Quaternary Period in the United States—Developments in Quaternary Science, Amsterdam, Elsevier. {{ISBN|0-444-51470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the change from freshwater to salty water and eventually salt flats started over 2,400 to 6,400 years before the oldest of the impacts hypothesized by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis occurred. As a result, it impossible that the formation of these salt lakes could have been associated with the impact hypothesized by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann.&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt;

==Megatsunami==
Finally, credible physical evidence of either multiple-kilometer-high [[tsunami]] waves penetrating deeply into continents and the ecological devastation they would have certainly caused have yet to be reported from any of the thousands of paleoenvironmental records constructed from the study of lakes, bogs, mires, and river valleys all over the world by [[palynology|palynologists]]. In the case of North America, various peer-reviewed publications&lt;ref name="BryantOthers1985"&gt;Bryant, V.M., Jr., and R.G. Holloway, 1985, ''Pollen Records of Late-Quaternary North American Sediments''. Dallas, American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists. {{ISBN|0-931871-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JacobsonOthers1987"&gt;Jacobson, G.L., Jr., T. Webb, III, and E.E. Grimm, 1987, ''Patterns and rates of vegetational change during the deglaciation of North America''. in W. F. Ruddiman and H. E. Wright, Jr., eds., pp. 277-287. North America Adjacent Oceans During the Last Deglaciation. The Geology of North America. K-3. Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShumanOthers2002"&gt;Shuman, B., P. Bartlein, N. Logar, P. Newby, T. Webb, III, 2002, ''Parallel climate and vegetation responses to the early Holocene collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet''. Quaternary Science Reviews. v. 21, no. 16–17, pp. 1793-–805.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrimmOthers2004"&gt;Grimm, E.C. and G.L. Jacobson, Jr., 2004,  ''Late Quaternary vegetation history of the eastern United States''. in Gillespie, A.R.,  S.C. Porter, and B.F. Atwater, eds., pp. 381–402. The Quaternary Period in the United States—Developments in Quaternary Science, Amsterdam, Elsevier. {{ISBN|0-444-51470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarize numerous published scientific papers that provide detailed records of paleoenvironmental changes that have occurred throughout the last 10,000 to 15,000 years as reconstructed from [[pollen]] and other paleoenvironmental data from over a thousand sites throughout [[North America]]. In none of these records, have palynologists recognized any indication of either the catastrophic environmental devastation or layers of [[tsunami deposit]]s, which the [[mega-tsunami]]s postulated by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis would have created. Paleovegetation maps&lt;ref name="ShumanOthers2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OverpeckOthers1992"&gt;Overpeck, J.T., R.S. Webb, and T. Webb., 1992. ''Mapping eastern North American vegetation change over the past 18,000 years: no-analogs and the future''. Geology. v. 20, no. 12, pp. 1071-1074.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrate a distinct lack of the dramatic changes in North American paleovegetation during the Holocene, which would be expected from the cataclysmic ecological and physical destruction that a continental-wide mega-tsunamis would have certainly have caused.

For example, E. C. Grimm G. L. Jacobson and others&lt;ref name="GrimmOthers1993"&gt;Grimm, E.C., G.L. Jacobson Jr., W.A. Watts, B.C.S. Hansen, and K.A. Maasch, 1993, ''A 50,000-Year Record of Climate Oscillations from Florida and Its Temporal Correlation with the Heinrich Events.'' Science. v. 261, no. 5118, pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; documented a 50,000-year-long record of environmental change by the analysis of pollen from an {{convert|18.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} core from [[Lake Tulane]] in [[Highlands County, Florida|Highland county]], [[Florida]]. Because of the low-lying nature of the peninsula, in which this part of Florida lies, this lake and the area around it certainly would have been flooded and obliterated along with many of the other lakes and bogs described in their&lt;ref name="GrimmOthers1993"/&gt; and other publications.&lt;ref name="JacobsonOthers1987"/&gt; The forests and associated ecosystems of these areas would have been flooded and completely obliterated by the mega-tsunamis proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann.&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt; Despite its location, both the core and the pollen record recovered from Lake Tulane completely lacks any indication of any abrupt, catastrophic environmental disruptions,&lt;ref name="GrimmOthers1993"/&gt; which the mega-tsunamis proposed by the Tollmann bolide hypothesis would have caused. This and other cores from Florida and elsewhere also lack sedimentary layers that have the characteristics of sediments deposited by either tsunamis or mega-tsunamis.

The cataclysmic scale of physical and ecological destruction that a megatsunami, like the one proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann,&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt; would have caused to the Holocene landscape and ecosystems certainly would have left an obvious and readily recognizable signature within the majority of long-term environmental records. Such a signature has not been reported from the more than thousand cores from North America for which Holocene paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental records have been reconstructed. There is a similar lack of evidence for mega-tsunami related, Holocene, catastrophic environmental disruptions and deposits reported from environmental records reconstructed from thousands of locations from all over the world. This lack of a physical record for the occurrence of Holocene mega-tsunamis is quite revealing given that geologists and palynologists have been quite successful in some coastal regions finding in cores and exposures the characteristic [[sediments]] deposited by tsunamis locally generated by either [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, or submarine slides and recovering abundant well-defined records of their environmental effects by studying the pollen from cores and exposures.

Members of the [[Holocene Impact Working Group]] have published papers advocating the occurrence of mega-tsunamis created by extraterrestrial impacts at various times during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene.&lt;ref name="Blakeslee"&gt;Blakeslee, S., 2006, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/14/science/14WAVE.html?8dpc ''Ancient Crash, Epic Wave.''] New York Times, November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these proposed impacts match either the cataclysmic scale or timing proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"/&gt; for Alexander Tollmann's bolide.

Victor Riesel was born on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] to Nathan and Sophie Riesel.&lt;ref name="Tears"&gt;"Tears of Jobless Inspired Riesel," ''New York Times,'' April 6, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson"&gt;Nissenson, ''The Lady Upstairs: Dorothy Schiff and the New York Post,'' 2007, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill"&gt;Hamill, "The Lives They Lived: Victor Riesel and Walter Sheridan: In Defense of Honest Labor," ''New York Times,'' December 31, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid"&gt;"The Press: Answer by Acid," ''Time,'' April 16, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sophie"&gt;"Mrs. Sopie Riesel," ''New York Times,'' May 31, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in a [[cold water flat]] near the [[IRT Second Avenue Line|elevated railroad]] tracks.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; The Riesels were [[Jews|Jewish]], and their neighbors were primarily Jewish and [[Italian American]].&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; Victor's father, Nathan, had helped organize the Bonnaz, Singer, and Hand Embroiderers' Union, Local 66, of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union]] in 1913,&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;Marks, "12 Who Made It Big," Newman Library, Baruch College, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, ILGWU, ''The Fight's Just Begun: Fifty Years with Local 66, 1913–1963,'' 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and held the Card No. 1 in the local union.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RieselFatherobit"&gt;Riesel, "Remembering the Crusade," ''Miami News,'' March 6, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, Nathan Riesel was appointed a staff member of the union and elected secretary-treasurer and then president of the local union.&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Embroiderers Ratify Call for Walkout," ''New York Times,'' August 23, 1929; "Embroidery Strike Likely Next Week," ''New York Times,'' September 4, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Victor attended [[elementary school]] at [[List of public elementary schools in New York City#Region 2: The Bronx|P.S. 19]] (now the Judith K. Weiss School).&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;

When Victor was three years old, his father taught him to make pro-union speeches and would take his son to rallies and union meetings and have the boy recite the speeches for onlookers.&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder"&gt;Maeder, "Dark Places: Victor Riesel, 1956," ''New York Daily News,'' September 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Attending union meetings, indoor and outdoor rallies, and standing on street corners promoting the union formed many of Victor Riesel's childhood and teenage memories.&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RieselFatherobit" /&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, Nathan Riesel successfully opposed [[Communist Party USA]] attempts to infiltrate activists into the local union and turning its purpose to promotion of the party (a strategy known as "[[boring from within]]").&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the "boring from within" strategy, see, generally: Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 9: The T.U.E.L. to the End of the Gompers Era,'' 1991; Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 10: The T.U.E.L., 1925–1929,'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his childhood and teenage years, he saw his father come home bleeding many times after fistfights with communist activists or gangsters.&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt; This conflict left a deep impression on Victor.&lt;ref name="RieselFatherobit" /&gt;

The family moved to the [[Bronx]] when Riesel was 13 years old.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; Academically gifted, Victor Riesel graduated from [[Morris High School (Bronx, New York)|Morris High School]] at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt; While in high school, Riesel began typing stories about the American labor movement and sending them to English language newspapers around the world, charging $1 for publication rights.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; He typed the same story over and over (sometimes as many as 15 times) to make it look like an original (his goal being to sell the same story to many newspapers rather than many stories to a single newspaper), and earned a significant income from this work.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;

He enrolled in [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1928, taking classes at night in human resource management and industrial relations.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; 

==Career==

Riesel worked several different jobs to support himself, and found employment in a hat factory, lace plant, steel mill, and saw mill.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; He was appointed director of undergraduate publications at the college, working as an [[Editing#Print media|editor]], columnist, and literature and theatre critic.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt; He earned his [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] from CCNY in 1940.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;

During his undergraduate years at CCNY, Riesel began working as a gofer at ''[[The New Leader]]''.&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt; After graduation in 1940, he became the magazine's managing editor.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

Two additional events in Riesel's life led him to a career as a labor reporter. The first occurred on March 6, 1930, during a visit to his father's union offices. Riesel saw a man weeping on the stairs because he had no job and his family had no food to eat.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; The second occurred in 1942. Nathan Riesel was now fighting [[organized crime]] influence in his union, and despaired of keeping his local out of criminal hands.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RieselFatherobit" /&gt; Nathan Riesel was severely beaten by gangsters in 1942, and died five years later (in part due to the injuries suffered during and surgeries related to this attack).&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RieselFatherobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

===Journalism===
Victor Riesel's labor journalism career formally began in 1937 when he started writing a regular column on labor union issues.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt;

He was hired by ''[[The New York Post]]'' in 1941.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt; His column became nationally syndicated in 1942.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; He left the ''Post'' in 1948 after a change in management, and joined [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissenson" /&gt; Within eight years, his column was syndicated in 193 newspapers.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

His investigation of Communist Party infiltration of the [[National Maritime Union]] led [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Louis B. Heller]] to introduce legislation in 1951 to investigate the charges.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; In 1951 and 1952, Riesel provided [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Pat McCarran]] with information that led to a Senate investigation into communist influence in the [[United Public Workers of America]].&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; In 1952, he publicly alleged before the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Subcommittee on Internal Security]] (led at the time by Sen. McCarran) that Local 65 of the [[Distributive, Processing and Office Workers of America]] was controlled by the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; The same year, he denounced [[Gambino crime family]] member [[Anthony Anastasio|Anthony "Tough Tony" Anastasio]] for engaging in [[Racket (crime)|labor racketeering]].&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; Anastasio sued Riesel for $1 million for [[libel]], but the suit was thrown out of court.&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

On February 6, 1953, Riesel spoke with New York University philosophy professor [[Sidney Hook]] and others on "The Threat to Academic Freedom" in the evening on [[WEVD]] radio.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1956, Riesel began working with [[United States Attorney]] Paul Williams to rein in labor racketeering in the New York City garment and trucking industries.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;

===Acid attack===
On April 5, 1956, an assailant threw [[sulphuric acid]] into Riesel's face as he was leaving [[Lindy's]] (a famous restaurant in Manhattan). Riesel had been reporting on corruption in the [[International Union of Operating Engineers]] and its then-President, [[William C. DeKoning, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; He had recently alleged that DeKoning was conspiring with [[Joseph S. Fay]] (a convicted labor racketeer and [[extortion]]ist) to re-establish his father, [[William C. DeKoning, Sr.]] (who had recently been freed from prison after serving a sentence for extortion) as president of the union.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt; Although Riesel had received numerous death and other threats over the past few months, he had dismissed them as the work of "cranks."&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;

The attack occurred shortly after a Riesel radio broadcast.  [[Barry Gray (radio)|Barry Gray]], radio station [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]'s overnight [[talk radio]] host, had asked Riesel to substitute for him.&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; Riesel invited two IUOE Local 138 leaders who were challenging the DeKonings for control of the local union to join him for the broadcast.&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt; The broadcast originated from Hutton's Restaurant at [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]] shortly after midnight on April 5, and concluded at 2 AM.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; Afterward, Riesel and his secretary went to Lindy's restaurant, located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between 49th Street and [[50th Street (Manhattan)|50th Street]].&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; They had coffee, and departed Lindy's at 3 AM to walk to the secretary's automobile.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; Riesel removed his eyeglasses, which he did by habit when in public.&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt; A slender, black-haired man in blue and white jacket stepped out of the shadows of the entrance to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and threw a vial of sulphuric acid into Riesel's eyes.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; Riesel shouted, "My gosh! My gosh!", and clutched at his face.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt; While the secretary and others rendered assistance and dragged Riesel into Lindy's, the assailant walked calmly away.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;

The acid struck Riesel's right eye more than the left.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; Riesel's eyes were flushed with water inside Lindy's, but patrons stopped administering aid for fear of doing further damage.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; Riesel was taken to St. Clare's Hospital on East 71st Street, where doctors worked to save his vision.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt; Measures to counteract the acid were not taken until Riesel arrived at St. Clare's, 40 minutes after the attack.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; On May 4, doctors said that Riesel had completely lost his sight (see the right photograph in the infobox, above).&lt;ref name="LosesSight" /&gt; In December 1956, Riesel described the amount of acid as a "deluge" which covered most of his cheeks, eyes, and forehead.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RanzalStand"&gt;Ranzal, "Riesel, on the Stand, Describes How Acid 'Deluge' Hit His Eyes," ''New York Times,'' December 4, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In fact, there was so much acid thrown that some of it splashed back onto attacker Abraham Telvi's face. Telvi's scars made him easily identifiable as Riesel's assailant. When Telvi demanded another $50,000 as compensation for remaining in hiding and staying quiet in the case, the Genovese crime family had him killed. See: Levey, "F.B.I. Solves Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' August 18, 1956; Perlmutter, "Body Is Exhumed In Riesel Inquiry," ''New York Times,'' August 22, 1956; "Body of Hoodlum Examined Anew," ''New York Times,'' August 23, 1956; "Johnny Dio and 4 Others Held As Masterminds in Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' August 29, 1956; Perlmutter, "Dio Linked By U.S. To Telvi Murder in Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' August 30, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of Riesel's face (see right photo, above, compared to left photo, particularly the left cheek, jaw line, and jowls; the eyebrows; and the forehead) were permanently scarred as well.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Visits Riesel's Bedside," ''New York Times,'' April 9, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Riesel wore dark glasses for the rest of his life to hide his damaged eyes, which many people found difficult to look at.&lt;ref name="RanzalStand" /&gt;

The ''Daily Mirror'' immediately offered a $10,000 reward for information identifying the assailant and leading to his conviction.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; The [[The Newspaper Guild|Newspaper Guild of New York]], [[New York Press Photographers Association]], [[Overseas Press Club]], New York Newspaper Reporters Association, and the Society of Silurians (an organization of veteran New York City journalists) immediately raised the reward to $15,000.&lt;ref name="RaskinThug" /&gt; By week's end, donations from labor unions, radio station WMCA, and other groups had increased the reward to $41,000.&lt;ref name="AnswerByAcid" /&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) identified [[Abraham Telvi]] as the assailant in August 1956, but Telvi had been murdered on July 28, 1956, by mobsters for demanding an additional $50,000 on top of the $500 he had already received for the crime.&lt;ref name="Frankel"&gt;Frankel, "Johnny Dio and 4 Others Held As Masterminds in Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' August 29, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "F.B.I. Solves Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' August 18, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 1956, Genovese crime family [[underboss]] [[Johnny Dio]] was arrested for conspiracy in the Riesel attack, pleaded not guilty, and was released on $100,000 bond even though prosecutors later publicly linked him to the Telvi murder.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "U.S. Hints New Lead In Attack on Riesel," ''New York Times,'' August 19, 1956; Perlmutter, "Dio Linked By U.S. To Telvi Murder in Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' August 30, 1956; "Reprisal Feared for Dio's Arrest," ''New York Times,'' August 31, 1956; "Hogan Gets Data in Riesel Inquiry," ''New York Times,'' September 1, 1956; Levey, "Rackets and Crime Linked in Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' September 2, 1956; Ranzal, "Court Cautions U.S. To Speed Dio Case," ''New York Times,'' September 6, 1956; Ranzal, "Jury Indicts Dio in Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' September 8, 1956; "Dio and Four Deny Guilt in Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' September 11, 1956; "Bond of $100,000 Is Posted By Dio," ''New York Times,'' October 11, 1956; "Indictment of Dio Upheld By Court," ''New York Times,'' October 16, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Carlino, a Dio associate who had hired Telvi to attack Riesel, pleaded guilty on October 22, and prosecutors severed Dio's trial from the others.&lt;ref&gt;Stengren, "Guilty Plea Made By Riesel Suspect," ''New York Times,'' October 23, 1956; "2 Trials Granted in Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' November 8, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlino later testified that Dio had ordered Genovese mob associate Gandolfo Miranti to find a hitman and identify Riesel, and that Miranti had contacted Dominick Bando to assist him in finding the hitman (Bando contacting Carlino, who sought out Telvi).&lt;ref name="Maeder" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Fall-Out," ''Time,'' August 27, 1956; "The Team Behind Telvi," ''Time,'' September 10, 1956; Ranzal, "Jury Hears Story of Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' November 15, 1956; Ranzal, "Dio Directed Attack On Riesel, Trial Told," ''New York Times,'' November 28, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Miranti and Bando were then found guilty (Bando pleading guilty at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, "3 Convicted of Plot In Riesel Blinding," ''New York Times,'' December 7, 1956; "Guilty Plea Filed in Riesel Attack," ''New York Times,'' January 26, 1957; ''United States v. Miranti,'' 253 F.2d 135 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy charges against Dio were later dropped despite the convictions. Dio's attorney delayed the trial for nearly five months with motions.&lt;ref&gt;"Riesel-Case Trial of Dio Is Delayed," ''New York Times,'' April 25, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; When the trial finally began, Carlino and Miranti recanted their pre-trial statements and courtroom testimony, claiming they did not know who had ordered the attack on Riesel.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, "Key Dio Witness Refuses to Talk," ''New York Times,'' May 21, 1957; Ranzal, "Dio Case Dropped From Court Docket," ''New York Times,'' May 28, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1957, the government no longer sought to prosecute Dio for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;"Judge Continues Dio's Indictment," ''New York Times,'' September 24, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Miranti received 8 to 16 years in prison and Bando 2 to 5 years in prison for the acid attack and another five years for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;"2 In Riesel Case Get Long Terms," ''New York Times,'' February 22, 1957; Ranzal, "Silent in Dio Case, Thug Gets 5 Years," ''New York Times,'' May 25, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlino received a suspended sentence for cooperating with the prosecution,&lt;ref&gt;"Freed in Riesel Case," ''New York Times,'' December 14, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; and three other co-conspirators were freed after the judge in their case declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].&lt;ref&gt;"Acid Throwing Case Called A Mistrial," ''New York Times,'' July 6, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mirror'' paid one witness $5,000 in 1961 for information leading to the identification of Abraham Telvi as the assailant.&lt;ref&gt;"Mirror Pays Reward," ''New York Times,'' March 31, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on Riesel had significant implications for national American labor policy.  [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] (who had seen Riesel on ''[[Meet the Press]]'') told [[AFL-CIO]] President [[George Meany]] that he was so incensed by the attack on Riesel that he intended to introduce legislation designed to root out corruption in labor unions.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eisenhower to Act on Union Rackets," ''New York Times,'' June 6, 1956; Ball, ''Meet the Press: Fifty Years of History in the Making,'' 1998, p. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark R. Mollenhoff]], editor of the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', was so alarmed by the attack on Riesel that he ordered extensive investigations into trade union corruption.&lt;ref name="Hilty"&gt;Hilty, ''Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector,'' 2000, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Mollenhoff's investigative efforts unearthed much evidence that [[Teamsters]] President [[Jimmy Hoffa]] was engaged in labor racketeering.&lt;ref name="Hilty"/&gt; The attack also convinced [[Robert F. Kennedy]], then chief legal counsel for the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Committee on Government Operations]], to lead an investigation into labor racketeering.&lt;ref name="Hilty" /&gt; Kennedy's investigations (as well as subsequent labor scandals) led to the establishment of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]].&lt;ref name="Hilty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein"&gt;Lichtenstein, ''State of the Union: A Century of American Labor,'' 2003, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This committee's investigations led directly to the passage of the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]], which imposed financial reporting requirements on labor unions, limited the power of trusteeships, established many member and employer rights, and created additional [[unfair labor practice]]s governing unions.&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein" /&gt;

The acid attack vastly boosted Riesel's national popularity. He began a regular [[television program]] on WRCA-TV, and a regular weekly radio program on [[WWRV|WEVD]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, "Air Shows Slated for Victor Riesel," ''New York Times,'' June 13, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write his column, typing it himself while his wife read newspapers and [[News agency|wire service]] articles to him.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;

===Anti-communist views===
Riesel was a militant anti-[[Communism|communist]]. Initially, his views focused on both [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. As early as 1939, he joined [[John Dewey]]'s newly formed [[Committee for Cultural Freedom]], which was opposed to [[totalitarianism]] in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;"New Group Fights Any Freedom Curb," ''New York Times,'' May 15, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he told the [[Union for Democratic Action]] that Rep. [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] was intent on establishing a national fascist police force to suppress freedom of speech in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Dies Called Creator of Political Police," ''New York Times,'' July 29, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riesel's attacks on fascism lessened after World War II, and he focused almost exclusively on communism after 1950. Riesel's attacks on communism extended beyond labor unions. He attacked [[American folk music revival|folk musician]] [[Vern Partlow]] for promoting communism and undermining American national security with his 1945 [[talking blues]] song "Atomic Talking Blues" (also known as "Talking Atom" and "Old Man Atom").&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940–1970,'' 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he was named a director of the [[Committee to Defend America by Aiding Anti-Communist China]], a part of the [[China Lobby]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Patterns in the Dust: Chinese-American Relations and the Recognition Controversy, 1949–1950,'' 1983, p. 255, fn. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one author alleges that Riesel even cooperated with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] beginning in the early 1950s, providing information on liberal politicians and union leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America,'' 2008, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, he supported a movement to stop the importation of goods from the [[Soviet Union]] into the United States, and for a time [[Stevedore|longshoremen]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] refused to unload Soviet ships due to Riesel's campaign.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt; During the height of [[McCarthyism]] in the early 1950s, he also became interested in purging [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] from federal civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, ''The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst,'' 2001, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly called for a "preventive war" with the Soviet Union in 1951, and demanded that President [[Harry S. Truman]] drop the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] on Russia and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Olson, ''John Wayne: American,'' 1995, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly criticized [[Malcolm X]] for meeting with [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]] and [[Julian Mayfield]] in the mid-1960s, and accused Malcolm X of fomenting communist conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, ''Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America,'' 2007, p. 112; Horne, ''Race Woman: The Lives of Shirley Graham Du Bois,'' 2000, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Riesel became an unofficial advisor to President [[Richard Nixon]]. He supported Nixon in his column, discussed labor union issues and outreach to working-class voters with him personally over the phone, and occasionally met with [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] members.&lt;ref&gt;Sidey, "This Is the White House Calling," ''Life,'' April 2, 1971, p. 28; Liebovich, ''Richard Nixon, Watergate and the Press: A Historical Retrospective,'' 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as 1973, Riesel was defending [[COINTELPRO]], a series of [[Covert operation|covert]] and often illegal projects conducted by the FBI aimed at investigating and disrupting [[Dissident|dissident political organizations]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Wannall, ''The Real J.

Riesel was intimately involved in the [[Hollywood blacklist]] of the late 1940s and 1950s. He strongly criticized [[Samuel Fuller]]'s 1951 [[Korean War]] [[film]] ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'' for promoting communism and portraying American soldiers as murderers.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, ''Hollywood Asian: Philip Ahn and the Politics of Cross-Ethnic Performance,'' 2006, p. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attacked the 1954 pro-union film ''[[Salt of the Earth (1954 film)|Salt of the Earth]]'' as communistic, and implied that the production's on-location proximity to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the [[Nevada Test Site]] was a cover for Soviet spying on the American nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;Lorence, ''The Suppression of 'Salt of the Earth': How Hollywood, Big Labor, and Politicians Blacklisted a Movie in Cold War America,'' 1999, p. 78; Biberman, ''Salt of the Earth: The Story of a Film,'' 2003, p. 88; Whitfield, ''The Culture of the Cold War,'' 1996, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Riesel saw it as his patriotic duty to publicize allegations of communist influence made against actors, directors, producers, and others (especially those claims made by conservative actors [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Ward Bond]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baughman, ''The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America Since 1941,'' 2006, p. 38; Pells, ''The Liberal Mind in a Conservative Age: American Intellectuals in the 1940s and 1950s,'' 1989, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navasky"&gt;Navasky, "HUAC in Hollywood," in ''Hollywood: Social Dimensions: Technology, Regulation and the Audience,'' 2004, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; As the blacklist lifted, Riesel agreed to allow his column to become a means for blacklisted individuals to admit their offenses, denounce communism, and become active in the motion picture industry again. Along with [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Walter Winchell]], he would meet privately with these individuals, assess the sincerity of their [[penance]], and then work with them to help rehabilitate their careers if he believed they were being honest with him.&lt;ref name="Navasky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blacklist"&gt;Bernstein, ''Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist,'' 2000, p. 153; Rose, ''The Agency: William Morris and the Hidden History of Show Business,'' 1996, p. 156; Ceplair and Englund, ''The Inquisition in Hollywood: Politics in the Film Community, 1930–60,'' 2003, p. 389; Lichtman and Cohen, ''Deadly Farce: Harvey Matusow and the Informer System in the McCarthy Era,'' 2004, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Victor Riesel retired from the ''Daily Mirror'' in 1963 but continued to publish his syndicated column.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt; Three men who leased coin-operated pool tables to establishments in California sued Riesel for libel in 1965, alleging that his column on racketeering in the vending industry defamed them.&lt;ref&gt;"Coinmen Sue Columnist," ''Billboard,'' April 17, 1965, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riesel was elected a director of the Overseas Press Club in 1962, and the organization's president in 1966 (he served a single one-year term).&lt;ref name="Sophie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Overseas Press Club Elects New Officers," ''New York Times,'' May 1, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riesel retired his column in 1990.&lt;ref name="obitNYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamill" /&gt;

Captain Higgins returned to Vietnam in 1972 as an infantry battalion advisor to the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine Division]], then in 1973 served as a rifle company commander with B Company, [[1st Battalion 4th Marines]].

From 1973 to 1977, Captain Higgins served at the Staff Noncommissioned Officers Academy and [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidate School]], both in [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico]], Virginia.

Returning to the [[Fleet Marine Force]] in 1977, Capt. Higgins was assigned to the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina, where he again served as a rifle company commander with A Company, [[1st Battalion 2nd Marines|1st Battalion]], [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|2nd Marines]]. Upon promotion to major, he was reassigned as the [[Logistics]] Officer for [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|Regimental Landing Team 2]], [[4th Marine Amphibious Brigade]].

On February 17, 1988, Higgins disappeared while serving as the Chief, Observer Group Lebanon and Senior Military Observer, United Nations Military Observer Group, [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]]. Higgins was driving alone on the coastal highway between [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Naqoura]] in southern Lebanon, returning from a meeting with a local leader of the Amal movement, when he was pulled from his vehicle by armed men who it is suspected were affiliated with [[Hezbollah]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/29/cp.01.html |title=CNN PRESENTS&amp;nbsp;— Encore Presentation: Inside Hezbollah |accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |last=Cooper |first=Anderson |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-07-29 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=CNN.com |pages= |language= |doi= |quote=Hezbollah is a suspect in the torture and murder of U.S. Colonel William Higgins.

As a reaction to his abduction, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 618|Resolution 618]], demanding his release. A year and a half after his abduction, images of his body, hanged by the neck, were televised around the world from a videotape released by his captors. The exact date of Higgins' murder is uncertain; he was declared dead on July 6, 1990. His remains were recovered on December 23, 1991, by Major Jens Nielsen of the Royal Danish Army, who was attached to the United Nations Observation Group in Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unogilbackgr.html |title=Lebanon{{mdash}}UNOGIL |work=United Nations Peacekeeping Missions |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Higgins' remains were found beside a mosque near a south [[Beirut]] hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Giandomenico Picco, Man Without a Gun, Times Books, New York (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  His remains were interred at [[Quantico National Cemetery]], Triangle, Virginia, on December 30, 1991.

==Awards and honors==
Higgins' military decorations include: the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Defense Superior Service Medal]], [[Legion of Merit]], [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [[combat "V"]], [[Purple Heart]], [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]], [[Navy Commendation Medal]] with gold star and combat "V", [[Combat Action Ribbon]], [[Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry]] with silver star, Staff Service Honor Medal, [[United Nations Medal]], and numerous unit commendations and campaign ribbons.

On March 18, 1992, President George Bush awarded Higgins the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] (posthumous).  The medal was accepted by his wife, Robin, and daughter, Chrissy. Higgins was also survived by two sisters.

On February 17, 1994, the [[Secretary of the Navy]] announced a new [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] guided missile destroyer would be named for Higgins. On October 4, 1997, the {{USS|Higgins|DDG-76}} was christened by Higgins' widow, [[Robin Higgins]] and commissioned on April 24, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navysite.de/dd/ddg76.htm|title=USS Higgins (DDG 76)|work=navysite.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, he was posthumously granted a [[Prisoner of War Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mediafire.com/?d04qtp9a19f6ify memo from Secretary of the Navy to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, "Prisoner of War Medal ICO Colonel R.

'''Youth suicide''' is when a young person, generally categorized as someone below age 21, deliberately [[suicide|ends their own life]]. Rates of attempted and completed youth [[suicide]] in [[Western societies]] and other countries are high. Youth suicide attempts are more common among girls, but adolescent males are the ones who usually carry out suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Youth Suicide Risk and Preventive Interventions: A Review of the Past 10 Years|journal=Research Update Review|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide rates in youths have nearly tripled between the 1960s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Death, Society, and Human Experience|last = Kastenbaum|first = Robert J.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-205-00108-8|location = Boston|pages = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Australia]] suicide is second only to [[motor vehicle accident]]s as its leading cause of death for people aged 15–25,&lt;ref&gt;Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the [[National Institute for Mental Health]], [[Teenage suicide in the United States|suicide]] is the third leading cause of death among teens in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;National Institute [for] Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;Iype, George.

==Suicide contagion==
According to research conducted by the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian in 2007, 39% of all youth suicides are completed by young people who have lost someone of influence or significance to them to suicide. The Commission terms this [[Copycat suicide|suicide contagion]] and makes several recommendations as to the importance of safeguarding young people and communities from suicide contagion.

In 2011 the [[Australian Federal Parliament]] Standing Committee for [[Department of Health and Ageing|Health and Ageing]] Inquiry into Youth Suicide met in a round table forum with young representatives from three organisations at the forefront of preventing youth suicide. These organizations included [[Sunnykids]],&lt;ref&gt;SunnyKids 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Inspire, and [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]]. The Standing Committee has since released a discussion paper highlighting the findings of their inquiry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/youthsuicide/index.htm%20 Federal Parliament Health and Ageing Standing Committee Inquiry into Youth Suicide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108195633/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/youthsuicide/index.htm%20 |date=January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will seek to make final recommendations on the most effective means for reducing youth suicide.

===Teens at risk===
One of the problems facing teenagers at risk of suicide is getting psychiatric counseling when it's needed.&lt;ref name=GM&gt;[http://m.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/conditions/addiction/mental-health/a-four-part-action-plan-in-the-battle-against-teen-suicide/article2182663/ ]''The Globe and Mail,'' 2011-09-28.  Retrieved 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; One study says, "In teenagers, depression is considered a major - if not the leading - cause of teen suicide." &lt;ref name=teen&gt;[http://www.teensuicidestatistics.com/causes-issues.html ]"Teen Suicide Causes and Issues," Retrieved 2012-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors and risks contributed to youth suicide are academic pressure, alcohol consumption, the loss of a valued relationship, frequent change of residency, and poor family patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Death, Society, and Human Experience|last = Kastenbaum|first = Robert J.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-205-00108-8|location = Boston|pages = 199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment is a leading cause of teen suicide, along with abuse. Gay teens or those unsure of their sexual identity are more likely to commit suicide, particularly if they have suffered bullying or harassment, as discussed next. The following campaigns have been started in hopes of giving teens hope and abolishing the feeling of isolation.

* Stop Youth Suicide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopyouthsuicide.com/|title=Stop Youth Suicide Campaign|website=www.stopyouthsuicide.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lack of impulse control has been found to differentiate adolescent suicide attempters from a control group of adolescents with an acute illness (Slap, Vorters, Chaudhuri, &amp; Centor, 1988). However, impulsivity does not characterize all suicide attempters, since group comparisons have found no differences between suicidal patients and psychiatric controls on a measure of cognitive impulsivity (Patsiokas, Clum, &amp; Luscomb, 1979). Instead, impulsivity may be important in identifying high risk subgroups.

=== Sexual minority youth and suicide ===
Youth that fall under the category of [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] are at an elevated risk of depression and succumbing to self-harm. Among the population of sexual minority youth, on average, 28% explain having past experiences with suicidal actions and/or thoughts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshal Ph.D|first=Michael. P|date=February 5, 2011|title=Suicidalitity and Depression Disparities Between Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Youth: A Meta-Analytic Review|url=|journal=Journal of Adolescent|volume=49|pages=115–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lesbian]] and [[gay]] youth are the group most likely to face negative experiences, leading to a higher likelihood of the development of suicidal thoughts according to mental care professionals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Bisexuality]] also carries a higher likelihood of suicidality with bisexuals being 5 times more likely to report suicidal thoughts and actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexual minority youth also report a higher incidence of substance abuse when compared to heterosexuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Overall, studies suggest that sexual minority youth carry a higher incidence of suicide and depression.

=== Previous exposure, attempts, and age impacting youth suicide ===
Exposure to suicide, previous attempts of suicide, and age are some of the most influential factors of young individuals and their probability of dying by suicide. Adolescent exposure to suicide through classmates has caused researchers to hypothesize suicide as a contagion. They note how a child’s exposure to suicide predicts suicide ideation and attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Swanson |first=Sonja |last2=Colman|first2=Ian|title=Association between exposure to suicide and suicidality outcomes in youth|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=185.10|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous exposure to suicide through parental attempts have also been found to have a 3.5 increase in a youth’s probability of having suicidal thoughts, with a 2.6 increased chance of them attempting suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niederkrotenthaler|first=Thomas|title=Exposure to Parental Mortality and Markers of Morbidity, and the Risks of Attempted and Completed Suicide in Offspring: an Analysis of Sensitive Life Periods |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume= 66|issue= 3|pages=233–239|doi=10.1136/jech.2010.109595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggression in families and its transference can be one of the main causes of transmission of suicidal tendencies in families&lt;ref&gt;Hawton, K., Saunders, K. E., &amp; O'Connor, R. C. (2012). Self-harm and suicide in adolescents. The Lancet, 379(9834), 2373-2382.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Previous attempts of suicide also play a major role in a youth attempting suicide again. On average, it has been recorded that the follow-up period for suicide-attempters was 3.88 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Erik|last2=Jensen|first2=Borge|title=Risk Of Repetition Of Suicide Attempt, Suicide Or All Deaths After An Episode Of Attempted Suicide: A Register-Based Survival Analysis |journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=41.3|pages=257–265|doi=10.1080/00048670601172749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence shows those most at risk for suicide are those who previously attempted suicide, with research showing that they can have anywhere from a 40 to over a 100 times higher chance of dying by suicide compared to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Upadhyaya|first=Ajaya|title=Attempted Suicide in Older Depressed Patients: Effect of Cognitive Functioning|journal=The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|volume=|pages=317–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age and experience also factor into suicide. It has been found that older, more experienced populations take more time to plan, choose deadlier methods, and have greater suicidal intent. This results in them eventually committing suicide at a higher rate than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bf3aw9bu9y.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=A+Novel+Brief+Therapy+for+Patients+Who+Attempt+Suicide%3A+A+24-months+Follow-Up+Randomized+Controlled+Study+of+the+Attempted+Suicide+Short+Intervention+Program+%28ASSIP%29&amp;rft.jtitle=PLoS+Medicine&amp;rft.au=Anja+Gysin-Maillart&amp;rft.au=Simon+Schwab&amp;rft.au=Leila+Soravia&amp;rft.au=Millie+Megert&amp;rft.date=2016-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Public+Library+of+Science+%28PLoS%29&amp;rft.issn=1549-1277&amp;rft.eissn=1549-1676&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rft.issue=3&amp;rft.spage=e1001968&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001968&amp;rft.externalDBID=DOA&amp;rft.externalDocID=oai_doaj_org_article_df955ee89339439b8f8b6f07ab49134c&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=A Novel Brief Therapy for Patients Who Attempt Suicide: A 24-Months Follow-Up Randomized Controlled Study of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP).|last=Gysin-Maillart|first=Anja|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bereavement among young people===
The primary goals of suicide [[postvention]] include assisting the survivors of suicide with the grief process, along with identifying and referring those survivors who may be at risk for negative outcomes such as depressive and [[anxiety disorder]]s, and suicidal behaviour. With 42% of completed youth suicides being suicide bereavement (or contagion) related - further research and investment must be made into supporting this group of people. A few suggestions to make sure the support is effective include making the individuals feel connected and understood.

== Epidemiology ==
Two possible determinants to suicide attempts are lifetime [[sexual abuse]] and adult [[Violence|physical violence]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=Sarah|last2=Geofroy|first2=Dominique|last3=Chachamovich|first3=Eduardo|date=3 April 2015|title=Changing Rates of Suicide Ideation and Attempts Among Inuit Youth: A Gender-Based Analysis of Risk and Protective Factors|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sltb.12122/full|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=45|issue=2|pages=141–156|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among participants aged 18–25, the [[odds ratio]]s for lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence are 4.27 and 3.85,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; respectively. In other words, those who committed suicide are 327% more likely to have experienced lifetime sexual assault. Similarly, a suicide victim is 285% more likely to have suffered physical violence as an adult. Based on a survey done on American high school students, 16% reported considering suicide and 8% reported attempting suicide sometime within the 12 months before taking the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/suicideyouth.html|title=Suicide Among Youth &amp;#124; Gateway to Health Communication &amp;#124; CDC |website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1994, the suicide rates of young black males doubled. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives]] commit suicide at a higher rate than any other ethnic group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teen Suicide|last = Woodward|first = John|publisher = Szumski|year = 2005|isbn = 0-7377-2428-5|location = Greenhaven|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], one-third of suicides are young people 15&amp;ndash;29. In 2002, 154,000 suicides were recorded in India. In the United States, about 60 percent of suicides are carried out with a gun. Some Aboriginal teens and gay or lesbian teens are at high risk, depending on their community and their own self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;(Reference to come)&lt;/ref&gt; Several campaigns have been started to give them hope and help them to feel less isolated.

==Intervention==
One organization in Australia has found that young people who feel connected, supported and understood are less likely to commit suicide. Reports on the attitudes of young people identified as at risk of suicide have been released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnykids.org.au/pdf/print-media/Children's%20Commission%20Head%20High%20Submission%202009.pdf Head High Fact Sheet 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823025411/http://www.sunnykids.org.au/pdf/print-media/Children's%20Commission%20Head%20High%20Submission%202009.pdf |date=August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reports support the notion that connectedness, a sense of being supported and respected, is a protective factor for young people at risk of suicide. According to Pueblo Suicide Prevention Center (PSPC) for some reason kids today are experiencing more pressure.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Issues for communities===
Intervention issues for communities to address include: suicide contagion, developmental understanding of suicide, development and suicide risk, and the influence of culture. Key matters in postvention responses for young people include: community context, life stage relevance of responses, identification and referral (Postvention Co-ordination), developing a suite of services, and creating ongoing options.

== Prevention ==
One can help prevent adolescent suicide by discouraging isolation, addressing a child's depression which is correlated with suicide, getting rid of any objects that a child could use to commit suicide, and simply paying attention to what the child does or feels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teen-suicide/art-20044308?pg=2|title=Teen suicide: What parents need to know - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools are a great place to provide more education and support on suicide prevention. Since students spend a majority of their time at school, school can be either a haven from or a source of suicidal triggers, and students' peers can heavily influence their state of mind. The school setting is an ideal environment to educate students on suicide and have support readily available.
