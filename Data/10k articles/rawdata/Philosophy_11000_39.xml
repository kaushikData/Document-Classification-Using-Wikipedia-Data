'''''A Course in Miracles''''' (also referred to as '''ACIM''' or '''the Course''') is a 1976 book containing a curriculum which claims to assist its readers in achieving [[spiritual transformation]]. The underlying premise of the work is the teaching that the greatest "[[miracle]]" that one may achieve in one's life is the act of simply gaining a full "awareness of love's presence" in one's own life.&lt;ref&gt;''A Course in Miracles''.  Foundation for Inner Peace. [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Course_in_Miracles/Text Introduction], Page 1. Retrieved December 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written, or "scribed," by [[Helen Schucman]], who claimed that it had been dictated to her word for word via "inner [[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]" which came from [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="scribes"&gt;{{cite web|title=ACIM: About the Scribes|url=http://www.acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html|website=''acim.org''|publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACIMPrefaceHowItCame"&gt;{{cite book|author=Foundation for Inner Peace|title=A Course in Miracles: Combined Volume|date=1992|publisher=The Foundation|location=Glen Ellen, Calif.|isbn=0-9606388-9-X|pages=vii–viii|edition=2nd|url=https://www.acim.org/AboutACIM/how.html|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Course contains a curriculum to bring about what it calls a "[[spiritual transformation]]," consisting of three sections entitled the "Text", "Workbook for Students," and "Manual for Teachers". Written, or transcribed, from 1965 to 1972, some distribution occurred via [[photocopies]] before a hardcover edition was published in 1976 by the Foundation for Inner Peace.&lt;ref name="Miller2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

Throughout the 1980s annual sales of the book steadily increased each year; however the largest growth in sales occurred in 1992 after [[Marianne Williamson]] discussed the book on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'',&lt;ref name="Miller2011"/&gt; with more than two million volumes sold.&lt;ref name="Miller2011"/&gt; The book has been called everything from "New Age psychobabble"&lt;ref name="BoaBowman1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boa |first1=Kenneth |last2=Bowman |first2=Robert M. |title=An Unchanging Faith in a Changing World: Understanding and Responding to Critical Issues that Christians Face Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJuUtcoUOysC|accessdate=September 28, 2014|year=1997|publisher=Oliver Nelson|isbn=9780785273523}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "a Satanic seduction"&lt;ref name="Miller2011"/&gt; to "The New Age Bible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemidjistate.edu/academics/publications/social_work_journal/issue09/articles/2_Immanent.htm The Imminent Heaven: Spiritual Post-Metaphysics and Ethics in a Postmodern Era]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''A Course in Miracles'' was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City as Thetford's research associate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html Helen Schucman's Career]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acim.biz/a-course-in-miracles-book-acim/|title=A Course in Miracles Book ACIM Lessons Online and Text|work=ACIM Portal|access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that "[t]here must be another way".&lt;ref name="Collaboration"&gt;{{cite book | title=Helen Schucman: Autobiography, in "Origins of A Course in Miracles" 3:27–28 |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace Archives, Tiburon, CA (cited hereafter as FIPA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an "inner voice" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an "inner voice" told her: "This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes." Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.&lt;ref&gt;Skutch, Robert. ''Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles''. Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, she explained the events of her "note taking" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miraclestudies.net/Scribe.html Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ken wapnick seattle unity cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles]]

Fr. [[Benedict Groeschel]], a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, arranged an introduction of Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ''ACIM'' manuscript in 1973 and testified that he was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick then reviewed the draft and discussed, with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to place the book in its final copyrighted and published form. Thetford then made a few further editorial decisions and stipulations about the "Principles of Miracles" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from being directly involved with any further major edits to the material. Wapnick and Schucman continued to edit the manuscript by deleting personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, creating chapter and section headings, and correcting various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization.&lt;ref name="The Story of A Course In Miracles"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJ6BO8xeDA |title= The Story of A Course in Miracles = Documentary where Bill Thetford, Helen Schucman, and Ken Wapnick talk about A Course in Miracles  |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This editing process was completed by approximately February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ''ACIM,'' a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP).

==Contents==
The content of ''A Course in Miracles'' is presented in the three sections: "Textbook", "Workbook", and "Manual for Teachers":
* The "Textbook" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels:
**It states that  ''everything'' involving time, space, and [[perception]] is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that  eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is "already over", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. ''A Course in Miracles'' states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level:
** The time-space level, or "perceptory" level, which is referred to as "the dream". ''A Course in Miracles'' states that this level was "made" by the "sleeping Son" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the "Son" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the "sin-guilt-fear" cycle: we ''sinned'' by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the [[Big Bang]]); this results in ''guilt'' over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent ''fear'' of God's wrath. The "sin-guilt-fear" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently [[Psychological projection|projected]] out, so that to ''Homo sapiens'' it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as "[[Ego (religion)|ego]]", or "the wrong mind". ''A Course in Miracles'' concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from "condemnation-out-of-fear" (mindlessness) to "forgiveness-out-of-love" ([[mindfulness]]), since our "right mind" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing "the Face of Christ" in all living things is the way to "accept the Atonement" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of [[individuality]] and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of [[karma]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was.
* The "Workbook" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from "condemnation-out-of-fear" to "forgiveness-out-of-love". ''A Course in Miracles'' defines "miracle" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the "Voice for God," "right mind," "Inner Teacher," or "intuition"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is "a beginning, not an end".
* The "Manual for Teachers" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a "teacher of God": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the "voice" of the Holy Spirit.
* In the third edition, the two pamphlets "Psychotherapy" and "The Song of Prayer" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.

== Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions ==
A limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, a publishing company that had been created solely to publish A Course in Miracles. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ''ACIM'' in a set of three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet ''Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.'' In 1985, FIP began publishing a single volume containing all three of the first books in single soft-cover volume. In 1992, FIP published its second edition, a hardcover edition. This revision incorporated some minor changes within the first three sections including some editorial content additions and the addition of a verse-numbering system, as well as addition of the "Clarification of Terms" section. At this time, FIP also released the publication of the supplemental ''Song of Prayer'' booklet.

In October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over A Course In Miracles was decided with a ruling that put the work into the public domain.

In August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published "A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition", which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, and prior to it being edited by Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick into the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.

==Reception==
Since it first went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages.&lt;ref name="translations"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acim.org |title=ACIM Translations |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace |accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is distributed globally, forming the basis of a range of organized groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bradby, Ruth, "A course in miracles in Ireland". 147 – 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Wapnick said that "if the Bible were considered literally true, then (from a Biblical literalist's viewpoint) the Course would have to be viewed as demonically inspired".&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Halverson, "Seeing Yourself as Sinless", ''SCP Journal'' 7, no. 1 (1987): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Though a friend of Schucman, Thetford, and Wapnick, Catholic priest [[Benedict Groeschel]] has criticized ACIM and the related organizations. Finding some elements of ''ACIM'' to be what he called "severe and potentially dangerous distortions of Christian theology", he wrote that it is "a good example of a false revelation"&lt;ref&gt;Groeschel, Benedict J., ''A Still Small Voice'' (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993) 80&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has "become a spiritual menace to many”.&lt;ref&gt;Groeschel, Benedict J., ''A Still Small Voice'' (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993) 82&lt;/ref&gt; The evangelical editor Elliot Miller says that Christian terminology employed in ''ACIM'' is "thoroughly redefined" to resemble [[New Age]] teachings. Other Christian critics say that ''ACIM'' is "intensely anti-Biblical" and incompatible with Christianity, blurring the distinction between creator and created and forcefully supporting the [[occult]] and New Age worldview.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newport|first= John P. |title=The New Age movement and the biblical worldview: conflict and dialogue  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rxss1cqHWYIC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22a+course+in+miracles%22+christian+criticism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1998|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4430-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skeptic [[Robert T. Carroll]] criticized ''ACIM'' as "a minor industry" that is overly commercialized and characterizes it as "Christianity improved". Carroll said the teachings are not original and suggested they are culled from "various sources, east and west".&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd |title=The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=skeptic+%22a+course+in+miracles#v=onepage&amp;q=skeptic%20%22a%20course%20in%20miracles&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''acquiescence''' occurs when a person knowingly stands by without raising any objection to the infringement of his or her rights, while someone else unknowingly and without [[malice aforethought]] acts in a manner inconsistent with their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acquiescence|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/acquiescence|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of acquiescence, the person whose rights are infringed may lose the ability to make a legal claim against the infringer, or may be unable to obtain an [[injunction]] against continued infringement. The doctrine infers a form of "[[permission (philosophy)|permission]]" that results from silence or passiveness over an extended period of time.

==Overview==

Although not typically not found in statutory law, the doctrine of acquiescence is well-supported by case law. One common context in which acquiescence is raised is when there is a dispute or disagreement over the location of a property line, followed by an extended period of time during which the parties respect a property line. Even if it is later discovered that the actual property line was in a different location, the long-term acquiescence to the incorrectly placed line may result in its becoming enforceable as the legal property line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Acquiescence To A Boundary Line|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/acquiescence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the law of acquiescence occurred in a dispute between the State of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the State of [[South Carolina (U.S. state)|South Carolina]], in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that Georgia could no longer make any claim to an [[island]] in the [[Savannah River]], despite the 1787 [[Treaty of Beaufort]]'s assignment to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 US 376, 110 S. Ct. 2903, 111 L. Ed. 2d 309 (1990)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14552846522715606367|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that Georgia had knowingly allowed South Carolina to join the island as a [[peninsula]] to its own coast by dumping sand from dredging, and to then levy [[property tax]]es on it for decades.  Georgia thereby lost the island-turned-peninsula by its own acquiescence, even though the [[treaty]] had given it all of the islands in the [[river]].

==Similar legal doctrines==

Doctrines similar to acquiescence include:

*The [[common law]] [[doctrine]] of '''[[estoppel]]'''. A claim of estoppel may arise when one party gives legal notice to a second party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party may be said to have acquiesced to the claim, and thus to be ''estopped'' from later challenging it or making a counterclaim based upon the actions of the other party. Estoppel by acquiescence is different from estoppel by [[Laches (equity)|laches]] as acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of acquiescence, while laches may result from conduct that is not voluntary.
*'''Silence is acquiescence''' (aka. '''silent acquiescence''' and '''acquiescence by silence'''). Under this related doctrine, when confronted with a wrong or an act that can be considered a [[tort]]ious act, one's silence in the face of the transgression may result in a loss of a right to make a claim for loss or damage, on the principle of consent inferred from accepting or permitting the wrongful acts without protest or [[claim (legal)|claim]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Central Pacific R. Co. v. Alameda County, 284 US 463, 52 S. Ct. 225, 76 L. Ed. 402 (1932)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17866206001274130168|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adbhutananda''' (died 1920), born '''Rakhturam''', was a direct monastic disciple of [[Ramakrishna]], a mystic of nineteenth century [[Bengal]].

&lt;/ref&gt; He was a servant boy of a devotee of Ramakrishna, and he later became his monastic disciple. Though unlettered, Adbhutananda was considered as a monk with great spiritual insight by Ramakrishna's followers, and Vivekananda regarded him as "the greatest miracle of Ramakrishna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swami Gambhirananda | title = The Apostles of Sri Ramakrishna | page = 271 | year = 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A.P.Sen-2006"/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Adbhutananda was born in North-Eastern India in the [[Chhapra]] district of [[Bihar]], around the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="A.P.Sen-2006"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the name Rakhturam, meaning "child who is protected by Lord [[Rama]]". His parents were poor, humble villagers. Both his father and mother died before Rakhturam was five years old and he was left in the care of an uncle who was affectionate towards him.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with them'', p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in the village, Rakhturam led a carefree life, tending cows and sheep in the fields. In later years he said, "I used to wander freely with the cowherd boys. How simple and guileless they were! You can't have real joy unless you are like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sri Latu Maharajer Smritikatha | pages = 491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty forced Rakhturam and his uncle to travel to [[Calcutta]] in search of a livelihood. Rakhturam came in contact with [[Ramachandra Datta]], a householder devotee of [[Ramakrishna]], and he joined as his servant.&lt;ref name="GLWT_396"&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.396&lt;/ref&gt; As a servant, Rakhturam was considered energetic and faithful. Rakhturam became known as "Latu" in his new Calcutta surroundings, and he was called by that name thereafter.&lt;ref name="GLWT_396"/&gt;

=== Meetings with Ramakrishna ===
Ramakrishna lived at the [[Dakshineswar Kāli Temple]], a few miles north of Calcutta on the eastern bank of the [[Ganges]]. [[Ram Chandra Datta]], Latu's employer, was one of the first householder disciples to visit Ramakrishna. Datta loved to speak about Ramakrishna and his sayings and Latu heard about Ramakrishna from him and was attracted by Ramakrishna's teachings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sri Latu Maharajer Smritikatha | page = 27 | quote = The first teaching he heard was, "God sees into the mind of a man, without concern for what he is or where he is.He who yarns for God and wants none other than God--to such a man God reveals Himself. One should call on Him with a simple and innocent heart. Without sincere longing, none can see God. One should pray to Him in solitude and weep for him; only then will he bestow his mercy."}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that inspired by the teachings of Ramakrishna, he was often found lying covered with his blanket, quietly wiping tears from his eyes thinking of God.&lt;ref name="GLWT_397"&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.397&lt;/ref&gt; Latu waited eagerly for an opportunity to meet Ramakrishna, and he met Ramakrishna on a Sunday in 1879 or 1880.

When Ramakrishna saw Latu, he reportedly said to Ramchandra that Latu had "holy signs in him." and it is reported that when Ramakrishna touched him, Latu entered an ecstatic state, "tears trickled from his eyes and his lips began to quiver with emotion" and he gradually returned to normal state of consciousness.&lt;ref name="GLWT_397"/&gt; Latu began to visit Ramakrishna regularly, and he lost the enthusiasm with which he worked before at Datta's house. In June 1881, he joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar as his personal attendant and helper.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.400&lt;/ref&gt; He also used to help [[Sarada Devi]] in her chores.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.433&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar ===
At Dakshineswar Latu began a life of rigorous spiritual discipline under Ramakrishna's guidance, and also continued his service as his servant to him. His day began first seeing Ramakrishna and saluting him. As Latu had received no formal schooling, Ramakrishna hoped that he might acquire at least a rudimentary education, so he tried to teach him the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[alphabet]]s himself. However, Latu's [[Bihari people|Bihari]] accent was different from that of a Bengali and he could not read even the first [[vowel]] correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prabhavananda|first=Swami|title=The Sermon on the Mount According to Vedanta|page=36|chapter=The Salt of the Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UtISmcVWgYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA36,M1 | isbn=978-0-87481-050-9 | year=1991 | publisher=Vedanta Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramakrishna corrected him repeatedly with much amusement, and the experiment was later discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', pp.401-402&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Saradananda]], Ramakrishna's monastic disciple Latu was seen "praying and meditating the whole night and sleeping during the day. His life was a literal example of the teaching of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]'':'In that which is night to all beings, the man of self-control is awake; and where all beings are awake, there is night for the sage who sees (2.69)."&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.404&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Shyampukur and Cossipore ===
In the middle of 1885 Ramakrishna's throat became sore, which later developed into [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. To conveniently treat him, the devotees moved Ramakrishna from Dakshineswar to [[Shyampukur]], in North Calcutta. Latu, being his personal attendant went with him. He later moved on with Ramakrishna to [[Cossipore]] on 11 December 1885. He took care of nursing Ramakrishna during his final days, reminiscing about which Latu said, "Serving the Master was our worship. We didn't need any other spiritual disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.411&lt;/ref&gt; Latu received an ochre cloth and [[rosary]] from Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.412&lt;/ref&gt; After Ramakrishna's death on 16 August 1886, Latu went on a pilgrimage visiting [[Vrindaban]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ayodhya]] with [[Sarada Devi]], and other lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Calcutta ===
[[File:GirishChandraGosh group photo.jpg| thumb | right | Adbhutananda with [[Girish Chandra Ghosh]], [[Mahendranath Gupta]] and other disciples and devotees of Ramakrishna]]
After Ramakrishna's passing away, Narendra (Vivekananda) and some of the other disciples established the first Ramakrishna monastery at [[Baranagore]] in an old dilapidated house. Here some of the disciples including Naren took their monastic vows and were engaged in the study of the scriptures, practicing [[meditation]] and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.414&lt;/ref&gt; Latu joined them later in 1887 and accepted the monastic vows. Vivekananda]gave him the monastic name Adbhutananda, meaning, "He who finds bliss in the wonderful nature of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]."&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.415&lt;/ref&gt; According to his brother monks, Adbhutananda lead a very austere life at the monastery practicing meditation and ''[[japa]]''. He led the life of a wandering monk around Calcutta area, unattached to people and places. Sometimes he stayed at the home of other householder devotees, but most often was found living simply on the bank of the [[Ganges]]. Sometimes he stayed at [[Alambazar]] Math and [[Belur Math]].&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.417&lt;/ref&gt;
He also went on several pilgrimages to North India with his brother disciples including Vivekananda.&lt;ref&gt;''God lived with them'', p.422&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he moved to the house of [[Balaram Bose]], a householder devotee of Ramakrishna and stayed there till 1912. Here he was visited by people from different walks of life—judges, doctors, teachers, learned monks, and householders for spiritual instructions.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prabhavananda|first=Swami|title=The Sermon on the Mount According to Vedanta|page=36|chapter=The Salt of the Earth | quote = One day, several young monks came across a difficult passage in the [[Upanishads]], the ancient scriptures of the Hindus. They could not understand it, although they referred to a number of commentaries. Finally they asked Adbhutananda for an explanation. As he did not know Sanskrit, the young monks phrased the passage in this vernacular. Adbhutananda thought for a moment; then he said, "I've got it!" Using a simple illustration, he explained the passage to them, and they found wonderful meaninging it.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UtISmcVWgYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA36,M1 | isbn=978-0-87481-050-9 | year=1991 | publisher=Vedanta Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Varanasi ===
In October 1912 Adbhutananda left Balaram's hose for [[Varnasi]], never to return again.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.434&lt;/ref&gt; Here he first stayed at Ramakrishna [[Advaita Ashrama]] and later at different locations. As was characteristic of him, he was so often absorbed in meditation that he rarely had fixed time for meals. In Varanasi he continued to teach and people visited him for spiritual instructions.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Last days ====
During his last days, according to his devotees Adbhutananda seemed to be gradually withdrawing from the world. He spoke occasionally with people, and when he spoke it was generally of spiritual matters. As reported by this disciples, his body, which had once been remarkably strong, had been gradually weakened by age and years of intense spiritual disciplines and his indifference towards the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.436&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few years he suffered from [[diabetes]] and minor physical ailments. During the last year of his life he developed a blister on this leg, which developed into [[gangrene]].&lt;ref name="p437"&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.437&lt;/ref&gt; He was visited by his brother disciples—[[Turiyananda]] and [[Saradananda]].&lt;ref name="p437"/&gt; Eventually the gangrene worsened and the doctors operated several times on successive days, but were unsuccessful. Adbhutananda died in the holy city of [[Varnasi]] at 12:10 p.m on Saturday, 24 April 1920.&lt;ref name="p438"/&gt; Regarding his death, Turiyananda wrote in a letter to [[Josephine MacLeod]], an American devotee of Vivekananda, "He showed no signs of pain during his illness. But the wonder of all wonders was that after this death when his body was placed in a sitting position to conform with some of the funeral rites, we found him looking so beautiful, so serene, so full of peace and bliss. His face beamed with light and an intelligence unspeakable, as if he were taking leave from his friends for the last time with an exhortation of affectionate benediction."&lt;ref name="p438"&gt;''God Lived with Them'', p.438&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings and sayings ==
Adbhutananda, being illiterate, did not write any books; his teachings and sayings have been recorded by this disciples and devotees. Adbhutananda taught that "the true being in man is ever free, ever pure, and remains ever untouched by good or evil. Good and evil have no absolute reality. They exist only so long as man identifies himself with the ego, the [[false self]]. When the ego is completely annihilated, man is freed from the false knowledge of duality or relativity--of good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first= Astrid |title=Being Consciousness Bliss|page=161|chapter=Ignorance, Suffering and the Ego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEo58-ihNygC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA161,M1 | isbn=978-0-9701097-8-1 | year=2001 | publisher=SteinerBooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His other teachings were,
* What is the use of prayer and meditation if you have no dependence on Him ? Everything else is useless if you lack this.
* It is a great sin to find fault with others. You will invariably find that it is such people as never do a good act themselves who easily see defects in others and energetically spread rumors.
* It is better to continue calling on the Lord devotedly than to know, speak, and preach thousand and one religious cants and shibboleths.

'''Affirmations''' in [[New Thought]] and [[New Age]] terminology refer primarily to the practice of positive thinking and self-empowerment—fostering a belief that "a positive mental attitude supported by affirmations will achieve success in anything."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salemctr.com/newage/center32.html Supercharged Affirmations] The Salem New Age Center, Salem Massachusetts USA . Accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, an affirmation is a carefully formatted statement that should be repeated to one's self and written down frequently. For affirmations to be effective, it is said that they need to be present tense, positive, personal and specific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmindful.com/articles/affirmation-class-questions-and-answers Affirmation Class] May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Thought==
The [[New Thought]] movement is not part of New Age but does share certain practices. This concept has grown popular due to [[Rhonda Byrne]]'s ''[[The Secret (book)|The Secret]]'' (also a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[The Secret (2006 film)|film]])  These books and teachers express similar ideas to [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]''. [[Rhonda Byrne|Byrne]] was inspired in particular by [[Wallace D. Wattles]]' 1910 book ''[[The Science of Getting Rich]]''. Affirmations are also referred to in [[Neurolinguistic Programming]] (NLP), [[Neuro Associative Conditioning]] "NAC" as popularized by [[Anthony Robbins]], and [[hypnosis]].

A related belief is that a certain critical mass of people with a highly spiritual consciousness will bring about a sudden change in the whole population.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web | url = http://skepdic.com/monkey.html | title = The Hundredth Monkey Phenomenon | first = Robert Todd | last = Carroll | year = 2005 | work = Skeptic's Dictionary | accessdate = 2007-08-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070903180124/http://skepdic.com/monkey.html| archivedate= 3 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; And that humans have a responsibility to take part in positive creative activity and to work to heal ourselves, each other and the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/refs/2/1/113 Accepting Total and Complete Responsibility: New Age NeoFeminist Violence against Sethna] Feminism Psychology.1992; 2: pages 113–119&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Louise Hay]] a [[Religious Science]] Practitioner published ''[[You Can Heal Your Life]]'', a guide to changing thoughts and beliefs. Hay's affirmations are designed to help the user re-program their thought patterns, the intention being that harmful underlying beliefs which Hay believes psychologically support illness will be replaced with healing beliefs, and thus remove a barrier to healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hay|first=Louise|title=You Can Heal Your Life|year=1984|publisher=Hay House Inc.|location=Carlsbad, California|isbn=978-0-937611-01-2|pages=251|url=http://www.hayhouse.com/details.php?id=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Age==
[[Esther Hicks]], author of the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|''Law of Attraction'']] series,&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham, by (Spirit) Abraham, Abraham, Esther Hicks, Jerry Hicks, published by [[Hay House]], 2006,{{ISBN|1-4019-1227-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4019-1227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocates using affirmations when one is already in a state of happiness and peace.

New-Age affirmations come in different forms:

* spiritual talks
* lectures
* classes
* affirmative images,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everydayaffirmations.org/2013/02/daily-affirmations-13-feb-2013.html#.URsymB18nD4 Various forms of New Age Affirmations ] Everyday Affirmations Organisation. Accessed February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* affirmative words
* affirmative videos
* [[mantra]] chants

Proponents of New-Age affirmations say that with our thoughts, desires and emotions, we create our world.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Brendan Baker]], founder of [[The Start of Happiness]], affirmations work best when they encompass three elements:

# visualisation of the affirmation in one's [[personal life|life]]
# feeling the affirmation in one's physiology
# vocalizing the affirmation in a way that one is already congruent with that affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startofhappiness.com/positive-affirmations/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhonda Britten==
According to [[Rhonda Britten]], affirmations work best when combined with acknowledgements because the acknowledgements build up a backlog of results in one's mind to prove that one can do what one is affirming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Britten, Rhonda|title=Fearless Living|chapter=No Beating Yourself Up|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the acknowledgement "I bought a good pair of sneakers and some gym clothes" could complement the affirmation "I can reach my goal of losing 20 pounds." The goal is to focus on steps one has taken toward accomplishing one's goals rather than criticizing oneself for what one has not yet accomplished, or could theoretically have accomplished but did not.

==Scientific research==
A 2009 study found that positive affirmation had a small, positive effect on people with high self-esteem, but a detrimental effect on those with low self esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem who made positive affirmations felt worse than individuals who made positive statements but were allowed to consider ways in which the statements were false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Joanne V.|last2=Perunovic|first2=W. Q. Elaine|last3=Lee|first3=John W.|date=July 2009|title=Positive self-statements: power for some, peril for others|journal=Psychological Science|volume=20|issue=7|pages=860–866|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02370.x|issn=1467-9280|pmid=19493324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found that [[self-affirmation]]s, which involve writing about one's core values rather than repeating a positive self-statement, can improve performance under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Geoffrey L.|last2=Sherman|first2=David K.|date=2014|title=The psychology of change: self-affirmation and social psychological intervention|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=65|pages=333–371|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115137|issn=1545-2085|pmid=24405362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4731">'''Andries Hugo Donald Mac Leod''' (10 August 1891 – 28 March 1977) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[Sweden|Swedish]] [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].

Andries Mac Leod was born in [[Ledeberg]], a suburb of [[Ghent]], as a son of [[Julius Mac Leod]], a botanist and professor at [[Ghent University]], and of Fanny Mac Leod born Maertens, who was translator from English into Dutch of two books by
[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]].

While Mac Leod was attending the atheneum in Ghent, he already got interested in [[philosophy]] and he was one of the founders of a ''Wijsgerige Kring'' (philosophical circle) there. One of the other members of this circle was
[[Marcel Minnaert]], with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship.

Mac Leod studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at [[Ghent University]], where he obtained his [[doctorate]] in July 1914 by submitting a [[thesis]] on a problem in [[fluid mechanics]] (which appeared later as [[#MacLeod1923|Mac Leod 1923]]). Immediately afterwards he travelled for holidays to [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]] in [[Sweden]]. There he learnt that the German army had [[Western Front (World War I)|invaded Belgium]] on 4 August 1914. He decided to stay in Sweden. He got a job in the large mathematical library of [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] in [[Djursholm]] near [[Stockholm]]. He also attended the seminars of the philosopher [[Adolph Phalén]] at [[Uppsala University]]. He was deeply impressed by Phalén's work.

In 1921 Mac Leod returned to Belgium, where he became a high school teacher in mathematics and physics, first in [[Diest]] and later in Ghent. In 1922 he married with Gunhild Sahlén, whom he had met during his stay in Sweden. In that year also his first book appeared, an introduction to [[non-Euclidean geometry]] ([[#MacLeod1922|Mac Leod 1922]]). In 1927 his first philosophical monograph ([[#MacLeod1927|Mac Leod 1927]]) was published.

In February 1939 he moved with his wife to Sweden, where he would stay during the rest of his life, devoting all his time to philosophical research on fundamental [[ontology|ontological]] and [[epistemology|epistemological]] questions. Notably he published two lengthy philosophical monographs in Swedish ([[#MacLeod1960|Mac Leod 1960]], [[#MacLeod1972|Mac Leod 1972]]).
In 1960 he got an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] at [[Uppsala University]] and a few years later he was honoured with a [[Festschrift]] ([[#HenschenDahlquist1966|Henschen-Dahlquist 1966]]).

'''Ascodroutes''', in antiquity, were a [[sect]] of [[Christian]] [[heresy|heretics]] in the 2nd century, who rejected all use of [[sacrament]]s, on the principle that incorporeal things cannot be communicated by things visible and corporeal. They made perfect [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] consist in the knowledge of the [[universe]] ([[Theodoret]], lib. 1. ''Haereticarum fabularum compendium'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1081">'''Athenodorus of Soli''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀθηνόδωρος ὁ Σολεύς}}) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher, and disciple of [[Zeno of Citium]], who lived in the 3rd century BC.

He was the son of Athenodorus, and was born in the town of [[Soli, Cilicia]], and was the compatriot of another disciple of Zeno, [[Chrysippus]]. Athenodorus was the brother of the poet [[Aratus of Soli]],&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Aratos''&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the long didactic poem, ''Phaenomena''. Both brothers followed the teachings of Zeno.

He is mentioned in the list given by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] as the disciple of Zeno.&lt;ref name="diog1"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii.''&lt;/ref&gt; He may be the dedicatee of the work ''On Definite Propositions'' ({{lang-el|Περὶ τῶν ϰαταγορευτιϰῶν}}) written by Chrysippus.&lt;ref name="diog1"/&gt;

'''{{IAST|Aśvaghoṣa}}''' or '''Ashvaghosha''' ({{IPA|/'əɕʋə'gʰoːʂə/}}; {{circa|80|150 [[Common Era|CE]]}}) was a [[Buddhist]] philosopher, dramatist, poet and orator from [[India]]. He was born in [[Saketa]] in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manu's Code of Law |editor1-first=Patrick |editor1-last=Olivelle |editor2-first=Suman |editor2-last=Olivelle |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780195171464 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnHo02RtONMC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have been the first [[Sanskrit]] dramatist, and is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to [[Kālidāsa]]. He was the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers, whose epics rivalled the contemporary [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas much of Buddhist literature prior to the time of Aśvaghoṣa had been composed in [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]], Aśvaghoṣa wrote in [[Classical Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="teachYourselfSanskrit"&gt;{{cite book | last = Coulson | first = Michael | title = Sanskrit | publisher = NTC Pub.

==Life as an ascetic==
According to the traditional biography of Aśvaghoṣa,&lt;ref&gt;Li Rongxi (2002). The Life of Asvaghosa Bodhisattva; in: [https://web.archive.org/web/20140820052907/http://www.bdk.or.jp/pdf/bdk/digitaldl/dBET_LivesGreatMonksNuns_2002.pdf The Lives of Great Monks and Nuns], Berkeley CA: Numata Center for Translation and Research, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart H. Young (trans.), [https://web.archive.org/web/20140103164731/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/103180.htm Biography of the Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa], Maming pusa zhuan 馬鳴菩薩傳, T.50.2046.183a, translated by Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva.&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated into Chinese by [[Kumārajīva]], and preserved in that language, he was originally a wandering [[ascetic]] who was able to defeat all-comers in debate.

He set a challenge to the [[Buddhist]] monks that if none could meet with him in debate then they should stop beating the wood-block which signalled to the people to bring offerings to them. There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the wood-block.

However, in the north there was an elder bhikṣu named Pārśva at the time, who saw that if he could convert this ascetic, it would be a great asset to the propagation of the [[Dharma]], so he travelled from northern [[India]] and had the wood-block sounded.

The ascetic came to ask why it had been sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to debate with him, he accepted the challenge. After seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, his Ministers, and many ascetics and brahmans. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other.

They agreed that the elder Pārśva should speak first, and he said: "The world should be made peaceable, with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy throughout the land, with none of the myriad calamities", to which the ascetic had no response and so was bound to become Pārśva's disciple, and he was given full ordination as a bhikṣu.

Although he had to consent to this, he still was not convinced of the elder's virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Bases of Spiritual Power ([[Iddhipada|r̥ddhipādāḥ]]), at which point he gained faith. Pārśva then taught him the 5 Faculties, the 5 Powers, the 7 Factors and the 8-fold Noble Path, and he eventually mastered the teaching.

Later, the central kingdom was besieged by the [[Kushana|Kuṣāna]] King's army, who demanded 300,000 gold pieces in tribute. The King could not pay so much, as he had only 100,000. The Kuṣāna King therefore asked for the Buddha's begging bowl, the converted monk, and the 100,000 gold pieces for his tribute.

Although the King of the central kingdom was unhappy, the monk persuaded him it would be for the good of the propagation of the Dharma which would spread across the four continents if he went with the Kuṣāna King. He was therefore taken away.

The Kuṣāna's King's Ministers, however, were unhappy, not thinking that the bhikṣu was priced correctly at 100,000 gold pieces. The King, who knew the worth of bhiksu, ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The King then made an assembly and had the bhikṣu preach the Dharma.

Even the horses, whose favourite food was placed in front of them, were entranced by the Teaching of the monk, and listened intently. Everybody was thereby convinced of his worth. He was then granted the name Aśvaghoṣa, Horse-Cry.

He travelled throughout northern India proclaiming the Dharma and guiding all through his wisdom and understanding, and he was held in great regard by the four-fold assembly, who knew him as The Sun of Merit and Virtue.

He was previously believed to have been the author of the influential [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] text ''[[Awakening of Mahayana Faith]]'', but modern scholars agree that the text was composed in China.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan.

Routledge, 2007, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent research into his kavya poems have revealed that he may have used the [[Yogacarabhumi]] as a textual reference, particularly for the Saundarananda, which opens up the possibility he was affiliated with either the [[Yogacara]] or the [[Sautrantika]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Yamabe, Nobuyoshi. 'On the School Affiliation of Aśvaghoṣa: "Sautrāntika" or "Yogācāra"?' ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Vol. 26 (2), 225-249, 2003.

He wrote an [[epic poetry|epic]] life of the Buddha called ''[[Buddhacharita]]''&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Cowell (trans): Buddhist Mahâyâna Texts, "The Buddha-karita of Asvaghosha", [[Sacred Books of the East]], Clarendon Press, Oxford 1894.

The monk [[Yijing (monk)|I-tsing]] (Yijing) mentioned that in his time ''Buddhacarita'' was "...extensively read in all the five parts of India and in the countries of the South Sea (Sumātra, Jāva and the neighbouring islands). He clothed manifold notions and ideas in a few words which so delighted the heart of his reader that he never wearied of perusing the poem. Moreover it was regarded as a virtue to read it in as much as it contained the noble doctrine in a neat compact form."&lt;ref name="ancient-buddhist-texts.net"&gt;J.K.

It described in 28 chapters the whole Life of the Buddha from his birth until his entry into Parinirvāna. During the Muslim invasions of the 10th – 12th centuries, half of the original Sanskrit text was lost.&lt;ref name="ancient-buddhist-texts.net"/&gt; Today, the second half only exists in Chinese and Tibetan translations.

He also wrote ''Sundarananda'', a [[kavya|kāvya]] poem with the theme of conversion of Nanda, Buddha's half-brother, so that he might reach salvation.

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
The '''Bahá'í Faith''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑ:|i:|,_|-|ˈ|h|aɪ}}; {{lang-fa |بهائی}} ''{{transl|fa|Bahā'i}}'') is a [[religion]] teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people.{{sfn|Dictionary|2017}} Established by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 1863, it initially grew in [[Iran]] and parts of the [[Middle East]], where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} Currently it has between 5 and 7 million adherents, known as Bahá'ís, spread out into most of the world's countries and territories.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010}}

It grew from the mid-19th-century [[Bábism|Bábí religion]], whose founder taught that God would soon send a [[prophet]] in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|Akka]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]&lt;ref&gt;Scholch, Alexander. “The Demographic Development of Palestine, 1850-1882.” International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 17, no. 4, 1985, pp. 485–505. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/163415.&lt;/ref&gt;. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] (1844–1921), and later his great-grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]] (1897–1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the [[Universal House of Justice]], the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in [[Haifa]], Israel, near the [[Shrine of the Báb]].

Bahá'í teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]] is considered single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through [[Manifestations of God]] who are the founders of [[major world religions]] throughout history; [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]] being the most recent in the period before the [[Báb]] and Bahá'u'lláh. Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all people]], openly rejecting notions of [[racism]] and [[nationalism]]. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings is the goal of a [[New world order (Bahá'í)|unified world order]] that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.&lt;ref name="Hatcher"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Baha'i |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Global Religion |editor1=Mark Juergensmeyer |editor2=Wade Clark Roof |author=Moojan Momen |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=October 1, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7619-2729-7 |doi=10.4135/9781412997898.n61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters written by Bahá'u'lláh to various individuals, including some heads of state, have been collected and assembled into a canon of [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] that includes works by his son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], and also [[Báb|the Báb]], who is regarded as Bahá'u'lláh's forerunner. Prominent among Bahá'í literature are the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'', ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', and ''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]''.

==Etymology==
In English-language use, the word ''Bahá'í '' is used either as an adjective to refer to the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole.{{sfn|Stockman|2006}} It is derived from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Greatest Name|Bahá‘]]}} ({{lang|ar|بهاء}}), meaning "glory" or "splendor", although the word ''Bahá'í'' is actually Persian from the Arabic root (the {{lang|fa-Latn|í}} suffix is [[Persian language|Persian]]).{{NoteTag|Bahá'ís prefer the orthographies ''Bahá'í'', ''Bahá'ís'', ''the Báb'', ''Bahá'u'lláh'', and ''`Abdu'l-Bahá '', using a [[Bahá'í orthography|particular transcription]] of the Arabic and Persian in publications. "Bahai", "Bahais", "Baha'i", "the Bab", "Bahaullah" and "Baha'u'llah" are often used when [[diacritic]]s are unavailable.}} The term "Bahaism" (or "Baha'ism") is still used, mainly in a pejorative sense.{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Centre for Faith and the Media}}

==Beliefs==
{{Main|Bahá'í teachings}}
Three core principles establish a basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|unity of God]], the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} From these concepts stem the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=108–109}}

===God===
{{Main|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[File:Bahaitemplesydney.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A white domed building|Bahá'í Temple in [[Ingleside, New South Wales|Ingleside]], Sydney, Australia]]
The Bahá'í writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=106}} The [[existence of God]] and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=106–107}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=111–112}}

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}{{sfn|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}} In the Bahá'í religion, God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]]. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}{{sfn|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}} According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]], and being of service to others.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}

===Religion===

{{See also|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)}}
[[File:Wilmette how side.jpg|upright|alt=A white column with ornate designs carved into it, including a Star of David|left|thumb|Symbols of many religions on a pillar of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)|Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.]]

Bahá'í notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]] that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert H. Stockman |title=The Baha'i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eezSINHndMC&amp;pg=PA41 |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4411-0447-2 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.{{sfn|McMullen|2000|p=7}}

Bahá'í beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religious beliefs.{{sfn|Stockman|1997}} Bahá'ís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own [[Bahá'í literature|scriptures]], [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[Bahá'í laws|laws]], and [[Bahá'í history|history]].{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}{{sfn|Bausani|2012}} While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in [[Shi'a Islam]] being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.{{sfn|Van der Vyer|1996|p=449}}  Muslim institutions and clergy, both [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], consider Bahá'ís to be deserters or [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates from Islam]], which has led to Bahá'ís being [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecuted]].{{sfn|Boyle|Sheen|1997|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|Afshari|2001|pp=119–120}} Bahá'ís describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings to the modern context.{{sfn|Lundberg|2005}} Bahá'u'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the [[Eschatology|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.{{sfb|Buck|2004|pp=143–178}}

===Human beings===
{{See also|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|Bahá'í Faith on life after death}}
[[File:Ringstone.svg|alt=A stylized Arabic figure which has intersecting lines that lock around rings and five-pointed stars to either side|thumb|right|The [[Bahá'í symbols#Ringstone symbol|Ringstone symbol]] represents humanity's connection to God.]]
The Bahá'í writings state that human beings have a "rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through his [[Manifestation of God|messengers]], and to conform to their teachings.{{sfn|McMullen|2000|pp=57–58}} Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.{{sfn|Masumian|1995}}

The Bahá'í writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

===Summary===
{{Bahá'í texts sidebar}}
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bedrock of the Bahá'í Faith:

{{quote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or tradition; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and [[Bahá'í Faith and science|science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed].{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=281–282}}}}

===Social principles===
The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Principles of the Bahá'í Faith|26 March 2006}} The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.{{sfn|Bausani|2012}}{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=438–446|ps=: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-i {{nowrap|"Bahaism: The Faith"}} ]}}

Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}}}
* Obedience to government and non-involvement in partisan politics.{{NoteTag|Obedience to government is not applicable when submission to law amounts to a denial of Faith. See for example: [http://www.bahaistudies.net/nonpolitical.html Political Non-involvement and Obedience to Government&amp;nbsp;– A compilation of some of the Messages of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice] (compiled by Dr. Peter J. Khan)}}
* Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty

With specific regard to the pursuit of world peace, Bahá'u'lláh prescribed a world-embracing [[collective security]] arrangement for the establishment of a temporary era of peace referred to in the Baha'i teachings as the Lesser Peace. For the establishment of a lasting peace (The Most Great Peace) and the purging of the "overwhelming Corruptions" it is necessary that all the people of the world universally unite under a universal Faith.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=266–267}}

===Covenant===
{{Main|Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh}}
The Bahá'í teachings speak of a "Greater Covenant",{{sfn|Taherzadeh |1972}} being universal and endless, and a "Lesser Covenant", being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bahá'í writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.{{sfn|Momen|1995|ps=: {{nowrap|"Lower covenant"}}}} The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.
With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an [[Bahá'í administration|administration]] they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any [[Bahá'í divisions]] have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following.{{sfn|MacEoin|1989|p=448}} The followers of such divisions are regarded as [[Covenant-breaker]]s and shunned, essentially [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].{{sfn|Momen|1995|ps=: {{nowrap|"Lower covenant"}}}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=173}}

==Canonical texts==
{{Main|Bahá'í literature}}
The ''canonical texts'' are the writings of the [[Báb]], Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the [[Universal House of Justice]], and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=100–101|ps=: {{nowrap|"Canonical texts"}}}} Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the ''Most Holy Book'', which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society,{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=46}} the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], literally the ''Book of Certitude'', which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief,{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=137}} the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]], which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the [[Seven Valleys]] and [[the Four Valleys]] which are mystical treatises.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=20}}

===Mystical writings===
Although the Bahá'í teachings have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} [[The_Seven_Valleys|''The Seven Valleys'']] is considered Bahá'u'lláh's "greatest mystical composition." It was written to a follower of [[Sufism]], in the style of [[Attar Neyshapuri|`Attar]], the [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslim poet,{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=311|ps=: {{nowrap|"Seven Valleys"}}}} and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bahá'u'lláh to the West. ''[[Hidden Words|The Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Bahá'u'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Bahá'u'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=181|ps=: {{nowrap|"Hidden Words"}}}}

{{Main|History of the Bahá'í Faith}}
The Bahá'í Faith formed from the Persian religion of the Báb, a merchant who began preaching a new interpretation of Shia Islam in 1844. The Báb's claim to divine revelation was rejected by the generality of Islamic clergy in Iran, ending in his public execution by authorities in 1850. The Báb taught that God would soon send a new messenger, and Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh to be that person.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} Although they are distinct movements, the Báb is so interwoven into Bahá'í theology and history that Bahá'ís celebrate his birth, death, and declaration as [[Bahá'í Holy Days|holy days]], consider him one of their three central figures (along with Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá), and a historical account of the Bábí movement (''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]'') is considered one of three books that every Bahá'í should "master" and read "over and over again".&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer dated 9 June 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í community was mostly confined to the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Bahá'u'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|1987|p=125}} Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=56}}

===The Báb===
{{Main|Báb}}
[[File:Shrine Bab North West.jpg|left|alt=A domed building|thumb|upright|[[Shrine of the Báb]] in Haifa, Israel]]
On the evening of 22 May 1844, Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad of Shiraz gained his first convert and took on the title of "the Báb" ({{lang|ar|الباب}} "the Gate"), referring to his later claim to the status of [[Mahdi]] of Shi`a Islam.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} His followers were therefore known as [[Bábism|Bábís]]. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]]'s army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.{{sfn|Winter|1997}}

Bahá'ís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Bahá'í Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá'ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be in 1863.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The Báb's tomb, located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], is an important place of [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bahá'ís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from [[Iran]] to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Bahá'u'lláh.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}} The main written works translated into English of the Báb's are collected in [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb]] out of the estimated 135 works.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|September 2002|pp=349–350}}

===Bahá'u'lláh===
{{Main|Bahá'u'lláh}}
Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852–53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Shah]]. Although they acted alone, the government responded with [[collective punishment]], killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[Síyáh-Chál]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the [[Maid of Heaven]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}}

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from Tehran to [[Baghdad]], in the Ottoman Empire;{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} then to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]); and then to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Bahá'u'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Bahá'ís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including [[Pope Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III]], and [[Queen Victoria]].

He produced over 18,000 works in his lifetime, in both Arabic and Persian, of which only 8% have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Stockman, R. H. (2012). The Baha'i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed. A&amp;C Black. pp. 2 &lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan [[Abdülâziz]] a final time in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|`Akká]], in present-day [[Israel]]. Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city.{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=422–429|ps=: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-allah {{nowrap|"BAHĀʾ-ALLĀH"}} ]}} He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at [[Mansion of Bahjí|Bahjí]] as the [[Qiblih]] to which they turn in prayer each day.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=20–21, 28}}

===`Abdu'l-Bahá===
[[File:‘Abdu’l-Bahá portrait.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bahá]]
{{Main|`Abdu'l-Bahá}}
`Abbás Effendi was Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will]] that appointed `Abdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Bahá'í community, and designated him as the "Centre of the Covenant", "Head of the Faith", and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=47}} `Abdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bahá'í Faith.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}}

There are over 27,000 extant documents by `Abdu'l-Bahá, mostly letters, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|September 2002|pp=349–350}}  Among the more well known are ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'', the ''[[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]]'', and ''[[Some Answered Questions]]''. Additionally notes taken of a number of his talks were published in various volumes like ''[[Paris Talks]]'' during his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|journeys to the West]].

===Bahá'í administration===
{{Main|Bahá'í administration}}
Bahá'u'lláh's ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' and ''The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]'' are foundational documents of the Bahá'í administrative order. Bahá'u'lláh established the elected [[Universal House of Justice]], and `Abdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=55–57}} In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bahá appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, serving as head of the religion until his death, for 36 years.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=55}}

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated [[Bahá'í texts]]; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bahá'í community; developed the [[Bahá'í World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} He died in 1957 under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=347–363}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=58–69}}

At local, regional, and national levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]], which run the affairs of the religion. There are also [[Institution of the Counsellors|appointed individuals]] working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Bahá'í Faith does not have.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=160}} The [[Universal House of Justice]], first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies.{{sfn|Stockman|1995}} Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=205}}

===International plans===
[[File:Willmette how.jpg|thumb|alt=A white domed building with a large garden leading toward it|The [[Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)|Bahá'í House of Worship]], [[Wilmette, Illinois]], is the oldest surviving Bahai House of Worship in the world.{{sfn|Ryan|1987|p=6}}]]
In 1937, Shoghi Effendi launched a seven-year plan for the Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946.{{sfn|Danesh|Danesh|Danesh|1991}} In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the [[Ten Year Crusade|Ten Year World Crusade]]. This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of [[Bahá'í texts]] into several new languages, and the sending of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í pioneers]] into previously unreached nations.{{sfn|Hassal|1996|pp=1–21}} He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.{{sfn|Smith|Momen|1989|pp=63–91}}

Annually, on 21 April, the Universal House of Justice sends a ‘[[Ridván]]’ message to the worldwide Bahá’í community,{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=297|ps=: "Ridván"}} which generally gives an update on the progress made concerning the current plan, and provides further guidance for the year to come.{{NoteTag|All Ridván messages can be found at [http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages Bahai.org] and [http://bahaiprayers.net/Ridvan Bahaiprayers.net/Ridvan] (multi-lingual).}} The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as [[Bahá'í study circle|study circles]].{{sfn|Gervais|2008}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|17 January 2003}} Further focuses are involvement in [[Socioeconomic development and the Bahá'í Faith|social action]] and participation in the prevalent discourses of society.{{sfn|Vahedi|2 March 2011}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|21 April 2010}} The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.{{sfn|Universal House Of Justice|2006}}

They further state: "The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha’i was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region."{{sfn|Johnson|Grim|2013|pp=59–62}} This source's only systematic flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than other cross-national data sets.{{sfn|Hsu|Reynolds|Hackett|Gibbon|2008|pp=691–692}}

From its origins in the Persian and Ottoman Empires, by the early 20th century there were a number of converts in [[South Asia|South]] and [[South East Asia]], Europe, and North America. During the 1950s and 1960s, vast travel teaching efforts brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world. By the 1990s, Bahá'ís were developing programs for systematic consolidation on a large scale, and the early 21st century saw large influxes of new adherents around the world.

According to ''[[World Almanac|The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004]]'':

{{quote|The majority of Bahá'ís live in Asia (3.6 million), Africa (1.8 million), and Latin America (900,000).

The Bahá'í Faith is a medium-sized religion{{sfn|Lewis|2008|p=118|ps=: "Baha'i ... is a medium-sized religion of seven million adherents."}} and was listed in ''The Britannica Book of the Year'' (1992–present) as the second most widespread of the world's independent religions in terms of the number of countries represented. According to ''Britannica'', the Bahá'í Faith (as of 2010) is established in 221 countries and territories and has an estimated seven million adherents worldwide.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010}} Additionally, Bahá'ís have self-organized in most of the nations of the world.

==Social practices==
{{See also|Bahá'í laws}}

===Exhortations===
The following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are required or encouraged of his followers.
* Bahá'ís over the age of 15 should individually recite an [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form.
* In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, Bahá'ís should offer daily devotional prayer and to meditate and study sacred scripture.
* Adult Bahá'ís should observe a [[Nineteen-Day Fast]] each year during daylight hours in March, with certain exemptions.
* There are specific requirements for Bahá'í burial that include a specified prayer to be read at the interment. Embalming or cremating the body is strongly discouraged.
* Bahá'ís should make a 19% voluntary payment on any wealth in excess of what is necessary to live comfortably, after the remittance of any outstanding debt. These [[Huqúqu'lláh]] payments are to be used for philanthropic purposes.

===Prohibitions===
[[File:Bahá'í gardens by David Shankbone.jpg|alt=Elaborate gardens with several gates and a walkway leading to a domed building in the distance|thumb|[[Bahá'í gardens]] in [[Haifa, Israel]]]]
The following are a few examples from Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are prohibited or discouraged.
* [[Backbiting]] and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
* Drinking or selling [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] is forbidden.
* [[Sexual intercourse]] is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus premarital, extramarital, or homosexual intercourse are forbidden. ''(See also [[Homosexuality and the Bahá'í Faith]])''
* Abstaining from [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] politics is required.
* Begging as a profession is forbidden.

While some of the laws from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time, others are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í,{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=158}} and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=223–225|ps=: "Law"}}{{sfn|Walbridge|1996}}

===Marriage===
{{Main|Bahá'í marriage}}
The purpose of marriage in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=164–165}} The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a ''fortress for well-being and salvation'' and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of [[society|human society]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required [[chastity]] outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other.{{sfn|Baha'is of Warwick|12 October 2003}} [[Interracial marriage]] is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}}

Bahá'ís intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} Although parents should not [[Arranged marriage|choose partners for their children]], once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, whether they are Bahá'í or not. The Bahá'í marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} The vows are "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God."{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}}

===Work===
Bahá'u'lláh prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=154–155}} [[Monasticism]] is forbidden, and Bahá'ís are taught to practice spirituality while engaging in useful work.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

===Places of worship===
{{Main|Bahá'í House of Worship}}
[[File:House of Worship Germany 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A white domed building with palm trees in front of it|Bahá'í House of Worship, [[Langenhain]], Germany]]
Most Bahá'í meetings occur in individuals' homes, local Bahá'í centers, or rented facilities. Worldwide, there are currently ten Bahá'í Houses of Worship, eight Mother Temples and two local Houses of Worship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baha'i Temples A Brief Introduction|url=http://bahaiblog.net/site/2018/07/bahai-temples-a-brief-introduction/|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further three  planned as of April 2012.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|22 April 2012}} Bahá'í writings refer to an institution called a "Ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;riqu'l-A&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;kár" (Dawning-place of the Mention of God), which is to form the center of a complex of institutions including a hospital, university, and so on.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=194}} The first ever Ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;riqu'l-A&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;kár in [[Ashgabat|`Ishqábád, Turkmenistan]], has been the most complete House of Worship.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=236|ps=: {{nowrap|"Mashriqu'l-Adkhar"}}}}

===Calendar===
{{Main|Bahá'í calendar}}
The Bahá'í calendar is based upon the calendar established by the [[Báb]]. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five [[Ayyám-i-Há|intercalary days]], to make a full [[Tropical year|solar year]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw Rúz]], and occurs on the [[vernal equinox]], near 21 March, at the end of the month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty).{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=188–190}} The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 [[Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=188}}

===Symbols===
[[File:051907 Wilmette IMG 1404 The Greatest Name.jpg|alt=Arabic script inscribed on a metal plate|thumb|upright=1.25|The calligraphy of the [[Bahá'í symbols#The Greatest Name|Greatest Name]]]]
{{Main|Bahá'í symbols}}
The symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Bahá’ ({{lang|ar|بهاء}} "splendor" or "glory"), with a [[Abjad numerals|numerical value]] of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the [[nine-pointed star]].{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=167–168|ps=: {{nowrap|"Greatest Name"}}}} The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two five-pointed stars interspersed with a stylized Bahá’ whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses,{{sfn|Faizi|1968}} while the latter is a calligraphic rendering of the phrase Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá ({{lang|ar|يا بهاء الأبهى}} "O Glory of the Most Glorious!").{{clear left}}The five-pointed star is the official symbol of the Bahá'í Faith,{{sfn|Effendi|1973|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Bahai-library.com|Nine-Pointed Star}} known as the ''Haykal'' ("temple"). It was initiated and established by the [[Báb]] and various works were written in calligraphy shaped into a five-pointed star.{{sfn|Beyer|2017}}

Since its inception the Bahá'í Faith has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,{{sfn|Momen|1994|ps=: Section 9: Social and economic development}}  promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,{{sfn|Kingdon|1997}} and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.{{sfn|Momen|1994|ps=: Section 9: Social and economic development}}

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.{{sfn|Smith|Momen|1989|pp=63–91}}

Current initiatives of social action include activities in areas like health, sanitation, education, gender equality, arts and media, agriculture, and the environment.{{sfn|Bahá’í Office of Social and Economic Development|2018}} Educational projects include schools, which range from village tutorial schools to large secondary schools, and some universities.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} By 2017 there were an estimated 40,000 small scale projects, 1,400 sustained projects, and 135 Bahá'í inspired organizations.{{sfn|Bahá’í Office of Social and Economic Development|2018}}

===United Nations===
Bahá'u'lláh wrote of the need for [[world government]] in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Bahá'í community has chosen to support efforts of improving [[international relations]] through organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]], with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} The [[Bahá'í International Community]] is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:{{sfn|McMullen|2000|p=39}}{{sfn|Bahá'í International Community|6 June 2000}}
* [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF)
* [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM)
* [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC)
* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)
* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)

The Bahá'í International Community has offices at the United Nations in New York and [[Geneva]] and representations to United Nations regional commissions and other offices in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Bangkok]], [[Nairobi]], Rome, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], and [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Bahá'í International Community|6 June 2000}} In recent years an Office of the Environment and an Office for the Advancement of Women were established as part of its United Nations Office. The Bahá'í Faith has also undertaken joint development programs with various other United Nations agencies. In the 2000 [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Forum]] of the United Nations a Bahá'í was invited as the only non-governmental speaker during the summit.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|8 September 2000}}

[[File:Cemetery of yazd.jpg|alt=Broken cinder blocks and felled palm trees|thumb|upright=1.25|The Bahá'í cemetery in [[Yazd]] after its desecration by the Iranian government]]
Bahá'ís continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion, but rather as [[apostasy from Islam]]. The most severe persecutions have occurred in [[Bahá'í Faith in Iran|Iran]], where more than 200 Bahá'ís were executed between 1978 and 1998,{{sfn|International Federation of Human Rights|August 2003}} and in [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt|Egypt]]. The rights of Bahá'ís have been restricted to greater or lesser extents in numerous other countries, including [[Bahá'í Faith in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222323 Afghanistan]}} [[Indonesia]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222133 Indonesia]}} [[Iraq]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222291 Iraq]}} [[Morocco]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222305 Morocco]}} [[Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;Bahá’í World News Service.

===Iran===
The marginalization of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}} In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed.{{sfn|Nash|1982}} Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}}{{sfn|Sanasarian|2000|pp=52–53}}

During the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], to divert attention from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted.{{NoteTag|In line with this is the thinking that the government encouraged the campaign to distract attention from more serious problems, including acute economic difficulties. Beyond this lay the difficulty which the regime faced in harnessing the nationalist movement that had supported Musaddiq.{{harv|Akhavi|1980|pp=76–78}}}} An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}} In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=432}} Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}}{{sfn|Simpson|Shubart|1995|p=223}}

Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 Iranian [[Isfahan|Bahá'ís]] have regularly had their homes ransacked or have been banned from attending university or from holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in study circles.{{sfn|International Federation of Human Rights|August 2003}} Bahá'í cemeteries have been desecrated and property has been seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of Mírzá Buzurg, Bahá'u'lláh's father.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} The House of the Báb in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], one of three sites to which Bahá'ís perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}}{{sfn|Netherlands Institute of Human Rights|8 March 2006}}{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|2005}}
In May 2018, the Iranian authorities expelled a young woman student from university of [[Isfahan]] because she was Bahá'í.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woman Expelled From Iranian University Just Before Obtaining Degree Because She’s Baha’i |url=https://iranhumanrights.org/2018/07/woman-expelled-from-iranian-university-just-before-obtaining-degree-because-shes-bahai/ |website=Center for Human Rights in Iran |accessdate=23 August 2018 |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, two more Bahá'í students were expelled  from universities in the cities of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]] and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] because of their religion. 

According to a US panel, attacks on Bahá'ís in Iran increased under [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s presidency.{{sfn|CNN|16 May 2008}}{{sfn|Sullivan|8 December 2009}} The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran ordering its members to identify Bahá'ís and to monitor their activities. Due to these actions, the [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on 20 March 2006, that she "also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bahá'í faith, in violation of international standards. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.{{sfn|Jahangir|2006}}

On 14 May 2008, members of an informal body known as the "Friends" that oversaw the needs of the Bahá'í community in Iran were arrested and taken to [[Evin prison]].{{sfn|CNN|16 May 2008}}{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|15 May 2008}}  The Friends court case has been postponed several times, but was finally underway on 12 January 2010.{{sfn|CNN|12 January 2010}} Other observers were not allowed in the court. Even the defence lawyers, who for two years have had minimal access to the defendants, had difficulty entering the courtroom. The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said that it seems that the government has already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law.{{sfn|CNN|12 January 2010}} Further sessions were held on 7 February 2010,{{sfn|Washington TV|2010}} 12 April 2010{{sfn|Djavadi|8 April 2010}} and 12 June 2010.{{sfn|Radio Free Europe|3 June 2010}} On 11 August 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners{{sfn|Siegal|2010}} which was later reduced to ten years.{{sfn|CNN|16 September 2010}} After the sentence, they were transferred to [[Gohardasht prison]].{{sfn|AFP|16 February 2011}} In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years.{{sfn|AFP|31 March 2011}} On 3 January 2010, Iranian authorities detained ten more members of the Baha'i minority, reportedly including Leva Khanjani, granddaughter of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of seven Baha'i leaders jailed since 2008 and in February, they arrested his son, Niki Khanjani.{{sfn|The Jerusalem Post|14 February 2010}}

The Iranian government claims that the Bahá'í Faith is not a religion, but is instead a political organization, and hence refuses to recognize it as a minority religion.{{sfn|Kravetz|1982|p=237}} However, the government has never produced convincing evidence supporting its characterization of the Bahá'í community.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2008|p=5}} Also, the government's statements that Bahá'ís who recanted their religion would have their rights restored, attest to the fact that Bahá'ís are persecuted solely for their religious affiliation.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|p=9}} The Iranian government also accuses the Bahá'í Faith of being associated with [[Zionism]] because the Bahá'í World Centre is located in Haifa, Israel.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|loc=Statement of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Buenos Aires, 26 September 1979}} These accusations against the Bahá'ís have no basis in historical fact,{{sfn|Cooper|1993|p=20}}{{sfn|Simpson|Shubart|1995|p=223}}{{sfn|Tavakoli-Targhi|2008|p=200}} and the accusations are used by the Iranian government to use the Bahá'ís as "scapegoats".{{sfn|Freedman|26 June 2009}} In fact it was the Iranian leader Naser al-Din Shah Qajar who banished Bahá'u'lláh from [[Persia]] to the Ottoman Empire and Bahá'u'lláh was later exiled by the Ottoman Sultan, at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in Syria, which only a century later was incorporated into the state of [[Israel]].{{sfn|Momen|2004|pp=27–29}}

===Egypt===
Bahá'í institutions and community activities have been illegal under Egyptian law since 1960. All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, have been confiscated by the government and [[fatwa]]s have been issued charging Bahá'ís with [[apostasy]].{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222287 Egypt]}}

The [[Egyptian identification card controversy]] began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of [[identity documents]], which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.{{sfn|Bigelow|16 November 2005}} Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|17 April 2009}} The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|14 August 2009}}

'''Bernard Philip Kelly''' (1907—1958) was an English Catholic layman who worked in a bank, raised a large family, and regularly penned, over 25 years, philosophical essays and book reviews for the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] journal ''Blackfriars''. His friendship with foremost British [[Thomism|Thomists]] and leading [[Distributism|distributists]] of his day, and with the Indian scholar [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]—along with his love for the poetry of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]—permitted his short life to become the matrix of a rich body of writings.

==Works==
Kelly's inspiration was drawn in part from [[scholastic philosophy]] and, in particular, the metaphysics of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Among the themes developed in his writings were the social and economic theory of Distributism, reflections on the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the outlines of a critique of the modern world, and the development of an informed and Christian approach to [[Eastern religions]]. His seminal articles on Eastern philosophy and religion were among his last publications:&lt;ref&gt;See in particular:  "Notes on the Light of the Eastern Religions" (Dominican Studies, London, 1954, pp. 254-271;  reprinted in ''Religion of the Heart'', Foundation for Traditional Studies, Oakton VA, 1991);  "A Thomist Approach to the [[Vedanta]], (Blackfriars XXXVII, no. 430, January 1956);  and "The metaphysical background to analogy" (Aquinas Paper No. 28, Blackfriars Publications, London 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian meditation''' is a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to become aware of and reflect upon the revelations of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation for Beginners'' by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000, {{ISBN|0-88489-361-8}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[meditation]] comes from the Latin word ''meditārī'', which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Christian spirituality'' by F. Antonisamy, 2000 {{ISBN|81-7109-429-5}} pages 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; 

Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' pages 12-13"&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Volume 3 page 488"&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} page 488&lt;/ref&gt; Both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]] meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level [[Christian prayer|vocal prayer]], but is more structured than the multiple layers of [[Christian contemplation|contemplative prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Simple Ways to Pray'' by Emilie Griffin 2005 {{ISBN|0-7425-5084-2}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality in the Catholic tradition'' by Jordan Aumann 1985 Ignatius Press {{ISBN|0-89870-068-X}} page 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miskin39"&gt;''Orthodox prayer life: the interior way'' by Mattá al-Miskīn 2003 {{ISBN|0-88141-250-3}} St Vladimir Press, "Chapter 2: Degrees of Prayer" pages 39–42 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CpPnSHWu5d8C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=eastern+orthodox+degrees+of+prayer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GZLSTobNHtSIhQfZoJHbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eastern%20orthodox%20degrees%20of%20prayer&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Igumen &gt;''The art of prayer: an Orthodox anthology'' by Igumen Chariton 1997 {{ISBN|0-571-19165-7}} pages 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; Teachings in both the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church|Western]] Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's [[knowledge of Christ]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Teaching world civilization with joy and enthusiasm'' by Benjamin Lee Wren 2004 {{ISBN|0-7618-2747-1}} page 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perfection' page 145"&gt;''The Way of Perfection'' by Teresa of Avila 2007 {{ISBN|1-4209-2847-3}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238"&gt;''The Byzantine Empire'' by Robert Browning 1992 {{ISBN|0-8132-0754-1}} page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261–1453'' by Donald MacGillivray Nicol 2008 {{ISBN|0-521-43991-4}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and structure==
Christian meditation involves looking back on Jesus' life, thanksgiving and adoration of God for his action in sending Jesus for human  salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Systematic theology'', Volume 3 by Wolfhart Pannenberg, Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1997 {{ISBN|0-8028-3708-5}} page 210&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''[[El Castillo Interior|The Interior Castle]]'' (Mansions 6, Chapter 7) Saint [[Teresa of Avila]] defined Christian meditation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this way. We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.&lt;ref name="Your Mother page 4"&gt;''This Is Your Mother: The Scriptural Roots of the Rosary'' by Ronald Walls, 2003 {{ISBN|0-85244-403-6}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Gospel of Matthew]], c. 1700]]
Quoting the [[Gospel of Matthew]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Matthew|11:27|NIV}}: "No one knows the Father but only the Son and anyone whom the Son wants to reveal him" and [[I Corinthians]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|ICor|2:12|NIV}}: "But we have received the Spirit who is from God so that we may realize what God has freely given us", theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar|Hans von Balthasar]] explained the context of Christian meditation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dimensions of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking out of his own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man.... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, so we may join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], 1989 ''Christian meditation'' Ignatius Press {{ISBN|0-89870-235-6}} pages 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Building on that theme, [[Edmund P. Clowney|E. P. Clowney]] explained that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The first is that Christian meditation is grounded in the Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use [[mantra]]s. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the ''love of'' God, as in [[I John]] {{Bibleref2c-nb|IJohn|4:19|NIV}}: "We love, for he first loved us". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in ''praise''.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' pages 12-13"/&gt;

[[Thomas Merton]] characterized the goal of Christian meditation as follows: "The true end of Christian meditation is practically the same as the end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritual direction and meditation'' by Thomas Merton 1960 {{ISBN|0-8146-0412-9}} page 105&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Protestants]] view [[Christian soteriology|salvation]] in terms of ''faith and grace alone'' (i.e. [[sola fide]] and [[sola gratia]]) both [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Christians]] see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 1999 {{ISBN|0-631-21281-7}} pages 67-72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apostle Paul]] stated in [[Epistle to the Romans]] {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|9:16|NIV}} that salvation only comes from "God that hath mercy".&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 48&lt;/ref&gt; The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of give and take, and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Holy Spirit===
In Western Christian teachings, meditation is usually believed to involve the inherent action of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] to help the meditating Christian understand the deeper meanings of the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Lectio Divina'' by Christine Valters Paintner, Lucy Wynkoop 2008 {{ISBN|0-8091-4531-6}} page 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Urs27 /&gt; In the 12th century, decades before [[Guigo II]]'s the ''Ladder of the Monk'', one of his predecessors, [[Guigo I]], emphasized this belief by stating that when earnest meditation begins, the Holy Spirit enters the soul of the meditator, "turns water into wine" and shows the path towards contemplation and a better understanding of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Carthusian spirituality: the writings of Hugh of Balma and Guigo de Ponte'' by Hugh of Balma, Guigo de Ponte and Dennis D. Martin (Translator) 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3664-3}} pages 184–187&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Charles Spurgeon]] affirmed this belief within the Protestant tradition and wrote: "The Spirit has taught us in meditation to ponder its message, to put aside, if we will, the responsibility of preparing the message we've got to give. Just trust God for that."&lt;ref name=McGrath84 &gt;''Christian spirituality: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-631-21281-2}} pages 84-87&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] paraphrased this teaching as follows:&lt;ref name= Urs27 &gt;Hans Urs von Balthasar, 1989 ''Christian meditation'' Ignatius Press {{ISBN|0-89870-235-6}} pages 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vistas of God's Word unfold to the meditating Christian solely through the gift of the Divine Spirit. How could we understand what is within God and is disclosed  to us except through the Spirit of God who is communicated to us? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a biblical basis for this teaching, von Balthasar referred to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:9|1 Corinthians 2:9-10]]: "these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God".:&lt;ref name= Urs27 /&gt;

===Distinction from non-Christian meditations===
{{also|Aspects of Christian meditation|A Christian reflection on the New Age}}
[[File:Monk's Loneliness La soledad del monje.jpg|thumb|210px|A monk walking in a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]]]]
Christian meditation is different from the style of meditations performed in Eastern religions (such as [[Buddhism]]) or in the context of the New Age.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' pages 12-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Volume 3 page 488"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' page 12"&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''How to pray'' by Elmer L. Towns 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8307-4187-8}} page 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 7–10&lt;/ref&gt; While other types of meditation may suggest approaches to disengage the mind, Christian meditation aims to fill the mind with thoughts related to Biblical passages or Christian devotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life'' by Donald S. Whitney 1997 {{ISBN|1-57683-027-6}} Chapter 3, Part2: ''Meditating on God's Word'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wdMdv7P-26EC&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=christian+meditation+uncomfortable&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3UPcTd2SO46N-wberuS5Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20meditation%20uncomfortable&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Although some mystics in both the Western and Eastern churches have associated feelings of ecstasy with meditation, (e.g. St. [[Teresa of Avila]]'s legendary meditative ecstasy),&lt;ref name="Urban Tigner Holmes page 98"&gt;''A history of Christian spirituality: an analytical introduction'' by Urban Tigner Holmes, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8192-1914-2}} page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} page 311&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Gregory of Sinai]], one of the originators of [[Hesychasm]], stated that the goal of Christian meditation is "seeking guidance from the [[Holy Spirit]], beyond the minor phenomenon of ecstasy".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Christian Theology, Volume 1'' edited by Jean-Yves Lacoste 2004 {{ISBN|1-57958-250-8}} page 695&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian teachings on meditation at times include specific criticism of the [[Transcendental Meditation technique|transcendental styles]] of meditation, e.g. [[John Bertram Phillips]] stated that Christian meditation involves the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] on Biblical passages and warned of approaches that "disengage the mind" from scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Psalms'' by John Phillips, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8254-3492-0}} page 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmund P. Clowney]], Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of oriental [[meditation]] as radically as the portrayal of [[God the Father]] in the Bible contrasts with discussions of [[Krishna]] or [[Brahman]] in Indian teachings.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' page 12"/&gt; Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' pages 12-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Volume 3 page 488"/&gt; According to Clowney it is the search for wisdom, not ecstasy, that marks the path of Christian meditation, a wisdom sought in the "Christ of Scripture and the Scripture of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 document generally known as ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'' set forth the position of the [[Holy See]] with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all [[Catholic bishop]]s, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential [[Christology|Christocentric]] nature of Christian meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891510_meditazione-cristiana_ge.html Vatican website: Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation'' (in German), October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation'' (in English), October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions'' by Wayne Teasdale 2004 {{ISBN|0-7425-3178-3}} Page 74&lt;/ref&gt; The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, [[meditation]], which should be a ''flight from the self'', can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1990-01-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament references==
In the [[Old Testament]], there are two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words for meditation: ''hāgâ'' ({{lang-he|הגה}}), which means ''to sigh'' or ''murmur'', but also ''to meditate'', and ''sîḥâ'' ({{lang-he|שיחה}}), which means ''to muse'', or ''rehearse in one's mind''. When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek, ''hāgâ'' became the Greek ''melete'' which emphasized meditation's movement in the depth of the human heart. ''Melete'' was a reminder that one should never let meditation be a formality. The Latin Bible then translated ''hāgâ''/''melete'' into ''meditatio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|0-8091-3660-0}} page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible mentions ''meditate'' or ''meditation'' 23 times, 19 times in the [[Book of Psalms]] alone &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esv.org/search/?q=meditate&amp;page=1 |title= Search {{!}} ESV.org |website=ESV Bible |language=en |access-date= 2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When the Bible mentions meditation, it often mentions obedience in the next breath. An example is the [[Book of Joshua]]{{Bibleref2c|Joshua|1:8}}: "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+1:8&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Joshua 1:8 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Christian meditation}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], the monastic traditions of both [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: [[Lectio Divina]] in the West and [[hesychasm]] in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the [[Jesus Prayer]], but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.&lt;ref name=global31 &gt;''Globalization of Hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer: Contesting Contemplation'' by Christopher D. L. Johnson 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4411-2547-7}} pages 31–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reading with God: Lectio Divina'' by David Foster 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-6084-4}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lectio_Divina.svg|thumb|210px|The four movements of [[Lectio divina]]: ''read'', ''meditate'', ''pray'', ''contemplate'']]
The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by [[Guigo II]], a [[Carthusian]] monk who died late in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Egan38 &gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3660-5}} pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Guigo II's book ''The Ladder of Monks'' is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} pages 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Eastern Christianity]], the monastic traditions of "constant prayer" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and [[Evagrius Pontikos]] established the practice of [[hesychasm]] and influenced [[John Climacus]]' book ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' by the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox Church: Its Past and Its Role in the World Today'' by John Meyendorff 1981 {{ISBN|0-913836-81-8}} page&lt;/ref&gt; These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint [[Gregory Palamas]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238"/&gt;&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;

The methods of "methodical prayer" as taught by the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' group in northern Europe had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name=Elena28 &gt;''Teresa of Avila's autobiography'' by Elena Carrera 2004 {{ISBN|1-900755-96-3}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was known in Spain as ''Contemptus mundi'' became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of [[Francisco de Osuna]] which she studied.&lt;ref name=Elena28 /&gt; Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, [[John of the Cross]] continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina. By the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had also been firmly established in the [[Protestant]] spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt;

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, some components of meditation had started to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=ReadLive &gt;''Reading to live: the evolving practice of Lectio divina'' by Raymond Studzinski 2010 {{ISBN|0-87907-231-8}} pages 188–195&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as [[Lectio divina]] aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.&lt;ref name=ReadLive /&gt;

In 1965, one of the principal documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the dogmatic constitution ''[[Dei verbum]]'' (Latin for ''Word of God''), emphasized the use of [[Lectio divina]] and on the 40th anniversary of ''Dei verbum'' in 2005 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] reaffirmed its importance.&lt;ref name=spring &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050916_40-dei-verbum_en.html Vatican website ''Address at the 40th anniversary of DEI VERBUM, Friday, 16 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to meditation==
A number of [[saint]]s and historical figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings have emphasized the use of meditation as an element in increasing one's [[knowledge of Christ]]. The ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]'' of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] use meditative mental imagery, with the goal of knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In [[The Way of Perfection]], St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and [[mental prayer]].&lt;ref name="Perfection' page 145"/&gt; [[Hesychastic]] prayer and meditation continues to be used in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byzantium page 211"&gt;''The last centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453'' by Donald MacGillivray Nicol 2008 {{ISBN|0-521-43991-4}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Ignatius of Loyola===
The ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]'' of [[Ignatius Loyola|St. Ignatius of Loyola]] (1491&amp;ndash;1556), the founder of the [[Jesuit]]s, contain numerous meditative exercises. To this day, the Spiritual Exercises remain an integral part of the Novitiate training period of the Roman Catholic religious order of Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola'' by St Ignatius Loyola 2007 {{ISBN|1-60206-373-7}} page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercises are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through an experience of Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with a consideration of the purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.&lt;ref&gt;''2000 Years of Prayer'' by Michael Counsell 2004 {{ISBN|1-85311-623-8}} page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercises often involve imagery in which one enters a biblical scene. For example, the practitioner is encouraged to visualize and meditate upon scenes from the life of Christ, at times asking questions from Christ on the cross, during [[Crucifixion of Christ|crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ignatius de Loyola, powers of imagining'' 1986 by [[Antonio T. De Nicolás]], {{ISBN|0-88706-109-5}} pages 123-125&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Teresa of Avila===
[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|thumb|Saint [[Teresa of Avila]] depicted by [[Rubens]], 1615. She is often considered one of the most important Christian mystics.&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} page 413&lt;/ref&gt;]]
St. [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515&amp;ndash;1582) a [[Doctor of the Church]], practiced contemplative prayer for periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa believed that no one who was faithful to the practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritual direction and meditation'' by Thomas Merton 1960 {{ISBN|0-8146-0412-9}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa of Avila'' by [[Rowan Williams]] 1991 {{ISBN|0-8264-7341-5}} page vii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14515b.htm|title=St. Teresa of Avila|work=[[Catholic encyclopedia]]|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Teresa taught her nuns to meditate on specific prayers. Her prayers described in
''[[The Way of Perfection]]'' involve meditation on a mystery in the life of Jesus and are based on the faith that "God is within", a truth that Teresa said she learned from [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|0-8091-3660-0}} page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''Life'', she wrote that she taught herself from the instructions given in the book, ''The Third Spiritual Alphabet'' - by [[Francisco de Osuna]] - which relates to [[Franciscan]] mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa of Avila: The Book of My Life'' by Tessa Bielecki, Mirabai Starr 2008 {{ISBN|1-59030-573-6}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} pages 413-415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa of Avila'' by [[Rowan Williams]] 1991 {{ISBN|0-8264-7341-5}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her starting point was the practice of "recollection", i.e. keeping the senses and the intellect in check and not allowing them to stray. In her meditations, one generally restricts attention to a single subject, principally the love of God. In ''The Way of Perfection'' she wrote: "It is called recollection because the soul collects together all the faculties and enters within itself to be with God".&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Perfection'' by St Teresa of Avila 2007 {{ISBN|1-60206-260-9}} page 160&lt;/ref&gt; She would use devices such as short readings, a scene of natural beauty or a religious statue or picture to remind her to keep her focus. She wrote that in due course, the mind naturally learns to maintain focus on God almost effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa, a woman: a biography of Teresa of Avila'' by Victoria Lincoln 1995 {{ISBN|0-87395-937-X}} page xvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa of Avila'' by [[Rowan Williams]] 1991 {{ISBN|0-8264-7341-5}} page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Teresa of Avila: The Progress of a Soul'' by Cathleen Medwick 2001 {{ISBN|0-385-50129-3}} page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Theresa viewed Christian meditation as the first of four steps in achieving "union with God", and used the analogy of watering the garden. She compared basic meditation to watering a garden with a bucket, ''Recollection'' to the water wheel, ''Quiet'' (contemplation) to a spring of water and ''Union'' to drenching rain.&lt;ref name="Urban Tigner Holmes page 98"/&gt;

===Saint Francis de Sales===
[[File:Franz von Sales.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Francis de Sales]]
[[Saint Francis de Sales]] (1576&amp;ndash;1622) used a four-part approach to Christian meditation based on "''preparation''", "''consideration''", "''affections and resolutions''" and "''conclusions''":&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Christian spirituality'' by F. Antonisamy, 2000 {{ISBN|81-7109-429-5}} pages 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref for below too --&gt;
* In the ''preparation'' part, one places oneself in the presence of God and asks the [[Holy Spirit]] to direct the prayer, as in the [[Epistle to the Romans]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Romans|8:26|NIV}}: "The Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words."
* In the ''consideration'' part, one focuses on a specific topic, e.g. a passage from the Bible.
* In the ''affections and resolutions'' part, one focuses on feelings and makes a resolution or decision. For instance, when meditating on the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] one may decide to visit someone sick and be kind to them.
* In the ''conclusion'' part, one gives thanks and praise to God for the considerations and asks for the grace to stand by the resolution.

==Denominational issues==
===Catholic Church===
{{see also|Aspects of Christian meditation}}
[[File:Padre Pio.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Padre Pio]] stated: "''Through the study of books one seeks God; by meditation one finds him''".&lt;ref name="The Rosary pages 79"&gt;''The Rosary: A Path Into Prayer'' by Liz Kelly 2004 {{ISBN|0-8294-2024-X}} pages 79 and 86&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) said that meditation is necessary for devotion, and the [[Second Vatican Council]] called for "faithful meditation on God's word" as part of the spiritual formation of seminarians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults'' by Donald W. Wuerl, Ronald Lawler 2004 {{ISBN|1-59276-094-5}} page 350&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint John of the Cross]] (1542–1591), a close friend of St. Teresa of Avila, viewed Christian meditation as a necessary step toward union with God, and wrote that even the most spiritually advanced persons always needed to regularly return to meditation.&lt;ref&gt;''St. John of the Cross: an appreciation'' by Daniel A. Dombrowski 1992 {{ISBN|0-7914-0887-6}} page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Padre Pio]] (1887–1968), who was devoted to [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|rosary meditations]], said:&lt;ref name="The Rosary pages 79"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The person who meditates and turns his mind to God, who is the mirror of his soul, seeks to know his faults, tries to correct them, moderates his impulses, and puts his conscience in order."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] encourages meditation as a form of prayer: "Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking" (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing ''union with God'', it states: "Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord [[Jesus]], to union with him" (#2708).&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' by David Bordwell 2002 {{ISBN|0-86012-324-3}} pages 570–615&lt;/ref&gt; Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).

====Eucharistic meditations====
{{see also|Eucharistic adoration|Holy Hour}}
[[File:Blessed Sacrament Chapel interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eucharistic adoration and meditation, [[Cathedral of Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]]]
Christian meditation performed along with [[Eucharistic adoration]] outside of Mass has been associated with a large amount of Catholic writings and inspirations specially since the 18th century. The ''Eucharistic meditations'' of the two Saints [[Peter Julian Eymard|Pierre Julien Eymard]] and [[Jean Vianney]] (both promoters of the [[Eucharist]]) were published as books.&lt;ref&gt;''The Real Presence: eucharistic meditations'' by Saint Pierre Julien Eymard, Sentinel Press, 1938 ASIN B00087ST7Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The eucharistic meditations of the Curé d'Ars'' by Saint Jean Baptiste Marie Vianney Carmelite Publications (1961) ASIN B0007IVDMY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eucharistic Meditations: Extracts from the Writings and Instructions of Saint John Vianney'' by H. Convert, Jean Baptiste Marie, Saint Vianney, and Mary Benvenuta 1998 {{ISBN|0-940147-03-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] was devoted to Eucharistic meditation and on February 26, 1895 shortly before she died wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece "''To Live by Love''" which had composed during Eucharistic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;''Therese and Lisieux'' by Pierre Descouvemont, Helmuth Nils Loose, 1996 {{ISBN|0-8028-3836-7}} page 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Collected poems of St Thérèse of Lisieux'' by Saint Thérèse (de Lisieux), Alan Bancroft 2001 {{ISBN|0-85244-547-4}} page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant portions of the writings of the [[Venerable]] [[Concepcion Cabrera de Armida]] were reported as having been based on her adorations of the Blessed Sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;Concepción Cabrera de Armida. ''I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel'' {{ISBN|0-8189-0890-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in her book ''Eucharist: true jewel of eucharistic spirituality'' [[Maria Candida of the Eucharist]] (who was beatified by Pope [[John Paul II]]) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on eucharistic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'' by Matthew Bunson 2008 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} page 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20040321_candida_en.html Vatican Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rosary meditations====
{{Main|Rosary devotions and spirituality}}
Meditation is an integral part of the [[rosary]]. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries.&lt;ref name=Miller200 &gt;''Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion'' by John D. Miller 2002 {{ISBN|0-86012-320-0}} page 200&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated [[Hail Mary]]s dates back to 15th century [[Carthusian]] [[monk]]s, and was soon adopted by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at large.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Johnston|William M. Johnston]], ''Encyclopedia of monasticism'', Volume 1, 2000 {{ISBN|1-57958-090-4}} page 246&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book ''Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine'' (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of [[Milan]] provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.&lt;ref&gt;''Music in the collective experience in sixteenth-century Milan'' by Christine Suzanne Getz, 2006 {{ISBN|0-7546-5121-5}} page 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Teresa of Avila]]'s meditative approach of focusing on "the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son" can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations.&lt;ref name="Your Mother page 4"/&gt;  In his 2002 [[encyclical]] ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'', [[Pope John Paul II]] placed the rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rosary with John Paul II'' by George Madore, 2004, Alba House, {{ISBN|2-89420-545-7}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or "transfigured", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us and for us.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rosary with John Paul II'' by George Madore, 2004, {{ISBN|2-89420-545-7}} page 19&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that: "''To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]], #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===
{{See also|Omphaloskepsis}}
[[File:Simonos petras 1.jpg|thumb|[[Simonopetra monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]]]
During the [[Byzantine Empire]], between the 10th and 14th centuries, a tradition of prayer called [[hesychasm]] developed, particularly on [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]], and continues to the present.  St. [[Gregory of Sinai]] is considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html |title=Mount Athos: History |work=Macedonian Heritage |accessdate=12 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207062434/http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Athos/General/AthosHistory.html |archivedate=December 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition uses a special posture and breathing rituals, accompanied by the repetition of a short prayer (traditionally the '[[Jesus Prayer]]') giving rise to suggestions that it may have been influenced by Indian approaches. "While some might compare it [''hesychastic prayer''] with a mantra, to use the Jesus Prayer in such a fashion is to violate its purpose. One is never to treat it as a string of syllables for which the 'surface' meaning is secondary. Likewise, hollow repetition is considered to be worthless (or even spiritually damaging) in the hesychast tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Hesychasm|title=Hesychasm|work=OrthodoxWiki|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is to be in the spirit of a true mantra. This style of prayer was at first opposed as heretical by [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlam]] in [[Calabria]], but was defended by Saint [[Gregory Palamas]].&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byzantium page 211"/&gt; Coming from ''hesychia'' ("stillness, rest, quiet, silence"), hesychasm continues to be practiced in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and some other [[Eastern Church]]es of the [[Byzantine Rite]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' {{ISBN|0-631-23203-6}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt; Hesychasm has not gained significance in the [[Western Church|Western churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm|title=Hesychasm|work=[[Catholic encyclopedia]]|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history'' by Matthew Bunson 2004 {{ISBN|1-59276-026-0}} page 433&lt;/ref&gt;

In hesychasm, the [[Jesus prayer]], consisting of the phrase: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me" is repeated either for a set period of time or a set number of times. Hesychasm is contrasted with the more mental or imaginative forms of Christian meditation in which a person is encouraged to imagine or think of events from the life of Jesus or sayings from the Gospel. Sometimes hesychasm has been compared to the meditative techniques of oriental religions and it is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and [[Sufis]], but this has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches'' by John Binns 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66738-0}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
[[John Main]] OSB (1926&amp;ndash;1982) was a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk and priest who presented a way of Christian meditation which used a prayer-phrase or [[mantra]]. This approach was then used by groups which then become the [[World Community for Christian Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: The Teacher Within'' by [[Laurence Freeman]], 2001 {{ISBN|0826413749}} page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[decision analysis]], the '''clarity test''' (or '''clairvoyant test''') is a test of how well a model element is defined. Although nothing (outside a [[formal system]]) can be completely defined, the clarity test allows the [[decision participant]]s to determine whether such elements as variables, events, outcomes, and alternatives are sufficiently well defined to make the decision at hand. In general, a model element is well defined if a knowledgeable individual can answer questions about the model element without asking further clarifying questions.

More precisely, Howard&lt;ref name="Howard_1988" /&gt; defines the clarity test by saying that a quantity or event is clearly defined—it passes the clarity test—if a "clairvoyant would be able to say whether or not the event in question occurred or, in the case of a variable, the value of the variable." Howard&lt;ref name="Howard_1988" /&gt; defines the clairvoyant as "a person who knew the future, who had access to all future newspapers, readings of physical devices, or any other determinable quantity." In later teaching Howard more broadly defined the clairvoyant as a person with perfect knowledge of all events and measurable quantities, past present and future, but no judgment.

The concept of the clairvoyant is useful in decision analysis for ensuring [[clarity of thought]], particularly when assessing [[uncertainty]].

The wizard is another mythical character who can change the future, usually for a fee, provided he or she is given a well-defined request. The concept of the wizard is useful for assessing [[deterministic preference]]s by eliminating the complexity added by [[uncertainty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">A '''direct reference theory''' (also called '''referentialism'''&lt;ref name="Schroeder2006"/&gt; or '''referential realism''')&lt;ref name="Bianchi2012p79"&gt;Andrea Bianchi (2012) ''Two ways of being a (direct) referentialist'', in Joseph Almog, Paolo Leonardi, ''Having in Mind: The Philosophy of Keith Donnellan'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=CnTWQgtTtG0C&amp;pg=PA79 p. 79]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of language]] that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; The object denoted by a word is called its [[referent]]. Criticisms of this position are often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name="Schroeder2006"&gt;Severin Schroeder (2006), ''Wittgenstein'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30]: "This view that the meaning of a word has to be explained in terms of what it stands for, its reference, I shall call referentialism."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, mathematician and philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]] argued against it, and contrasted it with [[mediated reference theory]].&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"&gt;Emery J. Hyslop-Margison, Ayaz Naseem (2007), ''Scientism and Education: Empirical Research as Neo-Liberal Ideology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5gveeSYcNQC&amp;pg=PA83 pp. 83–4]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, with his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', Wittgenstein argued against referentialism, famously saying that "the meaning of a word is its use."&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; Direct reference theory is a position typically associated with [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt; and [[analytical philosophy]]. Logical positivist philosophers in particular have significantly devoted their efforts in countering positions of the like of Wittgenstein's, and they aim at creating a "perfectly descriptive language" purified from [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] and confusions.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2007p83"/&gt;

== John Stuart Mill ==
The [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]] was one of the earliest modern advocates of a direct reference theory beginning in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stainton|first=Robert J.|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Language|publisher=Broadview Press|year=1996|pages=61|isbn=978-1-55111-086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[A System of Logic]]'' Mill introduced a distinction between what he called "connotation" and "denotation." Connotation is a relation between a name (singular or general) and one or more attributes. For example, ‘widow’ denotes widows and connotes the attributes of being female, and of having been married to someone now dead. If a name is connotative, it denotes what it denotes in virtue of object or objects having the attributes the name connotes. Connotation thus determines denotation. The same object can, on the other hand, be denoted with several names with different connotations. A name can have connotation but no denotation. Connotation of a name, if it has one, can be taken to be its meaning in Mill.&lt;ref name="Helsinki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/filosofia/s2008/MillFrege.doc|title=John Stuart Mill – Connotation and Denotation|year=2008|publisher=University of Helsinki|accessdate=2009-01-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mill, most individual concrete names are connotative, but some, namely proper names, are not. In other words, proper names do not have meaning. All general terms, on the other hand, are according to Mill connotative. In sum, Mill’s overall picture resembles very much the description theory of reference, though his take on proper names is an exception.&lt;ref name="Helsinki" /&gt;

== Bertrand Russell ==
[[Saul Kripke]], a proponent of direct reference theory, in his ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' dubbed [[mediated reference theory]] the "[[Frege–Russell view]]" and criticized it (see [[#Saul Kripke|below]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that [[Bertrand Russell]]'s views on reference theory were the same as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Wettstein, "Frege-Russell Semantics?", ''Dialectica'' '''44'''(1–2), 1990, pp. 113–135, esp. 115: "Russell maintains that when one is acquainted with something, say, a present sense datum or oneself, one can refer to it without the mediation of anything like a Fregean sense. One can refer to it, as we might say, ''directly''."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saul Kripke ==
[[Saul Kripke]] defended direct reference theory when applied to proper names. Kripke claims that proper names do not have any "senses" at all, because senses only offer contingent facts about things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kripke|first=Saul |title=Naming and Necessity|publisher=Basil Blackwell|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] advanced a theory of direct reference for proper names at a symposium in which [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and Kripke were participants: published in ''[[Synthese]]'', 1961 with Discussion in ''Synthese'' 1962. She called directly referring proper names "tags" (see [[tag theory of names]]). Kripke urged such a theory in 1971 and thereafter. He called such directly referring proper names "[[rigid designator]]s".

Kripke articulated this view using the formal apparatus of [[possible worlds]]. The possible worlds thought-experiment first takes the subject, and then tries to imagine the subject in other possible worlds. Taking George W. Bush, for example. First (1) the thought-experiment must state that the name "George W. Bush" is the name used to describe the particular individual man that is typically meant. Then (2), the experimenter must imagine the possible states of affairs that reality could have been - where Bush was not president, or went into a different career, was never born at all, etc. When this is done, it becomes obvious that the phrase "President of the United States in 2004" does not necessarily describe George W. Bush, because it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] in all possible worlds; it only contingently describes him. By contrast, for instance, the word "apple" will always describe the same things across all possible worlds, because of premise (1). So use of the word "apple" to describe apples is true in all possible worlds.

Terms that are true across all possible worlds in this way are called "[[rigid designator]]s".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16719">A '''giving circle''' is a form of participatory [[philanthropy]] where groups of individuals donate their own money or time to a pooled fund, decide together where to give these away to [[charitable organization|charity]] or [[community project]]s and, in doing so, seek to increase their awareness of and engagement in the issues covered by the charity or community project.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://media.npr.org/documents/2009/may/givingcircles.pdf |title= The Impact of Giving Together: a snapshot of a study on giving circles' influence on philanthropic &amp; civic behaviors, knowledge &amp; attitudes|author1=Eikenberry, Angela  |author2=Bearman, Jessica |publisher= [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]|date= May 2009|accessdate= May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many circles, in addition to donating their money, also contribute their time and skills to support local causes.

== Structure and function ==

The current manifestation of giving circles is a relatively new trend, but it is built on traditions dating back hundreds of years to [[benefit society|mutual aid societies]] and other forms of giving for the community. In the [[United States]], giving circles were initially composed of women; they are now more diverse in race, age and gender, although women continue to make up the majority of members.&lt;ref name="Growing"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/244842/Giving_Circles_Growing_Grassroots_Philanthropy | title=Giving Circles: Growing Grassroots Philanthropy | author=Eikenberry, Angela M | journal=[[Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly]] |date=September 2006  | volume=35 | issue=3 | pages=517–532 | doi=10.1177/0899764006287482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the circles can be informal or formal. On the informal side, circles may vote and choose an organization to support and each member writes an individual [[cheque|check]]. Formal circles may have their money housed at a local community foundation and have staff that support the work of the circle. Giving circles can range in size from a handful of members to several hundred.

Individual donors who join or form a giving circle typically seek to [[community building|build community]] within their circle through social events, in addition to the economic impacts of the groups.

In a 2007 study, the [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]' New Ventures in Philanthropy initiative identified approximately 400 giving circles in the United States, more than double the number from two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1857011,00.html |title= Report: Giving Circles |author=Kadlec, Dan|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 5, 2008|accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of 160 circles, published in 2008, found they had leveraged nearly $100 million, $13 million of this in 2006 alone. Nearly 12,000 people took part in the 160 giving circles surveyed. Nearly half of circles have male participants, and the popularity of giving circles is also growing among racial, ethnic and tribal communities as well as in the gay and lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |title=Report: Giving Circles Are Here to Stay |publisher=[[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]] |year=2008 |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219033229/http://givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |archivedate=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study conducted in 2005 by Angela M. Eikenberry, an associate professor at the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], found that giving circles generally bring both long-time and new philanthropists to organized philanthropy.&lt;ref name= "Growing"/&gt; For both groups, participation seems to increase levels of giving while bringing “new money” to the [[nonprofit sector]]; especially to small and locally based organizations. Members also seem to learn about and give to organizations and individuals, and in areas of interest, they most likely would not have given to otherwise. In addition, members are more thoughtful, focused and strategic in their personal giving because of educational experiences in the giving circle. These findings are based on 30 interviews with giving circle participants, staff, and philanthropic professionals working with giving circles, document analysis, and secondary data.

Research by Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman, published in 2009, and largely based on a survey of giving circle members compared to a control group, found that giving circles influence members to give more and to give more strategically. Their members give to a wide array of organizations and are highly engaged in the community. Giving circles increase members’ knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community but have a mixed influence on members’ attitudes about philanthropy, nonprofit and government roles, and political/social abilities and values. Level of engagement, length of engagement, and size of the giving circle seem to matter most, when it comes to understanding giving circles’ effects on members.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== United States ===
Examples of giving circles include the Zawadi giving circle in [[New Orleans]], where 12 [[African American]] members collectively donated $24,000 over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/giving-circle-popularity-skyrockets-to-become-100-million-force-58351422.html |title= Giving Circle Popularity Skyrockets to Become $100 Million Force|publisher= [[PR Newswire]] |date= May 21, 2007 |accessdate= July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their money has provided intensive math tutoring for students at a local school, along with other projects.

The Queer Youth Fund, established in 2002 and based in [[Los Angeles, California]], has invested more than $3 million in grants to small youth-led organizations in the United States and Canada that promote equality and justice for lesbian, gay, transgender, queer and questioning ([[LGBT]]QQ) youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libertyhill.typepad.com/main/2010/10/qyf-fights-hate-with-love.html |title=Queer Youth Fund Fights Hate With Love |author=Osborn, Barbara |publisher=Liberty Hill Blog: News from the Frontlines |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010420/http://libertyhill.typepad.com/main/2010/10/qyf-fights-hate-with-love.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplifier Giving (www.AmplifierGiving.org) is the first concerted effort to network Jewish giving circles, catalyze the creation of new giving circles, educate circle members on best practices in philanthropy, and create a platform to connect NGOs and Jewish giving circles to each other efficiently and effectively. The Amplifier network includes 50 giving circles and 369 organizations. The Amplifier website has a circle and organization directory, online common grant application system, and a resource library with information about how to start and sustain a giving circle.&lt;ref name="Amplifier"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amplifiergiving.org/ | title=Home page | publisher=Amplifier Giving | accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2013 that a giving circle, Women for Social Innovation, is providing seed money for social innovators helping women, girls and families in Greater [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Hannon"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/giving/giving-circles-more-impact-to-go-around.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work= [[The New York Times]]|title=Giving Circles: More Impact to Go Around|date= November 27, 2013 | accessdate= February 14, 2015 | author=Hannon, Kerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [http://www.latinocf.org/ Latino Community Foundation] launched the first Latino Giving Circle Network in the United States. As of August 2016, there are over 220 members in this network, which focuses on investing in Latino-led organization in [[California]].

=== United Kingdom ===
The Kew Giving Circle in [[Kew]], south west [[London]], started meeting in January 1999 and is still active. It is the first recorded giving circle in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/apr/23/charitablegiving.observercashsection| title=Squaring the Charity Circle|author=Bibby, Andrew |work= [[The Observer]]|date= April 23, 2000| accessdate= January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members contribute to a pooled [[Charities Aid Foundation]] account and meet to agree payments from the account to their selected charities.

The Funding Network is the largest known and first open giving circle in the UK.  It is a charity that runs ''[[Dragons' Den]]''-style events to bring together potential donors and charities to fund positive social change. It has raised over £5 million for over 700 projects across the globe.&lt;ref name=Impact&gt;{{cite web |title=The Funding Network 10th Anniversary Impact Report |url=http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |work=10th Impact Report |publisher=The Funding Network |date=July 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015114/http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

The number of giving circles in Asia is growing.

When [[Padmasambhava]] arrived in [[Tibet]] in the eighth century, he subdued all [[Gyalpo spirits|gyalpo]] spirits and put them under control of Gyalpo Pehar, who promised not to harm any sentient beings and was made the chief guardian spirit of [[Samye]] during the reign of [[Trisong Detsen|Trisong Deutsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol |translator=Matthieu Ricard |editor=Constance Wilkinson |editor2=Michal Abrams |title=The life of Shabkar |year=1994 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn= 978-0-7914-1835-2 |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pehar is the leader of a band of five gyalpo spirits and would later become the protector deity of [[Nechung|Nechung Monastery]] in the 17th century under the auspices of the [[5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraprod.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:3281|title=Nechung: The Ritual History and Institutionalization of a Tibetan Buddhist Protector Deity - University of Virginia Library - Libra|website=libraprod.lib.virginia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group teaches self-defense and has staged armed protests in favor of [[African Americans|African American]] [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]]&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and against [[police brutality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140820-huey-p.-newton-gun-club-leads-open-carry-rally-in-south-dallas.ece|title=Huey P.

The group garnered national attention in August 2014 for its [[Open carry in the United States|open carry]] patrols. Balogun expressed the hope that the club would continue to grow and eventually become a mainstream gun-rights organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/huey-does-dallas-0000552-v22n1|title=Huey P.

== Activity ==
In August 2014, the Huey P. Newton Gun Club staged their first openly armed patrol through a predominantly black neighborhood in [[South Dallas]], where police killed an unarmed black youth named James Harper in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140820-huey-p.-newton-gun-club-leads-open-carry-rally-in-south-dallas.ece |title=Huey P.

The club staged another protest in October of the same year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the coalition held a counter-protest at the Muhammad Mosque in South Dallas in response to a demonstration by the [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] Bureau of American Islamic Relations (BAIR). BAIR organized the protest against the [[Nation of Islam]], which runs the mosque. Both parties were armed and police were present during the protest, which ended shortly without any violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/04/tense-anti-mosque-protest-draws-armed-demonstrators-in-south-dallas.html/ |title=Armed clash over black mosque triggers anger in South Dallas |work=The Dallas Morning News |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fox4news.com/news/110636637-story|title=Planned Anti-Islamic protest causes confusion|publisher=fox4news.com|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/racial-showdown-dallas-black-panther-muslims-white-anti-mosque-activists-face-guns-2347917|title=Racial Showdown In Dallas: Black Panther Muslims and White Anti-Mosque Activists Face Off with Guns in Texas|date=4 April 2016 |work=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugger Mugger Yoga Products''' is one of the oldest designers and manufacturers of yoga products. Based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and founded in 1986, the company developed the Tapas [[yoga mat]], the first nonskid mat designed specifically for yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yoga-Supply House Fit for a Market; Utah-built company reflects strength of founder's vision |author=Janet Rae Brooks |url= |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=May 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugger Mugger now offers a wide variety of yoga and meditation tools, including an entire line of eco-friendly gear and [[made in USA]] products. The company continues its innovation of yoga mats, props, handmade bolsters, meditation cushions, and accessories, serving yoga teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=About Us |author=Hugger Mugger LinkedIn |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1156458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1986, Hugger Mugger Yoga Products was founded by Sarah Chambers in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Chambers was a custom furniture builder and a devoted student of Cita Mason and David Riley, [[Iyengar Yoga]] teachers in her city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Teaching Yoga - 30 Years of Gratitude |author=Charlotte Bell |url=https://www.yogauonline.com/yogau-wellness-blog/teaching-yoga-30-years-gratitude |date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a workshop with the late [[Mary Dunn (yoga)]], Chambers observed the teacher using a belt to demonstrate a modification to a pose. This inspired her to create a 1-1/2-inch-wide cotton D-ring strap, and she began making more Iyengar-inspired yoga props in the basement of her home. She consulted with her local teachers and Dunn to help her come up with products, including handmade yoga blocks set to [[B. K. S. Iyengar]]'s specifications.

She named her company Hugger Mugger after the thigh-hugging yoga shorts she was sewing. (Hugger Mugger means "to conceal.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=hugger-mugger definition |author=Dictionary.com |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hugger-mugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maroon, velour shorts stayed in place during inversions and wide-legged poses with the addition of an elastic band around the thighs.

Chambers began importing and selling a makeshift yoga mat, which was cut from European under-carpet padding.  When she started hearing that this material would crumble after a few months, she decided to develop something new. The Tapas Mat, the first mat ever designed specifically for yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugger Mugger Tapas Yoga Mat |author=jbyrdyoga |url=http://www.jbyrdyoga.com/yoga%20mat%20review2.html |date=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugger Mugger moved into a warehouse space in 1989, as the company began to outgrow her basement. To help continue expanding the business, Chambers took on partner, David Chamberlain, in 1997. They have both since retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=History |author=Hugger Mugger Website |url=http://www.huggermugger.com/about/mission-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humberto Maturana''' (born September 14, 1928, in [[Santiago, Chile]]) is a [[Chile]]an [[biologist]]. Many consider him a member of a group of [[second-order cybernetics]] theoreticians such as [[Heinz von Foerster]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Herbert Brün]] and [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]].

Maturana, along with [[Francisco Varela]] and Ricardo B. Uribe, is particularly known for creating the term "[[autopoiesis]]" about the self-generating, self-maintaining structure in [[living systems]], and concepts such as structural determinism and structure coupling.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto &amp; Varela, Francisco ([1st edition 1973] 1980). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nVmcN9Ja68kC&amp;dq=Maturana++Varela+Autopoiesis+Cognition&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vN1YS_eUGqD20wSjzLHxBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Autopoiesis and Cognition: the Realization of the Living]''. Robert S. Cohen and [[Marx W. Wartofsky]] (Eds.), Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science '''42'''. Dordecht: D. Reidel Publishing Co. {{ISBN|90-277-1015-5}} (hardback), {{ISBN|90-277-1016-3}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been influential in many fields, mainly the field of systems thinking and cybernetics. Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.&lt;ref name="MRKS 2012"&gt;Magnus Ramage, Karen Shipp (2012) ''Systems Thinkers''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
After completing secondary school at the Liceo Manuel de Salas in 1947, Maturana enrolled at the [[Universidad de Chile|University of Chile]], studying first medicine then biology. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to study [[anatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]] at [[University College London]]. He obtained a [[PhD]] in biology from [[Harvard University]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;See more biographical details in ''History: The Biology of Cognition Laboratory of the Universidad de Chile (1960–2006)''. Juan-Carlos Letelier, Gonzalo Marin &amp; Jorge Mpodozis. Published online at.http://biologyofcognition.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

He works in [[neuroscience]] at the [[Universidad de Chile|University of Chile]], in the research center "Biología del Conocer" (Biology of Knowing). Maturana's work has been developed and integrated into the work on Ontological coaching done by [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Julio Olalla]].

In 1994 he received Chile's [[National Prize for Natural Sciences (Chile)|National Prize for Natural Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/08/31/558419/bernabe-santelices-es-condecorado-con-el-premio-nacional-de-ciencias-naturales.html |title=Bernabé Santelices recibe el Premio Nacional de Ciencias Naturales |trans-title=Bernabé Santelices Receives the National Prize for Natural Sciences |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Santiago |language=Spanish |date=31 August 2012 |access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, Maturana established his own reflection and research center, the Instituto de Formación Matriztica.

==Work==
[[File:Maturana podium.JPG|thumb|Maturana, 2012]]
[[File:A drawing in zero time.JPG|thumb|A drawing in zero time]]
Maturana's research interest concerns concepts like cognition, autopoiesis, languaging, zero time cybernetics and structural determined systems. Maturana's work extends to [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]] and even to [[family therapy]]. He was early inspired by the work of the biologist [[Jakob von Uexküll]].

His inspiration for his work in cognition came while he was a medical student and became seriously ill with tuberculosis.  Confined in a sanatorium with very little to read, he spent time reflecting on his condition and the nature of life. What he came to realize was "that what was peculiar to living systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves&amp;nbsp;... whether a dog bites me or doesn't bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself." This paradigm of autonomy formed the basis of his studies and work.&lt;ref name="MRKS 2012"/&gt;

Maturana and his student [[Francisco Varela]] were the first to define and employ the concept of [[autopoiesis]]. Aside from making important contributions to the field of [[evolution]], Maturana is associated with an [[epistemology]] built upon [[empirical]] findings of [[neurobiology]]. Maturana and Varela wrote in their [[Santiago Theory of Cognition]]: "''[[Living systems]] are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition''. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system."&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Humberto R./Varela, Francisco J. (1980): Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Realization of the Living. Dordrecht: Reidel, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Maturana influenced - and appears in coded form as a character in - the novel ''Replay'' by German author [[:de:Benjamin Stein|Benjamin Stein]].

They were first proposed [[Thomas Donaldson (professor)|Thomas Donaldson]] and Thomas W. Dunfee &lt;ref name=Dunfee&amp;Donaldson&gt;“When ethics travel: the promise and peril of global business ethics” by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas W. Dunfee, California Management Review, Summer 1999; 41, 4; ABI/INFORM Global pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an integrative [[social contract]] model of business ethics.&lt;ref name=Mayer&amp;Cava&gt;Social Contract Theory and Gender Discrimination: Some Reflections on the Donaldson/Dunfee Model Don Mayer; Anita Cava Business Ethics Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 2, Social Contracts and Business Ethics. (Apr., 1995), pp. 257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;
Donaldson and Dunfee have described hypernorms as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"principles so fundamental that they constitute norms by which all others are to be judged. Hypernorms are discernible in a convergence of religious, political and philosophical thought. An "authentic norm" is one that is generated within a community's moral free space and which satisfies the requirements of terms 1 and 2 of the macrosocial contract. Authentic norms are based upon the attitudes and behaviors of the members of their source communities. A "legitimate norm" is an authentic norm that is compatible with hypernorms."&lt;ref name=ties&gt;Précis for Ties that Bind* Thomas Donaldson Thomas W.

'''InfraKit''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] project that is part of the larger [[Docker (software)|Docker]] application container software project. The project was formally announced for Docker by its creator [[Solomon Hykes]] at the [[LinuxCon|Linuxcon]] [[European Union|EU]] 2016 event. InfraKit was originally called 'libmachete' and was renamed by Docker developers in October 2016.

According to the project's [[GitHub]] description, InfraKit is a toolkit for creating and managing declarative, self-healing infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/docker/infrakit|title=docker/infrakit|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; InfraKit consists of several core elements which include, instances, groups and flavors. Groups are collections of instances while flavors are specific groups built for a certain purpose. The InfraKit model works as a set of plugins that can be used to monitor Docker infrastructure. In the event of a failure or a node falling out of a set policy, the self-healing element of InfraKit enables remediation.

'''Jacopo Mazzoni''' (Latinized as '''Jacobus Mazzonius''') (27 November 1548 – 10 April 1598) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]], a professor in [[Pisa]], and friend of [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heilbron|first=John|title=Galileo|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hSaFC9eFd8C|pages=46–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first name is sometimes reported as "Giacomo".

==Biography==
Giacopo (Jacopo) Mazzoni was born in [[Cesena]], [[Italy]] in 1548.&lt;ref name="DBDI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/jacopo-mazzoni_(Dizionario-Biografico) |title=MAZZONI, Jacopo |first=Davide |last=Dalmas |encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |language=it |volume=72 |year=2008}} &lt;/ref&gt; Educated in [[Bologna]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[rhetoric]], and [[poetics]], Mazzoni later attended the [[University of Padua]] in 1563 where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]].

One of the most eminent savants of the period, Mazzoni was reported to have an excellent memory, which made him adept at recalling passages from [[Dante]], [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], and others in his regular debates with prominent public figures. It also allowed him to excel at memory contests, which he routinely won.&lt;ref name="leitch300"&gt;Leitch, 300&lt;/ref&gt; He had the distinction, it is said, of thrice vanquishing the [[James Crichton|Admirable Crichton]] in dialectic.

Later in life, Mazzoni would teach at universities in [[Rome]], [[Paris]], and Cesena, and was partly responsible for the establishment of the Della Crusca Academy.&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt;

He was an authority on ancient languages and [[philology]], and gave a great impetus to the scientific study of the [[Italian language]]. Mazzoni died in [[Ferrara]], Italy, in 1598.&lt;ref name="DBDI"/&gt;

==Major works==
Though Mazzoni considered himself primarily a philosopher (Adams, 178), his major work of philosophy – an attempt to reconcile the theories of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] called ''De Triplici Hominum Vita, Activa Nempe, Contemplativa, et Religiosa Methodi Tres'' (''On the Three Ways of Man’s Life: the Active, the Contemplative, and the Religious'', published in 1576) – is not widely read. Mazzoni is most known for his work on literary criticism, particularly his defenses of [[Dante]]’s [[Divine Comedy]], ''Discorso in Difesa Della Commedia Della Divino Poeta Dante'' (''The Discourse in Defense of the Comedy of the Divine Poet Dante''), published in 1572 and a second effort, ''Della Difesa Della Comedia Di Dante'' (''On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante''), which was not published until 1688.&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt;

Mazzoni was originally asked to write the defense by a noble friend who was distressed at criticism being leveled at the [[Divine Comedy]] by Castravilla.&lt;ref name="gilbert358"&gt;Gilbert, 358&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzoni’s initial volume on the subject (In Defense of the Comedy of the Divine Poet Dante), which he claims was written in only 20 days,&lt;ref name="monty5"&gt;Montgomery, 5&lt;/ref&gt; attracted criticism for its sometimes vague reasoning and its tendency, at times, to simply contradict, rather than refute, [[Dante]]’s detractors.&lt;ref name="monty5"/&gt;

In response to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini leveled against his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive and more sophisticated On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante.&lt;ref name="gilbert358"/&gt; In this work, before directly addressing Dante’s work, Mazzoni develops his theory of poetics, in which, drawing heavily from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], he discusses mimesis, the role of poetry, and the definition of poetry versus poetics (see Theory section, below). Though no complete English translation of Mazzoni’s text exists, excerpts from the Introduction and Summary have appeared in some anthologies, as well as in a partial translation by Robert L. Montgomery.

==Theory==
One of Mazzoni’s more interesting contributions to criticism is his discussion of mimesis in poetry. Mazzoni departs from his predecessors in that he conceives poetic imitation as not the recreation of an actual object, but of the recreation of an ideal. This idea, which has been compared to [[Baudrillard]]’s [[simulacrum]],&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt; Mazzoni calls the “idol” – a concept constructed by human artifice to which poetic imitations are compared in order to determine their believability. Mazzoni discusses believability or credibility, rather than truth – he defines poetry as a sophistic activity, the purpose of which is not to recreate truth, but rather to mimic that which will have the proper effect on the audience. As Mazzoni says, “if it should happen that two things should appear before the poet, one of them false but credible and the other true but incredible or at least not very credible, then the poet must leave the true and follow the credible.”&lt;ref name="leitch309"&gt;Leitch, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazzoni resurrects the ancient tradition of linking poetry to rhetoric, which also has the credible, rather than the true, as its object. He also gives great importance to poetry’s effect on the audience as a determinant of quality – though he admits that much of the exercise of poetry involves attempting faithful imitation (albeit of human constructs or “categories”, not ones that are necessarily “true”), success in poetry is ultimately determined by persuasion, not truth and objectivity. For him, successful poetry is something that occurs in and of the audience, not outside and independent of it. For Mazzoni, even “poetry” is a meaningless category – it is our classifications that constitute criticism,&lt;ref name="monty11"&gt;Montgomery, 11&lt;/ref&gt; not our ability to form a relationship with some reified thing called “The Poem”.

Like [[Plato]], Mazzoni was very concerned with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight in the perception of the believable images.”&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt; Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.”&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt; In part, this has to do with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt; Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt;

Mazzoni’s work is characterized by his methodical attempts to draw distinctions between similar phenomena.&lt;ref name="leitch300"/&gt; In proceeding along this course, he makes some compelling definitions and distinctions, such as that between poetry and poetics, the former being concerned with the formation of poetry (considerations for rhyme or meter for example) and the latter with a poem’s relationship to the “civil faculty.”&lt;ref name="leitch301"&gt;Leitch, 301&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from [[Plato]], is also important in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or the creation of a character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination.&lt;ref name="monty8"&gt;Montgomery, 8&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction would play an important role in Mazzoni’s ''On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante'', in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed ''Dante''’s work as lacking in [[verisimilitude]] and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.

==Influences==
Some of Mazzoni’s influences are obvious, such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Mazzoni regularly makes direct reference to their works and draws some of his ideas directly from theories that they established (the distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, for example, is drawn from [[Plato]]). The influence of other thinkers has also been identified in Mazzoni’s work, including neo-platonists such as Proclus and Greek sophists such as Dionysius of Helicarnassus and [[Aulus Gellius]] (the latter two particularly in Mazzoni's discussion on the impact of the character of the poet on the nature of the poem;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, 643&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Impact and criticism==
Mazzoni influenced many theorists ranging from the romantics right up to the present day. In “emphasizing poetry’s relationship to images and games,”&lt;ref name="leitch301"/&gt; for example, Mazzoni informs romantic writers such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Friedrich von Schiller]] (Leitch, 301). His influence can also be seen in modern efforts to define the difference between poetic language and other types.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 178&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite his influence, however, Mazzoni has been subject to some criticism. Some see, for example, a contradiction in trying to assign both pleasure and social utility to poetry at the same time, while others question his use of the distinction between icastic and phantastic mimesis (Leitch, 301).

'''Jacqueline K. Barton''' (born [[New York City, NY]]), is an American [[chemist]]. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the [[California Institute of Technology]] (1989-to the present).  In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.

Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of [[DNA]] and their roles in biological activities.  The primary focus of her research is transverse [[electron transport]] along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for [[materials science]]s applications such as targeted [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic treatments]] for cancer.  Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 [[National Medal of Science]] and the 2015 [[Priestley Medal]].

==Education==
Jacqueline Kapelman attended [[Riverdale Country School]] for Girls in [[Riverdale, New York]], where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take [[calculus]] at the boys' school.  Her interest in chemistry began at [[Barnard College]], where she studied [[physical chemistry]] with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.&lt;ref name=CAEN2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Jacqueline K.|title=A Career In Chemistry|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=March 23, 2015|volume=93|issue=12|pages=15–19|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i12/Career-Chemistry.html|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SegalObituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernice Segal, 59, a Professor of Chemistry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/11/obituaries/bernice-segal-59-a-professor-of-chemistry.html|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 11, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,&lt;ref name=Ghaffari/&gt; receiving her B.A. from [[Barnard College]] as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held [[postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral appointments]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories|Bell Labs]] and [[Yale University]], where she worked with [[Robert G. Shulman]]. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.&lt;ref name=Ghaffari/&gt; Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.&lt;ref name=Ghaffari/&gt; While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to [[enantiomers]].&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt;

In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref name=Ghaffari/&gt;  She became a full professor in 1986&lt;ref name=Wilson2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Elizabeth K.|title=Jacqueline Barton Named Priestley Medalist|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=June 12, 2014|volume=92|issue=24|page=4|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i24/Jacqueline-Barton-Named-Priestley-Medalist.html|accessdate=2 April 2015|doi=10.1021/cen-09224-notw1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt; Her research focused on the use of organo-[[ruthenium]] complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With [[Nicholas Turro]] and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences.&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt; Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect.  During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.&lt;ref name=light/&gt;

In 1989, Barton moved to [[Caltech]],&lt;ref name=Wilson2015/&gt; where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.&lt;ref name=Wilson2015/&gt;  In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.&lt;ref name=light/&gt;

The research that Barton, [[Catherine J. Murphy]], Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt; Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.&lt;ref name=EarthSky/&gt;

Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=AICGold/&gt;  Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches.  The company has since been acquired by [[Becton Dickinson|BD Diagnostics]].&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt;

Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.&lt;ref name=AICGold/&gt; Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",&lt;ref name=Wilson2015/&gt; Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".&lt;ref name=CAEN2015/&gt;  She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|title=Jacqueline K. Barton Ph.D.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=1135245|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of [[California Institute of Technology]], effective July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=Ghaffari&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghaffari|first1=Elizabeth|title=Women Leaders at Work: Untold Tales of Women Achieving Their Ambitions|date=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3730-3|pages=115–124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwpxyTC-QU4C&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton has been a Member of the Board of [[Dow Chemical]] since 1993.&lt;ref name=DowBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline K.

===Research summary===
[[File:National Medal of Science 2010 recipients.jpg|thumb|250px|Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011]]
Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.

==Awards and honors==
Barton was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] by [[Barack Obama]] in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics.  Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse2011&gt;{{cite news|title=President Obama Honors Nation’s Top Scientists and Innovators|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/27/president-obama-honors-nation-s-top-scientists-and-innovators|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=The White House|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards include:

'''James Renwick''' (1790–1863), was an English-American scientist and engineer.

He was born in [[Liverpool]], England, on 30 May 1790. He graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1807. In 1820 he was appointed professor of [[natural philosophy]] in that college, a position he held until 1854. In 1838 he was appointed by the U.S. government one of the commissioners to explore the line of the boundary, then settled by the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]], between [[Maine]] and [[New Brunswick]]. In addition to his collegiate duties he wrote the biographies of [[Robert Fulton]], [[David Rittenhouse]], and [[Count Rumford]], in [[Jared Sparks|Sparks]]'s ''American Biography''; a Memoir of [[DeWitt Clinton]] (1834); and a ''Treatise on the Steam-engine'' (1830). His textbooks, ''Outlines of Natural Philosophy'' (1822), ''Elements of Mechanics'' (1832), and ''First Principles of Chemistry'' (1840) were among the first works of their kind published in the United States, the first and third of these, along with his other educational works, passing through multiple editions. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter F|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterF.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick died in 1863.

He married Margaret Brevoort, from a wealthy and socially prominent New York family. His eldest son, Henry Brevoort Renwick, was a mechanical engineer and inspector of steamboat engines. His middle son, [[James Renwick, Jr.]], was a noted Gothic Revival architect, designer of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York and the [[Smithsonian Castle]] in Washington, D.C., among many other buildings.  His youngest son, [[Edward S. Renwick]] was a mechanical engineer, inventor and patent expert.

==Engineering on the Morris Canal==
Renwick was also responsible for the idea and initial design of the inclined planes on the [[Morris Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirby|first=Richard Shelton|title=Engineering in History|year=1990|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0486264122|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of these planes were later copied for the [[Elbląg Canal]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="catskill"&gt;{{cite web|url=

'''Jean-Marie Guyau''' (October 28, 1854 – March 31, 1888) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[poet]].

Guyau was inspired by the philosophies of [[Epicurus]], [[Epictetus]], [[Plato]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Alfred Fouillée]], and the poetry and literature of [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Victor Hugo]], and [[Alfred de Musset]].

== Life ==
Guyau was first exposed to [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], as well as the [[history of religions]] and [[history of philosophy|philosophy]] in his youth through his stepfather, the noted French philosopher [[Alfred Fouillée]]. With this background, he was able to attain his Bachelor of Arts at only 17 years of age, and at this time, translated the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Handbook]]'' of [[Epictetus]]. At 19, he published his 1300-page "Mémoire" that, a year later in 1874, won a prize from the [[French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] and helped to earn him a philosophy lectureship at the [[Lycée Condorcet]].  However, this was short-lived, as he soon began to suffer from [[pulmonary disease]]. Following the first attacks of his disease, he went to southern France where he wrote philosophical works and poetry. He remained there until his early death at 33 years of age.

His mother, {{ill|Augustine Tuillerie|fr}} (who married [[Alfred Fouillée|Fouillée]] after Guyau's birth), published ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'' in 1877 under the pseudonym G. Bruno.

Guyau's wife published short novels for young people under the pseudonym of Pierre Ulric.

== Philosophy ==
Guyau's works primarily analyze and respond to modern philosophy, especially [[moral philosophy]]. Largely seen as an [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]], he viewed English [[utilitarianism]] as a modern version of Epicureanism. Although an enthusiastic admirer of the works of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], he did not spare them a careful scrutiny of their approach to morality.

In his ''Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction'', probably his most important work on moral theory, he begins from Fouillée, maintaining that utilitarian and [[positivism|positivist]] schools, despite admitting the presence of an unknowable in moral theory, wrongly expel individual hypotheses directed towards this unknowable. He states that any valid theory of ethics must consider the moral sphere as consisting not merely of moral '''facts''' (the utilitarian approach) but also, and more importantly, of moral '''ideas'''. On the other hand, in contrast to Fouillée, he does not see this unknowable itself as able to contribute a "principle practically limiting and restricting conduct," i.e. of "mere justice" which, he states, comes too close to [[Kantian]] notions of duty; for this, in turn, would bring us back to a theory of moral obligation, which, as the title suggests, he wishes to free moral theory from. Much of his treatise is dedicated to arguing what moral theory can be based upon that relieves moral theorists from relying on e.g. duty, sanctions, and obligations. For example,

&lt;blockquote&gt; The only admissible "equivalents" or "substitutes" of duty, to use the same language as the author of "[[Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée|La Liberté et le Déterminisme]]" appear to us to be:
#The consciousness of our inward and superior '''power''', to which we see duty practically reduced.
#The influence exercised by '''ideas''' over '''actions'''.
#The increasing fusion of the '''sensibilities''', and the increasingly social character of our pleasures and sorrows.
#The love of '''risk''' in action, of which we will show the importance hitherto ignored.
#The love of metaphysical hypothesis, which is a sort of '''risk of thought'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guyau also took interest in aesthetic theory, particularly its role in society and social evolution. Primarily, Guyau's theories of [[aesthetics]] refute [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] idea that aesthetic judgment is disinterested, and accordingly, partitioned off from the faculties of mind responsible for moral judgement. In ''Les Problèmes de l'esthétique contemporaine'', Guyau argues that beauty in fact activates all dimensions of the mind—the sensual, the intellectual, and the moral. Aesthetic sensations are fully integrated with life and morality. They are also the mark of man's self-actualization. Contrary to [[Herbert Spencer|Herbert Spencer's]] theory that the development of the arts is an indicator of the decline of society at large, Guyau maintains that as society continues to evolve, life will become increasingly aesthetic. In ''L'Art au point de vue sociologique'', Guyau argues the purpose of art is not to merely produce pleasure, but to create sympathy among members of a society. By extension, he contends that art has the power to reform societies as well as to form them anew.

== Influence ==

Though Guyau is now a relatively obscure philosopher, his approach to philosophy earned him much praise from those who knew of him and his philosophy.

He is the original source of the notion of [[anomie]], which found much use in the philosophy of Guyau's contemporary [[Émile Durkheim]], who stumbled upon it in a review of "Irréligion de l'avenir".&lt;ref&gt;Orru, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petr Kropotkin]] devotes an entire chapter to Guyau in his ''[[Ethics: Origin and Development]]'', describing Guyau's moral teaching as "so carefully conceived, and expounded in so perfect a form, that it is a simple matter to convey its essence in a few words",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ethics: Origin and Development]]'', p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; while the American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]] considered him as "one of the most prominent of recent French philosophical critics."&lt;ref&gt;Orru, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also written on [[17th-century philosophy|17th century (Western) philosophy]], including on [[John Locke]] and [[René Descartes]].

== Education and career ==
After a B.A. in Philosophy at the University of Toronto, Nagel earned her M.A. (1994) and Ph.D. (2000) in Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].  Her dissertation, ''The Role of Necessity in Empirical Knowledge'', was written under the supervision of [[John McDowell]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/jnagel/CV.html|title=CV|website=individual.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2013 through June 2016, Nagel was associate chair of the University of Toronto's Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2015, Nagel founded a group called Room for More, a Toronto-based group sponsoring Syrian Refugees coming to Canada, in partnership with Humanity First.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themedium.ca/features/theres-room-for-more-refugees/|title=There’s "Room for More" refugees {{!}} The Medium|last=Ayub|first=Mahnoor|date=2016-01-11|newspaper=The Medium|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Much of Nagel's research draws on empirical developments from the [[cognitive science]]s and [[experimental philosophy]] in order to address longstanding questions in epistemology and philosophy of mind.  For example, Nagel is well-known for defending the value of intuitions in philosophical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagel|first=Jennifer|date=2012-11-01|title=Intuitions and Experiments: A Defense of the Case Method in Epistemology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x/abstract|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|language=en|volume=85|issue=3|pages=495–527|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x|issn=1933-1592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stich|first=Stephen|date=2013-07-01|title=Do Different Groups Have Different Epistemic Intuitions?

Nagel also argues, building on suggestions made by [[Timothy Williamson]], that knowledge is a mental state. Whereas knowledge is traditionally thought to be reducible to a form of belief, i.e., a justified and true belief, Nagel argues that knowledge should itself be counted among the fundamental types of mental state, on a par with beliefs, desires, intentions, and so on.

Nagel is the author of ''Knowledge: A [[Very Short Introductions|Very Short Introduction]]'', which has been praised as an "admirably clear and engaging" introduction to epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/16/knowledge-very-short-introduction-review-jennifer-nagel|title=Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction review – the sceptic chuckles darkly|last=Poole|first=Steven|date=2014-10-16|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nagel considers classic questions, including about [[skepticism]], [[rationalism]], and [[empiricism]], as well as more contemporary concerns, such as whether [[Wikipedia]], "where most articles have multiple and anonymous authors", can be a reliable source of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/knowledge-a-very-short-introduction-9780199661268?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction|last=Nagel|first=Jennifer|publisher=Oxford|year=2014|isbn=9780199661268|location=|pages=72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremy Bentham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|θ|ə|m}}; 15 February 1748 [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 4 February 1747]&lt;ref name="Johnson2012" /&gt; – 6 June 1832) was an English [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], and [[social reformer]] regarded as the founder of modern [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Sweet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="utilitarianphilosophy.com" /&gt;

Bentham defined as the "fundamental axiom" of his philosophy the principle that "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong".{{sfn|Bentham|1977|p=393}}{{sfn|Burns|2005 |pp=46–61 }} He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American [[philosophy of law]], and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of [[welfarism]]. He advocated for [[individual freedom|individual]] and [[economic freedom]]s, the [[separation of church and state]], [[freedom of expression]], equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts.{{sfn|Bentham|2008|pp=389–406}}{{sfn|Campos Boralevi|2012|p=37}} He called for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], of the [[death penalty]], and of [[physical punishment]], including that of children.{{sfn|Bedau|1983|pp=1033-1065}} He has also become known as an early advocate of [[animal rights]].{{sfn|Sunstein|2004|pp=3-4}}{{sfn|Francione|2004|p=139|ps=: footnote 78}}{{sfn|Gruen|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Benthall|2007|p=1}} Though strongly in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], he opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]] (both of which are considered "divine" or "God-given" in origin), calling them "nonsense upon stilts".{{sfn|Harrison|1995|pp=85-88}}&lt;ref name="Sweet" /&gt;  Bentham was also a sharp critic of [[legal fiction]]s.

Bentham's students included his secretary and collaborator [[James Mill]], the latter's son, [[John Stuart Mill]], the legal philosopher [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], as well as [[Robert Owen]], one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]].  He "had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself."{{sfn|Roberts|Roberts|Bisson|2016|p=307}}

On his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected, and then to be permanently preserved as an "auto-icon" (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display at [[University College London]] (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the "spiritual founder" of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation.&lt;ref name="UCL Academic Figures" /&gt;

== Life ==
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Thomas Frye.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Bentham by the studio of [[Thomas Frye]], 1760–1762]]

Bentham was born in [[Houndsditch]], [[London]], to a wealthy family that supported the [[Tory (British political party)|Tory party]]. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study [[Latin]] at the age of three.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk" /&gt; He learnt to play the violin and at the age of seven, Bentham would perform sonatas by Handel during dinner parties.{{sfn|Warren|1969|p=}} He had one surviving sibling, [[Samuel Bentham]], with whom he was close.

He attended [[Westminster School]] and, in 1760, at age 12, was sent by his father to [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1763 and his master's degree in 1766. He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of the English legal code, which he termed the "Demon of Chicane".

When the American colonies published their [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a rebuttal.{{sfn|Dupont |Onuf|2008|pp=32–33}} His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled "Short Review of the Declaration" written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans' political philosophy.{{sfn|Armitage|2007|p=}}{{sfn|Lind|1776|p=3}}

Among his many proposals for legal and social reform was a design for a prison building he called the [[Panopticon]].{{sfn|Bentham|1787|p=}} He spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] argued that the Panopticon was paradigmatic of several 19th-century "disciplinary" institutions.{{sfn|Foucault|1977|pp=200, 249–256}}

Bentham became convinced that his plans for the Panopticon had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite acting in their own interests. It was largely because of his brooding sense of injustice that he developed his ideas of "sinister interest" – that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.{{sfn|Schofield| 2009| pp. 90–93}}

More successful was his cooperation with [[Patrick Colquhoun]] in tackling the corruption in the [[Pool of London]]. This resulted in the [[Thames Police Bill (1798)|Thames Police Bill of 1798]], which was passed in 1800.{{efn|An Act for the More Effectual Prevention of Depredations on the River Thames (39 &amp; 40 Geo 3 c 87)&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;}} The bill created the [[Thames River Police]], which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for [[Robert Peel]]'s reforms 30 years later.{{sfn|Everett|1966|pp=67–69}}

Bentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the aging [[Adam Smith]], in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float.{{sfn|Persky|2007|p=228}} As a result of his correspondence with [[Honoré Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and other leaders of the [[French Revolution]], Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France.{{sfn|Bentham|2002|p=291}} He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of [[natural rights]] and of the violence that arose after the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with [[Latin American wars of independence|Latin American Independence]] Precursor [[Francisco de Miranda]] and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London.

In 1823, he co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for the "[[Historical radicalism#Political reform|Philosophical Radicals]]"{{spaced ndash}}a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life.{{sfn|Hamburger|1965|p=}}{{sfn|Thomas|1979|p=}} One was [[John Bowring]], to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as "son and father": he appointed Bowring political editor of the ''Westminster Review'' and eventually his [[literary executor]].{{sfn|Bartle|1963|p=}} Another was [[Edwin Chadwick]], who wrote on hygiene, sanitation and policing and was a major contributor to the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]]: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.{{sfn|Everett|1968|p=94}}

An insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's ''The Life of John Stuart Mill'':
{{quote| During his youthful visits to [[Bowood House]], the country seat of his patron [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]], he had passed his time at falling unsuccessfully in love with all the ladies of the house, whom he courted with a clumsy jocularity, while playing chess with them or giving them lessons on the harpsichord. Hopeful to the last, at the age of eighty he wrote again to one of them, recalling to her memory the far-off days when she had "presented him, in ceremony, with the flower in the green lane" [citing Bentham's memoirs]. To the end of his life he could not hear of Bowood without tears swimming in his eyes, and he was forced to exclaim, "Take me forward, I entreat you, to the future{{spaced ndash}}do not let me go back to the past."{{sfn|Packe|1954|p=16}} }}

A [[Psychobiography|psychobiographical]] study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]].{{sfn|Lucas|Sheeran|2006|pp= 26–27}}

Bentham was an atheist.{{sfn|Crimmins|1986|p=95}} {{harvnb|González|2012|p=81}} writes, "In sum, with Hume's agnosticism and Bentham's atheism, the fundamental voluntarist thesis about the gulf between the divine and the human mind reaches new depths, and this serves to reinforce and radicalize the rejection, begun by Pufendorf, of Grotian rights-theory as the appropriate means of formulating the conventionalist theory of the moral life." And {{harvnb|Crimmins|1990|p=283}} notes, "Making allowance for Adams's cautious phrasing, this is a concise statement of Bentham's secular positivism, but it is also important to note the conviction with which Bentham held his atheism."

== Death and the auto-icon ==

[[File:Jeremy Bentham's Severed Head.JPG|thumb|right|Jeremy Bentham's severed head, on temporary display at UCL]]

Bentham died on 6 June 1832 aged 84 at his residence in Queen Square Place in [[Westminster]], [[London]], England. He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the [[dissection]] of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist [[George Fordyce]], whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765–1858), married Jeremy's brother [[Samuel Bentham]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; A paper written in 1830, instructing [[Thomas Southwood Smith]] to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

On 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham's remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy &amp; Medicine in [[Southwark]], London. The printed oration contains a frontispiece with an engraving of Bentham's body partly covered by a sheet.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Afterward, the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the "Auto-icon", with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in Bentham's clothes. Originally kept by his disciple [[Thomas Southwood Smith]],&lt;ref name="Marmoy" /&gt; it was acquired by [[University College London]] in 1850. It is normally kept on public display at the end of the South Cloisters in the main building of the college; however, for the 100th and 150th anniversaries of the college, and in 2013,&lt;ref name="Smallman2013" /&gt; it was brought to the meeting of the College Council, where it was listed as "present but not voting".&lt;ref name="ChemUCL" /&gt;

Bentham had intended the Auto-icon to incorporate his actual head, [[Mummy#Modern mummies|mummified]] to resemble its appearance in life. Southwood Smith's experimental efforts at mummification, based on practices of the indigenous people of New Zealand and involving placing the head under an air pump over sulfuric acid and drawing off the fluids, although technically successful, left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; The auto-icon was therefore given a [[wax]] head, fitted with some of Bentham's own hair. The real head was displayed in the same case as the auto-icon for many years, but became the target of repeated [[student prank]]s. It is now locked away securely.&lt;ref name="UCL1" /&gt;

In 2017, plans were announced to re-exhibit the head and at the same time obtain a DNA sample for sequencing with the goal of identifying genetic evidence of [[autism]].&lt;ref name="Knapton2017" /&gt;

In 2018, Jeremy Bentham's auto-icon was on display in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Breuer location.

== Work ==

=== Utilitarianism ===
{{Utilitarianism}}

Bentham's ambition in life was to create a "Pannomion", a complete [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] code of law. He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of [[utilitarianism]] took for its "fundamental axiom", ''it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong''".{{sfn|Bentham|1776|p= |loc=Preface (2nd para.)}} Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of [[Joseph Priestley]],{{sfn|Bentham |1821 |p=24 }} although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form "the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined".{{sfn|Priestley|1771|p=17}}

The "[[greatest happiness principle]]", or the principle of utility, forms the cornerstone of all Bentham's thought. By "happiness", he understood a predominance of "pleasure" over "pain". He wrote in ''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'':

{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think ...{{sfn|Bentham |1789 |p=1 |loc=Ch. I}} }}

Bentham was a rare major figure in the history of philosophy to endorse [[psychological egoism]].&lt;ref name="May" /&gt;

Bentham was a determined opponent of religion.  Crimmins observes:  "Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men."{{sfn|Crimmins|1986|p=95}}

Bentham suggested a procedure for estimating the moral status of any action, which he called the Hedonistic or [[felicific calculus]]. Utilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham's student [[John Stuart Mill]]. In Mill's hands, "Benthamism" became a major element in the [[classical liberalism|liberal]] conception of state policy objectives.

Bentham's critics have claimed that he undermined the foundation of a free society by rejecting natural rights.&lt;ref name="Smith2012" /&gt;

In his exposition of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the "happiness factor" of any action.{{sfn|Bentham|1789|loc=Ch, IV}} Nonetheless, it should not be overlooked that Bentham's "hedonistic" theory (a term from [[J.J.C. Smart]]), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of [[justice]]. In ''Bentham and the Common Law Tradition'', Gerald J. Postema states: "No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion..."{{sfn|Postema|1986|p=148}} Thus, some critics{{who|date=January 2013}} object, it would be acceptable to [[torture]] one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in ''Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law'', Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law "provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being".{{sfn|Kelly|1990|p=81}} It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows "expectation utilities" to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many. Law professor Alan Dershowitz has quoted Bentham to argue that torture should sometimes be permitted.&lt;ref name="Dershowitz2014" /&gt;

Bentham's ''[[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'' focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. His principle of utility regards "good" as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and "evil" as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society. He lays down a set of criteria for measuring the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The criteria are divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent. Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society. He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared "right", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Economics ===
[[File:Bentham - Defence of usury, 1788 - 5231094.tif|thumb|''Defence of Usury'', 1788]]
{{Hedonism}}Bentham's opinions about [[money|monetary economics]] were completely different from those of [[David Ricardo]]; however, they had some similarities to those of [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]]. He focused on [[monetary expansion]] as a means of helping to create [[full employment]]. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, [[propensity to consume]], the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern [[welfare economics]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or "dimension" such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.{{sfn|Spiegel|1991|pp=341–343}}

=== Law reform ===
Bentham was the first person to aggressively advocate for the [[codification (law)|codification]] of ''all'' of the [[common law]] into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb "to codify" to refer to the process of drafting a legal code.&lt;ref name="morriss"&gt;Andrew P. Morriss, ''Codification and Right Answers,'' 74 Chic.-Kent L. Rev. 355 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President [[James Madison]] in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realized that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer.

During his lifetime, Bentham's codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England. However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of [[David Dudley Field II]] in the United States a generation later.&lt;ref name="morriss" /&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Bentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of [[animal rights]].{{sfn|Benthall|2007|p=1.}} He argued and believed that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark, or what he called the "insuperable line". If reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short, too.{{sfn|Bentham|1879|p=}} In 1789, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to [[slave]]s in the [[French West Indies]] by the [[Code Noir]], he wrote:

{{quote|The day has been, I am sad to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day ''may'' come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs, the [[Hair follicle|villosity]] of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of [[Speech communication|discourse]]? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they ''reason''? nor, Can they ''talk''? but, Can they ''suffer''?{{sfn|Bentham|1879|p=|loc=Ch. 17}} }}

Earlier in that paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to [[Animal testing|medical experiments]] on animals, providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a "decided and insuperable objection" to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the ''Morning Chronicle'' in March 1825, he wrote:

{{quote|I never have seen, nor ever can see, any objection to the putting of dogs and other inferior animals to pain, in the way of medical experiment, when that experiment has a determinate object, beneficial to mankind, accompanied with a fair prospect of the accomplishment of it. But I have a decided and insuperable objection to the putting of them to pain without any such view. To my apprehension, every act by which, without prospect of preponderant good, pain is knowingly and willingly produced in any being whatsoever, is an act of cruelty; and, like other bad habits, the more the correspondent habit is indulged in, the stronger it grows, and the more frequently productive of its bad fruit. I am unable to comprehend how it should be, that to him to whom it is a matter of amusement to see a dog or a horse suffer, it should not be matter of like amusement to see a man suffer; seeing, as I do, how much more morality as well as intelligence, an adult quadruped of those and many other species has in him, than any biped has for some months after he has been brought into existence; nor does it appear to me how it should be, that a person to whom the production of pain, either in the one or in the other instance, is a source of amusement, would scruple to give himself that amusement when he could do so under an assurance of impunity.&lt;ref name="Bentham1825" /&gt;}}

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Bentham{{year needed|date=July 2018}} said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist.{{sfn|Williford|1975|p=167}} Bentham spoke for a complete equality between sexes.
Bentham{{year needed|date=July 2018}} nevertheless thought women inferior to men regarding such qualities as "strength of intellectual powers" and "firmness of mind".{{sfn|Bentham|1879|p=48}}

The essay ''Offences Against One's Self,''{{sfn|Bentham|2008|pp=389–406}} argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexual sex.{{sfn|Campos Boralevi,|2012| p= 40}} The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality. It was published for the first time in 1931.{{sfn|Campos Boralevi,|2012| p= 37}} Bentham does not believe homosexual acts to be unnatural, describing them merely as "irregularities of the venereal appetite". The essay chastises the society of the time for making a disproportionate response to what Bentham appears to consider a largely private offence – public displays or forced acts being dealt with rightly by other laws. When the essay was published in the ''Journal of Homosexuality'' in 1978, the "Abstract" stated that Bentham's essay was the "first known argument for homosexual law reform in England".{{sfn|Bentham|2008|pp=389–406}}

=== Privacy ===
For Bentham, transparency had moral value. For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone. This he describes by picturing the world as a gymnasium in which each "gesture, every turn of limb or feature, in those whose motions have a visible impact on the general happiness, will be noticed and marked down".{{sfn|Bentham|1834|p=101}} He considered both surveillance and transparency to be useful ways of generating understanding and improvements for people's lives.&lt;ref name="McStay2013" /&gt;

=== Fictional entities ===
Bentham distinguished among fictional entities what he called "fabulous entities" like [[Prince Hamlet]] or a [[centaur]], from what he termed "fictitious entities", or necessary objects of discourse, similar to [[Kant]]'s categories,{{sfn|Cutrofello|2014|p=115}} such as nature, custom, or the social contract.{{sfn|Murphy|2014|p=61–62}}

== Bentham and University College London ==
Bentham is widely associated with the foundation in 1826 of London University (the institution that, in 1836, became [[University College London]]), though he was 78 years old when the University opened and played only an indirect role in its establishment. His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single £100 share in the new University, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders.{{sfn|Harte|1998|pp= 5–8}}

[[File:Four founders of UCL.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Tonks]]' imaginary scene of Bentham approving the building plans of London University]]
Bentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the University. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the [[Church of England]] and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a "more than passive part" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that "his interest was greater than his influence".{{sfn|Harte|1998|pp= 5–8}} He failed in his efforts to see his disciple [[John Bowring]] appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]], as the first professor of [[Jurisprudence]] in 1829.

The more direct associations between Bentham and UCL{{spaced ndash}}the College's custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving papers{{spaced ndash}}postdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by [[Henry Tonks]] hanging in UCL's [[John Flaxman|Flaxman Gallery]] depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established) UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

UCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham's influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its "spiritual founder".&lt;ref name="UCL Academic Figures" /&gt;

Bentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was constitutionally incapable, except on rare occasions, of bringing his work to completion and publication.{{sfn|Lucas|Sheeran|2006| pp= 26–27}} Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime (see list of published works online)&lt;ref name="socialsciences.mcmaster.ca" /&gt; was prepared for publication by others. Several of his works first appeared in French translation, prepared for the press by [[Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont|Étienne Dumont]], for example, Theory of Legislation, Volume 2 (Principles of the Penal Code) 1840, Weeks, Jordan, &amp; Company. Boston. Some made their first appearance in English in the 1820s as a result of back-translation from Dumont's 1802 collection (and redaction) of Bentham's writing on civil and penal legislation.

The book, published anonymously, was well received and credited to some of the greatest minds of the time. Bentham disagreed with Blackstone's defence of judge-made law, his defence of legal fictions, his theological formulation of the doctrine of mixed government, his appeal to a social contract and his use of the vocabulary of natural law. Bentham's "Fragment" was only a small part of a ''Commentary on the Commentaries'', which remained unpublished until the twentieth century.

Bentham's main argument against the restriction is that "projectors" generate positive [[externalities]]. [[G.K. Chesterton]] identified Bentham's essay on usury as the very beginning of the "modern world". Bentham's arguments were very influential. "Writers of eminence" moved to abolish the restriction, and repeal was achieved in stages and fully achieved in England in 1854. There is little evidence as to Smith's reaction. He did not revise the offending passages in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', but Smith made little or no substantial revisions after the third edition of 1784.

=== Posthumous publications ===
On his death, Bentham left manuscripts amounting to an estimated 30 million words, which are now largely held by UCL's Special Collections (c. 60,000 manuscript folios), and the [[British Library]] (c.15,000 folios).

==== Bowring (1838–1843) ====
[[John Bowring]], the young radical writer who had been Bentham's intimate friend and disciple, was appointed his [[literary executor]] and charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in 11 volumes in 1838–1843. Bowring based much of his edition on previously published texts (including those of Dumont) rather than Bentham's own manuscripts, and elected not to publish Bentham's works on religion at all. The edition was described by the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' on first publication as "incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged", and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring's memoir of Bentham's life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir [[Leslie Stephen]] as "one of the worst biographies in the language".{{sfn|Bartle|1963|p=27}} Nevertheless, Bowring's remained the standard edition of most of Bentham's writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international&lt;ref name="neologisms"&gt;a word [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Bentham-Project/tools/neologisms Bentham himself coined]&lt;/ref&gt; relations as Bentham's [[A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace]] written 1786–89, which forms part IV of the [[Principles of International Law]].

==== Stark (1952–1954) ====
In 1952–1954, [[Werner Stark]] published a three-volume set, ''Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings'', in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham's writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material. Although a significant achievement, the work is considered by scholars to be flawed in many points of detail,{{sfn|Schofield|2009a|pp=475-494}} and a new edition of the economic writings is currently in preparation by the Bentham Project.

==== Bentham Project (1968–present) ====
{{further|Transcribe Bentham}}
In 1959, the Bentham Committee was established under the auspices of University College London with the aim of producing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings. It set up the Bentham Project&lt;ref name="UCL3" /&gt; to undertake the task, and the first volume in ''[[The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham]]'' was published in 1968.  The ''Collected Works'' are providing many unpublished works, as well as much-improved texts of works already published.  To date, 31 volumes have appeared; the complete edition is projected to run to around seventy. The volume ''Of Laws in General'' (1970) was found to contain many errors and has been replaced by ''Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence'' (2010){{sfn|Schofield|2013|p=51–70}} In June 2017, Volumes 1–5 were re-published in open access by UCL Press.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

To assist in this task, the Bentham papers at UCL are being digitised by crowdsourcing their transcription.  [[Transcribe Bentham]] is an award-winning [[crowdsourced]] manuscript transcription project, run by [[University College London]]'s Bentham Project,&lt;ref name="UCL4" /&gt; in partnership with UCL's [[UCL Centre for Digital Humanities]], UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the [[University of London Computer Centre]], and the online community. The project was launched in September 2010 and is making freely available, via a specially designed transcription interface, digital images of UCL's vast Bentham Papers collection – which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios – to engage the public and recruit volunteers to help transcribe the material. Volunteer-produced transcripts will contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of ''The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham'', and will be uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository,&lt;ref name="UCL5" /&gt; widening access to the collection for all and ensuring its long-term preservation. Manuscripts can be viewed and transcribed by signing-up for a transcriber account at the Transcription Desk,&lt;ref name="UCL6" /&gt; via the Transcribe Bentham website.&lt;ref name="UCL7" /&gt;

Bentham's name was adopted by the Australian [[Legal financing|litigation funder]] IMF Limited to become Bentham IMF Limited on 28 November 2013, in recognition of Bentham being "among the first to support the utility of litigation funding".&lt;ref name="imf.com.au" /&gt;

[[Ivan Vazov]], [[List of national poets|national poet]] and [[man of letters]] of [[Bulgaria]] (then recently liberated from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], but divided by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]) refers to Bentham in his 1881 poem [[:s:bg:Дипломираните|"Дипломираните"]] (in English: "People with Diplomas").&lt;ref name="Вазов1942" /&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}

'''Joseph-Marie, [[Count|Comte]] de Maistre''' ({{IPA-fr|də mɛstʁ|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;"Maistre" is traditionally pronounced {{IPA-fr|mɛstʁ|}} (i.e. sounding the "s" and rhyming with ''[[wikt:bourgmestre|bourgmestre]]''); that is how it is usually heard at university and in historical movies (as in [[Sacha Guitry]]'s 1948 film {{Interlanguage link multi|Le Diable boiteux (film)|fr|3=Le Diable Boiteux (film)|lt=''Le Diable Boiteux''|vertical-align=sup}}). The pronunciation {{IPA-fr|mɛtʁ|}} (rhymes with ''[[wikt:maître|maître]]'') is sometimes heard under the influence of the modernized pronunciation, adopted by some descendants (such as Patrice de Maistre).&lt;/ref&gt; 1 April 1753 – 26 February 1821&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Joseph de Maistre |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-de-Maistre}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[French language|French-speaking]] [[Savoy]]ard philosopher, writer, lawyer, and diplomat, who advocated [[social hierarchy]] and [[monarchy]] in the period immediately following the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Beum, Robert (1997). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/ModernAge-1997q3-00290 "Ultra-Royalism Revisited,"] ''Modern Age'', Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his close personal and intellectual ties with [[France]], Maistre was throughout his life a subject of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|King of Piedmont-Sardinia]], whom he served as member of the Savoy Senate (1787–1792), ambassador to [[Russia]] (1803–1817),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dublinreview33londuoft#page/418/mode/2up "Joseph de Maistre,"] ''The Dublin Review'', Vol. XXXIII, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and minister of state to the court in [[Turin]] (1817–1821).&lt;ref&gt;The issue of Maistre's national identity has long been contentious. In 1802, after the invasion of Savoy and [[Piedmont]] by the armies of the [[French First Republic]], Maistre had fled in [[Cagliari]], the ancient capital of Kingdom of Sardinia that resisted to the French invasion, wrote to the French ambassador in [[Naples]], objecting to having been classified as a French ''[[émigré]]'' and thus subject to confiscation of his properties and punishment should he attempt to return to Savoy. According to the biographical notice written by his son Rodolphe and included in the ''Complete Works'', on that occasion Maistre wrote that {{quote|He had not been born French, and did not desire to become French, and that, never having set foot in the lands conquered by France, he could not have become French.|''Œuvres complètes de Joseph de Maistre'', Lyon, 1884, vol. I, p. XVIII.}}  Sources such as the [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358824/Joseph-de-Maistre ''Encyclopædia Britannica''] and the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09554a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia''] identify Maistre as French, by culture if not by law. In 1860 Albert Blanc, professor of law at the [[University of Turin]], in his preface to a collection of Maistre's diplomatic correspondence wrote that: {{quote|... this philosopher [Maistre] was a politician; this Catholic was an Italian; he foretold the destiny of the [[House of Savoy]], he supported the end of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Austrian rule]] [of northern Italy], he has been, during this century, one of the first defenders of [Italian] independence.|''Correspondance diplomatique de Joseph de Maistre'', Paris, 1860, vol. I, pp. III-IV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key figure of the "[[Counter-Enlightenment]]",&lt;ref&gt;Masseau, Didier (2000). ''Les Ennemis des Philosophes.''

''Joseph de Maistre, Etat et Religion.'' Paris: Perrin.&lt;/ref&gt; He called for the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the throne of France and for the ultimate authority of the [[Pope]] in temporal matters. Maistre argued that the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] rejection of [[Christianity]] was directly responsible for the disorder and bloodshed which followed the French Revolution of 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Richard (1989). "The Satanic Revolution: Joseph de Maistre's Religious Judgment of the French Revolution", ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Western Society for French History'', Vol. 16, pp. 234–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrard, Graeme (1996).

==Biography==
Maistre was born in 1753 at [[Chambéry]], in the [[Duchy of Savoy]], which at that time was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], ruled by the [[House of Savoy]].&lt;ref name=berlin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/nachlass/maistre.pdf |title= The Second Onslaught: Joseph de Maistre and Open Obscurantism |work= Two Enemies of the Enlightenment |publisher=[[Wolfson College, Oxford]] |date= 24 November 2005 |origyear=1965 |accessdate= 11 December 2008 |format=[[PDF]] |last= Berlin |first=Isaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was of French and Italian origin.&lt;ref name="geneanet"&gt;[http://gw.geneanet.org/stefanofrancobora?lang=en&amp;pz=claudio&amp;nz=franco+bora&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=joseph&amp;n=maystre+de+maistre+aspremont Etude Culturelle - Recherches Historiques]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather André (Andrea) Maistre, whose parents Francesco and Margarita Maistre (née Dalmassi) originated in the [[County of Nice]],&lt;ref name="geneanet.com"&gt;[http://gw.geneanet.org/stefanofrancobora?lang=en&amp;pz=claudio&amp;nz=franco+bora&amp;ocz=0&amp;p=andrea&amp;n=maystre+de+maistre+aspremont Etude Culturelle - Recherches Historiques]&lt;/ref&gt; had been a draper and councilman in [[Nice]] (then under the rule of the House of Savoy), and his father François-Xavier, who moved to Chambéry in 1740, became a magistrate and senator, eventually receiving the title of [[count]] from the King of Piedmont-Sardinia. His mother's family, whose surname was Desmotz, were from [[Rumilly, Haute-Savoie|Rumilly]].&lt;ref name="triomphe"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Triomphe |title=Joseph de Maistre | location=Genève | publisher=Droz | year=1968 |pages=39–41}}  Preview available [https://books.google.com/books?id=CkrcFHJB5cQC&amp;pg here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph's younger brother, [[Xavier de Maistre|Xavier]], who became an army officer, was a popular writer of fiction.&lt;ref name=cath&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle= Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xav&gt;{{Cite CE1913| wstitle = Xavier de Maistre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Joseph de Maistre.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Stipple engraving of Maistre, from a painting by [[Pierre Bouillon]]. He is shown wearing the insignia of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]].]]

Joseph was probably educated by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].&lt;ref name=cath/&gt; After the Revolution, he became an ardent defender of their Order, increasingly associating the spirit of the Revolution with the Jesuits' traditional enemies, the [[Jansenism|Jansenists]]. After completing his training in the law at the [[University of Turin]] in 1774, he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Senator in 1787.

A member of the progressive [[Scottish Rite]] [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodge at Chambéry from 1774 to 1790,&lt;ref&gt;Vulliaud, Paul (1926). ''Joseph de Maistre Franc-maçon.'' Paris: Nourry.&lt;/ref&gt; Maistre originally favoured political reform in France, supporting the efforts of the magistrates in the [[Parlement]]s to force King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to convene the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]. As a landowner in France, Maistre was eligible to join that body, and there is some evidence that he contemplated that possibility.&lt;ref name="lebrun"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Lebrun |url=http://www.maistre.polthought.cam.ac.uk/maistrebio.html |title=A Brief Biography of Joseph de Maistre|publisher=[[University of Manitoba]] |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was alarmed, however, by the decision of the States-General to combine clergy, [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocracy]], and [[commoner]]s into a single legislative body, which became the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. After the passing of the [[August Decrees]] on 4 August 1789 he decisively turned against the course of political events in France.&lt;ref&gt;Greifer, Elisha (1961). "Joseph de Maistre and the Reaction Against the Eighteenth Century," ''The American Political Science Review'', Vol. 55, No. 3, pp. 591–598.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maistre fled Chambéry when it was taken by a French revolutionary army in 1792, but unable to find a position in the royal court in Turin, he returned the following year. Deciding that he could not support the French-controlled regime, he departed again, this time for [[Lausanne]], in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Bordeaux, Henri (1895). "Joseph de Maistre à Genève et à Lausanne". In: ''Semaine Littéraire'', II, pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; There he discussed politics and theology at the salon of [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], and began his career as a counter-revolutionary writer,&lt;ref&gt;Ferret, Olivier (2007). ''La Fureur de Nuire: Échanges Pamphlétaires entre Philosophes et Antiphilosophes, 1750-1770.'' Oxford: Voltaire Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; with works such as ''Lettres d'un Royaliste Savoisien'' ("Letters from a Savoyard Royalist", 1793), ''Discours à Mme. la Marquise Costa de Beauregard, sur la Vie et la Mort de son Fils'' ("Discourse to the Marchioness Costa de Beauregard, on the Life and Death of her Son", 1794) and ''Cinq paradoxes à la Marquise de Nav...'' ("Five Paradoxes for the Marchioness of Nav...", 1795).&lt;ref name=berlin/&gt;

From Lausanne, Maistre went to [[Venice]], and then to [[Cagliari]], where the King of Piedmont-Sardinia held the court and the government of the kingdom after French armies took Turin in 1798. Maistre's relations with the court at Cagliari were not always easy&lt;ref name=berlin/&gt; and in 1802 he was sent to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Teeling, T.T. (1985). [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic20philuoft#page/806/mode/2up "Joseph de Maistre,"] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', Vol. XX, p. 824.&lt;/ref&gt; as ambassador to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. His diplomatic responsibilities were few, and he became a well-loved fixture in aristocratic circles, converting some of his friends to Roman Catholicism, and writing his most influential works on political philosophy.

[[File:Joseph de Maistre by Vallotton.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Swiss painter [[Félix Vallotton]], from ''La Revue blanche'', 1er semestre, 1895.]]

Maistre's observations on Russian life, contained in his diplomatic memoirs and in his personal correspondence, were among [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s sources for his novel ''[[War and Peace]]''.&lt;ref name=berlin/&gt;  After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] and the restoration of the House of Savoy's dominion over [[Piedmont]] and Savoy  (under the terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]]), Maistre returned in 1817 to Turin, and served there as [[magistrate]] and minister of state until his death. He died on 26 February 1821 and is buried in the Jesuit Church of the Holy Martyrs (''Chiesa dei Santi Martiri'').

==Political and moral philosophy==
In ''Considérations sur la France'' ("Considerations on France," 1797), Maistre claimed that France has a divine mission as the principal instrument of good and evil on Earth. He interpreted the Revolution of 1789 as a [[Divine Providence|Providential]] event: the monarchy, the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocracy]], and the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' in general, instead of directing the influence of French civilization to the benefit of mankind, had promoted the [[atheism|atheistic]] doctrines of the [[Age of Enlightenment|eighteenth-century philosophers]]. He claimed that the crimes of the [[Reign of Terror]] were the [[logical consequence]] of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightened]] thought, as well as its divinely-decreed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Richard A. (1967). [http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1967/Lebrun.pdf "Joseph de Maistre, how Catholic a Reaction?,"] ''CCHA Study Sessions'', Vol. 34, pp. 29–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short book ''Essai sur le Principe Générateur des Constitutions Politiques et des Autres Institutions Humaines'' ("Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions and other Human Institutions," 1809), Maistre argued that constitutions are not the product of human reason, but come from God, who slowly brings them to maturity. After the appearance in 1816 of his French translation of [[Plutarch]]'s treatise ''On the Delay of Divine Justice in the Punishment of the Guilty'', in 1819 Maistre published ''Du Pape'' ("[[On the Pope]]"), the most complete exposition of his authoritarian conception of politics.

{{Conservatism sidebar |People |People}}

According to Maistre, any attempt to justify government on rational grounds will only lead to unresolvable arguments about the legitimacy and expediency of any existing government, and that this, in turn, will lead to violence and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John C. (1949). "The Political Thought of Joseph de Maistre," ''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 63–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Owen (1999). ''A Modern Maistre: The Social and Political Thought of Joseph de Maistre''. Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Maistre therefore argued that the legitimacy of government must be based on compelling but non-rational grounds, which its subjects must not be allowed to question.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Richard A. (1969). "Joseph de Maistre, Cassandra of Science," ''French Historical Studies'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 214–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Maistre went on to argue that authority in politics should therefore derive from religion, and that in Europe this religious authority must ultimately lie with the Pope.

What was novel in Maistre's writings was not his enthusiastic defense of monarchical and religious authority ''per se'', but rather his arguments concerning the practical need for ultimate authority to lie with an individual capable of decisive action, as well as his analysis of the social foundations of that authority's legitimacy. In his own words, which he addressed to a group of aristocratic French émigrés, "you ought to know how to be royalists. Before, this was an instinct, but today it is a science.  You must love the sovereign as you love order, with all the forces of intelligence."&lt;ref name="Sénart"&gt;Quoted by Philippe Sénart in [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiDaH4ll41oC&amp;pg=PA646 "Maistre et Tocqueville"], ''Joseph de Maistre. Les Dossiers H'', (Lausanne: Editions L'Age d'Homme, 2005), p. 646.  {{ISBN|2825118710}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maistre's analysis of the problem of authority and its legitimacy foreshadows some of the concerns of early sociologists such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Hans (1956). "Auguste Comte et Joseph de Maistre". In: ''Etudes Suisses de l'Histoire Générale'', XIV, pp. 103–138.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]].&lt;ref name="Levy-Bruhl"&gt;[[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] (1903). [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyaugus00harrgoog#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Philosophy of Auguste Comte'']. New York: Putnam and Sons, pp. 297-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993). ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 261–8 {{ISBN|052143405X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his voluminous correspondence, Maistre left two books that were published posthumously. ''Soirées de St. Pétersbourg'' ("The Saint Petersburg Dialogues", 1821) is a [[theodicy]] in the form of a [[Plato#Plato's dialogues|Platonic dialogue]],&lt;ref&gt;Kochin, Michael S. (2002). [http://www.tau.ac.il/~kochin/maislawsfinal.pdf "How Joseph De Maistre Read Plato’s Laws,"] ''Polis'', Vol. 19, Nos. 1–2, pp. 29–43.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Maistre argues that evil exists because of its place in the divine plan, according to which the blood sacrifice of innocents returns men to God, via the expiation of the sins of the guilty; Maistre sees this as a law of human history, as indubitable as it is mysterious. ''Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon'', ("An Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon," 1836), is a critique of the thought of [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Huet, François (1837). "Le Chancelier Bacon et le Comte Joseph de Maistre." In: [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015073711635 ''Nouvelles Archives Historiques, Philosophiques et Littéraires.''] Gand: C. Annoot-Braekman, vol. I, pp. 65–94.&lt;/ref&gt; whom Maistre considers to be the fountainhead of the destructive [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightened]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Gourmont, Rémy de (1905). "François Bacon et Joseph de Maistre." In: ''Promenades Philosophiques.'' Paris: Mercure de France, pp. 7–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repute and influence==
Maistre, together with the [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman and philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], is commonly regarded as one of the founders of European conservatism,&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Michel (1984). "Edmund Burke et Joseph de Maistre", ''Revue de l'Université d'Ottawa'', Vol. 54, pp. 49–58.&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 19th century, Maistre's authoritarian, "throne-and-altar" conception of conservatism has declined in influence in comparison with the more liberal conservatism of Burke. Maistre's skills as a writer and polemicist however ensure that he continues to be read. [[Matthew Arnold]], an influential 19th-century critic, while comparing Maistre's style with his Irish counterpart, wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Joseph de Maistre is another of those men whose word, like that of Burke, has vitality. In imaginative power he is altogether inferior to Burke. On the other hand his thought moves in closer order than Burke's, more rapidly, more directly; he has fewer superfluities. Burke is a great writer, but Joseph de Maistre's use of the French language is more powerful, more thoroughly satisfactory, than Burke's use of the English. It is masterly; it shows us to perfection of what that admirable instrument, the French language, is capable.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Matthew (1973). "Joseph de Maistre on Russia." In: ''English Literature and Irish Politics.'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' of 1910 describes his writing style as "strong, lively, picturesque," and that his "animation and good humour temper his dogmatic tone. He possesses a wonderful facility in exposition, precision of doctrine, breadth of learning, and [[dialectic]]al power."&lt;ref name=cath/&gt; [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], though a political opponent, admired the splendour of his prose:

{{quote|That brief, nervous, lucid style, stripped of phrases, robust of limb, did not at all recall the softness of the eighteenth century, nor the declamations of the latest French books: it was born and steeped in the breath of the Alps; it was virgin, it was young, it was harsh and savage; it had no human respect, it felt its solitude; it improvised depth and form all at once… That man was new among the ''enfants du siècle'' [children of the century].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alphonse |last=de Lamartine|title= Souvenirs et Portraits|url=https://archive.org/stream/souvenirsetportr01lama#page/n5/mode/2up |edition= |volume=1 |location=Paris: Hachette et Cie. |year=1874 |chapter=Les De Maistre |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Émile Faguet]] described Maistre as "a fierce absolutist, a furious theocrat, an intransigent legitimist, apostle of a monstrous trinity composed of pope, king and hangman, always and everywhere the champion of the hardest, narrowest and most inflexible dogmatism, a dark figure out of the Middle Ages, part learned doctor, part inquisitor, part executioner."&lt;ref&gt;Émile Faguet, ''Politiques et Moralistes du Dix-neuvieme Siècle'', 1st series, Paris: Société Française d'Imprimerie et de Librairie, 1899.

Amongst those who admired him was the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]],&lt;ref&gt;Alphonsus, Mère Mary (1942). ''The Influence of Joseph de Maistre on Baudelaire. "De Maistre et Edgar Poe m'ont appris à Raisonner" (journaux intimes).'' Bryn Mawr: Bryn Mawr College doctoral thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eygun, Francois-Xavier (1990). "Influence de Joseph de Maistre sur les "Fleurs du Mal" de Baudelaire", ''Revue des Etudes Maistriennes'', Vol. 11, pp. 139–147.&lt;/ref&gt; who described himself a disciple of the Savoyard counter-revolutionary, claiming that he had taught him how to think.&lt;ref&gt;"De Maistre and Edgar Poe taught me to reason." — Baudelaire, Charles (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/baudelairehispro00baud ''Intimate Papers from the Unpublished Works of Baudelaire. Baudelaire – His Prose and Poetry.''] New York: The Modern Library, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Saintsbury]] called him "unquestionably one of the greatest thinkers and writers of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, George (1917). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433043675325;view=1up;seq=5 ''A Short History of French Literature.''] Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Maistre also exerted a powerful influence on the Spanish political thinker [[Juan Donoso Cortés]]&lt;ref&gt;Tarrago, Rafael E. (1999). [http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/cssr/Archival/1999/1999_167.pdf "Two Catholic Conservatives: The Ideas of Joseph de Maistre and Juan Donoso Cortes,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013164745/http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/cssr/Archival/1999/1999_167.pdf |date=13 October 2014 }} ''Catholic Social Science Review'', Vol. 4, pp. 167–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spektorowski, Alberto (2002). "Maistre, Donoso Cortes, and the Legacy of Catholic Authoritarianism," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 63, No. 2, pp. 283–302.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, on the French anti-Semitic monarchist [[Charles Maurras]]&lt;ref&gt;Gerin-Ricard, Lazare de (1929). ''Les Idées Politiques de Joseph de Maistre et la Doctrine de Maurras.'' La Rochelle: Editions Rupella.&lt;/ref&gt; and his counter-revolutionary political movement ''[[Action Française]]''.

According to Carolina Armenteros, Maistre's writings influenced not only conservative political thinkers, but also the [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]].&lt;ref name="Armenteros"&gt;Armenteros, Carolina (2011). ''The French Idea of History: Joseph de Maistre and his Heirs, 1794-1854''. Ithaca, NY and London: Cornell University Press {{ISBN|0-8014-4943-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early sociologists such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] explicitly acknowledged the influence of Maistre on their own thinking about the sources of social cohesion and political authority.&lt;ref name="Levy-Bruhl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickering" /&gt;

      <comment>Removed the following: "Miki was an ethnic nationalist, arguing in Principles of Thought for a New Japan (1939) that ‘race is a whole that transcends economic classes, and the state is the one moral whole which is established on the basis of a race’." The article referenced (from The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 39, No. 1, 1979, pp. 39-63) does not use the technical phrase "ethnic nationalist". The article also makes speculative claims about Miki's motivations and political commitments without taking into account relevant academic contexts and terminology (specifically the esoteric terminology about "race" and "species" employed by influential colleagues Tanabe and Nishida, and how these related to still-contested philosophical propositions about the State from G W F Hegel). It is not an appropriate reference for a biographical claim about Miki's political affiliations.</comment>

{{nihongo|'''Kiyoshi Miki'''|三木 清|Miki Kiyoshi|extra= January 5, 1897 – September 26, 1945}} was a [[Japan]]ese philosopher.

== Biography ==
Miki was a native of what is now part of [[Tatsuno, Hyōgo]]. He studied [[philosophy]] under [[Nishida Kitarō]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]] at the [[Kyoto University|Kyoto Imperial university]]. Later he went to [[Germany]], to study the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Upon his return to Japan, his outspokenness and outgoing lifestyle, coupled with a controversial affair with an older woman, led to his being denied an academic position at Kyoto. Further trouble engulfed him when he lent money to a friend who used it, unbeknown to Miki, to contribute to the [[Japanese Communist Party]]. Miki was then implicated in this development (the far-left movements were being cracked down upon, and such donations were illegal) and after brief imprisonment lost any chance of regaining decent academic standing. While he remained in touch with his mentor, Nishida, and other members of the [[Kyoto School]], he worked outside of academia proper, producing popular writings aimed at a wide audience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Miki believed that philosophy should be pragmatic and utilized in addressing concrete social and political problems. He wrote articles for the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] newspaper, providing commentary on issues of the day. His firm belief that philosophy should lead politics encouraged the political activism of intellectuals, and when he was offered in 1937 the opportunity to head up the cultural section of the ''[[Showa Kenkyu Kai]]'' ([[Showa Research Association]]), a [[think tank]] concerned with building an intellectual basis for Prince [[Konoe Fumimaro]]'s ''[[Shintaisei]]'' (New Order Movement), he eagerly accepted. While he formulated the concept of the "[[Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere]]," he was infuriated when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] employed it in justifying its aggressive expansion in [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Following the collapse of the [[Showa Kenkyu Kai]], and in an environment of the [[Japanese militarism|militarization of society]] and intensifying warfare abroad, Miki became depressed and isolated. After helping a friend on the run from the authorities, he was imprisoned and died in Toyotama Prison 40 days after the war ended, on September 26 1945&lt;ref&gt;"Miki Kiyoshi", Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; due to an illness resulting from poor prison conditions.{{fact|date=April 2017}} His death, at a time when the [[Occupied Japan|US Occupation of Japan]] was already underway, deeply upset Japanese intellectuals. As a result, the [[American occupation of Japan|American Occupation]] pressed to release political prisoners. Miki's complete works are available from Iwanami Shoten.

In Shoji Muramoto's psychological article "Historical Reflections for the International Development of Japanese Humanistic Psychology.", Kiyoshi is credited as a "central figure in the Japanese humanistic movement" because of his authoring of "the first book explicitly related to the existentialist tradition written by a Japanese thinker":&lt;ref name="www5d.biglobe.ne.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~shojimur/humanistic%20psychology/Historical%20Reflections%20for%20the%20International%20Development%20of%20.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805231343/http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~shojimur/humanistic%20psychology/Historical%20Reflections%20for%20the%20International%20Development%20of%20.htm |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Studies of Human Being in Pascal" (1926).

=== Thought ===
Miki developed a reading of Heidegger's early philosophy as essentially being in the tradition of [[Christian]] [[individualism]], reaching back to [[Saint Augustine]] and being fundamentally anti-Greek in character. As such, his reading of Heidegger falls with the broad class as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in that it ignores the priority Heidegger gives to the [[ontology|ontological]] question of [[Being]], in favor of seeing Heidegger's philosophy as an analysis of human [[existence]].

He became a [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] in 1925, and preceded Sartre in suggesting a synthesis of [[Marxism]] and [[existentialism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was influential in his intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;Susan C. Townsend, '''Miki Kiyoshi, 1897-1945: Japan's Itinerant Philosopher''', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loomio was built by a core group of developers, based out of [[Wellington|Wellington, New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enspiral.com/ventures/loomio|title=Loomio - The Enspiral Network|publisher=Enspiral Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905021136/http://www.enspiral.com/ventures/loomio|archivedate=5 September 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many contributors from all over the world have donated money and time, in an effort to fund the new platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/loomio/loomio/graphs/contributors|title=Contributors to loomio/loomio|publisher=Github|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Loomio raised over $100,000 via a [[Crowdfunding]] effort to develop Loomio 1.0. The Loomio 1.0 software supports mobile phone usage and other enhancements.&lt;ref name="Wired profile"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/loomio/ | title=Out in the Open: Occupy Wall Street Reincarnated as Open Source Software| work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| date=28 April 2014 | accessdate=28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Loomio emerged from the [[Occupy movement]]. In 2012, it launched its first prototype. It was utilized in the [[Occupy protests in New Zealand|Occupy movement in New Zealand]]. After using the first prototype in this, the team behind Loomio felt that it would be easier to give everyone a voice with an online software, leading to the launch of Loomio 1.0. Since the launch of Loomio 1.0, Loomio has stopped using [[Occupy hand signals|occupy hand-signals]] in the interface. It has since been developed into a social enterprise, and linked to the popular trend of "platform cooperativism".&lt;ref name="yes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/how-a-worker-owned-tech-startup-found-investors-and-kept-its-values-20160426|title=How a Worker-Owned Tech Startup Found Investors—and Kept Its Values|publisher=YES!

== Operation ==
[[File:Loomio 2.jpg|thumb|Diagram depicting how Loomio works]]
The top-level organizational structure in Loomio is the ''group''. A group is made up of members, who are granted permission to that group. Groups can be both public and private, permitting for both privacy and transparency.

Within the groups, members create discussions on specific topics. During a discussion, members of the group post comments and create proposals.

Proposals solicit feedback from members on a specific proposition.  Members can either agree, disagree, abstain, or block. Blocking is essentially a strong form of disagreement.

== Funding ==

Loomio is funded through contracts with government and business, and [[crowdfunding|donations from its users]].&lt;ref&gt;https://love.loomio.org{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Loomio has been used by the [[Wellington City Council]] for [[open-source governance|discussion with their citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loomio Launches Exciting Collaboration with Wellington City Council|date=15 March 2013|url=http://blog.enspiral.com/2013/03/15/loomio-launches-exciting-collaboration-with-wellington-city-council/|work=blog.enspiral.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106095818/http://blog.enspiral.com/2013/03/15/loomio-launches-exciting-collaboration-with-wellington-city-council/|archivedate=6 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El [http://www.partidopirata.cl/ Partido Pirata de Chile] has also adopted Loomio through their own fork called ''Lumio'', offering a slightly different translation into Spanish for the voting  options aiming at both remarking the importance of consensus and improving language style by using verbs in the first person singular (''Concuerdo'', ''Discrepo,'' ''Me abstengo'' y ''Solicito Reformluar'').  Additionally, the PPCL has promoted the use of Lumio in different areas of political discussion and group coordination inside and outside the Party &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partidopirata.cl/uso-de-herramientas-digitales-para-mejorar-la-democracia/|title=Declaración Pública Partido Pirata de Chile sobre el Uso de herramientas digitales para mejorar la democracia|work=www.partidopirata.cl|author= Partido Pirata de Chile |date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is a professor of philosophy and is currently serving as rector of [[Usman Institute of Technology]] (UIT) in Karachi, Sindh Province. He has international prestige for publishing articles, books, and leading edge research on the field of [[Philosophy of science]], particularly the philosophy of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Manzoor Ahmed was born into an [[Urdu speaking|Urdu-speaking]] family, in [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] on 11 March 1934.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Tribute"&gt;{{cite news |title=Manzoor Ahmad assumes charge of Rector IIU|url=http://www.paktribune.com/news/print.php?id=136736|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=Pakistan Tribute|date=9 March 2004|author=Staff reporter|agency=Pakistan Tribute|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents [[Home schooling|home schooled]] him, and he was later enrolled in a local middle school.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Bahzad Alam|title=AUTHOR: Dr Manzoor Ahmad: Impatient iconoclast|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/030112/books8.htm|publisher=Dawn Group of Media industries|accessdate=4 July 2012|pages=1–6|date=12 January 2003|quote=In Pakistan a teacher is an autocratic giver whose wisdom must never be questioned. By the same token, a student is an acquiescent taker. Curiosity, which is otherwise a praiseworthy virtue, is regarded as a contemptible vice and is severely frowned upon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a child prodigy, and enrolled in [[High School]] at the age of seven, where he excelled.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; Ahmad graduated from high school, and stood first in the matriculation examination for the state.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; He attended [[Rampur State|Raza Inter-College]] (RIC) where he studied science and philosophy, and stood first in the college examination for university transfer. Ahmad was persuaded by his family to study [[medicines]]; he therefore applied for three medical schools— [[King George Medical University, Lucknow|King George Medical University]] in [[Lucknow]], [[King Edward Medical College]] in [[Lahore]], and [[Dow Medical College]] in Karachi.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; However, Ahmad decided to pursue his inclination for philosophy and did not join any of these institutions. He moved to Karachi, Sindh Province and joined S.M. Arts College.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt;

In 1947, Ahmad acquired the Pakistani [[Citizenship in Pakistan|citizenship]], joining [[Karachi University]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; There he studied physics, mathematics and philosophy, and obtained a [[Minor (academic)|minor]] in [[Mathematics]], and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] (Hons) in [[Physics]] and a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Philosophy]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; In 1955, Ahmad obtained a [[Master of Arts|MA]] in philosophy from the same university.&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt;  With a [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC scholarship]], Ahmad went to [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] to attend the school of his choice. Ahmad enrolled in a doctoral programme at [[London University]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Group of Media industries"/&gt; Continuing his interest in physics, Ahmad was awarded a doctorate in [[philosophy of science]],&lt;ref name="Unknown publisher"/&gt; with a focus on the mathematical and philosophical notion of [[Space-time continuum|space and time continuum]].&lt;ref name="Unknown publisher"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief Biosketch|url=https://docs.google.com/a/unlv.nevada.edu/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:g2wrdEZlAWsJ:www.siut.org/bioethics/Manzoor%2520Ahmad%2520Edited%2520Biosketch.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjrtvYfDqESS2z2uguBWalHSPagZv8X4qxXPiRFcAdUsjjFcO1RmLDO0pa9Cry-Fh5yA4elvMUK5Wb8MneYj_TUyjT4fk2wggk4C5f6sUY5CVAjVghdAeyptWOZISXcad_hflo9&amp;sig=AHIEtbSqftYlsNQ3iAqgk6zRmV9zi02WqA|publisher=Unknown publisher|accessdate=4 July 2012|author=Manzoor Ahmad, Ph.D|format=google docs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
Since his return to his country, Ahmad has worked for the [[Government of Pakistan]], as head of various national and international organizations. He is also an active member of the [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] in Pakistan. After returning to Pakistan, Ahmad became associated to the [[Karachi University]] and has directed their [[#University of Karachi#Departments of University of Karachi|Department of Philosophy]]; he was later appointed as the Dean of their faculty of [[Fine Arts]]. Ahmad was the President of the Pakistan Philosophical Congress (PPC), which works for the improvement of [[Pakistani philosophy|Philosophical]] studies in the country. He was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]], and has lectured on philosophy of science at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California]]. He was also awarded fellowships by the [[James Graham Brown Foundation|Brown Foundation]] and the [[British Council]].

Ahmad held the vice-chancellorship of [[Hamdard University]] twice and holds the Chairmanship of the [[Usman Institute of Technology]] (UIT). He is the Rector of the [[Islamic International University]], [[Islamabad]] and Chairman of the Board of Governors for the [[Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]] (IVS).

===Philosophy, science and consciousness===
Ahmad has written important books about the relation between consciousness, science and philosophy. In his article, ''The Notion of Existence'', Ahmad argued that the impact of [[Scientific revolution|scientific development]] has created the problem of the subjectivity of sense qualities and a separation between knowledge and existence.&lt;ref name="Punjab University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=George F.|title=Philosophy in Pakistan|year=1998|publisher=Punjab University Press|location=Lahore, Punjab Pakistan |url=http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/IIA-3/chapter_xv.htm|author2=Manzoor Ahmad|edition=1|editor=Naeem Ahmad|accessdate=7 July 2012|language=English (Pakistani only)|chapter=The Notion of Existence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahmad further noted that, "the picture of the world given by immediate perception is totally different from what the world actually is, leading to an opposition between existence and true knowledge. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] solution is that this difference between knowledge and existence disappears to a certain extent in the clearest knowledge we possess, i.e. [[Mathematical sciences|mathematical knowledge]]."&lt;ref name="Punjab University Press"/&gt;  However, Ahmad believes in the theory of [[General theory of relativity|general relativity]] and cited that "without the existence of the [[Spacetime]] continuum, the universe would not exist and we would not exist".&lt;ref name="University of Allama Iqbal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad|first=Manzoor|title=Religion in the light of philosophy of self|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/apr61/6.htm|publisher=University of Allama Iqbal|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3801">{{Nihongo|'''Nakai Riken'''|中井 履軒|Riken Nakai|1732–1817}} was a leading academic in the [[Kaitokudo]] academy tradition of scholarship. He was the younger son of [[Nakai Shuan]] (1758 d.), one of the [[Kaitokudo]]'s two founding leaders, and was influenced by his teacher and mentor [[Goi Ranju]]. His intellectualised way of being led to continued engagement with but physical separation from the Kaitokudo. Much is made of his demeanor reflecting his.

Often stated as analogous to his floating [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] style Riken was vastly different in demeanour to his brother [[Nakai Chikuzan]], although their underlying [[epistemology|epistemologies]], beliefs and degree of tenacious individualism were similar. They both furthered the work of Goi Ranju and consolidating previous thought around the Kaitokudo school, bringing a level of prestige to the academy. 

Like his brother Chikuzan, Riken wholeheartedly denounced [[Ogyū Sorai]] and contended that all people have potential, to the extent that "even" commoners could become scholars, while he also denounced religion and superstition. However, Riken’s particular strain of the dismissal of ''dreams'', and the unverifiable led him to dabble in astronomy, most notably with [[Asada Goryu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Najita, Tetsuo]] (1987) ''Visions of Virtue in Tokugawa Japan. The Kaitokudo, Merchant Academy of Osaka''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 186-218&lt;/ref&gt;

Riken’s scholarship was far broader and is often perceived to transcend the specific question of reconciling the virtue of merchants with contemporary perceptions of merchants.

==Legacy==

Nakai Riken wrote extensive commentaries on the three of the [[four books and five classics|four books]]  [[Analects]], [[Doctrine of the mean]] and [[Mencius]]. He rejected other works as unreliable ''dreams'', largely due to their unverifiability. In these works, he dismissed [[the book of changes]], [[the book on Songs]] and [[the book of history]] as unreliable, and further [[the book of rites]] and [[the spring and autumn annals]] as unreliable or of authorship different from the received interpretation. 

However, his lasting legacy was in reaching a point of contradiction between the demand for verifiability in the Kaitokudo school and the reliance on the reading of text as history.&lt;ref&gt;Najita (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Nakai Riken, as well as Nakai Chikuzan and other contemporary moral philosophers outside the mainstream of Neo-confucianism, [[shingaku]] and [[Buddhism]] can be seen most immediately and concisely in the work of [[Yamagata Banto]]. It is said that Chikuzan has ongoing and great influence on his thought, but that Riken was more heavily involved in the final push toward publication of Yamagata’s work ''[[yume no shiro]]'' .

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to philosophy:

'''[[Philosophy]]''' &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as [[mysticism]], myth, or the arts) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "Philosophy" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''philosophia'' (φιλοσοφία), which literally means "love of wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111487 Philosophia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The definition of philosophy is: "1.orig., love of, or the search for, wisdom or knowledge 2.theory or logical analysis of the principles underlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe". {{cite book|title=Webster's New World Dictionary|edition=Second College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up''''' is a 2009 book by the American philosopher [[Irving Singer]], in which the author summarizes and expands upon the themes of his earlier three-volume works ''The Nature of Love'' (1984–1987) and ''Meaning in Life'' (1992–1996). The book, which has been described as an "intellectual biography" by its author, received positive reviews.

==Publication history==
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' was published by [[MIT Press]].{{sfn|Singer|2009|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' received positive reviews from the philosopher [[Leslie Armour]] in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Armour|2009|page=78}} and in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|2009|page=43}} The book was also reviewed by R. White in ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]''.{{sfn|White|2009|pages=319–320}}

Armour described the book as "an account of a life devoted to the idea of love and the love of ideas", and wrote that it summarizes Singer's previous work, including his philosophical trilogies ''The Nature of Love'' and ''Meaning in Life'', "with relaxed charm."{{sfn|Armour|2009|page=78}} The ''Publishers Weekly'' review described the book as "fairly interesting" and a summation of Singer's work, suggesting that it could serve as an introduction to it. It also wrote that it can serve as "a stand-alone survey of", or a model for understanding, the [[philosophy of love]].{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|2009|page=43}}

===Academic journals===
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' received positive reviews from Erica Lucast Stonestreet in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'',{{sfn|Stonestreet|2009}} and Michael Strawser in ''[[Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review]]''.{{sfn|Strawser|2010|pages=502–505}}

Stonestreet observed that the book deals with the same themes as Singer's previous works, such as ''The Nature of Love''. She wrote that it resembled a conversation in structure, and that it "lacks an overarching thesis and may for this reason be disappointing to someone who is looking for a systematic introduction to the philosophy of love", but credited Singer with being able to talk "graciously and thoughtfully about things that matter." She compared Singer's views to those of the philosopher [[Harry Frankfurt]], in that "both believe that love involves bestowing value on the beloved".{{sfn|Stonestreet|2009}} Strawser described the book as "the kind of book one wants to read by an eminent philosopher who has devoted his philosophical career to the study of love" and "an ideal opening text for a course on the philosophy of love". He credited Singer with providing an "accessible historical overview of the subject".{{sfn|Strawser|2010|pages=502–505}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Alan Soble]] wrote in the foreword to ''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' that it "is as much an intellectual biography as it is an exploration of love and sex", and observed that it "summarizes, explains, and elaborates" themes in Singer's ''The Nature of Love''. He recommended it to "potential students of the philosophy of love and sex".{{sfn|Soble|1999|pages=ix–xii}}

'''''Pratītyasamutpāda''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद pratītyasamutpāda}}; {{lang-pi|पटिच्चसमुप्पाद}} ''paṭiccasamuppāda''), commonly translated as '''dependent origination''', or '''dependent arising''', is a key principle in Buddhist teachings,{{refn|group=note|The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' doctrine, states Mathieu Boisvert, is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism and it may be considered as "the common denominator of all the Buddhist traditions throughout the world, whether Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mathieu Boisvert |title=The Five Aggregates: Understanding Theravada Psychology and Soteriology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUTRBtvSUaUC |year=1995|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-257-3 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which states that all ''dharmas'' ("phenomena") arise in dependence upon other ''dharmas'': "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist".

The principle is expressed in the [[Twelve Nidānas|links of dependent origination]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') in [[Buddhism]], a linear list of twelve elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which arise depending on the preceding link. Traditionally the list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}} An alternate Theravada interpretation regards the list as describing the arising of mental formations and the resultant notion of "I" and "mine," which are the source of suffering.&lt;ref name="Payutto"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2009}} Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth.{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr. |author2=Donald S. Lopez Jr. |title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-4805-8 |pages=583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the list, and regard it to be a later synthesis of several older lists.{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=167-168}}{{sfn|Schumann|1997}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009}}{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}} The first four links may be a mockery of the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogeny, as described in the ''[[Hymn of Creation]]'' of Veda X, 129 and the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}}{{sfn|Wayman|1984|p=173 with note 16}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=256}}{{sfn|Wayman|1971}} These were integrated with a branched list which describe the conditioning of mental processes,{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jones|2009}} akin to the five skandhas.{{sfn|Boisvert|1995}} Eventually, this branched list developed into the standard twelvefold chain as a linear list.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}} While this list may be interpreted as describing the processes which give rise to rebirth, in essence it describes the arising of ''dukkha'' as a psychological process, without the involvement of an atman.{{sfn|Shulman|2007}}{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}

==Etymology and meaning==

===Etymology===
''Pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms:
* pratitya: "having depended";{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} it appears in various [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]], such as hymns 4.5.14, 7.68.6 of the [[Rigveda]] and 19.49.8 of [[Atharvaveda]], in the sense of "confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_७.६८ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ७.६८], Rigveda 7.68.6, Wikisource; Quote: उत त्यद्वां जुरते अश्विना भूच्च्यवानाय '''प्रतीत्यं''' हविर्दे । अधि यद्वर्प इतऊति धत्थः ॥६॥&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwp623/&gt; The Sanskrit root of the word is ''prati*'' whose forms appear more extensively in the Vedic literature, and it means "to go towards, go back, come back, to approach" with the connotation of "observe, learn, convince oneself of the truth of anything, be certain of, believe, give credence, recognize". In other contexts, a related term ''pratiti*'' means "going towards, approaching, insight into anything".&lt;ref name=mmwp623&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=623}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* samutpada: "arising",{{sfn|Hopkins|1983|p=163}} "rise, production, origin"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=samutpada+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU spokensanskrit.de, ''samutpada'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Vedic literature, it means "spring up together, arise, come to pass, occur, effect, form, produce, originate".&lt;ref name=mmwp1078&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been translated into English variously as ''dependent origination'', ''dependent arising'', ''interdependent co-arising'', ''conditioned arising'', and ''conditioned genesis''.{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=29, Quote: "''Dependent origination'' has two meanings in Buddhist thought. The first refers to the twelvefold sequence of causation... The second meaning of ''dependent origination'' is a more general one, the notion that everything comes into existence in dependence on something else. It is this second meaning that [[Nagarjuna]] equates with emptiness and the middle way."}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|The term ''pratītyasamutpāda'' been translated into English as conditioned arising,{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}} conditioned genesis,{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations  791-809}} dependent arising,{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}{{refn|group=quote|The Dalai Lama explains: "In Sanskrit the word for dependent-arising is ''pratityasamutpada''. The word ''pratitya'' has three different meanings–meeting, relying, and depending–but all three, in terms of their basic import, mean dependence. ''Samutpada'' means arising. Hence, the meaning of ''pratityasamutpada'' is that which arises in dependence upon conditions, in reliance upon conditions, through the force of conditions."{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|p=35}}}} dependent co-arising,{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2008}} or dependent origination&lt;ref group=web name=brit1/&gt;}}

The term may also refer to the twelve nidānas, [[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni,'' from ''dvāvaśa'' ("twelve") + ''nidānāni'' (plural of "''nidāna''", "cause, motivation, link").{{refn|group=quote|The Nalanda Translation Committee states: "Pratitya-samutpada is the technical name for the Buddha’s teaching on cause and effect, in which he demonstrated how all situations arise through the coming together of various factors. In the hinayana, it refers in particular to the twelve nidānas, or links in the chain of samsaric becoming."&lt;ref group=web name=nalanda1&gt;Nalanda Translation Committee, [http://nalandatranslation.org/offerings/choosing-the-right-word/dependent-arising-tendrel/ Dependent Arising/Tendrel]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Generally speaking, in the Mahayana tradition, ''pratityasamutpada'' (Sanskrit) is used to refer to the general principle of interdependent causation, whereas in the Theravada tradition, ''paticcasamuppāda'' (Pali) is used to refer to the twelve nidānas.

===Meaning===

====Conditionality====
The ''Pratityasamutpada'' teachings asserts neither direct Newtonian-like causality nor a single causality. Rather, it asserts an indirect conditioned causality and a plural causality.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein |title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3683-7 |pages=512–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "causal link" propositions in Buddhism is very different from the idea of causality that developed in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Debrock |editor=Paul B. Scheurer|others=G. Debrock|title=Newton’s Scientific and Philosophical Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y18yBwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2809-1 |pages=376 with note 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=153-155}} Instead, the concept of causality in Buddhism is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate phenomena within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of realms of existence for another lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Kalupahana|title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1|pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=67–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=151-152}} The ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' principle asserts that the dependent origination is necessary and sufficient condition in both directions. This is expressed in [[Majjhima Nikaya]] as "When this is, that is; This arising, that arises; When this is not, that is not; This ceasing, that ceases."{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}&lt;ref name="Storhoff2010p74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Storhoff|title=American Buddhism as a Way of Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUCoZygxHRoC |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3095-9|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontological principle====
According to Peter Harvey, ''Pratityasamutpada'' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle; that is, a theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|Harvey: "This [doctrine] states the principle of conditionality, that all things, mental and physical, arise and exist due to the presence of certain conditions, and cease once their conditions are removed: nothing (except ''Nibbana'') is independent.

====Workings of the mind====
Against Harvey's ontological interpretation, Eviatar Shulman argues that 
{{quote|dependent-origination addresses the workings of the mind alone. Dependent-origination should be understood to be no more than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self). Viewing pratitya-samutpada as a description of the nature of reality in general means investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from later Buddhist discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shulman grants that there are some ontological implications that may be gleaned from dependent origination, but that at its core it is concerned with "identifying the different processes of mental conditioning and describing their relations".&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, E; Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:297–317 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8,http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Meanings%20of%20Dependent%20Origination_Shulman_JIP_2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Noa Ronkin states that while Buddha suspends all views regarding certain metaphysical questions, he is not an anti-metaphysician: nothing in the texts suggests that metaphysical questions are completely meaningless, instead Buddha taught that sentient experience is dependently originated and that whatever is dependently originated is conditioned, impermanent, subject to change, and lacking independent selfhood.{{sfn|Ronkin|2009}}

==Twelve Nidanas==
The twelve [[Nidana|nidāna]]s ([[Pāli|Pali]]: ''dvādasanidānāni,'' Sanskrit: ''dvādaśanidānāni'') is a linear list of twelve  elements from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings which are ''pratītyasamutpāda'', arising depending on the previous link. According to Shulman, "the 12 links ''are paticcasamuppada''"; in the suttas, dependent origination refers to nothing else but the process of mental conditioning as described by the twelve ''nidanas''.{{sfn|Shulman|2007|p=307}}

Traditionally the standard-list is interpreted as describing the conditional arising of rebirth in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'', and the resultant ''[[Dukkha|duḥkha]]'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pallis&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Pallis |title=A Buddhist Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7Laz6jbnIIC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2003|publisher=World Wisdom |isbn=978-0-941532-40-2 |pages=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M.

===Several series===
There are various Nidana lists throughout the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] and collections such as the [[Pali]] Nikayas, the most common of which is a list of [[Twelve Nidānas]] which appears in both Pali texts and [[Mahayana sutras]] such as the [[Salistamba Sutra]]. The 'dependent origination' doctrine is presented in Vinaya Pitaka 1.1–2, in abbreviated form in Samyutta Nikaya 2.1, 2.19 and 2.76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDermott |editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0 |pages=167 with note 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williams | first=David M. | title=The Translation and Interpretation of the Twelve Terms in the Paticcasamuppada | journal=Numen | publisher= BRILL Academic | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=1974 | pages=35–63 |  doi=10.2307/3269713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dīgha Nikāya Sutta 1, the Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71 describes six Nidānas:
{{quote|[...] [T]hey experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1996), page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walshe|first=Maurice|title=The Long Discourses of the Buddha: a Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya|year=1996|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-86171-103-1|page=656|edition=3. [Aufl.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Brahmajala Sutta, verse 3.71. This is identified as the first reference in the Canon in footnote 88 for Sutta 1, verse 3.71's footnotes.}}}}

Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 14 describes ten links, and in Sutta 15 nine links are described, but without the six sense{{nbhyph}}bases:&lt;ref&gt;Walshe 1996, page 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...they experience these feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness and distress.}}

Descriptions of the full sequence of twelve links can be found elsewhere in the Pali canon, for instance in section 12 of the Samyutta Nikaya:&lt;ref name="SN12.2"&gt;Samyutta Nikaya 12.2, [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html ''Paticca-samuppada-vibhanga Sutta: Analysis of Dependent Co-arising'']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications ... From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.}}

One can only see through the window.' Similarly, in the case of seeing, there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing. (So the eye does not have the ability to see without the eye-consciousness. The eye-consciousness itself cannot see anything without the organ.) The eye is not seeing, nor is seeing the eye, yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye. In reality, seeing comes into being depending on the eye.

"Nidanas" are co-dependent events or phenomena, which act as links on a chain, conditioning and depending on each other.&lt;ref name="Harris1991p135"/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=brit1/&gt; When certain conditions are present, they give rise to subsequent conditions, which in turn give rise to other conditions.&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pallis/&gt;&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60/&gt; Phenomena are sustained only so long as their sustaining factors remain.&lt;ref name="nutriments"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thera|first=Nyanaponika|title=The Four Nutriments of Life: An Anthology of Buddhist Texts|year=2006|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka, ''The Wheel'' Publication No. 105|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causal relationship is expressed in its most general form as follows:{{refn|group=note|The general formula can be found in the following discourses in the [[Pali Canon]]: [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 79, MN 115, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]]12.21, SN 12.22, SN 12.37, SN 12.41, SN 12.49, SN 12.50, SN 12.61, SN 12.62, SN 55.28, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.92, [[Udana|Ud]]. 1.1 (first two lines), Ud. 1.2 (last two lines), Ud. 1.3, [[Niddesa|Nd]]2, [[Patisambhidamagga|Patis]].}}

===Reversal===
Traditionally, the reversal of the causal chain is explained as leading to the annihilation of mental formations and rebirth:{{sfn|Harvey|2015|p=50-59}}&lt;ref name=emamnuelp60/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris1991p135"/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=brit1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica.

* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}}

|-
|[[Faith in Buddhism|Faith]] (''saddhā'')
|An attitude of trust directed at ultimate liberation and as refuge in the [[Refuge (Buddhism)|three jewels]]. The sutta states that "suffering is the supporting condition for faith", thereby linking it with the last nidana in the 12 nidana chain. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: "it is the experience of suffering which first tears us out of our blind absorption in the immediacy of temporal being and sets us in search of a way to its transcendence." Faith also comes about through the hearing of the exposition of true Dhamma (teaching). Faith also leads to the practice of [[Buddhist ethics|morality]] (sila).
|-
|Joy (''pāmojja'')
|From confidence in the sources of refuge and contemplation on them, a sense of joy arises
|-
|[[Pīti|Rapture]] (''pīti'')
|Generally, the application of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] is needed for the arising of rapture or bliss, though some rare individuals might experience rapture simply from the joy which arises from faith and a clear conscience arising from moral living. The meditative states called [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] are states of elevated rapture.
|-
|[[Passaddhi|Tranquillity]] (''passaddhi'')
|In the higher states of meditation, rapture gives way to a calm sense of tranquility. 
|-
|[[Sukha|Happiness]] (''sukha'')
|A subtler state than rapture, a pleasant feeling. 
|-
|[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Concentration]] (''samādhi'')
|"The wholesome unification of the mind", totally free from distractions and unsteadiness. 
|-
|''yathābhūta-ñānadassana''
|"Knowledge and vision of things as they really are". With a peaceful and concentrated mind, one is now able to practice the development of insight (''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]] bhavana),'' the first phase of which is insight into the nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]]''.'' Only ''pañña,'' the wisdom which penetrates the true nature of phenomena, can destroy the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] which keep beings bound to samsara. This wisdom is not mere conceptual understanding, but a kind of direct experience akin to visual perception which sees the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of all phenomena. In Northern Buddhist traditions and Mahayana works, insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] is further emphasized. 
|-
|Disenchantment (''nibbidā'')
|Noticing the passing away of phenomena, the fact that nothing is stable, reliable or permanent, gives rise to a sense of disenchantment towards them. B. Bodhi: "a conscious act of detachment resulting from a profound noetic discovery. ''Nibbida'' signifies in short, the serene, dignified withdrawal from phenomena which supervenes when the illusion of their permanence, pleasure, and selfhood has been shattered by the light of correct knowledge and vision of things as they are."
|-
|Dispassion (''virāga'')
|The first truly transmundane (''lokuttara'') stage in the progression. B. Bodhi: "Whatever tends to provoke grasping and adherence is immediately abandoned, whatever tends to create new involvement is left behind. The old urges towards outer extension and accumulation give way to a new urge towards relinquishment as the one clearly perceived way to release."
|-
|[[Vimutti|Freedom]] (''vimutti'')
|Having a twofold aspect: the emancipation from ignorance ''(paññavimutti)'' and defilements ''(cetovimutti)'' experienced in life, the other is the emancipation from repeated existence attained when passing away. Equivalent with [[Nibbana]].
|-
|''āsava-khaye-ñāna''
|"Knowledge of destruction of the [[Asava|Asavas]]". This is a stage termed retrospective cognition or "reviewing knowledge" ''(paccavekkhana ñana),'' which reviews and confirms that all defilements have been abandoned. B. Bodhi: "The retrospective cognition of release involves two acts of ascertainment. The first, called the "knowledge of destruction" ''(khaya ñana),'' ascertains that all defilements have been abandoned at the root; the second, the "knowledge of non-arising" ''(anuppade ñana),'' ascertains that no defilement can ever arise again."

The Upanisa Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya describes the reversed order, in which the causes for enlightenment are given. This application of the principle of dependent arising is referred to in Theravada exegetical literature as "transcendental dependent arising".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "Transcendental Dependent Arising: A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "In addition to giving a clear, explicit account of the conditional structure of the liberative progression, this sutta has the further advantage of bringing the supramundane form of dependent arising into immediate connection with its familiar samsaric counterpart. By making this connection it brings into prominence the comprehensive character of the principle of conditionality — its ability to support and explain both the process of compulsive involvement which is the origin of suffering and the process of disengagement which leads to deliverance from suffering. Thereby it reveals dependent arising to be the key to the unity and coherence of the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi. Transcendental Dependent Arising. A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The chain in this case is:

==Interpretation of the twelve nidanas==

===Theravāda===
Within the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, the twelve nidanas are considered to be the most significant application of the principle of dependent origination.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=141}}

The nikayas themselves do not give a systematic explanation of the nidana series.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; As an expository device, the commentarial tradition presented the factors as a linear sequence spanning over three lives,&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi 2005, page 314"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''In the Buddha's Words.'' Wisdom Publications, 2005, page 314.&lt;/ref&gt; thus shifting the theme from a single conception (and birth) to a sequence of "incarnations" (roughly speaking). The twelve nidanas were interpreted by [[Buddhaghosa]] (c. fifth century CE) of the Sri Lankan [[Mahavihara]] tradition as encompassing three successive lives, as outlined in his influential [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Olson (Translator)|title=Buddhadhamma: Natural Laws and Values for Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffsumKIixS8C |year=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2631-9|pages=112–115, 171–172 with footnote 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keownprebish269&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S.

====Arising of mental processes====
Yet, the twelve nidanas have also been interpreted within the Theravada tradition as explaining the arising of psychological or phenomenological processes in the present moment. There is scriptural support for this as an explanation in the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]], insofar as Vasubandu states that on occasion "the twelve parts are realized in one and the same moment".&lt;ref&gt;Abhidharmakosa, by Vasubandhu. Translated by Leo Pruden, Vol. II, pgs 404-405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]] notes that in Buddhaghosa's Sammohavinodani, a commentary to the [[Vibhanga]] of the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the principle of Dependent Origination is explained as occurring entirely within the space of one mind moment.&lt;ref name=Payutto2&gt;Ven. Prayudh Payutto, Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm#C5&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Prayudh Payutto]] there is material in the [[Vibhanga]] which discusses both models, the three lifetimes model and the phenomenological mind moment model.&lt;ref name=Payutto2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (2003), [http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/JACBUD.html ''Buddhadasa. Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand''], p.90-91&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis is also defended by Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]]'s ''Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination.'' In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sarvāstivāda===
According to Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner, the three-lives model, with its "embryological" interpretation which links dependent origination with rebirth was also promoted by the [[Sarvastivadin]] school (a north Indian branch of the [[Sthavira nikāya]]) as evidenced by the [[Abhidharmakosa]] of [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th to 5th century CE).&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"&gt;Hirakawa; Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhidharmakosa]] also outlines three other models of the twelve nidanas, that were used by the Sarvastivada schools together with the three lifetimes model:&lt;ref name="Hirakawa page 178"/&gt;
#Instantaneous – All 12 links are present in the same instant.
#Prolonged – The interdependence and causal relationship of dharmas or phenomenal events arising at different times.
#Serial – The causal relationship of the twelve links arising and ceasing in continuous series of moments.

===Yogacara===
[[Asanga]] (4th century CE) groups the twelve nidanas into four groups: 1-3 cause of dharmas; 4-7 dharmas; 8-10 cause of suffering; 11-12 suffering.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=173}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|right|The twelve nidanas are typically shown on the outer rim of a [[Bhavachakra]] in Buddhist artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Brandon|title=History, Time, and Deity: A Historical and Comparative Study of the Conception of Time in Religious Thought and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sny7AAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''[[bhavachakra]]'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; [[Pali language|Pāli]]: ''bhavachakra''; [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''srid pa'i 'khor lo'') is a symbolic representation of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]] (or cyclic existence). It is found on the outside walls of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help ordinary people understand Buddhist teachings. The Three Fires sit at the very center of the schemata in the [[Bhavacakra]] and drive the whole edifice. In Himalayan iconographic representations of the Bhavacakra such as within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the Three Fires are known as the Three Poisons which are often represented as the [[Gankyil]]. The Gankyil is also often represented as the hub of the [[Dharmacakra]].

[[Tsongkhapa]], following [[Asanga]], explains how the twelve nidanas can be applied to one life of a single person, two lives of a single person, and three lives of a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=180–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussing the three lifetimes model, Alex Wayman states that the Theravada/Sarvāstivāda interpretation is different from the Vajrayana view, because the Vajrayana view places a ''bardo'' or an intermediate state between death and rebirth, which is denied by the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins. This denial necessitated placing the first two nidanas of the "dependent origination" chain into the past life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=186–187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan Buddhism tradition allocates the twelve nidanas differently between various lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman |title=Buddhist Insight: Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7 |pages=184–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the twelve nidanas==

===Synthesis of older versions===

====Combination of older lists====
According to Frauwallner, the twelvefold chain is a combination of two lists. Originally, the Buddha explained the appearance of ''dukkha'' from ''tanha'', "thirst," craving. This is explained and described in the second part, from ''tanha'' on fowards. Later on, under influence of concurring systems, the Buddha incorporated ''avijja'', "ignorance," as a cause of suffering into his system. This is described in the first part, which describes the entry of ''vijnana'' into the womb, where the embryo develops.{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=167-168}} Frauwallner notes that "the purely mechanical mixing of both the two parts of the causal chainis remarkable and enigmatical." Noting that "contradictory thoughts stand directly near one another in the oldest Buddhistic ideas" many times, Frauwallner explains this as a "deficiency in systematization, the inability to mix different views and principles into a great unity."{{sfn|Frauwallner|1973|p=168}}

According to Schumann, the twelvefold chain is a later composition by monks, consisting of three shorter lists. These lists may have encompassed ''nidana'' 1-4, 5-8, and 8-12. The progress of this composition can be traced in various steps in the canon.{{sfn|Schumann|1997|p=92}}

Lambert Schmitthausen argues that the twelve-fold list is a synthesis from three previous lists, arguing that the three lifetimes-interpretation is an unintended consequence of this synthesis.{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=305, note 19}}{{refn|group=note|Shulman refers to Schmitthausen (2000), ''Zur Zwolfgliedrigen Formel des Entstehens in Abhangigkeit'', in ''Horin: Vergleichende Studien zur Japanischen Kultur, 7''}}

Roderick S. Bucknell analysed four versions of the twelve nidanas, to explain the existence of various versions of the ''pratitya-samutpada'' sequence. The twevefold version is the "standard version," in which ''vijnana'' refers to sensual consciousness.{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "''vinnana'': consciousness associated with eye, ear, nose tongue, body, and mind (''mano'')"{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=313}}}} According to Bucknell, the "standard version" of the twelve nidanas developed out of an ancestor version, which in turn was derived from two different versions, in which ''vijnana'' is differently explained.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999}}

In the socalled "branched version", which is not strictly linear, but connects a couple of branches, ''vijnana'' is derived from the coming together of the sense organs and the sense objects, a description which can also be found in other sutras. The three of them constitute ''phassa'' ("contact"). From there on, the list is linear. In the Sutta-nipata version, which is altogether linear, ''vijnana'' is derived from ''avijja'' ("ignorance") and ''[[Saṅkhāra]]'' ("activities" (RSB); also translated as "volitional formations").{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=335}} 

&lt;!-- *LOOPED VERSION* --&gt;

The ''Mahanidana-sutta'' describes a "looped version," which is also further linear, in which ''vijnana'' and ''nama-rupa'' condition each other. According to Bucknell, this "looped version" is derived from the "branched version."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=315, 333}} According to Bucknell, "some accounts of the looped version state explicitly that the chain of causation goes no further back than the loop.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=316}} The Mahanidana further explains ''vijnana'' as "consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at the moment of conception."{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=317}} Waldron notes that ''vijnana'' here has two aspects, namely "samsaric ''vijnana''" and "cognitive consciousness." "Samsaric ''vijnana''" is "consciousness per se, the basic sentience necessary for all animate life," which descends into the womb at the time of conception. Cognitive consciousness is related to the senses and the sense objects. It is "samsaric ''vijnana''" which forms, in Buddhist thought, the connection between two lifes.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20}} While these two aspects were largely undifferentiated in early Buddhist thought, these two aspects and their relation was explicated in later Buddhist thought, giving rise to the concept of ''[[alaya-vijñana]]''.{{sfn|Walfron|2004|p=20-21}}

While the "branched version" refers directly to the six sense objects, the "looped version" and the standard version  instead name it ''nama-rupa'', which eventually was misinterpreted as "name-and-form" in the traditional sense. This created "new causal series," which made it possible to interpret the beginning of the chain as referring to rebirth, just like the end of the chain. In line with this reinterpretation, ''vijnana'' "became the consciousness that descends into the mother's womb at conception, while ''nama-rupa'' became the mind-body complex that [...] experiences contact (''phassa'') and so on." {{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=339}}{{refn|group=note|Bucknell: "These observations by Watsuji, Yinshun, and Reat indicate that ''nama-rupa'', far from signifying "mind-and-body" or something similar, is a collective term for the six types of sense object."{{sfn|Bucknell|p=325}}}}

Bucknell further notes that the "branched version," in which ''nama-rupa'' refers to the six classes of sense-objects, corresponds with [[Buddhadasa]]s psychological interpretation of the twelve nidanas. The "looped version," in which ''vijanana'' corresponds with "rebirth consciousness," corresponds with defenders of the traditional interpretation, such as [[Nyanatiloka]].{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=327-328, note 46}} According to Bucknell, the linear list, with its distortions and changed meaning for ''nama-rupa'' and ''vinaya'', may have developed when the list came to be recited in reverse order.{{sfn|Bucknell|1999|p=332}}

Alex Wayman has argued that the idea of "dependent origination" may precede the birth of the Buddha, noting that the first four causal links starting with Avidya in the Twelve Nidānas are found in the cosmic development theory of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and other older Vedic texts.{{sfn|Wayman|1984|p=173 with note 16}}{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=256}}{{sfn|Wayman|1971}} Jeffrey Hopkins notes that terms synonymous to ''Pratītyasamutpāda'' are ''Apekṣhasamutpāda'' and ''Prāpyasamutpāda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Hopkins|title=Meditation on Emptiness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rp8qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2014|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-705-7|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana, the concept of causality and causal efficacy where "cause produces an effect because a property or ''svadha'' (energy) is inherent in something", appears extensively in the Indian thought in the Vedic literature of the 2nd millennium BCE, such as the 10th mandala of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Brahmana]]s layer of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1975p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

# ''sayam katam'' (''attakatam'', self causation): this theory posits that there is no external agent (God) necessary for a phenomenon, there is ''svadha'' (inner energy) in nature or beings that lead to creative evolution, the cause and the effect are in the essence of the evolute and inseparable (found in the Vedic and particularly [[Upanishad]]ic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''param katam'' (external causation): posits that something external (God, fate, past karma or purely natural determinism) causes effects (found in materialistic schools like [[Charvaka]], as well as fate-driven schools such as [[Ajivika]]); 
# ''sayam-param katam'' (internal and external causation): combination of the first two theories of causation (found in some [[Jainism]], theistic proto-Hindu schools); 
# ''asayam-aparam katam'' (neither internal nor external causation): this theory denies direct determinism (''ahetu'') and posits fortuitous origination, asserting everything is a manifestation of a combination of chance (found in some proto-Hindu{{clarify|date=January 2018}} schools).

|} 
A similar resemblance has been noted by Jurewicz, who argues that the first four ''nidanas'' resemble the ''Hymn of Creation'' of RigVeda X, 129, in which ''avijja'' (ignorance) leads to ''kamma'' (''desire''), which is the seed of ''vijnana'' ("consciousness").{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}}{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} This consciousness is a "singular consciousness," (Jurewicz) "non-dual consciousness," (Gombrich) "reflexive, cognizing itself" (Gombrich).{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} When the created world, ''name and form'', evolves, pure consciousness manifests itself in the world. It mistakenly identifies itself with ''name and form'', losing sight of its real identity.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|=135-136}} The Buddha mimicked this creation story, making clear how the entanglement with the world "drive a human being into deeper and deeper ignorance about himself."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} According to Jurewicz, the Buddha may have picked the term ''nama-rupa'', because "the division of consciousness into name and form has only the negative value of an act which hinders cognition."{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}} 

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist tradition soon lost sight of this connection with the Vedic worldview. It was aware that at this point there is the appearance of an individual person, which the Buddha referred to as the five skandhas,{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135}} denying a self (''atman'') separate from these skandhas.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=255}} The Buddhist tradition equated ''rupa'' with the first ''skandha'', and ''nama'' with the other four. Yet, as Gombrich notes, ''samkhara'', ''vijnana'', and ''vedana'' also appear as separate links in the twelvefold list, so this eqaution can't be correct for this ''nidana''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=135-136}} According to Jurewizc, all twelve nidanas show similarities with the Vedic cosmogeny. They may have been invoked for educated listeners, to make the point that suffering arises in dependence on psychological processes without an atman, thereby rejecting the Vedic outlook.{{sfn|Jurewicz|2000}}

According to Gombrich, following Frauwallner,{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy Vol. 1''}} the twelve-fold list is a combination of two previous lists, the second list beginning with ''tanha'', "thirst," the cause of suffering as described in the second Noble Truth".{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}} The first list consists of the first four ''nidanas'', which parody the Vedic-Brahmanic cosmogony, as described by Jurewicz.{{refn|group=note|Jurewicz (2000), ''Playing with fire: the pratityasamutpada from the perspective of Vedic thought''. Journal of the Pali Text Society, XXVI, 77-104.}} According to Gombrich, the two lists were combined, resulting in contradictions in it's negative version.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "The six senses, and thence, via 'contact' and 'feeling', to thirst." It is quite plausible, however, that someone failed to notice that once the first four links became part of the chain, its negative version meant that in order to abolish ignorance one first had to abolish consciousness!"{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=138}}}} Gombrich further notes that
{{quote|Jurewicz's interpretation also makes it unnecessary to accept the complicated, indeed contorted, interpretation favoured by Buddhaghosa, that the chain covers three lives of the individual.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=142}}}}

According to Schumann, the Nidanas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings, meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five [[Skandha|skhandhas]] shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nama-rupa en consciousness in the 9-fold are the beginning or start, while in the 12-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when nama-rupa en consciousness are present.
Schumann also proposes that the 12-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrate the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa and Vasubandhu maintain a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas aside the twelve nidanas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

Altogether the various lists combine as follows:

===Sequence of stages prior to birth===
According to Eisel Mazard, the twelve Nidanas are a description of "a sequence of stages prior to birth," as an "orthodox defense against any doctrine of a 'supernal self' or soul of any kind [...] excluding an un-mentioned life-force (jīva) that followers could presumed to be additional to the birth of the body, the arising of consciousness, and the other aspects mentioned in the 12-links formula."&lt;ref name=Mazard /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Mazard: "[T]he 12-links formula is unambiguously an ancient tract that was originally written on the subject of the conception and development of the embryo, as a sequence of stages prior to birth; in examining the primary source text, this is as blatant today as it was over two thousand years ago, despite some very interesting misinterpretations that have arisen in the centuries in-between [...] In the Mahānidāna [sutta]’s brief gloss on the term nāmarūpa [...] we have a very explicit reminder that the subject-matter being described in this sequence of stages is the development of the embryo [...] it is indisputably clear that we are reading about something that may (or may not) enter into (okkamissatha) the mother’s womb (mātukucchismiŋ) [...] [T]he passage is wildly incongruent with attempts of many other interpreters to render the whole doctrine in more abstract terms (variously psychological or metaphysical).&lt;ref name=Mazard&gt;Eisel Mazard, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/01/27/unpopular-facts-about-one-of-buddhist-philosophys-most-popular-doctrines/ ''Unpopular facts about one of buddhist philosophys most popular doctrines'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Mazard, "many later sources have digressed from the basic theme and subject-matter of the original text, knowingly or unknowingly."&lt;ref name=Mazard/&gt;

==Karma==
The notion of karma is integrated into the list of twelve nidanas, and has been extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Billington |title=Understanding Eastern Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=57–58, 73–74 note 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97342-3|pages=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nagarjuna, the second causal link (''[[sankhara]]'', motivations) and the tenth causal link (''[[bhava]]'', gestation) are two karmas through which sentient beings trigger seven sufferings identified in the Twelve Nidanas, and from this arises the revolving rebirth cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC|year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be liberated from samsara and dukkha, asserts Buddhism, the 'dependent origination' doctrine implies that the karmic activity must cease.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt; One aspect of this 'causal link breaking' is to destroy the "deeply seated propensities, festering predilections" ([[asavas]]) which are karmic causal flow because these lead to rebirth.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus2014p124"/&gt;

==Sunyata (emptiness)==

===Madhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
In the [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is dependently originated. [[Nāgārjuna]] equates [[Sunyata|emptiness]] with dependent origination in [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24.18-19;{{sfn|Mabja Tsondru|2011|p=67-71, 447-477}} 
{{quote|Whatever arises dependently&lt;br/&gt;
Is explained as empty.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus dependent attribution&lt;br/&gt;
Is the middle way.

Since there is nothing whatever&lt;br/&gt;
That is not dependently existent,&lt;br/&gt;
For that reason there is nothing&lt;br/&gt;
Whatsoever that is not empty.{{sfn|Geshe Sonam Rinchen|2006|p=21}}}}

In his analysis, [[svabhāva]] is somewhat redefined from the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika]] interpretation to mean: ''inherent existence'' or ''self-characterization.'' Nagarjuna notably rejected the idea of ''dharmas'' containing [[svabhāva]], meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If a ''dharma'' was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See [[Prasaṅgika#N.C4.81g.C4.81rjuna.27s Merely Designated Causality|Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality]]). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty. 

[[Madhyamaka]] is interpreted in different ways by different traditions. In the Tibetan [[Gelug]] school, all dharmas are said to lack any {{'}}''inherent''{{'}} existence, according to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]] in his Ocean of Reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaari.info/notes/03-06-06Tam2.pdf|title=Mula by Jay Garfield|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan Buddhism===
In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept of dependent origination is considered to be complementary to the concept of emptiness. Specifically, this tradition emphasizes the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness—also known as the relative and absolute aspects of reality:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* Appearance (relative truth) refers to the concept that all appearances are dependently originated;
* Emptiness (absolute or ultimate truth) refers to the concept that the "nature" of all phenomena is emptiness—lacking inherent existence.

In [[Mipham Rinpoche]]'s ''Beacon of Certainty'', this relationship is explained using the metaphor of the reflection of the moon in water.{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}  According to this metaphor:{{sfn|Anyen Rinpoche|2012|pp=58-59}}
* The ''nature'' of all phenomena is like the reflection of the moon in water—completely lacking inherent existence. However,
* The ''appearance'' of the moon in the water is an expression of dependent origination—the appearance is completely dependent upon causes and conditions.

One of the founders of Tibetan Buddhism, [[Padmasambhava]], emphasized his respect for this relationship as follows:
{{quote|Though my View is as spacious as the sky,&lt;br&gt; 
My actions and respect for cause and effect are as fine as grains of flour.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|p=169}}}}

==Interdependence==

===Hua Yen school===
The [[Huayan school]] taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [[Indra's net]]. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing. This philosophy is based in the tradition of the great Madhyamaka scholar [[Nagarjuna]] and, more specifically, on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. Regarded by [[D.T. Suzuki]] as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.

===Thich Nhat Hanh===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] states, "''Pratitya samutpada'' is sometimes called the teaching of cause and effect, but that can be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect. According to the teaching of Interdependent Co-Arising, cause and effect co-arise (''samutpada'') and everything is a result of multiple causes and conditions... In the sutras, this image is given: "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for the idea that there is no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=221-222}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] states all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent but interdependent with all other things. A tree, for example, cannot be isolated from anything else. It has no independent existence, states Rinpoche.{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|2009|loc=Kindle Locations 849-863}}

==Comparison with western philosophy==
[[Jay L. Garfield]] states that [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]] uses the causal relation to understand the nature of reality, and of our relation to it. This attempt is similar to the use of causation by Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer as they present their arguments. Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}

The concept of ''pratītyasamutpāda'' has also been compared to Western [[metaphysics]], the study of reality. Schilbrack states that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all.{{sfn|Schilbrack|2002}} Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.{{refn|group=quote|Hoffman states: "Suffice it to emphasize that the doctrine of dependent origination is not a metaphysical doctrine, in the sense that it does not affirm or deny some super-sensible entities or realities; rather, it is a proposition arrived at through an examination and analysis of the world of phenomena ..."{{sfn|Hoffman|1996|p=177}} }}

'''Prosopon''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|s|ə|p|ɒ|n}},{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-24|Prosopon}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Prosopon}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|p|r|ə|ˈ|s|oʊ|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosopon "prosopon"]. ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-grc|πρόσωπον}}; plural: {{lang-grc|πρόσωπα}} ''prosopa'') is a technical term encountered in Christian [[theology]]. It is most often translated as "person", and as such is sometimes confused with [[hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]], which is sometimes also translated as "person." Prosopon originally meant "face" or "mask" and derives from Greek theatre, in which actors on a stage wore masks to reveal their character and emotional state to the audience. Both prosopon and hypostasis played central roles in the development of theology about the [[Trinity]] and about [[Jesus Christ]] ([[Christology]]) in the debates of the fourth through seventh centuries.

==Overview==
The term "prosopon" is used for "the self-manifestation of an individual" that can be extended by means of other things. For example, a painter includes his brush within his own prosopon. (Grillmeier, 126)

[[St. Paul]] uses the term when speaking of his direct apprehension in the heart of the Face (prosopon) of Christ (II Cor 4:6).

Prosopon is the form in which [[hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]] appears. Every hypostasis has its own proper prosopon: face or countenance. It gives expression to the reality of the hypostasis with its powers and characteristics. (Grillmeier, 431)

Two distinct [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] [[Christology|Christologists]], [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], followed by his disciple [[Nestorius]], supported the prosopic union of the two natures ([[physis]]) of [[Jesus Christ]] rather than the accepted [[hypostatic union]].

Theodore of Mopsuestia maintained a vision of Christ that saw a prosopic union of the [[divinity|divine]] and human. This was a union where Jesus was only a man indissolubly united to [[God]] through the permanent indwelling of the [[Logos]]. (Grillmeir, 428-39) He believed the incarnation of Jesus represents an indwelling of the spirit of God that is separate from the indwelling experienced by the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s or [[New Testament]] [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]]. Jesus was viewed as a human being who shared the divine sonship of the Logos; the Logos united himself to Jesus from the moment of Jesus' conception. After the [[resurrection]], the human Jesus and the Logos reveal that they have always been one prosopon. (Norris, 25)

Theodore addresses the prosopic union in applying prosopon to Christ. He accounts for two expressions of Christ – human and divine. Yet, he does not mean Christ achieved a unity of the two expressions through the formation of a third prosopon, but that one prosopon is produced by the Logos giving his own countenance to the assured man. (Grillmeier, 432) He interprets the unity of God and man in Christ along the lines of the body-[[soul]] unity. Prosopon plays a special part in his interpretation of Christ. He rejected the Hypostasis concept – believing it to be a contradiction of Christ’s true nature. He espoused that, in Christ, both body and soul had to be assumed. Christ assumed a soul and by the grace of God brought it to [[Immutability (theology)|immutability]] and to a full dominion over the sufferings of the body. (Grillmeier, 424-27)

Nestorius furthered Theodore’s belief in the prosopic union as thus: "prosopon is the appearance of the [[ousia]]: the prosopon makes known the ousia." The two prosopa are united "In Christ… the one prosopon does not belong to a nature or hypostasis which arose through the natural union of [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and manhood, but to the unity of the two unconfused natures." (Grillmeier, 510)

Nestorian notion of "two persons" (prosopic duality) caused heated debates among Christian theologians in the first half of the 5th century, resulting in official condemnation of such views. The [[Third Ecumenical Council]] (431) affirmed the teaching of "One Person" of Jesus Christ, condemning all other teachings. The [[Fourth Ecumenical Council]] (451) reaffirmed the notion of One Person of Jesus Christ, formulating the famous [[Chalcedonian Definition]] with its "[[monoprosopic]]" (having one person) clauses, and in the same time explicitly denying the validity of "[[dyoprosopic]]" (having two persons) views.

He was the grandson of {{IAST|Śulapāṇi}} (c. 14th century CE), a noted writer on {{IAST|[[Smṛti]]}} from his mother's side. He was a pupil of {{IAST|Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma}}. He brought the new school of [[Nyaya]], ''{{IAST|Navya Nyāya}}'', representing the final development of Indian [[formal logic]], to its zenith of analytic power.

Raghunatha's analysis of relations revealed the true nature of number, inseparable from the abstraction of natural phenomena, and his studies of [[metaphysics]] dealt with the [[negation]] or [[nonexistence]] of a complex [[reality]]. His most famous work in logic was the [[Tattvachintamanididhiti|{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti}}]], a commentary on the ''[[Tattvacintāmaṇi]]'' of [[Gangesha|{{IAST |Gangeśa Upādhyāya}}]], founder of the ''{{IAST |Navya Nyāya}}'' school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">A '''semantic domain''' is a specific place that shares a set of meanings, or a language that holds its meaning, within the given context of the place. Harriet Ottenheimer (2006), a writer in [[Linguistic Anthropology]], defines a [[Semantics|semantic]] domain as a “specific area of cultural emphasis”.&lt;ref name="Ottenheimer 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ottenheimer|first1=Harriet J.|title=The Anthropology of Language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|date=2006|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont (Canada)|isbn=9780534594367|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[lexicography]] a semantic domain or [[semantic field]] is defined as "an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it ... For instance English has a domain ‘Rain’, which includes words such as rain, drizzle, downpour, raindrop, puddle.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moe|first1=Ronald|title=What is a semantic domain?|url=http://www.semdom.org/description|website=Semantic Domains|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic domains are the foundational concept for initial stages of vernacular dictionary building projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moe|first1=Ronald|title=Compiling Dictionaries Using Semantic Domains|journal=Lexikos|date=2003|volume=13|pages=215–223|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/lex/article/viewFile/51389/40043}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uses techniques such as the [http://www-01.sil.org/computing/ddp/DDP_intro.htm Dictionary Development Process] (DDP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moe|first1=Ronald|title=Dictionary Development Program|journal=SIL Forum for Language Fieldwork|date=2007|url=http://www-01.sil.org/silepubs/Pubs/49073/SILForum2007-003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://rapidwords.net RapidWords], or software such as [http://wesay.palaso.org/ WeSay]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albright|first1=Eric|last2=Hatton|first2=John|title=WeSay: A Tool for Engaging Native Speakers in Dictionary Building|journal=Documenting and Revitalizing Austronesian Languages|date=2007|pages=189–201|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/1368/10albrightsmall.pdf;jsessionid=E0D790207EA7697C244054E573212B23?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [http://fieldworks.sil.org/flex/ FLEx]. These techniques rely on extensive lists of semantic domains that are relevant to vernacular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Semantic Domains|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/85631464/SIL-2011-List-of-Semantic-Domains|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semantic Domains for vocabulary of Australian languages|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/linguistics/nash/aust/domains.html|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[social sciences]], the concept of semantic domains stemmed from the ideas of [[cognitive anthropology]]. The quest was originally to see how the words that groups of humans use to describe certain things are relative to the underlying perceptions and meanings that those groups share (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;18).  [[Ethnosemantics]] became the field that concentrated around the study of these semantic domains, and more specifically the study of how categorization and context of words and groups of words reflected the ways that different cultures categorize words into speech and assign meaning to their language.&lt;ref name="Ottenheimer 2006"/&gt;

==Examples==

Many sports have specific semantic domains that entail terminology that is specific to that particular sport. In order to understand the meanings of these terms one would need to understand the context and domain of that sport. For instance, in [[basketball]] there are many words that are specific to the sport. [[Free throw]], [[basketball court|court]], [[half court]], [[three point shot|three pointer]], and [[point guard]] are all terms that are specific to the sport of basketball. These words make very little sense when used outside of the semantic domain of basketball.

Another example of a semantic domain would be a [[café|coffee shop]]. The words [[latte]], [[cappucino]], or [[Starbucks]] probably would not be understood unless one could associate this language with the semantic domain of a coffee shop.

''Simtud Durar'', ''Simthud Durar'' or ''Simthud Duror'' ({{lang-ar| سمط الدّرر}}; {{IPA-ar| simðˤudduror}}) is the book of poem praising [[Muhammad]] The [[Prophet]] of [[Islam]] written by [[Habib]] Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi.  The poem is usually recited during a [[Mawlid]] event.  The poem is popular among [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] descents, especially of [[Sayyid]]s in [[Hadhramaut]], in the island of [[Java]] and in the towns of [[Lamu]], [[Mambrui]] and [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name="haddad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alhaddad.org/blog/?p=2|title=Simtud Durar|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Author==
Habib Ali bin Muhammad bin Husin al-Habshi was born on Friday November 17, 1843 CE (24 Shawwal 1259 [[Hijri year|AH]]) in Qasam, a town in Hadhramaut. He grew up under the care and supervision of both his father, Muhammad bin Husin bin Abdullah Al Habshi and mother, Syarifah Alawiyyah bint Al-Hussain bin Ahmad Al-Hadi Al-Jufri, who at the time was known as a piety woman.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bersholawatlah.blogspot.com/2012/10/biopengarang-maulid-simtud-durar.html|title=Biografi Pengarang Maulid Simtud Durar|language=id|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a very young age, Ali had studied and finished reciting [[al-Quran]] and successfully mastered the outward and inward knowledge before reaching the age that is usually required for that. Since then, he was consented to by the teachers and instructors to give lectures and studies in public, and in short time he became the center of attention and admiration and a place of honor in the hearts of every person in his town. He was handed the responsibility to teach at educational institutions and at large meetings.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Furthermore, he also collected, directed and educated his students to acquire knowledge, as well as to inspire them in the pursuit of high ideals and noble. To accommodate them, he built a mosque called "al-Riyadh" in [[Seiyun]], as well as boarding schools which were equipped with various facilities to meet their needs,  so that they can study in peace and quiet, free from all disturbing thoughts, especially those concerned with the needs of everyday life.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Ali  died in Seiyun,on Sunday March 7, 1915 CE (20 Rabi al-Akhir 1333 AH) and survived by sons who have obtained the best education of his own, who continued his ideals in preaching and disseminating Islam. Among his sons, his youngest son Habib Alwi bin Ali Al-Habshi was well known in Indonesia as he founded "al-Riyadh" mosque for his father namesake in [[Pasar Kliwon]], [[Surakarta]] as well as to hold the ''Simtud Durar'' mawlid for the first time in the country.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==The Poem==
The book ''Simtud-Durar'' (literally means ''A Necklace of Pearls'') is written by al-[[Habib]] ‘Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi when he was at the age of 68 years. He started to write the poem on March 19, 1909 CE (26 Safar 1327 AH). Habib 'Ali dictated the initial paragraph of the Simtud Durar by saying [[basmalah]].&lt;ref name="kisah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mazzulfa.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/kisah-turunnya-simtud-durar/|title=Kisah Turunnya Simtud Durar|language=id|accessdate=September 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528085958/http://mazzulfa.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/kisah-turunnya-simtud-durar/|archivedate=May 28, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of Rabi 'al-Awwal 1327 AH (around April 1909 CE), he ordered his students to read the poem. He opened it with great Fatiha. Then on Wednesday night, 9 Rabi al Awwal, he began reading the masterpiece at his home after it was perfected. He said, "The poem is very touching, after having just finished".&lt;ref name="kisah"/&gt;

The poem is similar to [[Qasida]], but mostly in the form of two-column [[stanza]]. It consists of 15 chapters which contain the history in poetic prose and praises of the Prophet. In chapter one it starts with [[Salawat]] poem.

The poem is recited during a [[Mawlid]] or other similar events. Usually the recitation is started by one person and after finishing one chapter the book is passed along to another person next to him to continue reciting it. Sometimes people recite it while sway to and from as if in spiritual ecstasy.&lt;ref name="haddad"/&gt;  It is also common during recitation of certain chapters the chanting accompanied with [[Rebana]], especially when reciting chapter eight.  The congregation raises during ''Mahallu al-Qiyaam'' (''Qiyaam'' literally means ''standing'' in Arabic) when the eighth chapter is chanted.

This central thesis may be argued from a theistic perspective, but is also argued to defend positions of [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skeptical-theism/|title=Skeptical theism|last=|first=|date=25 January 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=13 October 2016|quote=Alston is not quite as explicit, but seems to agree.

One argument is based on analogy, likening our understanding of God's motives to those of a child grasping a parent's reasons for seeking painful medical treatment, for example.  Other approaches are the limitations on the human ability to understand the moral realm, and appeals to epistemic factors such as sensitivity or contextual requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-K3583-1|access-date=13 October 2016|quote=Contemporary philosophers have further refined sceptical theism into a family of related views, each with a different defence. These defences include appeals to analogies (for example the parent/child relationship), appeals to the limitations of our grasp of the moral realm and appeals to epistemic requirements (for example sensitivity requirements or contextual requirements).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is not a broad skepticism toward human knowledge of God, but is instead putatively presented as a response to philosophical propositions, such as those focused on drawing "all things considered" inductive conclusions about God's motives from perceived circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin P.|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=|quote=It is important to get clear on the scope of the skepticism endorsed by skeptical theists.  First, it is not a global skepticism—skeptical theists are not committed to the view that we cannot know anything at all.  Instead, the skepticism is (putatively) limited to a narrow range of propositions, namely those having to do with God’s reasons for action.  For example, a skeptical theist could admit that humans have ceteris paribus knowledge of God’s reasons for actions.  An example of such knowledge might be the following: other-things-being-equal, God will eliminate suffering when he is able to do so.  However, knowing this latter claim is consistent with denying that we know the following: God will eliminate this particular instance of suffering.  Holding the combination of these two views is possible for the following reason: while we might know that other-things-being-equal, God will eliminate suffering when he is able to do so, we might not know whether or not other things are equal in any particular instance of suffering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, skeptical theism is not a position used to defend all forms of theism, though it is most often presented in the defense of orthodox Christian theism. Moreover, skeptical theism is not supported by all theists and some who support its skeptical positions are not theists.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justine|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2016|quote=Not all theists are skeptical theists, and not all of the philosophers who endorse the skeptical component of skeptical theism are theists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
'''Argument from evil''' is an atheological argument asserting that some evils in the world are pointless or gratuitous evils representing evidence against the existence of the orthodox Christian God.

'''Atheological''' is the atheistic equivalent to the word theological.

'''God''' (capitalized), for the purposes of skeptical theism is the [[Omniscience|omniscient]] (all knowing), [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (all good)  and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] (all powerful) God of orthodox Christianity.

'''Gratuitous evil''' is evil permitted to occur in the word, but for which God is argued to have no morally sufficient reason for permitting. It is also sometimes called 'pointless evil' or 'inscrutable evil'.

'''Noseeum Inference''' is a philosophical term describing the position asserting that an atheologian's inability to think of a justification for God to permit an evil means it is likely that there is no possible reason.

'''[[Theodicy|Theodicies]]''', are theological positions seeking to fully reconcile apparent [[evil]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the world with the existence of the Christian God.

== Draper's Skeptical Theism ==
In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is the position that we should be skeptical of our ability to assess God's motivations or lack of motivation from our perceptions of the circumstances we observe in the world. As originally proposed by the agnostic Purdue Philosopher [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] the position argues that human cognitive faculties should be insufficient to permit drawing inductive inferences concerning God's reasons or lack of reasons for permitting perceived evils.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-K3583-1|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=According to sceptical theists, the human mind is limited in such a way that it would not at all be surprising that God would have reasons that are beyond our understanding for allowing the evils of our world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position is often argued, seeking to undercut a key premise in the [[argument from evil|evidential argument from evi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skeptical-theism/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=|first=|date=25 January 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=11 October 2016|quote=Evidential arguments from evil attempt to show that, once we put aside any evidence there might be in support of the existence of God, it becomes unlikely, if not highly unlikely, that the world was created and is governed by an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The evidential argument from evil ==
The evidential argument from evil asserts that the amount, types, or distribution of evils, provide an evidential basis for concluding that God's existence is improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H2|title=Evidential Problem of Evil|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument has a number of formulation, but can be stated in the [[Modus ponens]] logical form:

# If an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God exists, there should be no gratuitous evil.
# There exists instances of gratuitous evil.
# Therefore, an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God does not exist.
In this logical form the conclusion (3) is true, if both the major premise (1) and minor premise (2) are true. Philosophers have challenged both premises, but skeptical theism focus is on the minor premise (2).

In 1979, the Philosopher William Rowe provided a defense of the minor premise (2). He argued that no state of affairs we know of is such that an omnipotent, omniscient being’s obtaining it would morally justify that being’s permitting some instances of horrific suffering. Therefore, Rowe concludes, it is likely that no state of affairs exists that would morally justify that being in permitting such suffering.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism, American|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly .|volume=16|pages=335–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Rowe argues that his inability to think of a good reason why God would allow a particular evil justifies the conclusion that there is no such reason, and the conclusion that God does not exist.

=== The Noseeum Defense ===
The Philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the Philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some evidential arguments from evil ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=The Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109033308/http://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1988|title=Evil and Theodicy|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=16|pages=119–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|title=Ruminations about Evil|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=5|pages=69–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically dubious. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The skeptical theism response ==
Skeptical theism provides a defense against the evidential argument from evil, but does not take a position on God’s ''actual'' reason for allowing a particular instance of evil.  The defense seeks to show that there are good reasons to believe that God ''could'' have justified reasons for allowing a particular evil that we cannot discern. Consequently, we are in no position to endorse the minor premise (2) of the argument from evil because we cannot be more than agnostic about the accuracy of the premise. This conclusion would be an undercutting defeater for the premise because there would be no justification for the conclusion that evils in our world are gratuitous.  To justify this conclusion, the skeptical theist argues that the limits of human cognitive faculties are grounds for skepticism about our ability to draw conclusions about God's motives or lack of motives; it is therefor reasonable to doubt the second premise.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/ Skeptical Theism], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bergmann and Rae thus concluded that Rowe's inference is unsound.&lt;ref name="BergmannRea"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Michael|year=2005|title=In Defense of Skeptical Theism: A Reply to Almeida and Oppy|url=http://nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51|doi=10.1080/00048400500111147|author2=[[Michael Rea]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sotirios Trambas''' ({{lang-el|Σωτήριος Τράμπας}}; born 17 July 1929) served as [[Korean Orthodox Church|Orthodox Metropolis of Korea]] from 2004 to 2009.

==Biography==
Trambas was born in Arta in 1929. He graduated from the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Theological School of the University of Athens]] in 1951.

He served his military service at the Military Department of Religion and preached at the military units of Northern Greece.

In 1956, he was tonsured monk of the Holy Monastery of Leimonos in [[Mytilene]], [[Greece]]. He was ordained Deacon and served as a preacher at the Metropolis of Methymnis. In 1961 he was ordained Priest and received the office of [[Archimandrite]]. In 1963, he returned to the [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]] and served as chaplain in the Evros area. 

From 1969 to 1974, he held the office of Chancellor (senior Archimandrite) of the [[Archbishopric of Athens|Archdiocese of Athens]]. While at this position he established and organized the Center for Family Support and other public welfare institutions of the Archdiocese of Athens.

In November 1975, he volunteered to serve the Orthodox Church in Korea, and with permission from the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Holy Synod of Constantinople]], became Dean of the St. Nicholas Church in [[Seoul]]. In 1986, he was appointed to be the chairman of the Orthodox Eastern Mission. As chairman, he translated Greek church texts into Korean and founded the monastery, a seminary and several parishes in Korea and in other places in Asia.

Then in 1991, he was elected an [[Auxiliary bishop|auxiliary bishop]] of the Metropolis of New Zealand and Exarch of Korea and was given the title of Bishop of Zelon, and after more than a decade in 2004 he was elected first Metropolitan of newly established Orthodox Metropolis of Korea by the holy synod of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kwak|first1=Byung-chan|title=Orthodox Church in Korea raised to the status of a Metropolis|url=http://legacy.www.hani.co.kr/section-009100020/2004/06/009100020200406161824062.html|publisher=[[The Hankyoreh]]|website=Internet Hankyoreh|accessdate=June 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received an honorary citizenship of the Seoul in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=300 honorary citizens of Seoul|url=http://m.chosun.com/svc/article.test.html?sname=news&amp;contid=2001041170231|publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he resigned voluntarily as Metropolitan of Korea for health reasons. The Holy Synod of Constantinople accepted his resignation and elected him Metropolitan of [[Pisidia]] (Turkey).

[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|Most modern English speakers encounter "thou" predominantly in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], in the works of other renaissance, medieval and early modern writers, and in the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;q=thee#v=snippet&amp;q=thee&amp;f=false "thou, thee, thine, thy (prons.)"], Kenneth G.

M. |url=http://www.bardweb.net/content/thou.html |title=Thou Pesky 'Thou' |website=Shakespeare Resource Centre |date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word '''''thou''''' ({{IPAc-en|ð|aʊ}}) is a [[grammatical person|second person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]] in [[English language|English]]. It is now largely [[archaism|archaic]], having been replaced in most contexts by ''[[you]]''. It is used in parts of Northern [[England]] and in [[Modern Scots|Scots]] ({{IPA|/ðu/}}), and also in rural parts of [[Newfoundland]] albeit as a recessive feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Sandra |date=2010 |title=Newfoundland and Labrador English |location=Scotland |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=89|isbn=9780748631414  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is '''''thee''''' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), the [[genitive|possessive]] is '''''thy''''' (adjective) or '''''thine''''' (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] is '''''thyself'''''. When ''thou'' is the [[grammatical subject]] of a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]], the verb form typically ends in ''-(e)st'' (e.g., "thou goest"; "thou do(e)st"), but in some cases just ''-t'' (e.g., "thou art"; "thou shalt"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in -s, hence the [[Quaker]] habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with "thee" as the subject (paralleling the usage of "you").

Originally, ''thou'' was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'', derived from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|ancient Indo-European]] root. In [[Middle English]], ''thou'' was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small "u" over the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]]: þͧ. Starting in the 1300s, ''thou'' was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, ''you'', the oblique/objective form of ''ye'', was used for formal circumstances (see [[T–V distinction]])&lt;ref name="MED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=yǒu (pron.) |encyclopedia= Middle English Dictionary |date= |year=2014 |publisher=the Regents of the University of Michigan |location= |id= |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED54032|access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 17th century, ''thou'' fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.

Early English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to [[God]] in [[French language|French]] (in [[Protestantism in France|Protestantism]] both in past and present, in [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholicism]] since the post-[[Vatican II]] reforms), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Ukrainian language| Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]] (all of which maintain the use of an "informal" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] between singular and plural second person pronouns and verb forms, so they used ''thou'', ''thee'', ''thy'', and ''thine'' for singular, and ''ye'', ''you'', ''your'', and ''yours'' for plural.

In standard [[modern English]], ''thou'' continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language and in certain fixed phrases such as "[[wikt:fare thee well|fare thee well]]". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of ''thou'' and ''ye'' through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as ''[[yinz]]'', ''yous''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM.|last = Kortmann|first = Bernd|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 2004|isbn = 978-3110175325|location = |page = 1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[y'all]]'' or the colloquial ''you guys''. ''Ye'' remains common in some parts of Ireland but these examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.

==Grammar==
Because ''thou'' has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Declension===
The English [[personal pronoun]]s have standardized [[declension]] according to the following table:{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
{{Early Modern English personal pronouns (table)}}

===Conjugation===
Verb forms used after ''thou'' generally end in ''-est'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|-|ɪ|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|-|ə|s|t}}) or ''-st'' in the [[indicative mood]] in both the [[present tense|present]] and the [[past tense|past]] [[grammatical tense|tenses]].  These forms are used for both [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s.

Typical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow.  The ''e'' in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized.  In verse, the choice about whether to use the ''e'' often depended upon considerations of [[meter (poetry)|meter]].

*to know: ''thou knowest'', thou knewest''
*to drive: ''thou drivest'', thou drovest''
*to make: ''thou makest'', thou madest''
*to love: ''thou lovest'', thou lovedst''

Modal verbs also have ''-(e)st'' added to their forms:
*can: ''thou canst''
*could: ''thou couldst''
*may: ''thou mayest''
*might: ''thou mightst''
*should: ''thou shouldst''
*would: ''thou wouldst''
*ought to: ''thou oughtest to''

A few verbs have irregular ''thou'' forms:
*to be: ''thou art'' (or ''thou beest''), ''thou wast'' {{IPAc-en|w|ɒ|s|t}} (or ''thou wert''; originally ''thou were'')
*to have: ''thou hast'', ''thou hadst''
*to do: ''thou dost'' {{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|s|t}} (or ''thou doest'' in non-[[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] use) and ''thou didst''
*shall: ''thou shalt''
*will: ''thou wilt''
*must: ''thou must'' (not inflected)

In Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was ''-es''. This came down unchanged from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: [[Russian language|Russian]] знаешь, ''znayesh'', thou knowest; [[Latin]] ''amas'', thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, ''znayet'', he knoweth, Latin ''amat'' he loveth.) The anomalous development from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related [[German language|German]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the [[consonant]] of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fennell |first=Barbara A.|title=A history of English: a sociolinguistic approach. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the equivalent of "thou", ''du'', also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of "you", ''gij'' (later ''jij'' or ''u''), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by ''jullie'' (''cf.'' English ''you people, you guys'').

In the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Grammatical mood#Imperative|imperative moods]], the ending in ''-(e)st'' is dropped (although it is generally retained in ''thou wert'', the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb "to be"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after "if" and the poetic "and".

If thou be Johan, I tell it the&lt;br /&gt;Ryght with a good aduyce&lt;br /&gt;Thou may be glad Johan to be&lt;br /&gt;It is a name of pryce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:O WERT thou in the cauld blast, ... I'd shelter thee ...&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Burns]], ''O Wert Thou in the Cauld Blast''(song), lines 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern regional English dialects that use ''thou'' or some variant, such as in [[Yorkshire dialect#Vocabulary and grammar|Yorkshire]], it often takes the third person form of the verb ''-s''. This comes from a merging of [[Early Modern English]] second person singular ending ''-st'' and third person singular ending ''-s'' into ''-s'' (the latter a southern [[isogloss|variation]] of ''[[Thorn (letter)|-þ]]'' (''-th'')).

The present [[indicative]] form ''art'' ("''þu eart''") goes back to [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] Old English (see [[OED]] ''s.v. be'' IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (''e.g.'' in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from [[Danelaw|the North]], ''cf.'' [[History of the Icelandic language#The Scandinavian period (550–1050)|Icelandic]] ''þú ert''. For its ultimate origin, see OED ''be'', etymology section i.ε/ζ. The preterite indicative of ''be'' is generally ''thou wast''.

==Etymology==
''Thou'' originates from [[Old English language|Old English]] {{lang|ang|þū}}, and ultimately via [[Grimm's law]] from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''tu'', with the expected [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[vowel]] lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an [[open syllable]]. ''Thou'' is therefore [[cognate]] with [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|þú}}, [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavian languages|Continental Scandinavian]]&lt;!-- = Danish, Swedish, Norwegian--&gt; {{lang|da|du}}, [[Latin]] and all major [[Romance languages]]&lt;!-- = Aragonese, Aromanian, Asturian, Castilian, Catalan, French, Italian, Leonese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Portuguese, Romanian, Sicilian, Spanish BUT NOT Galician, Lombard, Piedmontese, Rhaeto-Romansh, Sardinian, Venetian http://www.nativlang.com/romance-languages/romance-tables.php?tableName=pronounsPersonal--&gt;, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|ro|tu}} or {{lang|es|tú}}, [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|σύ}} ({{transl|el|sy}}), [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ты / ''ty''  or ти / ''ti'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|դու}} ({{transl|hy|dow}}/{{transl|hy|du}}), [[Hindi]] तू ({{transl|hi|tū}}), [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: তুই (''tui''), [[Persian language|Persian]] {{rtl-lang|fa|تُو}} ({{transl|fa|to}}) and [[Sanskrit]] त्वम् ({{lang|sa-Latn|tvam}}). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.&lt;ref&gt;Entries for ''thou'' and *''tu'', in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
The second person pronouns in [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are also similar.

==History==
===Old and Middle English===
[[File:Adam and Eve, thou abbrev.jpg|thumb|right|''þ&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;'', abbreviation for ''thou'', from ''Adam and Eve'', from a ca. 1415 manuscript, England]]
In [[Old English]], ''thou'' was governed by a simple rule: ''thou'' addressed one person, and ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' more than one. Beginning in the 1300's ''thou'' was gradually replaced by the plural ''ye'' as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, ''thou'' remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.&lt;ref name="MED"/&gt;

The practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the [[T–V distinction]] and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing [[monarch|kings]] and other [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] in the [[plural]]. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, ''tu'' was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form ''vous'' was reserved and formal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===General decline in Early Modern English===
Fairly suddenly in the 17th century, ''thou'' began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] farther from London,&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of ''thou'' in the 17th century include the increasing identification of ''you'' with "polite society" and the uncertainty of using ''thou'' for inferiors versus ''you'' for superiors (with ''you'' being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Nordquist, Richard (2016). "[https://www.thoughtco.com/notes-on-second-person-pronouns-1692677 Notes on Second-Person Pronouns: Whatever Happened to 'Thou' and 'Thee'?]" ''ThoughtCo''. About, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''A Grammar of the English Tongue'', wrote: "in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular", implying that ''thou'' was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while ''you'' could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] (specifically, [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire), where the usage of ''thou'' persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of [[Southern English English|southern British English]], ''thou'' had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''thou'' in ''[[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.

One notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns ''thou'', ''thy'', and ''thee'' is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of [[Early Modern English]] texts, such as many character interactions in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use ''thou'' (rather than ''you'') when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Carl D. (ed.) (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8buSTBjFyUC&amp;q=%22thou...was...the+pronoun%22 Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary]''. Associated University Presses. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Use as a verb===
Many European languages contain verbs meaning "to address with the informal pronoun", such as German ''duzen'', the Norwegian noun ''dus'' refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French ''tutoyer'', Spanish ''tutear'', Swedish ''dua'', Dutch ''jijen en jouen'', Russian ''тыкать (tykat')'', Polish ''tykać'', Romanian ''tutui'', Hungarian ''tegezni'' etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1603, when Sir [[Edward Coke]], prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to [[insult]] Raleigh by saying,

:''I thou thee, thou traitor!''&lt;ref&gt;Reported, among many other places, in [[H. L. Mencken]], ''[[The American Language]]'' (1921), ch. 9, ss. 4., [http://www.bartleby.com/185/41.html "The pronoun"].&lt;/ref&gt;
::In modern English: ''I "thou" you, you traitor!''

here using ''thou'' as a verb meaning ''to call (someone) "thou" or "thee"''. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in [[Yorkshire dialect]] for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:

:''Don't thee tha them as thas thee!'' 
::In modern English: ''Don't "thee" (you) those who "thee" you!''
::In other words:  ''Don't use the familiar form "thee" towards those who refer to you as "thee".'' ("tha" being the local dialectal variant of "thou")

And similar in [[Lancashire dialect]]:

:''Don't thee me, thee; I's you to thee!''
::In standard English: ''Don't "thee" me, you! I'm "you" to you!''

===Religious uses===
As [[William Tyndale]] [[Tyndale Bible|translated the Bible]] into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] originals. He used ''thou'' for the singular and ''ye'' for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the [[addressee]]. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier [[Wycliffe's Bible]] and the later [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. But as the use of ''thou'' in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jespersen|first1=Otto|authorlink1=Otto Jespersen|title=Progress in Language|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026448203#page/n279/mode/2up|year=1894|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.&lt;ref&gt;David Daniell, ''William Tyndale: A Biography''. (Yale, 1995) {{ISBN|0-300-06880-8}}. See also David Daniell, ''The Bible in English: Its History and Influence''. (Yale, 2003) {{ISBN|0-300-09930-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1662 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which is still the authorized form of worship in the [[Church of England]], also uses the word ''thou'' to refer to the singular second person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/bcp/ ''The Book of Common Prayer'']. The Church of England. Retrieved on 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] formerly used ''thee'' as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying ''thee'' for both nominative and accusative cases.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.bartelby.net/248/456.html ''The Quaker Widow''] by [[Bayard Taylor]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by [[George Fox]], who called it "plain speaking", as an attempt to preserve the [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the [[north Midlands]] area. The preservation of ''thee'' in Quaker speech may relate to this history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David Hackett |last=Fischer|authorlink =David Hackett Fischer | title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]] |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-19-506905-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of "plain speaking" often use the "thee" form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, ''is thee'' or ''was thee''.&lt;ref name="Quaker Thee"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ezra Kempton |last=Maxfield |title=Quaker 'Thee' and Its History |journal=American Speech |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=1926 |pages=638–644 |doi=10.2307/452011 |jstor=452011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latter-day Saint]] prayer tradition, the terms "thee" and "thou" are always and exclusively used to address [[God]], as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Oaks |first= Dallin H. |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |title= The Language of Prayer |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1993/05/the-language-of-prayer?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are used. One particular example is [[The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation]], translated by [[Maulvi Sher Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|1 85372 314 2}}) by Islam International Publications Ltd. Islamabad, Sheephatch Lane, Tilford, Surrey GUl 0 2AQ, UK.[https://www.alislam.org/quran/Holy-Quran-English.pdf The Holy Quran, English Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English translations of the [[Bahá'í literature|scripture]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are also used.  [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original [[Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]] to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Diana | last = Malouf | chapter = The Vision of Shoghi Effendi | title = Proceedings of the Association for Baha'i Studies, Ninth Annual Conference | date = November 1984 | location = Ottawa, Canada | pages = 129–139 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun ''thou'' exclusively to address [[God]], using ''you'' in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the [[Psalms]] and similar text in devotional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html Preface to the ''Revised Standard Version''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518063139/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html |date=2016-05-18 }} 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Standard Bible]] (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 [[Revised English Bible]] dropped all forms of ''thou'' that had appeared in the earlier [[New English Bible]] (1970). The [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989) omits ''thou'' entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of ''thou'' in [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |title=NRSV: To the Reader |publisher=Ncccusa.org |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206062332/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to God, "thou" is often capitalized for clarity and reverence.

===Literary uses===

====Shakespeare====
Like his contemporaries [[William Shakespeare]] uses ''thou'' both in the intimate, French style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other ''ye'' or ''you'' as often as they call each other ''thou'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, in the following passage from ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV]]'', Shakespeare has [[Falstaff]] use both forms with Henry. Initially using "you" in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate "thou".

:'''PRINCE:''' Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? ...

:'''FALSTAFF:''' Indeed, you come near me now, Hal ... And, I [[prithee]], sweet wag, when thou art a king, as God save thy Grace{{spaced ndash}}Majesty, I should say; for grace thou wilt have none&amp;nbsp;–

While in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet's antagonism towards his mother.

:'''QUEEN GERTRUDE:''' Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended..

:'''HAMLET:''' Mother, you have my father much offended.

====More recent uses====
Except where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of ''thou'' has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn [[ritual]] occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813193259/http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 13, 2004 |title=Psalm 90 |access-date=May 23, 2017 |df= }} from the [[Revised Standard Version]]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[skylark]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html ''Ode to a Skylark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104055626/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html |date=2009-01-04 }} by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Achilles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/166/38.html ''The Iliad''], translated by [[E.

In Leonard Cohen's song "[[Bird on the Wire]]", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying "I will make it all up to thee." The [[Kaiser Chiefs]] song "I Predict a Riot" is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]" (written by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]]) we hear the lyric "Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'." These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of "Upside Down", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. 

Most modern writers have no experience using ''thou'' in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional [[Grammatical conjugation|verb forms]]. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending ''-eth'' with ''thou'', for example ''thou thinketh''. The converse{{spaced ndash}}the use of the second person singular ending ''-est'' for the third person—also occurs ("So sayest Thor!"{{spaced ndash}}spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern [[parody]] and [[pastiche]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Rob Liefeld]], "Awaken the Thunder" (Marvel Comics, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', vol. 2, issue 1, cover date Nov. 1996, part of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline.)&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are often transposed.

In the fictional teenage [[argot]] [[nadsat]], invented for [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]]), [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] and his ''droogs'' regularly use "thou", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of "you" and "thou" for the second person):

:''Well if it isn't fat stinking billygoat Billyboy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip-oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Burgess | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | title = A Clockwork Orange | publisher = William Heinemann | year = 1962 | page = 15 | isbn = 0-434-09800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some translators render the T–V distinction in English with "thou" and "you", particularly in places where ''you'' appears in the place of expected ''thou'', or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. [[Ernest Hemingway]], in his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', uses the forms "thou" and "you" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the [[Spanish language]] in which both formal (''usted'') and familiar (''tú'') second-person pronouns still exist.

In reading passages with ''thou'' and ''thee'', many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the ''e'' in ''-est'' ought to be unstressed, and ''thou'' and ''thee'' should be no more stressed than ''you''.

==Current usage==
''You'' is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, "thou" has persisted,&lt;ref name="northern_england"&gt;{{cite journal | title='You' and 'Thou' in Northern England | first=William | last=Evans | journal=South Atlantic Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=4 |date=November 1969 | pages=17–21 | doi=10.2307/3196963 | publisher=South Atlantic Modern Language Association | jstor=3196963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as [[y'all]] in the [[Southern United States]]. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Persistence of second-person singular===
In traditional dialects, ''thou'' is used in the counties of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and some western parts of [[Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trudgill|title=The Dialects of England|isbn=978-0631218159|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person, for example ''thee coost'' (standard English: ''you could'', archaic: ''thou couldst'') in northern Staffordshire. The word ''thee'' is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the [[Dawley]] area of [[Telford]] and referred to as the Dawley dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telford-live.com/2012/10/the-dawley-dictionary/ |title=The Dawley Dictionary|first=Pete|last=Jackson|publisher=Telford Live|date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The possessive is often written as ''thy'' in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed ''tha'', and the possessive form of ''tha'' has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming ''yours'' or the local{{Specify|date=September 2008}} word ''your'n'' (from ''your one''):{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and [[genitive]] forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing ''tha'' to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.

Some other variants are specific to certain areas. In [[Sheffield]], the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the "dee-dahs" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, ''ta'' was used as an unstressed shortening of ''thou'', which can be found in the song "[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]". These variants are no longer in use.

In rural North [[Lancashire]] between Lancaster and the [[North Yorkshire]] border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as "What would ''tha'' like for ''thi'' tea?" (What would you like for your dinner), and {{"'}}appen ''tha'' waint" ("perhaps you won't"{{spaced ndash}}'''happen''' being the [[dialect]] word for '''perhaps''') and "tha knows" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.

The use of the word "thee" in the hit song "[[I Predict a Riot]]" by [[Leeds]] band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] ("Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee") caused some comment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml |title=BBC ''Top of the Pops'' web page |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-03-18|archivedate=2010-06-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618075108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]].

The use of the phrase "tha knows" has been widely used in various songs by [[Arctic Monkeys]], a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with "tha knows" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.

The use persists somewhat in the [[West Country dialects]], albeit somewhat affected.

''Thoo'' has also been used in the [[Orcadian dialect|Orcadian]] [[Scots language|Scots]] dialect in place of the singular informal ''thou''. In [[Shetlandic]], the other form of [[Insular Scots]], ''du'' and ''de'' are used. The word "thou" has been reported in the [[North Northern Scots]] dialect of [[Cromarty]] as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and now only in occasional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/download/files/The%20Cromarty%20Fisherfolk%20Dialect.pdf  The Cromarty Fisherfolk Dialect], Am Baile, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in cinema===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{In popular culture|section|date=November 2018}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
}}
The word ''thou'' can occasionally be heard in films recorded in certain English dialect. In [[Ken Loach]]'s films ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'', ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' and ''[[Looks and Smiles]]'', the word is used frequently in the dialogue. It is used occasionally, but much less frequently, in the 1963 film ''[[This Sporting Life]]''.

In the 2018 film ''[[Peterloo (film)|Peterloo]]'', the word is used by many of the working-class characters in Lancashire, including [[Samuel Bamford]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Use in video games===
All forms of ''thou'' appear in ingame dialogues of the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls video game series]]'' by [[FromSoftware]]. The games are settled in [[late medieval]] [[dark fantasy]] worlds. An earlier example is the original [[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].{{Importance inline|date=November 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Walter Bryce Gallie''' (5 October 1912 – 31 August 1998) was a Scottish [[social theorist]], [[political theorist]], and philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-professor-w-b-gallie-1196011.html|title=Obituary: Professor W. B. Gallie|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Walter Bryce Gallie, M.A., Emeritus Fellow of Peterhouse and Emeritus Professor of Political Science, died on Monday, 31 August 1998, aged 85 years." (''Cambridge University Reporter'', 7 October 1998.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early life===
Gallie was born in [[Lenzie]], [[East Dunbartonshire]], near [[Glasgow]], the son of an engineer. He grew up in a British [[boarding school]] and later published his memoirs of this in the book ''An English School''.

===Military career===
He served in the British Army from 1940 to 1945, leaving the service with the rank of Major. He was awarded the [[Croix de guerre]].
{{quote|[The time he spent in the army] evidently made {{sic|an}} great impression upon him. Though a very out-going man, he never spoke of his wartime experiences though he repeatedly returned to the philosophical aspects of war in conversation.(Sharpe, R.A., 5 September 1998)}}

===Academic career===
* 1935–1938: Assistant Lecturer in Philosophy, [[Swansea University|University College of Swansea]].
* 1938–1948: Lecturer in Philosophy, University College of Swansea.
* 1948–1950: Senior Lecturer in Philosophy, University College of Swansea.
* 1950–1954: Professor of Philosophy, [[Keele University|University College of North Staffordshire]].
* 1954–1967: Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University, Belfast]].
* 1967–1978: Professor of Political Science, [[Cambridge University]].
* 1967–1978: Fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]].
* 1970–1971: President of the [[Aristotelian Society]]

===Personal life and death===
Gallie married [[Menna Gallie|Menna Patricia Humphreys]] in 1940. They had a son and a daughter.

He died in [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Ceredigion]], on 31 August 1998:
{{quote|Walter Bryce Gallie, M.A., Emeritus Fellow of Peterhouse and Emeritus Professor of Political Science, died on Monday, 31 August 1998, aged 85 years. (''Cambridge University Reporter'', 7 October 1998.)}}

==Thought==
===Essentially contested concepts===
His paper on '[[Essentially contested concept]]s' (''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 56, 1956, pp.&amp;nbsp;167–198) is a seminal statement in the philosophy of the [[social science]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In it, Gallie argued that it is impossible to conclusively define key appraisive concepts such as '[[social justice]],' 'democracy,' '[[Christianity|Christian life]]', 'art', '[[goodness and value theory|moral goodness]]' and '[[duty]]', although it is possible and rational to discuss one's justifications for holding one interpretation over competing ones.  Clarification of such concepts involves not the examination of predictive relations (as is the case for most scientific concepts), but rather, consideration of how the concept has been used by different parties throughout its history.

'''Zen Mountain Monastery''' (or, '''Doshinji,''' meaning Temple of the Way of Reality) is a [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] monastery and training center on a {{convert|230|acre|km2|adj=on}} forested property in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in Mount Tremper, [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was founded in 1980 by [[John Daido Loori]] originally as the Zen Arts Center. It combines the [[Rinzai]] and [[Sōtō]] Zen traditions, in both of which Loori received [[shiho|Dharma transmission]]. From Loori's death in October 2009 until January 2015, Zen Mountain Monastery had two teachers: [[Geoffrey Shugen Arnold]] and [[Konrad Ryushin Marchaj]], who received Dharma transmission from Loori in 1997 and 2009, respectively. Since January 2015, the training at the Monastery has been led by Shugen Roshi, assisted by Ron Hogen Green, Sensei; Jody Hojin Kimmel, Sensei; and Vanessa Zuisei Goddard, Sensei.

==Retreat center building==
The monastery was originally built as '''Camp Wapanachki''' in the 1930s.  The massive [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style stone and wood frame former retreat house and chapel was built in two phases between about 1935 and 1938.  The four story "main house" is the earliest section. It contains living spaces, libraries, a small cellar and a large kitchen.  The later section is built of [[bluestone]] and contains a dining hall and chapel.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=9632|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Camp Wapanachki|date=August 1994|accessdate=2010-03-20 |author=John A. Bonafide|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=9618|title=Accompanying 12 photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Training==
Students and residents of the monastery practice according to Daido Roshi's '''Eight Gates of Zen''' training matrix. These gates consist of zazen, face-to-face teaching, liturgy, moral and ethical teachings, work practice, body practice, art practice and academic study. Their practice occurs either at home for lay students or at the monastery during weekend retreats and monthly week-long [[sesshin]] (meditation intensives). The monastery's schedule includes a Sunday morning program open to the general public and a variety of weekend and week-long Zen training programs, focusing variously on painting, poetry, [[shakuhachi]] performance, Japanese archery ([[kyūdō]]), [[qigong]], and many other activities.

The monastery grounds are also home to the Zen Environmental Studies Institute and Dharma Communications, which runs The Monastery Store and publishes ''[http://monasterystore.org/mountainrecord/ Mountain Record: The Zen Practitioner's Journal]'' and other print, audio, video and online information resources.

In addition to supporting the lay community, ZMM is home to a number of monastic practitioners. These individuals have taken life vows of simplicity, selflessness, stability, service and accomplishing the Buddha's Way. As a result, they do not work outside the monastery, earn money, or have children.  As the Mountain Record states: "Monastics in the order are entirely dependent on the sangha while maintaining the Monastery for current practitioners and sustaining it for generations to come."

==Mountains and Rivers Order==
ZMM is the main house of the [[Mountains and Rivers Order]], an umbrella organization inspired by the teachings of [[Dogen]] as found in the Mountains and Rivers Sutra. Founded by John Daido Loori in 1980, it includes the following branches:
# [http://monasterystore.org/dharma-communications/ Dharma Communications] is a nonprofit, right livelihood training dojo run at the monastery, and supplies teacher's talks and sitting supplies to home dwelling practitioners. It also creates the [http://monasterystore.org/mountainrecord/ Mountain Record] the longest running Zen journal published in the USA.
# Society of Mountains and Rivers is composed of affiliate sitting groups in Buffalo, Albany, Philadelphia, Vermont and New Zealand, which hold weekly sitting sessions and visits from the teachers of the Order.
# '''National Buddhist Archives''' which collects and digitizes outstanding documents and media chronicling the history of Buddhism in America thus far, and especially the history of Zen Mountain Monastery.
# The Zen Environmental Studies Institute sponsors and conducts wilderness retreats, environmental mindfulness workshops, and pursues research on the local environment.
# [http://monasterystore.org/nbps National Buddhist Prison Sangha] provides teaching supplies and sitting opportunities to inmates currently serving in a correctional facility.
# [http://zcnyc.mro.org/ Fire Lotus Temple], is the only residential Zen training facility in New York City, offering training opportunities to lay practitioners on a daily basis. Geoffrey Shugen Arnold is abbot of the Temple, which offers retreats as well as a Sunday program similar to that held at ZMM.

'''Zen lineage charts''' depict the [[Dharma transmission|transmission of the dharma]] from one generation to another. They developed during the [[Tang Dynasty]], incorporating elements from [[Indian Buddhism]] and East Asian [[Mahayana Buddhism]],{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4-5}} but were first published at the end of the Tang.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=5}}

==History==
{{Main article|Chan Buddhism}}
The idea of a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|patriarchal lineage]] in Chan dates back to the [[epitaph]] for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, [[Daman Hongren]] (弘忍 601–674). In the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and [[Dazu Huike]] are the only explicitly identified disciples of [[Bodhidharma]]. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|1993|p=37}}{{sfn|Cole|2009|p=73–114}}

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan lineage was developed:
{{quote|These famous biographies were non-sectarian. The Ch'an biographical works, however, aimed to establish Ch'an as a legitimate school of Buddhism traceable to its Indian origins, and at the same time championed a particular form of Ch'an. Historical accuracy was of little concern to the compilers; old legends were repeated, new stories were invented and reiterated until they too became legends.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=5-6}}}}

According to McRae, the schema developed over the course of several centuries.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}} It is a combined product of Indian and Chinese culture, which inherited elements "from the larger tradition of East Asian Mahayana Buddhism" such as the seven Buddhas of the past:{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}
{{quote|[T]he origins of this linegae-based transmission scheme are to be found in Indian Buddhism and the fourth- and fifth-century Buddhist meditation tradition of Kashmir. There are a number of parallels between the Chan transmission scheme and Chinese family genealogies of the eighth century and later, but we should remember that Indian Buddhists had parents and teachers, family genealogies and initiation lineages, just as the Chinese did. As an amalgamation of Indian and Chinese elements, though, the Chinese transmission schema developed within the Chinese Buddhist context and was particularly well adapted to that milieu.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=5}}}}
The complete system was published perhaps as early as 801 but certainly by the year 952.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}

Suzuki]] contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had "no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism" and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.{{sfn|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}

==Lineages==

===The Indian Lineage From Shakyamuni to Bodhidharma===
The earliest descriptions of the Chán-lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Śākyamuni Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Śākyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of the Chán school. The [[Denkoroku]], "Transmission of the Light", written by [[Keizan]], gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:{{sfn|Cook|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}}

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

===The First Six Ancestors of the Chinese Lineage===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/mag83546.htm 禪宗第七祖之爭的文獻研究]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle teachers of the Chan, [[Korean Seon|Seon]] and [[Zen]] traditions are commonly known in the first English translations as [[Patriarch]]s; however, the current trend is to use the more precise terminology of "Ancestors" or "Founders" (祖) and "Ancestral Masters" or "Founding Masters" (祖師) as the original terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:
{{Zen Lineage Six Patriarchs}}

===Tang Dynasty===

====Hongren - Huineng - Northern School - Shitou-lineage - Mazu-lineage - Southern School====
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|right|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
{{See also|East Mountain Teaching}}

The period of [[Dayi Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}} 580–651) and [[Daman Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}} 601–674) came to be called the [[East Mountain Teaching]], due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei. The term was used by [[Yuquan Shenxiu]], the most important successor to Hongren.{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=33–36}}

Yuquan Shenxiu (神秀 606?-706) was the most important successor to Daman Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by [[Wu Zetian]], who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=48}}

According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wuys.com/news/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=1276 禅宗研究一百年]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng, claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of the publicly recognized successor Yuquan Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]]{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A|p=9}} Shenhui's influence is traceable in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng, but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Shenhui himself does not figure in the ''Platform Sutra''; he was effectively written out of Chan history.{{sfn|MacRae|2003|p=63}}
{{Zen Lineage Hongren Huineng}}

====Shitou Xiqian - Fayan School - Yunmen school - Caodong/Soto school====
{{Main article|Shitou Xiqian|Caodong school}}
The details of Shítóu's life are found in traditional biographies. Scholar Mario Poceski writes that Shítóu does not appear to have been influential or famous during his lifetime.{{sfn|Poceski|2007}} Sayings to the effect that Shitou and [[Mazu Daoyi]] were the two great masters of their day date from decades after their respective deaths. Shítóu's retrospective prominence owes much to the importance of [[Dongshan Liangjie]], a 9th-century teacher who traced his lineage back to Shítóu.{{sfn|Poceski|2007|p=97–98}}

{{Zen Lineage Shihtou Lineage}}

====Mazu - Hongzhou school - Guiyang school - Linji school====
Traditionally, Mazu Daoyi is depicted as a successor in the lineage of Huineng, since his teacher [[Nanyue Huairang]] is regarded as a student and successor of Huineng. This connection between Huineng and Nanyue Huairang is doubtful, being the product of later rewritings of Chan history to place Mazu Daoyi in the traditional lineages.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=82}}

Mazu Daoyi is perhaps the most influential teaching master in the formation of Chan Buddhism.{{sfn|Schuhmacher and Woerner (editors)|1991|p=141}} While Chan became the dominant school of Buddhism during the [[Song dynasty]], the later [[Tang dynasty]] and Mazu Daoyi's [[Hongzhou school]] became regarded as the "golden age" of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=18-21}} The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755-763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and metropolitan Chan began to lose its status while "other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunnersof the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng."{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A|p=11}}

{{Zen Lineage Mazu}}

===Song Dynasty - The Five Houses of Chán===
During the Song the ''Five Houses (Ch. 五家) of Chán'', or five "schools", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as "schools" or "sects", but based on the various Chán-genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as "schools".

The Five Houses of Chán are:{{sfn|Cleary|2005}}
* [[Guiyang school]] (潙仰宗), named after masters [[Guishan Lingyou]] (771–854) and Yangshan Huiji (813–890), dharma-descendants of [[Mazu Daoyi]];{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A}}
* [[Linji school]] (臨濟宗), named after master [[Linji Yixuan]] (died 866), whose lineage came to be traced back to Mazu, establishing him as the archetypal iconoclastic Chán-master;{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* [[Caodong]] school (曹洞宗), named after masters [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (807–869) and [[Caoshan Benji]] (840–901);
* [[Yunmen school]] (雲門宗), named after master [[Yunmen Wenyan]] (died 949), a student of [[Xuefeng Yicun]] (822-908), whose lineage was traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]]:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}
* [[Fayan school]] (法眼宗), named after master [[Fayan Wenyi]] (885–958), a "grand-student" of [[Xuefeng Yicun]].

====Guiyang school====
{{Main article|Guiyang school}}

The Guiyang school (潙仰宗 Guíyáng, Jpn. Igyō) was the first established school of the [[Zen#The Five Houses of Zen|Five Houses of Zen]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=126–127}} Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771–854) (Kuei-shan Ling-yu, Jpn. Isan Reiyū) and his student, Yangshan Huiji (807-883,{{sfn|Koole|1997|p=207}} or 813–890) (Yang-shan Hui-chi, Jpn. Kyōzan Ejaku). After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern [[Jiangxi]].

The Guiyang school was distinct from the other schools due to its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's [[kōan]]s and other teachings.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=126–127}}

{{Zen Lineage Guiyang school}}

====Fayan school and Yunmen school====
{{Main article|Fayan school|Yunmen school}}

Via [[Xuefeng Yicun]] the Fayang school and Yunmen school are traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] and [[Huineng]]. Xuefeng was one of the most influential Chán-teachers at the end of the Tang Dynasty,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13}} when "a widely influential zen center formed around [[Xuefeng Yicun]]".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=169}} The loss of control by the Tang Dynasty, and the accompanying loss of support for Buddhist institutions, lead to a regionally based Chan of Xuefeng and his students.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=90}}

The ''Zutang ji'' (祖堂集 "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall), compiled in 952, the first document which mentions [[Linji Yixuan]], was written to support the Xuefeng Yicun lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It pictures this lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school,{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} though Xuefeng Yicun's lineage is traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (700-790). It was written by two students of Zhaoqing Wendeng (884-972), a dharma descendant of [[Xuefeng Yicun]].

{{Zen lineage Fayan school and Yunmen school}}

====Linji school====
{{Main article|Linji school}}

During the Northern Song (960–1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of [[China Proper|inner China]]. The Fayan school was the first faction to gain recognition at the Song court, due to the influence of the buddhist scholar-official Zanning (919-1001).{{sfn|Young|2009}} After his death this position was taken over by the linji-faction.{{sfn|Young|2009}}

The linji-school of the [[Song Dynasty]] brought together the classical elements of Zen:
* The ''denlu''-genre, the "Transmission of the Lamp";{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* The ''yulu''-genre, the recorded sayings of the masters of the Tang;{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* The ''gongan'' ([[koan]]) collections, describing fictiounous dialogues and interactions between masters and students, supplemented with introductions, commentary and poetry;{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}
* The [[Hua Tou]] practice, the meditative concentration on the "word-head" of a gongan as an aid in attaining [[kensho]];{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}
* The notion of "a special transmission outside the scripture" as one of the defining characteristics of Zen.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

All of these elements, which shaped the picture of the iconoclastic Zen-master who transmits a wordless truth, were shaped by and dependent on ''literary''  products that shaped the [[Zen#Zen narratives|Traditional Zen Narrative]] which furthered the position of the Linji-school. This narrative did not describe the actual Chán-practice, neither of the Song-Dynasty, nor of the Tang Dynasty.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念) (926-993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The ''Tiansheng Guangdeng lu'' (天聖廣燈錄), "Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗) (988-1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the [[Hongzhou school]] of [[Mazu Daoyi]], displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It also established the slogan of "a special transmission outside the teaching", supporting the Linji-school claim of "Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings".{{sfn|Young|2009}}

{{Zen Lineage Linji school}}

====Caodong school====
{{Main article|Caodong school}}

The Caodong school was founded by [[Dongshan Liangjie]] and his Dharma-heirs in the 9th century.

{{Zen Lineage Caodong School}}

===Japanese Zen===
Twenty-four different Zen-lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. [[Sōtō]] was transmitted to Japan by [[Dogen]], who travelled to [[China]] for Chan training in the 13th century CE. After receiving Dharma transmission in the [[Caodong]] line he returned to Japan and established the [[Sōtō]] line. The [[Linji school|Linji]] line was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it became known as the [[Rinzai]] line.

====Soto school====
{{Main article|Sōtō}}

Though [[Dōgen]] emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the Soto-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270-271}} Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher [[Rujing]], with whom he studied two years, but in medieval Soto he was also considered to be a dharma heir of Myōzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=426}} And [[Tettsū Gikai]], the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]], the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=426-427}} Gikai passed this linegae over to [[Keizan]], who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=427}}

To make the history of Soto even more complicated, the [[Caodong]]-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master [[Dayang Jingxuan]] to [[Touzi Yiqing]] via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's "portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} promising "to pass them on to a suitable successor". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage,{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but "[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated".{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}}

{{Zen Lineage Soto school}}

====Rinzai school====
{{Main article|Rinzai school|Ōtōkan|Hakuin}}

The [[Linji school]] was first brought to Japan by [[Eisai]].

The [[Ōtōkan|Otokan lineage]] was founded by [[Nanpo Jōmyō]] 南浦紹明 (1235–1308), who received transmission in China from the monk Xutang Zhiyu 虚堂智愚 (Japanese ''Kido Chigu,'' 1185–1269) in 1265, who then returned to Japan in 1267. It was then spread by his student [[Shuho Myocho]] (second generation) and [[Kanzan Egen]] (third generation), who made it an influential school.

The two main schools today are Takujū and Inzan, which both descent from Hakuin.

{{Zen Lineage Rinzai school}}

===Western Zen===
{{See also|Buddhism in the West|Zen in the USA}}

Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of [[Soyen Shaku]], a Japanese Zen monk, to [[Chicago]] during the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Especially [[Japanese Zen]] has gained popularity in the West. Quintessential in this popularity were the books published by [[D.T. Suzuki]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The various books on Zen by [[Reginald Horace Blyth]], and [[Alan Watts]] published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest from beat poets such as [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Gary Snyder]].{{sfn|Aitken|1994}}{{sfn|Fields|1992}}

The most successful implementation of Zen-practice was brought about by [[Shunryu Suzuki]], [[Hakuun Yasutani]], and Yasutani's student [[Taizan Maezumi]].

====Shunryu Suzuki====
{{main article|Shunryu Suzuki}}

Shunryu Suzuki (鈴木 俊隆 ''Suzuki Shunryū'', dharma name ''Shōgaku Shunryū'' 祥岳俊隆, often called Suzuki [[Rōshi|Roshi]]) (born May 18, 1904, [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] of [[Japan]]; died December 4, 1971 in San Francisco, CA, USA) was a [[Sōtō Zen]] monk and teacher who helped popularize [[Zen Buddhism]] in the [[United States]], and is renowned for founding the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery outside Asia ([[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]]). Suzuki founded [[San Francisco Zen Center]], which along with its affiliate temples, comprises one of the most influential Zen organizations in the United States. A book of his teachings, ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'', is one of the most popular books on Zen and Buddhism in the West.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.petercoyote.com/zenmind.html Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thewayofseeing.com/article_zen-mind.html Reflections on Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sfzc.org/zc/display.asp?catid=1,10,160,161&amp;pageid=522 Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind] at [[San Francisco Zen Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hakuun Yasutani====
{{main article|Hakuun Yasutani|Sanbo Kyodan}}

{{Nihongo|Hakuun Yasutani|安谷 白雲|Yasutani Hakuun|1885&amp;ndash;1973}} was a [[Sōtō]] [[Rōshi]], the founder of the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] [[Zen Buddhist]] organization. The Sanbõ Kyõdan incorporates Rinzai [[Kōan|Kōan study]] as well as much of Soto tradition, a style Yasutani had learned from his teacher Harada Daiun Sogaku. As founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, and teacher of [[Taizan Maezumi]], Yasutani has been one of the most influential persons in bringing Zen practice to the west. Although the membership of Sanbo Kyodan is small, 3,790 registered followers and 24 instructors in 1988,{{sfn|Sharf|1993}} "the Sanbõkyõdan has had an inordinate influence on Zen in the West".{{sfn|Sharf|1993}} His westerns students have spread out via Taizan Maezumi.
