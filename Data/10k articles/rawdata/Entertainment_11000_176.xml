'''Bangladesh Short Film Forum''' ('''BSFF''') is an organization of young Bangladeshi film makers. It was formed on 24 August 1986 by a group of young independent filmmakers and activists who were then campaigning for creative and aesthetically rich cinema.

Most of these young filmmakers were initiated into cinema through their involvement with the film society movement in Bangladesh that began as early as in the 1960s. Short Film Forum was formed at a time when mainstream Bangladeshi cinema was dominated by crass commercialism and a network of producers-distributors-exhibitors which allowed no space for artistic or socially responsible films.

The Forum featured some of most notable young Bangladeshi film makers among its members, including [[Morshedul Islam]], [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Tareque Masud]], Enayet Karim Babul, [[Tareq Shahrier]], [[Shameem Akhter]], [[Manjare Hasin Murad]], Yasmin Kabir, [[Nurul Alam Atique]], Zahidur Rahim Anjan, Rashed Chowdhury, and Akram Khan.&lt;ref&gt;Short Film Festival Newsletter, issue ??, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh Short Film Forum now has its own film center in [[Shahbag]], [[Dhaka]] with an auditorium, a library, an archive and an administrative office.

The Forum is mostly noted for organizing the biennial and non-competitive International Short and Independent Film Festival. The first festival was held in 1988, and was the first festival in the Indian Sub-continent which was entirely dedicated to short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The year that was... |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/the-year-that-was-57699 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum produced a number of short films, including ''One Day in Krishnanagar'' (53 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daily Star: Documenting Bangladesh |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2005/03/03/film.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dhaka 2005'' (5 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riff.it/pasteditions/inglese/pasteditions/RIFF06/short/Dhaka%202005.html Dhaka 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes seminars and workshops on films and limited scale film festivals all over Bangladesh, as well as film shows in its Bangladesh Film Center in Shahbag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet the Director: Supriyo Sen |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/entertainment/2015/aug/26/meet-director-supriyo-sen |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series, a contemporary [[prequel]] to  [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''; based on [[Robert Bloch]]'s [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]], depicts the lives of [[Norman Bates]] ([[Freddie Highmore]]) and his mother [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]] ([[Vera Farmiga]]) prior to the events portrayed in the novel and film, albeit in a different fictional town (White Pine Bay, [[Oregon]], as opposed to Fairvale, [[California]]) and in a modern-day setting.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: 'Bates Motel' a twisty, moody modern prequel to 'Psycho'. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/18/entertainment/la-et-st-bates-motel-20130318 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=McNamara |first=Mary |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427060255/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/18/entertainment/la-et-st-bates-motel-20130318 |archivedate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starpulse"&gt;{{cite web|title='Bates Motel': An Intriguing Contemporary Prequel To 'Psycho' |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alan_Danzis/2013/03/18/bates_motel_review_an_intriguing_conte |website=Starpulse |first=Alan |last=Danzis |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322072731/http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alan_Danzis/2013/03/18/bates_motel_review_an_intriguing_conte |archivedate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final season loosely adapts the plot of ''Psycho''.
[[Max Thieriot]] and [[Olivia Cooke]] both starred as part of the main cast throughout the series' run. After recurring in the first season, [[Nestor Carbonell]] was added to the main cast from season two onward.

The series begins in Arizona with the death of Norma's husband, after which Norma purchases the Seafairer motel located in a coastal Oregon town so that she and Norman can start a new life.&lt;ref name="aeorder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother, as She Lives and Breathes |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/arts/television/bates-motel-with-vera-farmiga-on-ae.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |last=Stanley |first=Alessandra |date=March 17, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624220548/http://tv.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/arts/television/bates-motel-with-vera-farmiga-on-ae.html |archivedate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tension builds in The Lake, but dies at the Bates Motel |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/17/3291295/tension-builds-in-the-lake-but.html |website=[[Miami Herald]] |last=Garvin |first=Glenn |date=March 17, 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021070700/http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/17/3291295/tension-builds-in-the-lake-but.html |archivedate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent seasons follow Norman as his mental illness becomes dangerous, and Norma as she struggles to protect her son, and those around him, from himself. The series was filmed outside [[Greater Vancouver|Vancouver]] in [[Aldergrove, British Columbia]], along with other locations within the [[Fraser Valley]] of British Columbia.

[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] chose to skip a pilot of the series, opting to go straight-to-series by ordering a 10-episode first season.&lt;ref name="aeorder"/&gt; On June 15, 2015, the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season, making ''Bates Motel'' A&amp;E's longest-running original scripted drama series in the channel's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Bates Motel' Renewed for Two More Seasons at A&amp;E; 'Returned' Cancelled |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bates-motel-renewed-returned-canceled-801653 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=June 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617162553/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bates-motel-renewed-returned-canceled-801653 |archivedate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' lead actors, Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore, received particular praise for their performances in the series, with the former receiving a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination and winning a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television]]. ''Bates Motel'' also won three [[People's Choice Awards]] for Favorite Cable TV Drama, and for Favorite Cable TV Actress (Farmiga) and Actor (Highmore).

==Series overview==
{{main|List of Bates Motel episodes}}
{{:List of Bates Motel episodes}}&lt;!--To edit this table, go to the List of episodes page--&gt;

===Season 1===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 1)}}
The first season follows Norma and Norman Bates as they buy a motel after Norman's father dies. On one of the first nights of the two owning the motel, the former owner breaks in and sexually assaults Norma. Norman knocks the attacker out, and Norma stabs him to death. She decides it's best not to call the police and to cover up the murder. She and Norman dispose of the body. He complicates the cover-up by keeping a belt that belonged to the victim. When the town sheriff and his deputy notice that a man has gone missing, Norma and Norman must keep them from digging too far.

===Season 2===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 2)}}
The second season follows the aftermath of Norman's teacher's murder, as her mysterious past comes to light. Meanwhile, Norma finds herself making dangerous decisions in order to keep the motel running and preventing the impending bypass. Bradley's search for her father's killer leads to the extremes, and Dylan learns the disturbing truth about his parentage.

===Season 3===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 3)}}
The third season focuses on Norman's waning deniability about what's happening to him, and the lengths he will go to gain control of his fragile psyche. The dramatic events of last season leave Norma more aware of her son's mental fragility and fearful of what he is capable of. Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero begins to distance himself from the Bates family after he suspects Norma is lying to him about her husband's death.

===Season 4===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 4)}}
The fourth season follows Norma as she becomes increasingly fearful of Norman, going to great lengths to find him the professional help he needs. This complicates their once unbreakable trust as Norman struggles to maintain his grip on reality. Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero once again finds himself drawn into Norma and Norman's lives.  He agrees to marry Norma because his insurance will enable her to place Norman in an expensive psychiatric hospital.  His generosity backfires, however, when Norman learns of the marriage.  Norman bitterly resents Romero for coming between him and his mother and at one point threatens the sheriff with an axe.

===Season 5===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 5)}}
The fifth season begins two years after the death of Norma. Publicly happy and well-adjusted, Norman struggles at home, where his blackouts are increasing and "Mother" threatens to take him over completely. Meanwhile, Dylan and Emma find themselves drawn back into Norman's world, and Romero hungers for revenge against his stepson, Norman.

      <comment>This episode guide is horrific - there's not one sentence that makes sense.  This was added by an anonymous editor a year ago. I'm restoring the previous version, which had less detail, but was readable. If someone wants to re-add some of the locales visited, that would be fine - I have no objection to the content, just the absolute lack of grammar and clarity.</comment>

'''''Billy Connolly's World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales''''' is the third of Scottish comedian [[Billy Connolly]]'s "world tours" commissioned by the [[BBC]]. It was first aired in 2002, and was released on DVD in 2004, with three episodes on disc one and the remaining five on disc two.

==Episode guide==

'''Episode 1:''' In the first episode, Connolly visits the city of [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]

'''Episode 2:''' Connolly visits the city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. While there, he visits a graveyard that has a wall built under the ground to keep the [[Protestants]] and [[Catholics]] apart in death.

'''Episode 3:''' While still in Ireland, Connolly visits the town of [[Killarney]] and surrounding areas.

'''Episode 4:''' Connolly's first episode to be set in England starts in the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. On his visit he gives an insight to how the [[Geordie]]s got their nickname.

'''Episode 5:''' The fifth episode focuses on the nation's capital, [[London]]. Connolly climbs to the top of the [[Big Ben]] clock tower, rides down the [[River Thames]], and performs at [[Shakespeare's Globe]].

'''Episode 6:''' Connolly visits the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]].

'''Episode 7:''' The whole episode focuses on the country of Wales, in which he visits [[Cardiff]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] and [[Portmeirion]].

'''Episode 8:''' In the final episode of the series, Connolly visits [[Bournemouth]]. In an almost traditional way for his World Tour Series, he strips down to nothing as he rides off on his bike during the ending credits.

==Music==
The closing credits of each episode feature [[Ralph McTell]], [[Cara Dillon]] and [[Mary Hopkin]] singing verses of McTell's song, "England" (suitably adapted for 'Ireland' and 'Cymru').  Hopkin can additionally be heard singing a verse of "[[Bugeilio'r Gwenith Gwyn]]" during Episode 7. The DVD also includes audio tracks of songs performed by Connolly and Dillon, and instrumental versions of three McTell compositions (including the series' theme tune).

'''Bits and Mortar''' is an online organization of publishers who support [[brick and mortar]] game stores.

== Background ==
Bits and Mortar was established in July 2010, alternately referred to as a ''publisher's alliance, initiative, or coalition'', which advocates for support of brick and mortar games stores. Founding organizations include [[Arc Dream Publishing]], [[Cellar Games]], [[Cubicle 7]], [[Evil Hat Productions]], [[Pelgrane Press]], and [[Rogue Games]].&lt;ref name="rpgblog1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgblog2.com/2010/08/zacks-gen-con-liveblog-day-3.html |title=RPG Blog II: Zack's Gen Con Liveblog, Day 3 |publisher=Rpgblog2.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002045032/http://www.rpgblog2.com/2010/08/zacks-gen-con-liveblog-day-3.html |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael “Stargazer” Wolf &amp;bull; |url=http://www.stargazersworld.com/2011/02/08/bits-and-mortar |title=Bits And Mortar |publisher=Stargazersworld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to their foundation, gaming publishers providing proprietary methods of supplying gaming documentation, such as [[PDF]]s, to retail customers of brick and mortar stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=2538 |title=Pelgrane Press Ltd » Blog Archive » Retail customers get PDFs through the Bits and Mortar initiative |publisher=Pelgranepress.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hicks]], founder of Evil Hat Productions and other publishers{{such as?|date=September 2013}} agreed to establish a [[non-profit organization]] to centralize the release and distribution of documentation. The Bits and Mortar initiative was eventually announced at [[Gen Con]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Hicks |url=http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2010/08/bits-mortar-begins |title=Bits &amp; Mortar Begins |publisher=Deadly Fredly |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Hicks is quoted as making the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We love real, physical brick and mortar game stores, and we want to see them survive — and thrive — even as the digital content options for gaming become more prevalent. Today's game-buying customers want the best of both worlds: the portability of an e-book, and the lasting durability of one made out of paper, glue, and ink. They want to be able to support their favorite local game stores, and they want to be able to support their favorite publishers. The Bits and Mortar initiative is all about making sure they don’t have to choose one or the other. We want them to choose both, every time.&lt;ref name="rpgblog1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Centre National du Costume de Scene''' (CNCS) ([[English language|English]]: '''The National Center of Costume and Scenography''' (CNCS)), is a French museum dedicated to stage costumes and sets.

It was inaugurated on 1 July 2006 in [[Moulins, Allier]] by [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]], [[Pierre-André Périssol]] the mayor of [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] and [[Christian Lacroix]], dressmaker and board chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnac.fr/media/documents/2013_07_CNCS_Expo_costumes_brochure.pdf | title=Centre National du Costume de Scene | publisher=CNAC | accessdate=16 December 2013 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Delphine Pinasa, whose portrait is exhibited at the museum.&lt;ref name="Vichy" /&gt;

==History==

It is located in the old district of [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]], [[Allier]] [[Departments of France]]. Situated on the left side of [[Allier (river)|Allier River]], it faces the town and its historic quarter.&lt;ref name="La Tribune de l'Art" /&gt;

The museum includes the historic building, which had been partially destroyed during [[World War II]]&lt;ref name="CNCS History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cncs.fr/le-CNCS/decouvrir-le-cncs/historique | title=Historique | publisher=Centre National du Costume de Scene | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was restored by François Voinchet, Architect of Historic Monuments for the museum.&lt;ref name="La Tribune de l'Art"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latribunedelart.com/le-centre-national-du-costume-de-scene-de-moulins-une-realisation-exemplaire | title=Le Centre National du Costume de Scène de Moulins: une réalisation exemplaire | publisher=La Tribune de l'Art | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villars, named for the native military officer, [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Marshal Villars]] (1653–1734), was built during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The 18th century [[Historical Monument|historical monument]]&lt;ref name="merimee"&gt;{{Base Mérimée|PA00093231}} Caserne ou quartier Villars, actuellement centre national du costume de scène&lt;/ref&gt; was used as a cavalry barracks.&lt;ref name="CNCS History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jodidio p. 533"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Jodidio|title=Architecture D'aujourd'hui|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kl9Shbs2S9cC&amp;pg=PT533|year=2004|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-2935-6|page=533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ville de Moulin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ville-moulins.fr/Centre-National-du-Costume-de,20.html | title=Centre National du Costume de Scene (French, translated in part using translate.google.com) | publisher=Ville de Moulins | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the museum was designed by [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]] and Jacques Brudin.&lt;ref name="La Tribune de l'Art" /&gt; A new {{convert|1730|sqm|sqft}} building, was built for conservation of the centre's collection.&lt;ref name="La Tribune de l'Art" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jodidio p. 533" /&gt;

==Overview==

The museum is the first structure, in France or abroad, to be entirely dedicated to [[scenography]] and [[costume]] heritage.&lt;ref name="Vichy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auzias p. 46" /&gt; Its mission is to preserve, study and increase the value of a [[Collection (artwork)|collection]] of 10,000 [[theatre]], [[opera]] and [[ballet]] costumes. It also shows paintings, on loan from the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] (National Library of France), the [[Comédie-Française]] and the [[Opéra de Paris]] (Paris Opera).&lt;ref name="Saatchi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile.php/Centre+National+Du+Costume+De+Scene/970.html | title=Centre National du Costume de Scene | publisher=Saatchi Gallery | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auzias p. 46"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Paul Labourdette, Dominique Auzias|author2=Sandrine Bavard|author3=Aurélia Riss|title=Petit Futé Vacances avec les enfants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMHCffAns44C&amp;pg=PA46|date=6 May 2009|publisher=Petit Futé|isbn=978-2-7469-2513-7|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Saatchi states that the collection hold 7,110 costumes, rather than the 10,000 states in the book by Labourdette and Auzias.&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auzias p. 46" /&gt;|group="nb"}}

The museum has four areas: the reserves, exhibition halls, library and the training center. There is a gallery of temporary exhibitions {{convert|1,500|sqm|sqft}} behind eight windows.&lt;ref name="La Tribune de l'Art" /&gt;  A large room showcases costumes in a [[scenography]] context. It also has educational spaces, an [[auditorium]] and a documentation center.&lt;ref name="Ville de Moulin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auzias p. 46" /&gt;

Its restaurant was decorated by [[Christian Lacroix]], and it has a museum shop.&lt;ref name="Vichy" /&gt;

==Collections==

===Nureyev collection===
The museum has a collection of [[Rudolf Nureyev]]'s costumes, as requested in his will to be a "place of memory". Nureyev, who has been the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] director had wished to have his collection placed in a museum in Paris, but suitable locations could not be found. So, his collection was placed in the museum in this Auvergne region museum, which is about 3 hours by train from Paris. It is "a permanent collection that offers visitors a sense of his exuberant, vagabond personality and passion for all that was rare and beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/arts/dance/at-a-french-museum-peeks-at-nureyevs-world.html?_r=0 | title=At a French Museum, Peeks at Nureyev’s World | work=New York Times | date=11 December 2013 | accessdate=16 December 2013 | author=Roslyn Sulcas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection has historical artifacts from Nureyev's career including film and photograph material, in addition to 70 costumes.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite news | author=Sarah Kaufman | title=Nureyev's Genius, Seen in Fragments of His Life. | work=The Washington Post (via HighBeam Research, subscription required) | publisher=Washingtonpost Newsweek Interactive | date=7 November 2012 | accessdate=16 December 2013 | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-33856062.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Nureyev sought a matador look, with a snug-fitting jacket cut short to lengthen his legs. The armhole seam had to be exactly placed so his movements would not be hindered. He favored details that underscored artistic themes. A silver-blue jacket for his Prince Siegfried from the first act of a 1984 ''[[Swan Lake]]'' echoes the watery locale where the hero meets his true love, with metallic threads flowing over the shoulders like rapids. For ''[[Don Quixote]],'' Nureyev preferred a billowing sleeve, as evidenced by a creation from Greek designer Nicholas Georgiadis in rust, wine and gold. The velvet cascades of the women's dresses, trimmed in coins and tassels, hint at the choreography's noisy fury.|Sarah Kaufman, The Washington Post&lt;ref name=Kaufman /&gt;}}

It was shown the [[De Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco, California]] through 17 February 2013 in a show entitled ''Rudolf Nureyev: A Life in Dance.''&lt;ref name=Kaufman /&gt;

===Stage costumes===
Several stage companies and theatres, including the [[Comédie Française]] and [[Paris Opera|National Opera in Paris]], send their costumes to the museum after their final show. At the museum they are available to be exhibited and preserved. They are also available to researchers and students for study.&lt;ref name="Vichy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vichy-spa-hotel.com/about-us/partners/centre-national-du-costume-de-scene | title=Centre National du Costume de Scene | publisher=Vichy Spa Hôtel Les Célestins | accessdate=16 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217021010/http://www.vichy-spa-hotel.com/about-us/partners/centre-national-du-costume-de-scene | archivedate=17 December 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkEMNk1Avfk | title=Centre national du Costume de Scène de Moulins (French) | publisher=Youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''Chamber theatre''' is a method of adapting literary works to the stage using a maximal amount of the work's original text and often minimal and suggestive settings. 

In chamber theater, [[narration]] is included in the performed text and the [[narrator]] might be played by multiple actors.  Professor Robert S. Breen (1909-1991) introduced "Chamber Theater" to his Oral Interpretation Classes at [[Northwestern University]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="O'Neill2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecily O'Neill|title=Dorothy Heathcote on Education and Drama: Essential Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqBeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63250-4|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Northwestern’s Professor of Performance Studies [[Frank Galati]], who studied chamber theater with Dr. Breen, has directed highly acclaimed chamber theater productions for the [[Goodman Theater]] and [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf Theater]] companies in Chicago. Galati’s chamber theater adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]’s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' won two [[Tony Awards]] on Broadway.&lt;ref name="Fisher2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Fisher|title=Historical Dictionary of Contemporary American Theater: 1930-2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6O5-spILIUC&amp;pg=PA286|date=1 June 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7950-8|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous and elaborate examples of chamber theatre is [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s ''[[The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (play)|The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby]]'', in which [[Charles Dickens]]' characters narrate themselves in [[Grammatical person|third person]].

'''Cremorne Gardens''' were popular [[pleasure gardens]] by the side of the [[River Thames]] in [[Chelsea, London]]. They lay between Chelsea Harbour and the end of the King's Road and flourished between 1845 and 1877; today only a vestige survives, on the river at the southern end of [[Cheyne Walk]]. Cremorne is also a ward of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 7,974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&amp;b=13688894&amp;c=Cremorne&amp;d=14&amp;e=62&amp;g=6331147&amp;i=1001x1003x1032x1004&amp;o=362&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1476542614333&amp;enc=1|title=Kensington and Chelsea Ward population 2011|accessdate=15 October 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics |work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally the property of [[Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon|the Earl of Huntingdon]] (c. 1750), father of [[Steele's Aspasia]], who built a mansion here, the property passed through various hands into those of [[Thomas Dawson, 1st Viscount Cremorne|The 1st Viscount Cremorne]] (1725–1813), an [[Irish people|Irish]] peer from [[County Monaghan]], who greatly beautified it.

The name [[Cremorne (barony)|Cremorne]] is the name of a [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]], an old administrative unit, in [[County Monaghan]] in [[Ireland]]. It is an Anglicisation of what in modern [[Irish language|Irish]] is ''Críoch Mhúrn''. This roughly translates as the 'Bounds of Mourne', from the territorial domain of an ancient clan or sept called Mughdorna in [[Old Irish]]. The name is cognate with the [[Mourne Mountains|Mountains of Mourne]].

The property was sold by the Dawson family, [[Earl of Dartrey|Barons Cremorne]], in 1831 to a Baron de Berenger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Hazelle|title=Who to Cremorne Would Not Gladly Repair?  A brief history of Cremorne Gardens, Chelsea|url=http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/cremorne.htm|website=London Park and Gardens Trust|publisher=London Parks &amp; Gardens Trust|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a convicted fraudster whose real name was Charles Random. de Berenger converted the site into a sports facility, called The Stadium, and became a proponent of self-defence techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baron Charles de Berenger’s “Defensive Gymnastics” (1838)|url=http://www.bartitsu.org/index.php/2010/05/baron-charles-de-berengers-defensive-gymnastics-1838/|website=The Bartitsu Society|publisher=The Bartitsu Society|accessdate=3 January 2016|date=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The business failed in 1843, but not before de Berenger had added some attractions of pleasure gardens of the time, including hosting a balloon ascent in 1838. For two years the gardens opened for summer, including an opening festival billed as "Pie de Nie" with Balloon ascent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cremorne House and Cremorne Gardens|journal=The Morning Post|date=June 19, 1845|issue=23222|pages=2|location=London, England|quote=Mr Littlejohn, late of the Rosherville Gardens ... has the honour to announce that he will open the Tavern, Park and Gardens of Cremorne for the season}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, were held, and the property was sold in 1845.  James Ellis took over the license in January 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SURREY SESSIONS|journal=Daily News|date=March 17, 1846|issue=48|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/galenet/sid|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve acre site was then developed by James Ellis into a proprietary place of entertainment and spectacle, being popular as such from 1845 to 1877. The Cremorne Gardens occupied a large site running between the Thames and the [[King's Road]]. Opened in 1845, they were noisy and colourful pleasure gardens featuring restaurants, entertainments, dancing and balloon ascents, and could be entered from the north gate on Kings Road or another by the Cremorne Pier on the river.

The famous artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] painted several nocturnes of Cremorne Gardens between 1872 and 1877.  He was a resident of Cheyne Walk, a mere few hundred yards from the Gardens. His painting Cremorne Gardens No 2 is full of fashionable and active figures and parallels to some extent the ‘modern life’ paintings of his French associates Manet and Tissot with whom he was in close contact during the early 1870s. Cremorne Gardens was doubtless a most attractive location, not only for its light displays but also for the brilliant array of fashionable people who gathered there. They provided the setting for Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Firewheel and Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Falling Rocket of c.1874, the latter resulting in the [[James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler#Ruskin_trial|Whistler versus Ruskin trial of 1878]].

Walter Greaves was the son of a Chelsea boat-builder who used to ferry Turner across the river; Walter and his brother Harry also performed the same service for Whistler, and in about 1863 became his unpaid studio assistants and pupils. They adored Whistler, accompanied him wherever he went, imitated his dress and manner, made the frames for his canvases, bought his materials and prepared his colours. Walter said; “He taught us to paint, and we taught him the waterman’s jerk”. Their close association lasted well into the 1890s, Whistler favouring Walter as he was the more gifted of the two brothers. Two of his most successful images were Regatta at Hammersmith Bridge and Chelsea under Snow; like Whistler he concentrated on areas around the Thames. He died in poverty, having been taken in by the Charterhouse.

Greaves chooses to depict Whistler near the Crystal Platform. A reporter in the Illustrated London News (30 May 1857) admired the structure’s “inclosing ironwork...enriched, by Defries and Son, with devices in emerald and garnet cut-glass drops, and semicircles of lustre and gas jets, which have a most brilliant effect.” The pavilion was about three hundred and sixty feet in circumference. It was encrusted with ornamental pillars, gas jets, and over forty plate-glass mirrors in black frames. In the upper portion of the pagoda (seen here), where the orchestra played, there were seventeen gas lit chandeliers.

This particular feature of the Gardens was clearly a favourite with Greaves as he chose to depict it on several occasions, for example The Dancing Platform, Cremorne Gardens (1870s) and in an etching of this period, which depicts the same view as Whistler in the Cremorne Gardens. In the former Whistler is depicted as the natty flaneur, striding along with and yet separate from the crowd. In the latter Whistler is seated but maintains the image of flaneur, the impartial, non-judgmental observer of contemporary life. He leans to one side to acknowledge a fellow dandy, much to the impatience of the young woman who stands at his table. Cremorne Gardens rapidly acquired a reputation as the territory of the demi-monde frequented by women of questionable morals. His associate could buy such a woman; this is implied by his indifference towards her, the attention of the passing woman as well as the undisguised stare of the gentleman at the railing.  
 
Whistler and the Greaves family were frequent visitors before the gardens closed in 1877.  Cremorne Gardens never acquired the fashionable fame of [[Vauxhall Gardens]], and finally became so great an annoyance to some of the more influential residents in the neighbourhood that a renewal of its licence was refused, and most of the site of the gardens was soon built over. The name survives in Cremorne Road.

[[Donald James Wheal]], in his first-person memoir of life in working-class [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]],  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099474166 World's End] gives a lively account of the almost-forgotten history and destruction of Cremorne Gardens.

==Today==
A vestige of the gardens survives next to the Thames, just east of [[Lots Road power station]]. It is largely paved over, and there is little to suggest the grand scale of the original gardens, though it still has two attached jetties, an echo of the landing stages where visitors to the original pleasure gardens would arrive by boat. Recently, one of the original grand iron gates from the gardens has been restored and stands on the current site {{coord|51.47983|N|0.17834|W|}}.
A [[Cremorne Gardens, Melbourne|Cremorne Gardens]] was also established in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].

On 13 September 2010 Thames Water published its preferred sites for building work on its [[Thames Tideway scheme|Thames Tideway]] super sewer.  Thames Water originally proposed that an access road cut straight through Cremorne Gardens. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195027/http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/pdf/Cremorne_Wharf_Foreshore.pdf]

Cremorne Gardens secured a Green Flag award for the first time in 2010 as one of the best green spaces in England.  Councillor [[Nicholas Paget-Brown]], Cabinet Member for Environment and Leisure Services, attended the flag raising ceremony at Cremorne Gardens at the end of July along with the Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor James Husband. [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:EOcHzNQ5WVAJ:www.rbkc.gov.uk/newsroom/idoc.ashx%3Fdocid%3Dbb421935-29cf-4f80-b90a-1f2448f8994e%26version%3D-1+by+election+cremorne+gardens+conservatives&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg0m7-2Svk-LrVVd5gyLdu4ozKFfw8ei5v9LSi-VhFLBK6ki814qhy8DFsqFPUk3HtdPyoaIKICOvJ2PGvcH4hrZoQGAS2VpNK67vQce5PI1VQ4ozgPP94iHb2_KjnA1Vht9hZz&amp;sig=AHIEtbR6lsCJXB4lwo8UdSW7PevDyUz6lQ]

Local Conservative Kensington and Chelsea Councillors and residents have promised to try to save the Gardens from use as an access road to build the Thames Tunnel. [http://kensington.londoninformer.co.uk/2011/01/residents-battle-to-save-garde.html].  Phil Stride representing Thames Water stated "We are happy to work with the council to use whatever access route they can help us find."  Early in 2011, the Lots Road Waste Centre owned by the Council ceased operation.  The former Waste Centre is closer to the proposed Tideway Tunnel, therefore is an alternative site for the access road.  However, Cremorne Gardens is still listed as the preferred site on the Thames Water website even though it is the Council's decision. [http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/corp/hs.xsl/10115.htm]

In 2014, Cremorne Gardens was again under threat from the local council which suggested to Transport For London that there be a "Chelsea West" station on Kings Road near World's End and on the site of the Cremorne Estate for Crossrail Two.  Cremorne Gardens would have been destroyed to use as the building site for the station.  After a huge outcry from residents, the council abandoned its support for Chelsea West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culbertson |first=Alix |url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/exclusive-crossrail-2-station-could-7333441 |title=Exclusive: Crossrail 2 station could destroy hundreds of homes built after Second World War |publisher=Getwestlondon.co.uk |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culbertson |first=Alix |url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/neighbours-fear-council-social-cleansing-7392583 |title=Neighbours fear council 'social cleansing' with Crossrail 2 plans |publisher=Getwestlondon.co.uk |date=2014-07-08 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The BBC drama ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' regularly depicted the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] meeting prostitutes in Cremorne Gardens.

In [[Strong Poison]], a [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] mystery, [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] named a character Cremorna Garden. Cremorna was an actress of dubious repute, no doubt so named after the garden's racy reputation.
In "Coral" by Compton Mackenzie (1925) in which Coral Avery, an upper-class girl, falls in love with her chauffeur, she gets him to drive down the Embankment to the Cremorne Arms at Chelsea reach, where they declare their love for each other.

'''De Wolfe Limited''' (Previously known as '''Music de Wolfe''', often referred to as '''De Wolfe Music''') is a British [[music production]] company, recognised as the originator of what has become known as [[library music]]. De Wolfe Music was established by Meyer de Wolfe in 1909 and began its recorded library in 1927 with the advent of '[[Talkies]]'.&lt;ref&gt;De Wolfe Music Compact Disk Catalogue, 1988, [[The Abrose Press]], 01-518 6638&lt;/ref&gt; 

Music from the library has been used in a number of well-known productions, including; ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Emmanuelle]]'', ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', '' [[EastEnders]]'', ''[[Kavanagh QC]]'', ''[[The Royle Family]]'', ''[[Spitting Image]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In recent years has been sampled by the likes of [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Lily Allen]], Peshay, [[Ja Rule]], [[Gorillaz]], [[Unkle]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]].

De Wolfe built and owns [[Angel Recording Studios]], a recording and mixing complex situated at The Angel, [[Islington, London]]. Artists who have recorded there in recent years include [[Adele]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Cee Lo Green]], [[Labrinth]], [[George Fenton]] (BAFTA and EMMY winner for his scores to the BBC's ''[[The Blue Planet]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''), [[Ian Brown]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], [[The Doves]], [[The Feeling]], and [[Kaiser Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelstudios.co.uk/news&lt;/ref&gt; Its specially composed department is called Inter Angel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interangel.co.uk/work/&lt;/ref&gt; De Wolfe is still a family-run company.

==History==

De Wolfe LTD was founded in London by Dutch musician Meyer de Wolfe in 1909. In early cinema the soundtrack to movies was provided by musicians playing live in the theatres. Meyer de Wolfe offered a [[sheet music]] library of original compositions to accompany [[silent films]], often produced in collaboration with other musicians from the orchestras of London. These collaborators included conductor [[Sir Landon Ronald]], violinist and conductor [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]], composers [[Giuseppe Becce]] and [[Ivor Novello]], and violinist Mantovani. 

By the late 1920's de Wolfe Music began recording with the 'sound-on-disc' technique and 'sound-on-film', on the 35mm [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]. This film was explosive if improperly stored, which proved to be the cause of an explosion in the basement of the company's [[Wardour Street]] office. Examples of compositions from this time include ''Keep Your Face To The Sunshine'' (1926), ''Odiele'', performed by Ivor Novello, from the film ''[[The Rat (1925 film)|The Rat]]'' (1925), and ''Policeman's Holiday'' (1931) by Montague Ewing. 

In the 1930's de Wolfe created soundtracks for [[newsreels]], working with [[Pathé News]], [[British Movietone News]], and [[Gaumont-British|British Gaumont Cinemas]]. This work continued throughout the Second World War and on in to the 1960's. The company was still providing music for film, including ''[[Fame Is the Spur (film)|Fame Is the Spur]]'' (with a soundtrack composed by [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] pilot [[John Wooldridge]]) and ''[[Edward, My Son]]'' (1948).

After the Second World War, de Wolfe expanded in to North America through a partnership with Corelli and Jacobs,  two film editors from Paramount Pictures. In 1955 the company provided the music for the first televised commercial in the U.K. for Gibbs Toothpaste.

In 1962 de Wolfe began distributing 10" vinyl records, with cover designs by Rolf Webster and [[Nick Bantock]]. These LPs are now widely sought after by record collectors. At this time de Wolfe provided the theme to ''[[The Power Game]]'' (earning de Wolfe and Wayne Hill an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Instrumental Composition of the Year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1960-1969/the-ivors-1967/|title=The Ivors 1967|author=DigitalMovement|date=2018|website=theivors.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a number of episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]''. 

In 1973 a Jack Trombey composition was used as the theme for the detective series ''[[Van Der Valk]]''. ''[[Eye Level]]'' became a million-selling number one single, topping the U.K charts for six weeks. Around this time de Wolfe music could be heard in Kung Fu movies by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brother's]], British Comedies ''[[Zeta One]]'' and ''[[Adventures of a Taxi Driver]]'', and the [[Monty Python]] films. The 1970's was a period of further expansion for the company, with the addition of the Rouge catalogue in 1975 and the establishing of Angel Recording Studios in 1979.

Digital technology bought changes to the music industry in the 1980's, particularly with the evolution of CDs. In 1985 de Wolfe launched its DWCD collection of 6 CDs, becoming the world's first digital production music library. De Wolfe ultimately ended the production of its vinyl series in 1988, and the end of the production of CDs would come in 2014 as de Wolfe shifted focus to online delivery.

De Wolfe LTD celebrated its centenary year in 2009, with the company at that time boasting offices and agents in 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dewolfemusic.com/page/nitrate_to_bitrate|title=Nitrate to Bitrate|author=de Wolfe Music|date=27 April 2015|website=dewolfemusic.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Derek_&amp;_Clive.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Dudley Moore]] (left) and [[Peter Cook]] as Derek and Clive]]  --&gt;
'''Derek and Clive''' was a [[double act]] of comedic characters created by [[Dudley Moore]] (Derek) and [[Peter Cook]] (Clive) in the 1970s. The performances were captured on the records ''[[Derek and Clive (Live)]]'' (1976), ''[[Derek and Clive Come Again]]'' (1977), and ''[[Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam]]'' (1978), as well as in a film documentary, ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/the-view-from-here/peter-cook-and-dudley-moores-derek-and-clive-albums-reassessed-70954|title=Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's Derek and Clive albums reassessed... - Uncut|date=2015-09-28|work=Uncut|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[greatest hits album]] containing some previously unreleased material, called ''[[Rude &amp; Rare: The Best of Derek and Clive]]'', was released in 2011. The characters are foul-mouthed extensions of the earlier characters [[Pete and Dud]].

Considered highly offensive by many at the time, the sketches primarily took the form of bizarre, sometime drunken streams of consciousness led by Cook, with interjections from Moore. Memorable moments from the records include Clive claiming that the worst job he ever had was retrieving [[lobster]]s from [[Jayne Mansfield]]'s arsehole, Derek claiming his worst job was cleaning up [[Winston Churchill]]'s bogeys (leading the pair to conclude that the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' was one such bogey), Clive claiming that he was sexually aroused by the sight of a deceased [[Pope]] lying in state, and a horse-racing 'commentary' featuring horses named after sexual organs or their vulgarised derivatives.

Though the recordings were far too crude for a mainstream audience, Derek and Clive [[bootleg recording]]s circulated. They were mostly unscripted dialogues incorporating copious swearing - including frequent use of the word "[[cunt]]".

==Characters==
The characters, supposedly two [[Public toilet|lavatory]] attendants (although in one sketch, 'Back of the Cab', they play the roles of two London taxi drivers) first surfaced in the mid-1970s.

==Development of the show==
Cook and Moore were performing on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] with their revue show ''Good Evening'', a live version of their television series ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. The relationship between the two men had become strained as a result of Cook's worsening [[alcoholism]]. To reassure Moore, Cook hired a recording studio in New York, where the two could simply relax, drink and ad-lib. The resulting recording was padded out with live performances of old favourites, such as "Bo Duddley" and began to circulate as ''Derek and Clive (Live)''.

Cook became bemused at the idea that they should not be making money from the increasing popularity of Derek and Clive, and suggested to Moore that the recording should be released officially. By this point, Moore had embarked on a successful [[Hollywood]] film career and found the tapes embarrassing, until he too realised his contemporaries were fans.

Two more records were made. They were less like dialogues and more like vindictive attacks on the increasingly successful Moore by Cook, whose career had stalled somewhat in comparison. One such merciless assault was in a [[cancer]] themed diatribe when Cook was fully aware that Moore had recently lost his father to the disease. The same love-hate relationship between them is evident in the ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]'' movie.

It is often mistakenly assumed that all of their releases were recorded while under the influence of alcohol. While this can be presumed of "Come Again" - where the sounds of bottles can be heard in the background, featuring some tracks where both Cook and Moore are slurring their words - the home video release of ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]'' shows a very sober looking Cook and Moore drinking [[coffee]] and [[water]] throughout. During the filming, a prank was played upon Cook and Moore by [[Richard Branson]] where '[[police]]' arrive and suspiciously sniff the contents of an ash tray to the dismay of the unnerved and wary pair.

Later CD releases of ''Come Again'' and ''Ad Nauseam'' featured out-takes, most were recorded during the ''Ad Nauseam'' sessions. Surreal at times, these included "Mother" - featured on ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]'' - where Cook pretends to visit his over-possessive and deranged mother, ending with Cook telling his mother to "shut your fucking face and die". "Valerie's Hymen," where Moore discussed cutting out his wife's hymen with a carving knife, and "Lady Vera Fart Teller", wherein Moore elaborates on a visit to a fortune teller who could tell his future by examining his [[fart]]s.

Transcripts of further, unreleased, out takes are available in a book titled ''Come Again'', edited by William Cook and feature "General [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]", where Cook reflects on the perils of counting the late General's dandruff flakes; "Vietnam", where Moore received a paper cut inflicted by the [[Viet Cong]] (in one insightful remark Cook mentions a "friend" of his who fought in [[Vietnam]] but he's not sure "on which side"), and "A Million Pounds", where Cook plays an hysterical woman trying to obtain a million pounds from a sympathetic Moore. The remaining unreleased out-takes are variations on actual releases.

Tracks from ''Derek and Clive (Live)'', specifically the Bo Duddley sketch, were sampled on one of the first UK [[house music]] tracks, 1988's "[[Voodoo Ray]]" by [[A Guy Called Gerald]].

'''''Every Little Step''''' is a 2008 American [[documentary film]] produced and directed by James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo. It follows the process of casting the 2006 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=402597 ''A Chorus Line'' at the Internet Broadway Database]&lt;/ref&gt; and explores the history of the award-winning [[musical theatre|musical]], beginning with the informal interviews with Broadway dancers conducted by [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] that served as its basis. Their personal observations and feelings were captured on [[audiotape]], many of which are heard in this film.

3,000 dancers arrived to audition for the revival on the first day.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20081017a2.html ''The Japan Times'', October 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their stories are interwoven with recollections of members of the original cast, including [[Donna McKechnie]] and [[Baayork Lee]]; composer [[Marvin Hamlisch]]; and [[Bob Avian]], who co-choreographed the original 1975 production and directed the 2006 revival

The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/MUST_WATCH_Every_Little_StepA_Chorus_Line_Documentary_Trailer_Donna_McKechnie_20080908 BroadwayWorld.com, September 8, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and went into theatrical release with the title ''Broadway Broadway'' in [[Japan]] the following month.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes /&gt; It was shown at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Thessaloniki Documentary Festival]], and the [[Sarasota Film Festival]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article983905.ece ''St. Petersburg Times'', March 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; before going into limited release in the US on April 17, 2009.

==Critical reception==
Kaori Shoji of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' said the film "plays off the echo effect of [its] premise with skill, grace and heartfelt sympathy; it's clearly the work of people who love dancers, whether they're grinning in the spotlight or fighting back tears after a failed tryout . . . [W]hat surfaces in the film is the fierce dedication [dancers] have to their craft and the sense that they're here singing and performing their guts out in front of choreographers and producers because there's no other place on Earth they'd rather be."&lt;ref name=JapanTimes /&gt;

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed, "There is a superficial resemblance between ''Every Little Step'' (and, for that matter, ''A Chorus Line'' itself) and [[Reality television|television reality shows]] in which ordinary people use their talents to scramble for the spotlight. But those programs are spectacles of amateurism chasing after celebrity, an impulse that could not be further from what Mr. Stern and Mr. Del Deo, taking their cues from Mr. Bennett, set out to honor. The 17 members of that chorus line — and the thousands like them, including those who dream of playing them — are professionals, and one of the names they give to the glory they seek is work. The other is love."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/movies/17step.html ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film "doesn't do anything unexpected, and it doesn't have to . . . it's a can't-miss effort that knows how to please."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-littlestep17-2009apr17,0,4361220.story ''Los Angeles Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' rated the film 1½ out of four stars and called it a "sloppily directed" film that "assumes you know everything going in, which makes it more a souvenir scrapbook than a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/04172009/entertainment/movies/same_old_song_and_dance_164758.htm ''New York Post'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and described it as "a thrilling combination of documentary and musical dazzler" and "a heartbreaker."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/21799142/review/27538108/every_little_step ''Rolling Stone'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the film A, calling it "a movie as layered and as enthralling as its subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20272253,00.html ''Entertainment Weekly'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|article|date=December 2008}}
'''''Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live''''' is a 2004 [[memoir]] by former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured player [[Jay Mohr]]. In it, Mohr recounts, among other things, his battles with panic attacks, being intimidated by castmates [[Rob Schneider]] and [[Ellen Cleghorne]], his conflicts with [[Al Franken]], his admiration for deceased castmates [[Chris Farley]] and [[Phil Hartman]], the admission that he stole material from actor/comedian [[Rick Shapiro]], and being depressed about his lack of sketch appearances.

''SNL'' castmember [[Bobby Moynihan]] has said that it was one of his favorite SNL related books, calling it "a handbook on what NOT to do at SNL."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/02/26/snl_s_bobby_moynihan_discusses_working_w?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''[[Booklist]]'' called it "Good insider dish": "Mohr chronicles those years with the sly wit he's become known for, as well as nostalgia for both the time he had and the kid he was. That's not to say things went well. He barely got any sketches on air, his dressing room was once an elevator shaft, and he suffered panic attacks so severe he thought he would die on camera. But he also met some encouraging people ([[Michael McKean|Mike McKeon]]) [''sic''] and was able to spend a little time hanging out with various luminaries ([[Eric Clapton]]), so even though he moans and whines about what he endured on the show, he ends up describing the experience as glorious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cooper |first= Ilene |title= Mohr, Jay. Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live |journal= [[Booklist]] |volume= 100 |issue= 19-20 |date= June 1, 2004 |page= 1684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', on the other hand, found "this stilted but honest memoir" to serve only "mostly superficial dish": "Few of his sketches aired, and aside from his impressions of [[Ricki Lake]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Dick Vitale]], he was rarely on camera. (When he was on air, he admits, he often couldn't keep a straight face.) Mohr treats readers to some affectionate, entertaining tales of the late [[Chris Farley]], but his book is less a juicy inside story of the comedy institution than a tale of an immature young man's struggle with a high-stress, erratic workplace: 'The schedule for putting together Saturday Night Live was made back in the seventies when everyone was on coke.... Problem was, no one did coke [anymore] and we were expected to keep the same hours.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live  |journal= [[Publishers Weekly]] |volume= 251 |issue= 17 |date= Apr 26, 2004 |page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, "Mohr is unafraid to come off as nervous and a little grating: the whole first season he's just the new guy nobody will look in the eye, whose ideas get shot down, who's always asking dumb questions and almost never gets on the air. Though tinged with bitterness (after two seasons, Mohr was basically known only for his Christopher Walken impersonation), this account is generous in its praise for people like [[Phil Hartman]], Chris Farley, and Michael McKean. Profiles of other costars--like [[David Spade]], who "was only on the show so he could sleep with models"—are just dishy enough to leave the reader wanting more. 
Despite stiff prose, an engagingly honest look at the crossroads of comedy and dysfunction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Mohr, Jay Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live  |journal= [[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume= 72 |issue= 8 |date= Apr 15, 2004 |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kliatt'' gave the Audiobook, read by Mohr, an A: "Mohr's experiences make one wonder how the show ever gets on the air. He dishes unflattering portraits of some of the cast and some guest hosts while speaking most fondly of Phil Hartman and Chris Farley. He does not shy from revealing his warts as well. For fans of SNL. Raw language... Recommended for advanced students and adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last= Moxley |first= Melody |title= Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live |journal= Kliatt |volume= 39 |issue= 5 |date= Sep 2005 |page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good People in Love''' is a 5-part dramatic [[mini series]] from [[Tina Cesa Ward]]. A dinner party to celebrate an engagement turns into a night of manipulation, dissection and revelation when the story’s narrators, Scott ([[Jesse Wakeman]]) and Sarah ([[Rachael Hip-Flores]]) set out to prove their distinct points of view on love using the party’s two couples as unwitting examples opening up a pandora’s box of trouble for everyone.

[[Image:St Louis zoo crocodiles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectacled Caiman]]s (''Caiman crocodilus'') at the Herpetarium in [[Saint Louis Zoological Park]].]]
A '''herpetarium''' is a [[zoo]]logical exhibition space for [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, most commonly a dedicated area of a larger zoo. A herpetarium which specializes in [[snake]]s is an '''ophidiarium''' or '''serpentarium''', which are more common as stand-alone entities. Many serpentariums milk snakes for [[venom]] for medical and scientific research.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Notable herpetariums==
*[[Alice Springs Reptile Centre]] in Alice Springs, Australia
*[[Chennai Snake Park Trust]] in Chennai, India
*[[Clyde Peeling's Reptiland]] in Allenwood, Pennsylvania
*[[Kentucky Reptile Zoo]] in Slade, Kentucky
*[[Los Angeles Zoo#The LAIR|The LAIR at the Los Angeles Zoo]] in Los Angeles, California
*[[Serpent Safari]] in Gurnee, Illinois

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7483">The '''International Amateur Theatre Association''' (AITA/IATA asbl&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aitaiata.org/&lt;/ref&gt;) is a worldwide non-governmental organisation of national centres, amateur theatres and individuals dedicated to promoting understanding and education through amateur theatre. Founded in [[Belgium]] in 1952, its members operate in more than 80 countries on 5 continents, making AITA/IATA the powerful voice of the global amateur theatre community. The current President is Mr Rob Van Genechten from Belgium (Flanders) and the organisation’s Secretariat is in [[London, England]].

==Goals==
Under its banner of universal understanding and education through theatre, AITA/IATA promotes cross-frontier cooperation, artistic enrichment, and a sense of universal togetherness.

The organisation is associated with [[UNESCO]] and fulfils a facilitating, networking and initiating role for member countries and cultural groupings.

==Governance==
'''Governing bodies'''
Every other year AITA/IATA has a General Assembly and Forum (formerly Congress) where its members come together to hold the Council of AITA/IATA to account for the running of the organisation.

'''General Assembly'''
The General Assembly (GA) is the highest decision-making body. It is held every two years and every other General Assembly is held in [[Monaco]].

'''International Theatre Festival'''
Alongside the GA, an  International Theatre Festival is held where amateur theatre groups selected by that country's AITA/IATA National Centre come together to perform, to attend workshops and discussions and to exchange theatre experiences. In 2015, it was held in the village of Westouter, some 10&amp;nbsp;km from Ypres, and was part of the Spots op West 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spotsopwest.org/en/festival-2015&lt;/ref&gt; Festival.

The Standing Committee (SCCY), exists to ensure that issues relating to children and youth are central to the concerns of AITA/IATA. A World Festival of Children’s Theatre is held in Lingen every four years and elsewhere in the world between every Lingen Festival and the Standing Committee offers an advisory and supportive role for the preparation of each festival. AITA/IATA works in close cooperation with other world theatre organisations such as [[ASSITEJ]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assitej-international.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People), ITI&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iti-worldwide.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[International Theatre Institute]]), IDEA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea-org.net/en/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[International Drama in Education Association]]), and other organisations such as [[EDERED]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edered.org/&lt;/ref&gt; European Drama Encounters.

'''Members'''
A member (an AITA/IATA National Centre) is an organisation that co-ordinates or networks amateur theatre groups and or individuals in their country and it is they with whom AITA/IATA predominantly communicates. An Affiliate is an organisation that over a two or four year period is working towards National Centre status. Each country has only one National Centre or Affiliate. 

'''Associates'''
An Associate is an organisation, group, individual, or festival, interested in amateur theatre. An Associate pays a subscription to AITA/IATA (less than Membership) which enables them to be linked into the AITA/IATA network of international amateur theatre.

'''World Festival of Children's Theatre'''
The first AITA/IATA World Festival of Children's Theatre was held in Lingen (Ems), Germany in 1991. It usually occurs every two years and every other Festival is held in Lingen. Non-Lingen Festivals have been held in [[Toyama, Japan]], 2000; [[Havana, Cuba]] 2004; [[Moscow, Russia]] 2008. The last Lingen Festival was in 2014 and the next World Festival of Children's Theatre will be in 2016 in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada. The City of Lingen will again organize the event in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://worldfestivalofchildrenstheatre.com/#&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congress "Drama in Education"'''
The AITA/IATA Drama in Education Congress was held for the first time in Austria in 1974 and has been held every two years since. Until the early 90s was probably the only regular international conference on "drama in education." The last one was held in April 2015.

'''50th Anniversary'''
In 2002, AITA/IATA published a 50th Anniversary booklet in English, French and Spanish which is a reflection on the growth and development of AITA/IATA up to that date. A copy is on the AITA/IATA website under Resources / Key Documents.

Having won a gold medal at the [[International Festival of Circus Arts]] in France, it is believed that he created the current style of kicking the bowls (Facing opposite directions). He is also credited with creating the [[incredible teapot]] finale to the act, which few others have been able to imitate due to its difficulty. He moved to the United States in 1999 and currently resides in [[Pasadena, California]].

The main focus of the story in the main campaign revolves around the life of the youngest child of Baron Lahnstein who on return to his lands finds that the family castle&lt;ref name="gamepedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legendsofeisenwald.gamepedia.com/Lahnstein_Castle |title=Lahnstein Castle |work=[[Gamepedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is impossible to enter. There are two separate single scenarios: The Masquerade and Cursed Castle that are separate stories happening in other locations of Eisenwald.

The gameplay is divided into two main parts: global map interactions including completing quests, buying and selling armor, weapons, potions and other equipment and items, equipping the army, managing castles, and other possessions, and finally the battles themselves.

Battles consist of confrontations between a hero's squad (which can take up to eleven other troops) and an enemy squad. At the end of the battle, the winning side receives experience points. All units receive XP proportionally to their contribution in the battle. If sufficient XP is accumulated by a unit, it may then upgrade to another, determined by its upgrade tree if any. Upgrade of the units is free and even if a unit is not upgraded right away, its extra upgrade points are saved for later.

At the beginning of a campaign, the player may select his or her class (Knight, Baroness, or a Mystic). Each class has its own advantages. For example, a knight can learn to ride a horse, a baroness can use both bows and crossbows, and a mage can learn mass spells. Unlike regular units, heroes don't change their look when they upgrade, they can learn new skills.

Hero skill trees are divided into three parts: combat, feudal and command. Combat skills are unique for each class whereas feudal and command skills are shared among the three heroes.

The game features many different units including soldiers, spearmen, nobles, pikemen, priests, monks, healers, witches and more that have different parameters and skills.

The following is a '''list of top-tier sports competitions arranged by country'''.

All professional sports leagues for which a country has at least one team that competes in it will be listed under that country. As such, many sports leagues will be listed under multiple countries. Leagues listed under 'World' or 'Europe' generally feature competitors that come from various countries, with each season possibly featuring different competitors and different countries, which makes them harder to define in terms of which countries they should be listed under.

'''''Love is in the Bin''''' is a 2018 [[art intervention]] by [[Banksy]] at [[Sotheby's]] London, with an unexpected [[self-destruct]]ion of his 2006 painting of ''[[Girl with Balloon]]'' immediately after it was sold at auction for a record £1,042,000. According to Sotheby's, it is "the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latest Banksy Artwork 'Love is in the Bin' Created Live at Auction |url=https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/latest-banksy-artwork-love-is-in-the-bin-created-live-at-auction |website=Sotheby's Inc. |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original work==
The painting is an adaptation of Banksy's 2002 mural ''[[Girl with Balloon]]'', rare as a unique work rather than a print. It was given by him to a friend shortly after the "[[Barely Legal (Banksy)|Barely Legal]]" exhibition in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/contemporary-art-evening-auction-l18024/lot.67.html|title=Contemporary Art Evening Auction – Banksy – Girl with Balloon|last=|first=|date=5 October 2018|website=Sotheby's|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy has said he prepared the self-destruct mechanism at this time in case the work was ever put up for auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BomXijJhArX/|title="The urge to destroy is also a creative urge" – Picasso|last=Banksy|first=|date=6 October 2018|website=Instagram|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auction and self-destruction==
[[Sotheby's]] London sold the painting at auction on 5 October 2018, at an artist-record price of £1,042,000.&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-appears-just-got-banksy-144105925.html |title='It Appears We Just Got Banksy-ed.' Art Piece Self Destructs After Being Sold for Over $1 Million |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |agency=[[Yahoo! News]] |author=Gina Martinez |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within seconds of the gavel drop, the canvas began sliding out of the bottom of the frame and [[paper shredder|shredding]] itself to the audible sound of a siren and the surprise exclamations of attendees. The work was housed in a deep frame and was plugged in to facilitate built-in electrical lights,{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in any source listed and no plug is visible on the video of the incident|date=October 2018}} which powered the hidden paper shredder as well. Sotheby's said they had no foreknowledge of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=busby/&gt; 

After the shredding, there was a negotiation with the buyer to confirm the sale, and on 11 October it was agreed that the sale would go through at the original price. The work was renamed by Banksy's representatives from ''[[Girl with Balloon]]'' to ''Love is in the Bin''. Market watchers speculated that the self-destruction would increase the artwork's value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/banksy-renames-shredded-painting-love-is-in-the-bin-as-work-sells-to-winning-bidder-after-a-week-of-negotiation|title=Banksy renames shredded painting Love Is In the Bin as work sells to winning bidder after a week of negotiation|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotheby's released a statement that called it "the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction".&lt;ref name=busby&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/11/woman-who-bought-shredded-banksy-artwork-will-go-through-with-sale |title=Woman who bought shredded Banksy artwork will go through with purchase |first=Mattha|last= Busby|date=11 October 2018|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.artnet.com/market/banksy-re-authenticates-shredded-1-4-million-european-buyer-will-keep-1369852 |title=Banksy Authenticates and Renames His Shredded $1.4 Million Painting—Which the Buyer Plans to Keep|first=Eileen|last= Kinsella|date=11 October 2018 |work=artnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that the artist uploaded a video of the event onto Instagram, showing the construction of the shredding mechanism and frame, but deleted the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-45829853|title=Woman to keep shredded £1m Banksy|date=11 October 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=13 October 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely, showing the painting being shredded with the words: "In rehearsals it worked every time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/18/banksy-video-girl-with-balloon-shred-entire-artwork |title=Banksy video shows plan to shred entire Girl With Balloon artwork  |date=18 October 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/banksy-video-girl-with-balloon/index.html |title=Banksy suggests self-destruct stunt didn't go as planned |date=18 October 2018 |work=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speculations ==
It has been speculated that a man seen filming the shredding was Banksy or someone connected to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/who-is-mystery-man-who-films-at-banksy-auction-11519745 |title=Who's the mystery man who films at Banksy prank auction? |work=Sky News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/banksys-girl-with-balloon-renamed-love-is-in-bin/index.html |title=Banksy's 'Girl with Balloon' sale is confirmed – and it's got a new name |date= 11 October 2018|work=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the auction, Josh Gilbert, an artist and blacksmith, noted what he thought were a number of inconsistencies with the work shredding itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/wtf/according-to-this-fan-theory-banksy-shredding-iconic-painting-might-actually-be-a-huge-prank-354660.html|title=According To This Fan Theory, Banksy Shredding Iconic Painting Might Actually Be A Huge Prank|work=indiatimes.com|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project includes four tracks – including the single "[[XO Tour Llif3]]" which was included later on ''Luv Is Rage 2'' – and features production from Derelle Rideout, DJ Plugg, DP Beats, JW Lucas and [[TM88]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-luv-is-rage-15-tracklist-album-art-lyrics|title=Luv Is Rage 1.5 (Tracklist + Album Art)|publisher=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-uzi-vert-luv-is-rage-15-new-mixtape.116904.html|title=Lil Uzi Vert - Luv Is Rage 1.5 (New Mixtape)|publisher=[[HotNewHipHop]]|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The four-track project was uploaded exclusively to Lil Uzi Vert's [[SoundCloud]] account, with the intention of generating excitement for his following release, ''Luv Is Rage 2''. The EP quickly amassed millions of plays despite not having a commercial release. Most notably the song "XO Tour Llif3" gained significant online attention, resulting in its commercial release as a single.

==Singles==
On March 24, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released a remastered version of "[[XO Tour Llif3]]" as a single, which peaked at number 7 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/7340914/Lil+Uzi+Vert/chart?f=379|title=Lil Uzi Vert - Chart history|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media reform''' refers to proposed attempts to reform [[mass media]] towards an agenda which is more in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate, government or political biases. Media reform advocates also place a strong emphasis upon enabling those who are [[marginalized]] or semi-marginalized by their individual incomes, immutable characteristics or desperate conditions to possess access to means of publication and dissemination of information. They do not come from a concern with policy, or with a desire to democratize federal bureaucracies and regulations.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

A related concept, '''media justice''', refers to an analytical framework and a regional, grassroots movement led by historically disenfranchised communities to transform media and cultural production, rights and policy in the service of [[social justice]]. The Media Justice Framework offers a new way to understand and redistribute media power to achieve a fair and accessible information and cultural apparatus that fulfils its promise to inform the public, watchdog power, and serve all segments of the public equally.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Movement for Media Justice believes that media production and distribution must be under the control of communities, not companies; and that achieving social justice victories requires a secondary strategy for media policy change.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== History ==

Media reform movement coincides with [[media democracy]] as a concept and is interlinked with the [[agenda setting theory]]. In 1922, in his book, ''[[Public Opinion]]'', [[Walter Lippmann]] argued that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. He stated that the media has an ability to influence the thoughts and opinions of the members of public consuming the content. He did not use the term "agenda setting", but scholars have come to agree that was the core concept.&lt;ref&gt;Lippmann, W (1922). Public opinion. New York: Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the media reform movement there is the traditional media reform movement which has its roots in the broadcasting and freedom of press movements and has been linked with the feminist movement as well as racial and gender justice.{{cn|date=October 2018}} However, mainstream media reform groups have so far steered clear from acknowledging media reform’s roots in content work, including the legal victory by the United Church of Christ that forced changes in hiring and reporting practices in Mississippi television journalism.{{cn|date=October 2018}} This is said to be done in order to maintain the support of conservative patrons and to downplay the importance of more controversial critical junctures that have shaped the way media reform movement is today.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

It has also been affected by federal policy advocacy, whereby media outlets and governments alter their broadcasting practices to attract powerful allies and making their agenda the national public agenda. Funders provide financial support that support the media outlets and drives business.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The traditional media reform movement has however undergone some significant changes with the rise of [[citizen journalism]], whereby citizens play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, S. and Willis, C. "We Media: How Audiences are Shaping the Future of News and Information." 2003, The Media Center at the American Press Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern media reform movement relies heavily on the Internet and the numerous social networking tools it offers and the Internet coupled with citizen curated content has led to a decrease in the popularity of traditional media networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Leary|first= D.|year=2009|title=Decline of Traditional Media|url=http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/decline_of_traditional_media|publisher=mercatornet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==

The Canadian media reform movement has its roots in the 1930s, Canadian Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom. Highlighting the threats of cultural Americanisation and excessive commercialism, and calling for universal radio service that would not be viable through market forces alone, the Canadian Radio League assembled a blue-ribbon coalition to persuade a Conservative government to create the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hackett|first=R.|year=2014|title=Media Democratisation in Canada: A Movement Comes Into Its Own|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/media_democratisation_in_canada_a_movement_comes_into_its_own|publisher=newleftproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable sites and advocates of the movement in Canada include thetyee.ca, the Media Co-op, Media Democracy Days, OpenMedia.ca, the Aboriginal Peoples Television and print outlets such as [[Canadian Dimension]].

Launched in 2001 and originating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Media Democracy Days are organized around the country with the aim of knowing, being and changing the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediademocracyproject.ca/|title=The Media Democracy Project|work=Media Democracy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage citizen journalism and expect netizens to take responsibility for bringing the change they wish to see in media. It is part of the Media Democracy Project that aims to create a significant presence for noncommercial media in Canada.

OpenMedia.ca was created in 2007 to celebrate two of the world’s foremost critics of media propaganda, Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky, and since then it has managed to earn national resonance and policy impact. It is by far the leader in the Media Reform movement in Canada.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The movement's focus in Canada has been predominantly on the not for profit sector. There is overwhelming recognition of the importance of the Internet in NGO work, and unanimous endorsement of the principle of [[net neutrality]] as a regulatory underpinning for equitable and affordable access to the Internet. Trade unions and independent media, arts and culture groups, particularly those representing media and cultural workers, are core advocates for democratic communications. Other groups, especially those concerned with human rights, are also supportive.

In a 2010 survey by Open Media, Canadian mainstream media’s democratic performance has been rated as poor or very poor by Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hackett|first1=Robert A.|last2=Anderson|first2=S.|year=2010|title=Revitalizing a Media Reform Movement in Canada|url=https://openmedia.ca/sites/openmedia.ca/files/SSRC%20Report(2).pdf|format=PDf|publisher=openmedia.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many NGOs report positive relationships with particular media, NGOs appear to have a more favorable view of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and of independent media, which relies heavily on citizen journalism and has led to the rise of blogger culture.&lt;ref&gt;Geert, L. 2007. "''Zero Comments: Blogging and Critical Internet Culture''." Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; An overwhelming majority of NGOs agree that the quality and diversity of Canadian journalism affects their organization’s work. There is an encouraging culture of collaboration amongst NGOs in the sectors surveyed. Values such as openness, accessibility, participation, choice, diversity and innovation may resonate well with NGOs in Canada. Media reform organizations should consider some kind of expansive institutional structure, such as an association or network that can facilitate communication and engagement with a broad and diverse array of organizations.

== Future ==
Media reform movement is a positive step towards a netizen curated web and has given rise to citizen journalism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Communications guru [[Frank Luntz]] has claimed that "A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth. I have seen how effective language attached to policies that are mainstream and delivered by people who are passionate and effective can change the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, Makani T. Mainstreams and Margins: A Critical Look at the Media Reform "Story". 2009. The Praxis Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Statements such as the ones by Mr. Luntz, encourage people and provide hope that we can be part of a fair and democratic media system. One that not only reports what the public wants but also tells the truth and does not use agenda setting theory for mere popularity.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:FRIDAY DIVERSETEASE.jpg|thumb|Millie Dollar at Hebden Bridge Burlesque Festival 2016]]
Millie Dollar was born in Toxteth, Liverpool in 1985.

The character of Millie Dollar was created in 2005, and took to the stage in 2006, starting out in Korova Bar in Liverpool where she gained immediate residency.

Millie created the Martini Lounge, a Liverpool-based burlesque and variety show in 2007, which ran first at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], before moving into [[St George's Hall, Liverpool]], and the [[Epstein Theatre]].

She married [[Edd Muir]] in 2015, a fellow cabaret performer, taking on his surname of Muir becoming Harriet Muir.

== History ==
Millie Dollar stepped onstage for the first time at Strip Club, a monthly night at Korova Bar Liverpool, just as burlesque was starting to become known in the UK. She went on to perform here until its end in 2008. She also became a regular at The Go-Go Cage at The Magnet Liverpool, and returned to this stage in 2016 for its tenth birthday.

By 2008 Millie was travelling overseas to perform, becoming a regular act in Paris, Milan, and Geneva. She also joined the cast of The Leg Show at [[Ink and Iron]] in Los Angeles.

After her time in Los Angeles she reworked her performance style, bringing back bump and grind and adding a new level of raunchiness to her stage acts.

In 2014 she also added fire performing, and whip cracking skills into her repartee and is always evolving and learning as her career progresses.

She is well known for being a performer with hearing loss, wearing hearing aids on and offstage since 2015, as a child Millie had three operations to gain her hearing, one in the UK, and two in Australia.

== Producing ==
Millie Dollar started producing in 2006 with a weekly Burlesque show at [[Heebie Jeebies Liverpool]] called [[The Girl Can't Help It]] which hosted many up and coming acts of the time such as [[Diva hollywood]] and [[Anna Fur Laxis]].

In 2007 she created a bi-monthly Burlesque and Variety show called The Martini Lounge. starting out in The Royal Court downstairs bar that was also used for [[Rawhide comedy]] club. This ran there until 2010, when the show moved into the Concert Room of [[St George's Hall, Liverpool]]. The first show there featured [[Missy Malone]], [[Dirty Martini (burlesque)]], [[Kitten Deville]] amongst its star-studded cast.

It ran from then up until 2015 alternating with the [[Epstein Theatre]], before taking a hiatus. There have been one-off events produced by the Martini Lounge for [[Liverpool Pride]], [[DaDaFest]], amongst various others.

Millie now runs a monthly Burlesque night at [[Blind Tiger Liverpool]] on the last Friday of every month, she has also mentioned plans to bring the Martini Lounge back to Liverpool.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">'''Museum of Children's Theaters''' ({{lang-ru|Музей детских театров}}) is a former museum in [[Moscow]], which existed from 1981 to 2003. Its exhibits were associated with the history of Russian [[young Spectator's Theatre]]. Since 2008, it has been opened as a department of children's and puppet theaters of the A.A. Bakhrushin State Central Theater Museum.&lt;ref name="gctm"&gt;[http://www.gctm.ru/collection/otdel-fondov-detskih-i-kukolnyih-teatrov/ Отдел фондов детских и кукольных театров] // Государственный центральный театральный музей имени А. А. Бахрушина&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Museum of young Spectator's Theatre was opened in 1981 at 12 Soviet Army Street, Moscow. By the beginning of the 2000s, the museum had over 32,000 items in storage. Its main exhibition was associated with the names of leading Russian theater figures, and it reflected the diversity of children's theaters in Russia.&lt;ref name="РМЭ"&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = Детских театров музей| chapter-url = | format = | url =  | title = Российская музейная энциклопедия | orig-year = | agency = Гл. ред.

In the museum funds, there were works of theatrical-decorative and decorative-applied art, theater dolls, costumes, and posters. Among the exhibits were memorials to and archives of cultural figures associated with the children's theater, such as [[Robert Falk]], [[Michael Chekhov]], [[Samuil Marshak]], [[Natalya Sats]], [[Sergey Obraztsov]], and V. A. Sperantova. Of particular value was the collection of puppet theaters of the 1910s and 1930s, which included puppets and finger puppets of Moscow artists Efimov, as well as puppets of the St. Petersburg theater under the leadership of E. Demmeni. There were also materials on the activities of children's theaters in the [[Gulag]] system, such as sketches, dolls, letters, and memoirs.&lt;ref name="РМЭ"/&gt;

In 2003, the Museum of Children's Theaters was closed, and its exhibits were transferred to the A.A. Bakhrushin State Central Theater Museum. In 2008, based on the materials of the Museum of Children's Theaters, the Department of Children's and Puppet Theater Funds was opened. The fund of the department consists of five collections: decorative-visual materials; memorial-clothing; photo-film-phonodocuments; written sources; and posters and programs.&lt;ref name="gctm"/&gt;

The '''Naked Women's Wrestling League''', also known as '''NWWL''', is a defunct [[erotic]] [[women's professional wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] which featured naked females battling in the ring. [[Carmen Electra]] acted as hostess for the organization until 2007, when she sued the company for breach of contract. The NWWL broadcast shows around the world, and its wrestlers were featured in magazines such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.

==History==
Before creating the Naked Women's Wrestling League, the creators tried other products that featured naked women, such as online gambling, before settling on nude female wrestling.&lt;ref name=blast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/entertainment/2007/08/carmen-electras-naked-womens-wrestling-league/|title=Carmen Electra’s Naked Women’s Wrestling League|author=Lavine, Samantha|publisher=Blast Magazine|accessdate=2009-12-06|date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWWL wrestlers were trained by [[Ron Hutchison]].&lt;ref name=blast/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; The show made its debut in 2004 with the release of the [[pay-per-view]] show "Vegas Stripped". It returned to pay-per-view in 2006, with the "Naked Revolution" show. Carmen Electra hosted the show, while other celebrities to appear on the program included pro-wrestling manager [[Jimmy Hart|Jimmy "Mouth of the South" Hart]], as well as adult entertainment star [[Mary Carey (actress)|Mary Carey]].&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/01/18/1399885.html|title=Turned off by naked women wrestling|author=Kapur, Bob|publisher=SLAM!

In November 2007, Electra announced a lawsuit against the NWWL for, among other things, [[breach of contract]] and failure to pay money that she claimed was still due to her.&lt;ref name=sue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b56708_Carmen_Electra_Suits_Naked_Wrestling.html|title=Carmen Electra Suits Naked Wrestling|author=Finn, Natalie|publisher=E Online|accessdate=2009-12-06|date=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, NWWL owner Howard Mann revealed that he would seek damages for defamation, slander and malicious persecution.&lt;ref name=sue/&gt;

In late 2007, the NWWL launched a website where their nude wrestling matches were available for [[download]]. Since the promotion debuted, the NWWL shows have been broadcast in approximately 38 countries.&lt;ref name=blast/&gt; In addition, the wrestlers have been featured in ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.&lt;ref name=blast/&gt;

'''''Semar Gugat''''' (Indonesian for ''Semar Accuses'') is a [[stage play]] written by [[Nano Riantiarno]] for his troupe Teater Koma. It follows the traditional ''[[wayang]]'' character [[Semar]] as he attempts— and fails— to take revenge against [[Arjuna]] and Srikandi for humiliating him by cutting off a lock of his hair while they are under the influence of the demon queen [[Durga]]. Completed in mid-1995, the play consists of 559&amp;nbsp;lines of dialogue spread through 30&amp;nbsp;[[Scene (drama)|scenes]]. ''Semar Gugat'' has been read as a critique of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government under president [[Suharto]]. It was first performed on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1995 after the government withheld permission for several months. After Teater Koma gave an initial two-week run, it was adapted by various amateur groups. In 1998 Riantiarno won a [[S.E.A. Write Award]] for the work.

==Plot==
The kingdom of [[Indraprastha|Amarta]] is preparing for the wedding of [[Arjuna]] and Srikandi. The [[Punakawan]]s—[[Semar]], his wife Sutiragen, and their children [[Gareng]], [[Petruk]], and [[Bagong]]—prepare to attend the ceremony.

However, the bride-to-be is fraught with doubt. Arjuna is already well known as a womanizer and has been with an untold number of women. She decides to test Arjuna's love by giving him a test. At this moment, [[Durga]], the queen of demons, chooses to possess her body and, controlling Srikandi's voice, demands to see Arjuna even though tradition forbids it. With the support of Arjuna's two other wives, [[Subhadra|Sumbadra]] and [[Larasasti]], she succeeds in meeting Arjuna and tells him to provide a lock (''kuncur'') of Semar's hair as proof of his devotion. Arjuna reluctantly does the deed and the ceremony goes as scheduled. However, Semar is unable to accept the humiliation, stating that not even gods dare touch his head. The family does not attend Arjuna's wedding, despite being palace servants, and Semar cries at home for the remainder of the day. Meanwhile, [[Pandava|Arjuna's brothers]], including King [[Yudhisthira|Yudistira]], leave the kingdom to meditate; Arjuna is left to rule over Amarta.

Semar decides that he has had enough humiliation; although he is very powerful, he feels constantly abused by humans and gods. With his favourite son Bagong he goes to the palace of the gods in Kayangan. However, only Semar is admitted; Bagong is chased off by two guards. Semar speaks to the gods [[Batara Guru]] and Batara Narada and asks to regain the handsome face he had once had. This they give him, using [[plastic surgery]]. Semar is made human and given his own kingdom, Simpang Bawana Nuranitis Asri. Semar changes his name to Prabu Sanggadonya Lukanurani. Although he has become leader of his own kingdom, Semar is unable to find happiness. His wife, not believing that he is Semar, leaves him; only his sons Petruk and Gareng join him. They begin building the kingdom, but are displeased to find that all of its riches are not enough to ensure harmony.

Meanwhile, in Amarta, Arjuna's leadership is causing the populace to feel miserable. Under the influence of Srikandi (who remains possessed by Durga), Arjuna focuses on economic development and increases the number of imports. He establishes monopolies on common commodities hoping to control the population and uses [[popular culture]] to promote a sense of selfless nationalism. Much of the disillusioned populace emigrates from Amarta, while others send extensive letters of protest to the palace. Those who remain are later possessed by demons under Durga's leadership, becoming prisoners in their own bodies.

In Simpang Bawana Nuranitis Asri, Larasati and Sumbadra—who have lost favour in Amarta—arrive. They meet with two warriors from Amarta, Sumbadra's son [[Abhimanyu|Abimanyu]] and his cousin [[Ghatotkacha|Gatotkaca]], who have come to tell Semar of Amarta's suffering. Unable to accept the people's suffering, Semar goes to his former homeland and challenges Arjuna and Srikandi, whom he realises has been possessed. When Semar tries to use his sacred [[flatulence]] known as "Ajian The White Kentuts", said to be capable of causing "whirlwinds, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, [and] volcanic eruptions",{{efn|Original: "''... lesus, angin puyuh, banjir bandang, gempa bumi, [dan] gunung-gunung meletus''."}}{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|p=99}} nothing happens. Durga laughs at Semar's impotence and lets him live, considering it the greatest humiliation possible. Petruk and Gareng join Durga, leaving Semar alone.

==Description==
''Semar Gugat'' is a [[stage play]] in 30&amp;nbsp;[[Scene (drama)|scenes]]. It also features an untitled opening song{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|p=1}} and a closing song entitled "Nyanyi Sunyi Jagat Raya" ("The Universe's Silent Song");{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|pp=108–109}} other songs, some untitled, are interspersed in the play proper. The story features 25&amp;nbsp;speaking roles, with an unspecified number of unnamed mute characters.{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|pp=ix–x}} Its 559&amp;nbsp;lines of dialogue is focused mostly on eight characters: Semar, Gareng, Petruk, Bagong, Durga, [[Kali]]ka (Durga's minion), and Srikandi.{{sfn|Nasution|2009|p=45}}

The script was written by [[Nano Riantiarno]], leader of Teater Koma, and completed in June 1995.{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|p=109}} It was the 78th&amp;nbsp;production for Teater Koma.{{sfn|Teater Koma 1995, Pamphlet}}

==Themes and style==
[[File:Wayang Kulit of Semar crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A puppet|The traditional character of [[Semar]] is generally known as a symbol of the people (''[[wong cilik]]'').]]
Semar is a character in traditional [[Javanese people|Javanese]] puppetry (''[[wayang]]''), depicted as a god who has come to Earth to serve human kings. Although he had been used by President [[Suharto]] of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] as symbolic of the regime,{{sfn|Banawiratma|1999|pp=561–563}} Semar is traditionally considered representative of the common people (''[[wong cilik]]''),{{sfn|Tejo 1995, Angin Litsus dari Semar}} as are the other Punakawans.{{sfn|Banawiratma|1999|pp=561–563}} As such, theologian J. B. Banawiratma surmises that the play is representative of the common people accusing the forces in power, be they internal or external. He writes that the power which is challenged is not that which is used for the good of the people, but power which is abused for a leader's self-interest. He further writes that the demon Durga serves as a personification of this abusive power.{{sfn|Banawiratma|1999|pp=561–563}}

Muhammad Ismail Nasution of the [[State University of Padang]] concurs, suggesting that the play is a criticism of the New Order government. He notes that dialogue criticising the social realities of New Order Indonesia is generally spoken by Semar's sons and encompasses the business practices, [[education in Indonesia|educational policies]], nepotism, and inequality found in New Order Indonesia.{{sfn|Nasution|2009|pp=51–52}} Quoting a line from Semar, in which he discounts his children's suggestion that Semar lead protests, Nasution also notes criticism of the youths who would demonstrate against the New Order, depicting them as being easily manipulated by ''[[Agent provocateur|agents provocateur]]'' and often needlessly destroying material goods.{{sfn|Nasution|2009|pp=51–52}}

H. Sujiwo Tejo of ''[[Kompas]]'' writes that the performance used more modern story telling techniques, noting that changes between scenes were more stylised and quicker than in traditional ''wayang''. He also notes influences of modern dance, another departure from traditional theatre.{{sfn|Tejo 1995, Angin Litsus dari Semar}}

==Performance==
After Riantiarno completed writing ''Semar Gugat'', the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government—which required stage plays to receive formal permission before performances could be held—held up production. Generally this was straightforward, but some playwrights reportedly faced more stringent criteria.{{sfn|Bodden|2010|p=50}} Riantiarno, who had previously been highly critical of the government in depicting prostitutes, transsexuals, and corrupt officials in ''Opera Kecoa'' (''The Cockroach Opera''),{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=1136}} was one such writer; others included [[Rendra]] and [[Guruh Sukarnoputra]].{{sfn|Bodden|2010|p=50}} The government only formally granted permission for the play to be performed on 24 November 1995.{{sfn|Tejo 1995, Angin Litsus dari Semar}} Owing to debate over the censorship of stage plays by the government, including ''Semar Gugat'', in 1996 the government formally rescinded the requirement; social commentators, however, remained skeptical.{{sfn|Bodden|2010|p=305}}

''Semar Gugat'' was first performed at 800-seat Graha Bakti Budaya in [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]], Jakarta, the day after permission was granted, by Riantiarno's Teater Koma. Tickets for the first two performances, each running three hours, sold out in advance; Tejo noted that most of the audience were not regular theatre-goers. The initial two-week run was produced by Nano's wife Ratna, with its [[choreography]] handled by Sentot S and music directed by Idrus Madani. Semar was portrayed by Budi Ros,{{sfn|Tejo 1995, Angin Litsus dari Semar}} while other roles were taken by Dudung Hadi, O'han Adiputra, Budi Suryadi, Ratna Riantiarno, Derias Pribadi, and Asmin Timbil.{{sfn|Teater Koma 1995, Pamphlet}} For his work on ''Semar Gugat'', in 1998 Nano Riantiarno received the [[S.E.A. Write Award]] from the government of Thailand.{{sfn|JCG, Nano Riantiarno}}

A book version of the script was published in November 1995 by Bentang Budaya in [[Yogyakarta]], with cover design by Si Ong.{{sfn|Riantiarno|1995|p=iv}} The play has continued to be performed by various amateur groups.

'''''South Park''''' is an American multimedia comedy [[Media franchise|franchise]] created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It is based on the [[South Park|television series of the same name]], originally developed by [[Brian Graden]] for the [[Comedy Central]] [[Cable television|television network]].

==TV show==
{{main|South Park}}
''South Park'' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] and developed by [[Brian Graden]] for the [[Comedy Central]] [[Cable television|television network]]. The show revolves around four boys—[[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular [[Colorado]] town. Much like ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''South Park'' uses a very large [[ensemble cast]] of recurring characters and became infamous for its [[profanity]] and [[black comedy|dark]], [[surreal humour|surreal humor]] that [[satire|satirizes]] a [[Subject matter in South Park|wide range of topics]] towards a mature audience.

The [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was produced using [[cutout animation]], leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with [[computer animation]] that emulated the cutout technique. Parker and Stone perform most of the [[voice acting]] for the show's male characters. Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary [[Screenwriter|writer]] and [[Television director|director]]. There have been a total of [[List of South Park episodes|{{:South Park}} episodes]] over the course of the show's 22 seasons. The show's twenty-second season premiered on September 26, 2018.

==Film==
{{Main|South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut}}
In 1999, less than two years after the series first aired, a [[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut|feature-length film]] was released. The film, a musical comedy, was directed by Parker, who co-wrote the script with Stone and [[Pam Brady]]. The film was generally well received by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/south_park_bigger_longer_and_uncut/|title=South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut (1999)|accessdate=October 19, 2008|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a combined US$83.1 million at the domestic and foreign box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=southpark.htm|title=South Park – Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)|publisher=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself and gained a spot in the 2001 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' for "Most Swearing in an Animated Film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,278482,00.html|work=Guinness Book of World Records|title= Pop Culture News : News + Notes : ''Entertainment Weekly''|date=November 10, 2000|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=May 28, 2009|last=Singer|first=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song "[[Blame Canada]]" from [[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut (soundtrack)|the film's soundtrack]] earned song co-writers Parker and [[Marc Shaiman]] an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/23/blame.canada/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505015211/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/23/blame.canada/ |archivedate=May 5, 2008 |title=– Entertainment – Raunchy song's creators tuning up for Oscar night |date=March 23, 2000 |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |last=Michael |first=Dennis |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Imaginationland: The Movie (South Park)|Imaginationland: The Movie]]'' was released [[direct-to-video]] in 2008 and features the three episodes from the [[South Park (season 11)|11th season]] ([[Imaginationland I]], [[Imaginationland II]], and [[Imaginationland III]]) merged into a [[compilation film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/26/south-park-imaginationland-uncensored-directors-cut-dvd-review|title=South Park: Imaginationland (Uncensored Director's Cut)  DVD Review|first=Travis Fickett and Christopher|last=Monfette|date=26 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parker and Stone said in a 2008 interview that a theatrically released sequel would most likely be what concludes the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trey Parker on a ‘South Park’ movie sequel|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/south-park-movi/|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when asked on the official ''South Park'' website whether a sequel would be made, they said "the first ''South Park'' movie was so potent, we're all still recovering from the blow. Unfortunately, at the current moment, there are no plans for a second ''South Park'' movie. But you never know what the future may bring, crazier things have happened..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/2010/mar|title=Will there be another South Park movie?|publisher=South Park Studios|date=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut'' the sixth greatest animated feature of all time.&lt;ref name="timelist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2079149_2079152_2079183,00.html|title=6.

Entertainment]] relinquished to [[Paramount Pictures]] its rights to co-finance a potential future ''South Park'' film during their negotiations to co-finance the [[Christopher Nolan]] science fiction film ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''. Previous efforts to create a second ''South Park'' film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolans-interstellar-warner-bros-562879|title=Warner Bros.

===Shorts===

===Video games===
{{See also|List of South Park video games}}

Following the early success of the series, three video games based on the series were released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]]. A [[first-person shooter]] simply titled ''[[South Park (video game)|South Park]]'' was released in 1998 for the [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[PlayStation]]. This was followed in 1999 by ''[[South Park: Chef's Luv Shack]]'', a [[party video game]] featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the [[Dreamcast]], PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, ''[[South Park Rally]]'', a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the ''South Park'' games they produced.&lt;ref name="sps40"&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Questions|url=http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129004417/http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 29, 2010|date=October 4, 2001|publisher=South Park Studios|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ps2_premiere"&gt;{{Cite video|title=PlayStation 2 Premiere |url=http://treyparker.info/video/playstation_18oct00.zip |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226085646/http://treyparker.info/video/playstation_18oct00.zip |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 26, 2006 |website=treyparker.info/ |publisher=shpadoinkle |date=October 18, 2000 |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |df= }} {{YouTube|m6jrRQnqeGU|Video}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a ''South Park'' game for the [[Game Boy Color]] in development at Acclaim but it was cancelled by Parker and Stone because they thought the game was not right for the system as the main demographic was kids. Parker and Stone have the prototype cartridge of the game, making it the first ''South Park'' video game ever made. Only one screenshot was published in ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' issue 114 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Park [GBC - Cancelled] - Unseen64|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/05/south-park-gbc-cancelled/|website=Unseen64: Beta, Cancelled &amp; Unseen Videogames!|access-date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Read-only memmory|ROM]] file for the game, in a complete state, was leaked online in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/08/07/south-parks-lost-unreleased-game-boy-color-game-leaks/|title=South Park's Lost, Unreleased Game Boy Color Game Leaks Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ''South Park'' game was in development for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[GameCube]] in 2004 but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the game was found in an Xbox development kit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=South Park's Cancelled GTA Clone - Unseen64|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifgnTz1oN5I&amp;feature=youtu.be|last=DidYouKnowGaming?|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=UNRELEASED SOUTH PARK GAME!

In 2010, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new ''South Park'' games,&lt;ref name="dd_intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/games/lgtdp/developer-diaries#358657 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116210046/http://www.southparkstudios.com/games/lgtdp/developer-diaries |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |title=''Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'': Developer Diaries: Do you have what it takes to save South Park? |last=Benson |first=Todd |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |publisher=South Park Studios |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily. The first such title is ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', a [[tower defense game]] developed by [[Doublesix]], which was released in 2009 for the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service on the [[Xbox 360]] console.

'''Spiral Q Puppet Theater''' is a puppet troupe that was founded in 1995 by Matthew "Mattyboy" Hart in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. After traveling the country he was inspired by the street performance work of the [[Radical Faeries]] and the [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] in [[Glover, Vermont]]. On his return to Philadelphia, Hart founded ''Spiral Q'' as a way to use his newfound interest in [[puppetry]], [[street theatre]] and [[wikt:pageant|pageant]]ry to promote [[social change|social]] and [[politics|political]] change.&lt;ref name="IMC"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Spiral Q Open Studios: June 12–16 for BioDemo |publisher=BioDemocracy Mobilization |date=2005-06-12 |url=http://www.phillyimc.org/en/node/42317 |accessdate=2009-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224081752/http://www.phillyimc.org/en/node/42317 |archive-date=2010-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Spiral Q seeks to bring the storytelling techniques of giant puppetry, pageantry, and toy theater to the urban backdrop of Philadelphia.

==History==
[[Image:Spiral Q Peoplehood Giant.jpg|thumb|left|"The Sleeping Giant" from Spiral Q's 2007 ''Peoplehood'' Pageant]]
Initially, Spiral Q was a [[shadow puppet]] theater that staged performances throughout the community. Local [[activist]] groups came to Hart to make puppets, props and [[effigy|effigies]] for demonstrations and educational campaigns. Spiral Q's identity springs from this early work in Philadelphia's HIV/AIDS activist and queer communities, particularly with AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]). In 1997 and 1998 Hart organized the week-long ''Full-On Puppet Festival'' in Philadelphia. showcasing puppeteers from around the country. Spiral Q also organized an annual [[Day of the Dead]] parade on [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] up through 1999. Both the festival and the parade were set aside so that the organization could focus on community activism.

Workshops with a local children's garden led to another model of community performance with children and adults carrying giant puppets that they created in parades and pageants. In 2000 Spiral Q started an annual citywide parade and pageant called ''Peoplehood''.&lt;ref name="Inky"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kristin |last=Granero |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/weekend/10643417.html |title= A parade that's big on puppets |publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=19 October 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2009}}{{Verify source|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each October the parade starts at the [[Paul Robeson House (Philadelphia)|Paul Robeson House]] and ends in [[Clark Park]]. In addition to neighborhood parades and pageants such as Peoplehood, Philadelphians can get involved with Spiral Q through its Justice Works Program and Education Initiatives.

Since 2000, the theater has been located in the [[Mantua, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|East Mantua]] section of [[West Philadelphia]]. Hart left the company he founded in 2003 to pursue other interests.

A '''television network''' is a [[telecommunications network]] for distribution of [[television program]] content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many [[television station]]s or [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television]] providers. Until the mid-1980s, television [[broadcast programming|programming]] in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of [[broadcast network]]s. Many early television networks (such as the [[BBC]], [[NBC]] or [[CBC Television|CBC]]) evolved from earlier [[radio network]]s.

==Overview==
In countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated content to all of their stations and where most individual [[television transmitter]]s therefore operate only as large "[[broadcast relay station|repeater stations]]", the terms "television network", "[[television channel]]" (a numeric identifier or [[radio frequency]]) and "television station" have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language, with professionals in television-related occupations continuing to make a differentiation between them. Within the industry, a tiering is sometimes created among groups of networks based on whether their programming is simultaneously originated from a central point, and whether the network [[master control]] has the technical and administrative capability to take over the programming of their [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in real-time when it deems this necessary – the most common example being during national [[breaking news]] events.

In [[North America]] in particular, many television networks available via [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] are branded as "channels" because they are somewhat different from traditional networks in the sense defined above, as they are singular operations – they have no affiliates or component stations, but instead are distributed to the public via cable or [[direct-broadcast satellite]] providers. Such networks are commonly referred to by terms such as "[[specialty channel]]s" in Canada or "[[cable channel|cable network]]s" in the U.S.

A network may or may not produce all of its own programming. If not, [[production company|production companies]] (such as [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]]) can distribute their content to the various networks, and it is common that a certain production firm may have programs that air on two or more rival networks. Similarly, some networks may import television programs from other countries, or use archived programming to help complement their schedules.

Some stations have the capability to interrupt the network through the [[local insertion]] of [[television commercial]]s, [[station identification]]s and [[emergency alert]]s. Others completely break away from the network for their own programming, a method known as [[regional variation]]. This is common where small networks are members of larger networks. The majority of commercial television stations are self-owned, even though a variety of these instances are the property of an owned-and-operated television network. The commercial television stations can also be linked with a [[noncommercial educational]] broadcasting agency. It is also important to note that some countries have launched national television networks, so that individual television stations can act as common repeaters of nationwide [[Television program|program]]s.

On the other hand, television networks also undergo the impending experience of major changes related to cultural varieties. The emergence of cable television has made available in major media markets, programs such as those aimed at American bi-cultural Latinos. Such a diverse captive audience presents an occasion for the networks and affiliates to advertise the best programming that needs to be aired.

This is explained by author Tim P. Vos in his abstract ''A Cultural Explanation of Early Broadcast'', where he determines targeted group/non-targeted group representations as well as the cultural specificity employed in the television network entity. Vos notes that policymakers did not expressly intend to create a broadcast order dominated by commercial networks. In fact, legislative attempts were made to limit the network's preferred position.

As to individual stations, modern [[network operations center]]s usually use [[broadcast automation]] to handle most tasks. These systems are not only used for [[broadcast programming|programming]] and for [[video server]] [[playout]], but use exact [[atomic time]] from [[Global Positioning System]]s or other sources to maintain perfect [[synchronization]] with upstream and downstream systems, so that programming appears seamless to viewers.

==Global==
A major international television network is the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]), which is perhaps most well known for its news agency [[BBC News]]. Owned by [[the Crown]], the BBC operates primarily in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is funded by the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licence]] paid by British residents that watch [[terrestrial television]] and as a result, no commercial advertising appears on its networks. Outside the UK, advertising is broadcast because the licence fee only applies to the BBC's British operations. 23,000 people worldwide are employed by the BBC and its subsidiary, [[BBC Studios]].

==United States==
{{See also|List of United States over-the-air television networks}}
[[Television in the United States]] had long been dominated by the [[Big Three television networks]], the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), [[CBS]] (formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the National Broadcasting Company ([[NBC]]); however the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (Fox), which launched in October 1986, has gained prominence and is now considered part of the "Big Four." The Big Three provide a significant amount of programs to each of their affiliates, including [[news broadcasting|newscast]]s, [[prime time]], [[daytime television|daytime]] and [[sports television|sports]] programming, but still reserve periods during each day where their affiliate can air [[local programming]], such as local news or [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]]. Since the creation of Fox, the number of American television networks has increased, though the amount of programming they provide is often much less: for example, [[The CW|The CW Television Network]] only provides twelve hours of primetime programming each week (along with six hours on Saturdays and five hours a week during the daytime), leaving its affiliates to fill time periods where network programs are not broadcast with a large amount of syndicated programming. Other networks are dedicated to specialized programming, such as [[religious broadcasting|religious]] content or programs presented in languages other than [[English language|English]], particularly [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The largest television network in the United States, however, is the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), a [[non-profit]], publicly owned, [[non-commercial educational]] service. In comparison to the [[commercial television]] networks, there is no central unified arm of broadcast programming, meaning that each PBS [[network affiliate#member stations|member station]] has a significant amount of freedom to schedule television shows as they consent to. Some public television outlets, such as PBS, carry separate [[digital subchannel]] networks through their member stations (for example, [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]]; in fact, some programs airing on PBS were branded on other channels as coming from GPB Kids and [[World (TV network)|PBS World]]).

This works as each network sends its signal to many local affiliated television stations across the country. These local stations then carry the "network feed," which can be viewed by millions of households across the country. In such cases, the signal is sent to as many as 200+ stations or as little as just a dozen or fewer stations, depending on the size of the network.

With the adoption of [[digital terrestrial television|digital television]], television networks have also been created specifically for distribution on the digital subchannels of television stations (including networks focusing on classic television series and films operated by companies like [[Weigel Broadcasting]] (owners of [[Movies!]] and [[Me-TV]]) and [[Tribune Broadcasting]] (owners of [[This TV]] and [[Antenna TV]]), along with networks focusing on music, sports and other niche programming).

[[Cable television in the United States|Cable]] and satellite providers pay the networks a certain rate per subscriber (the highest charge being for [[ESPN]], in which cable and satellite providers pay a rate of more than $5.00 per subscriber to ESPN). The providers also handle the sale of [[television commercials|advertising]] inserted at the local level during national programming, in which case the broadcaster and the cable/satellite provider may [[revenue sharing|share revenue]]. Networks that maintain a [[home shopping]] or [[infomercial]] format may instead pay the station or cable/satellite provider, in a [[brokered programming|brokered]] carriage deal. This is especially common with [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations, and in recent years, even more so for stations that used this revenue stream to finance their conversion to digital broadcasts, which in turn provides them with several additional channels to transmit different programming sources.

===History===
Television broadcasting in the United States was heavily influenced by [[radio]].  Early individual experimental radio stations in the United States began limited operations in the 1910s.  In November 1920, [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse]] signed on "the world's first commercially licensed radio station", [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baudino|first=Joseph E|author2=John M. Kittross|title=Broadcasting's Oldest Stations: An Examination of Four Claimants|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|pages=61–82|date=Winter 1977|url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/kdka.html|accessdate=2008-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306145733/http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/kdka.html|archive-date=2008-03-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies built early radio stations in [[Detroit]], [[Boston]], [[New York City]] and other areas.  Radio stations received permission to transmit through [[broadcast license]]s obtained through the [[Federal Radio Commission]] (FRC), a government entity that was created in 1926 to regulate the radio industry.  With few exceptions, radio stations east of the [[Mississippi River]] received official [[call sign]]s beginning with the letter "W"; those west of the Mississippi were assigned calls beginning with a "K".  The amount of programs that these early stations aired was often limited, in part due to the expense of program creation.  The idea of a network system which would distribute programming to many stations simultaneously, saving each station the expense of creating all of their own programs and expanding the total coverage beyond the limits of a single broadcast signal, was devised.

[[NBC]] set up the first permanent coast-to-coast [[radio network]] in the United States by 1928, using [[dedicated line|dedicated telephone line]] technology. The network physically linked individual radio stations, nearly all of which were [[independent radio|independently]] owned and operated, in a vast chain, NBC's audio signal thus transmitted from station to station to listeners across the United States. Other companies, including [[CBS]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], soon followed suit, each network signed hundreds of individual stations on as affiliates: stations which agreed to broadcast programs from one of the networks.

As radio prospered throughout the 1920s and 1930s, experimental television stations, which broadcast both an audio and a video signal, began sporadic broadcasts. Licenses for these experimental stations were often granted to experienced radio broadcasters, and thus advances in television technology closely followed breakthroughs in radio technology. As interest in television grew, and as early television stations began regular broadcasts, the idea of networking television signals (sending one station's video and audio signal to outlying stations) was born. However, the signal from an electronic television system, containing much more information than a radio signal, required a [[broadband]] transmission medium. Transmission by a nationwide series of radio relay towers would be possible but extremely expensive.

Researchers at [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] subsidiary [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] patented [[coaxial cable]] in 1929, primarily as a telephone improvement device. Its high capacity (transmitting 240 telephone calls simultaneously) also made it ideal for long-distance television transmission, where it could handle a frequency band of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755145,00.html Coaxial Cable]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Oct. 14, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany|German]] television first demonstrated such an application in 1936 by relaying televised telephone calls from [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] to [[Leipzig, Germany|Leipzig]], {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, by cable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/1936_German_Olympics_TV_Program_English.JPG Television in Germany], Berlin, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T laid the first [[L-carrier]] coaxial cable between New York City and [[Philadelphia]], with automatic [[repeater|signal booster stations]] every {{convert|10|mi|km}}, and in 1937 it experimented with transmitting televised [[film|motion picture]]s over the line.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/tv_piped.html Television 'Piped' From New York to Philadelphia] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730121316/http://www.earlytelevision.org/tv_piped.html |date=2012-07-30 }}," ''Short Wave &amp; Television'', February 1938, pp. 534, 574–575.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Labs gave demonstrations of the New York–Philadelphia television link in 1940 and 1941. AT&amp;T used the coaxial link to transmit the [[Republican National Convention]] in June 1940 from Philadelphia to New York City, where it was televised to a few hundred receivers over the NBC station W2XBS (which evolved into [[WNBC]]) as well as seen in Schenectady, New York via W2XB (which evolved into [[WRGB]]) via off-air relay from the New York station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1940.htm GOP Convention of 1940 in Philadelphia], UShistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC had earlier demonstrated an inter-city television broadcast on February 1, 1940, from its station in New York City to another in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]] by [[General Electric]] relay antennas, and began transmitting some programs on an irregular basis to Philadelphia and Schenectady in 1941. Wartime priorities suspended the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 1, 1942 to October 1, 1945, temporarily shutting down expansion of television networking. However, in 1944 a [[short film]], "[[Patrolling the Ether]]", was broadcast simultaneously over three stations as an experiment.

[[File:DuMont Affiliates 1949.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The DuMont Television Network in 1949. DuMont's network of stations stretched from Boston to St. Louis. These stations were linked together via AT&amp;T's [[coaxial cable]] feed, allowing the network to broadcast [[live television]] programming to all the stations at the same time. Stations not yet connected received [[kinescope]] recordings via physical delivery.]]
AT&amp;T made its first postwar addition in February 1946, with the completion of a {{convert|225|mi|km|adj=on}} cable between New York City and [[Washington, D.C.]], although a blurry demonstration broadcast showed that it would not be in regular use for several months. The [[DuMont Television Network]], which had begun experimental broadcasts before the war, launched what ''[[Newsweek]]'' called "the country's first permanent commercial television network" on August 15, 1946, connecting New York City with Washington.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;Weinstein, David (2004). ''The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television'' Temple University Press: Philadelphia, p. 16-17. {{ISBN|1-59213-499-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be outdone, NBC launched what it called "the world's first regularly operating television network" on June 27, 1947, serving New York City, Philadelphia, Schenectady and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934668,00.html Beginning]," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', July 7, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and Boston were added to the NBC television network in late 1947. DuMont and NBC would be joined by CBS and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1948.

In the 1940s, the term "chain broadcasting" was used when discussing network broadcasts,&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;"The Impact of the FCC's Chain Broadcasting Rules". ''The Yale Law Journal'', 60(1) (1951): 78–111&lt;/ref&gt; as the television stations were linked together in long chains along the [[East Coast (US)|East Coast]]. But as the television networks expanded westward, the interconnected television stations formed major networks of connected affiliate stations. In January 1949, with the sign-on of DuMont's [[KDKA-TV|WDTV]] in Pittsburgh, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] networks were finally connected by coaxial cable (with WDTV airing the best shows from all four networks).[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10136/1058239-426.stm] By 1951, the four networks stretched from coast to coast, carried on the new [[microwave radio relay]] network of [[AT&amp;T Long Lines]]. Only a few local television stations remained [[independent station (North America)|independent]] of the networks.

Each of the four major television networks originally only broadcast a few hours of programs a week to their affiliate stations, mostly between 8:00 and 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], when most viewers were watching television. Most of the programs broadcast by the television stations were still locally produced. As the networks increased the number of programs that they aired, however, officials at the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) grew concerned that local television might disappear altogether. Eventually, the federal regulator enacted the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which restricted the amount of time that the networks could air programs; officials hoped that the rules would foster the development of quality local programs, but in practice, most local stations did not want to bear the burden of producing many of their own programs, and instead chose to purchase programs from independent producers. Sales of television programs to individual local stations are done through a method called "broadcast syndication," and today nearly every television station in the United States obtains syndicated programs in addition to network-produced fare.

Late in the 20th century, cross-country microwave radio relays were replaced by fixed-service satellites. Some terrestrial radio relays remained in service for regional connections.

After the failure and shutdown of DuMont in 1956, several attempts at new networks were made between the 1950s and the 1970s, with little success. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], founded by the [[Rupert Murdoch]]-owned [[News Corporation]] (now owned by [[21st Century Fox]]), was launched on October 9, 1986 after the company purchased the television assets of [[Metromedia]]; it would eventually ascend to the status of the [[fourth television network|fourth major network]] by 1994. Two other networks launched within a week of one another in January 1995: [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Time Warner]] and the [[Tribune Company]], and the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), formed through a programming alliance between [[Chris-Craft Industries]] and [[Paramount Television]] (whose parent, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], would later acquire half and later all of the network over the course of its existence). In September 2006, [[The CW]] was launched as a "merger" of The WB and UPN (in actuality, a consolidation of each respective network's higher-rated programs onto one schedule); [[MyNetworkTV]], a network formed from affiliates of UPN and The WB that did not affiliate with The CW, launched at the same time.

===Regulation===
FCC regulations in the United States restricted the [[concentration of media ownership|number of television stations that could be owned by any one network, company or individual]]. This led to a system where most local television stations were independently owned, but received programming from the network through a [[franchising]] contract, except in a few major cities that had [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&amp;O) of a network and independent stations. In the early days of television, when there were often only one or two stations broadcasting in a given market, the stations were usually affiliated with multiple networks and were able to choose which programs would air. Eventually, as more stations were licensed, it became common for each station to be exclusively affiliated with only one network and carry all of the "prime-time" programs that the network offered. Local stations occasionally break from regularly scheduled network programming however, especially when a [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] situation occurs in the viewing area. Moreover, when stations return to network programming from [[commercial break]]s, station identifications are displayed in the first few seconds before switching to the network's logo.

==Canada==
{{main article|Television system|Television in Canada}}
A number of different definitions of "network" are used by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Under the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], a network is defined as "any operation where control over all or any part of the programs or program schedules of one or more broadcasting undertakings is delegated to another undertaking or person,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/B-9.01/page-1.html|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|website=laws.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must be licensed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

Only three national over-the-air television networks are currently licensed by the CRTC: government-owned [[CBC Television]] (English) and [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] (French), French-language private network [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]], and a network focused on Canada's indigenous peoples. A third French-language service, [[V (TV network)|V]], is licensed as a provincial network within [[Quebec]], but is not licensed or locally distributed (outside of carriage on the [[digital cable|digital tiers]] of pay television providers) on a national basis.

Currently, licensed national or provincial networks must be carried by all cable providers (in the country or province, respectively) with a service area above a certain population threshold, as well as all satellite providers. However, they are no longer necessarily expected to achieve over-the-air coverage in all areas (APTN, for example, only has terrestrial coverage in parts of northern Canada).

In addition to these licensed networks, the two main private English-language over-the-air services, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]], are also generally considered to be "networks" by virtue of their national coverage, although they are not officially licensed as such. CTV was previously a licensed network, but relinquished this licence in 2001 after acquiring most of its affiliates, making operating a network licence essentially redundant (per the above definition).

Smaller groups of stations with common branding are often categorized by industry watchers as [[television system]]s, although the public and the broadcasters themselves will often refer to them as "networks" regardless. Some of these systems, such as [[CTV Two]] and the now-defunct [[E! (TV system)|E!]], essentially operate as mini-networks, but have reduced geographical coverage. Others, such as [[Omni Television]] or the [[Crossroads Television System]], have similar branding and a common programming focus, but schedules may vary significantly from one station to the next. [[Citytv]] originally began operating as a television system in 2002 when [[CKVU-DT|CKVU-TV]] in [[Vancouver]] started to carry programs originating from [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] in [[Toronto]] and adopted that station's "Citytv" branding, but gradually became a network by virtue of national coverage through expansions into other markets west of [[Atlantic Canada]] between 2005 and 2013.

Most local television stations in Canada are now owned and operated directly by their network, with only a small number of stations still operating as affiliates.

==Europe, Asia, Africa and South America==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=October 2009}}
Most television services outside North America are national networks established by a combination of publicly funded broadcasters and commercial broadcasters.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} Most nations established television networks in a similar way: the first television service in each country was operated by a [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], often funded by a television licensing fee, and most of them later established a second or even third station providing a greater variety of content. Commercial television services also became available when private companies applied for television broadcasting licenses. Often, each new network would be identified with their channel number, so that individual stations would often be numbered "One," "Two," "Three," and so forth.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Television in the United Kingdom}}
The first television network in the United Kingdom was operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]). On 2 November 1936 the BBC opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from a 405 lines transmitter at Alexandra Palace. The BBC remained dominant until eventually on 22 September 1955, commercial broadcasting was established in order to create a second television network. Rather than creating a single network with local stations owned and operated by a single company (as is the case with the BBC), each local area had a separate television station that was independently owned and operated, although most of these stations shared a number of programmes, particularly during peak evening viewing hours. These stations formed the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.

When the advent of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] broadcasting allowed a greater number of television stations to broadcast, the BBC launched a second network, [[BBC Two]] (with the original service being renamed [[BBC One]]). A fourth national commercial service was launched, [[Channel 4]], although [[Wales]] instead introduced a Welsh-language service, [[S4C]]. These were later followed by the launch of a fifth network, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. Since the introduction of digital television, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 each introduced a number of digital-only networks. [[Sky plc|Sky]] operates a large number of networks including [[Sky One]], [[Sky Living]] and [[Sky Atlantic]]; as does [[UKTV]], which operates networks like [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], [[W (UK TV channel)|W]] and [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]].

===Sweden===
Sweden had only one television network until the early-1990s: the public broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Commercial companies such as Modern Times Group, TV4, Viasat, and SBS Discovery have established TV networks since the 1980s although they initially aired exclusively on satellite. In 1991, TV4 became Sweden's first commercial television network to air terrestrially. Most television programming in Sweden is centralised except for local news updates that air on SVT1 and TV4.

===Netherlands===
Until 1989, [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] was the only television network in the Netherlands, with three stations, [[Nederland 1]], [[Nederland 2]] and [[Nederland 3]]. Rather than having a single production arm, there are a number of public broadcasting organizations that create programming for each of the three stations, each working relatively independently. Commercial broadcasting in the Netherlands is currently operated by two networks, [[RTL Nederland]] and [[SBS Broadcasting]], which together broadcast seven commercial stations.

===Russia===

====Soviet era====
The first television network in the [[Soviet Union]] launched on 7 July 1938 when Petersburg – Channel 5 of Leningrad Television became a unionwide network.
The second television network in the [[Soviet Union]] launched on 22 March 1951 when Channel One of USSR Central Television became a unionwide network. Until 1989, there were six television networks, all owned by the USSR Gosteleradio. This changed during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] program, when the first independent television network, [[2x2 (TV channel)|2×2]], was launched.

====1990s====
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, USSR Gosteleradio ceased to exist as well as its six networks. Only Channel One had a smooth transition and survived as a network, becoming [[Channel One (Russia)|Ostankino Channel One]]. The other five networks were operated by Ground Zero. This free airwave space allowed many private television networks like [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]] and [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]] to launch in the mid-1990s.

====2000s====
The 2000s were marked by the increased state intervention in Russian television. On April 14, 2001 NTV experienced management changes following the expulsion of former [[oligarchy|oligarch]] and NTV founder [[Vladimir Gusinsky]]. As a result, most of the prominent reporters featured on NTV left the network. Later on January 22, 2002, the second largest private television network [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]], where the former NTV staff took refuge, was shut down allegedly because of its editorial policy. Five months later on June 1, [[TVS (Russia)|TVS]] was launched, mostly employing NTV/TV-6 staff, only to cease operations the following year. Since then, the four largest television networks (Channel One, Russia 1, NTV and Russia 2) have been state-owned.

Still, the 2000s saw a rise of several independent television networks such as [[REN (TV channel)|REN]] (its coverage increased vastly allowing it to become a federal network), Petersburg – Channel Five (overall the same), the relaunched [[2x2 (TV channel)|2×2]]. The Russian television market is mainly shared today by five major companies: Channel One, Russia 1, NTV, TNT and CTC.

===Brazil===
{{See also|Television in Brazil}}
The major commercial television network in Brazil is [[Rede Globo]], which was founded in 1965. It grew to become the largest and most successful media conglomerate in the country, having a dominating presence in various forms of media including television, radio, print (newspapers and magazines) and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18912764|title=Brazil profile|date=24 May 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other networks include [[Rede Bandeirantes]], [[RecordTV]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]], [[RedeTV!]], and [[TV Cultura]].

==Australia==
{{See also|Television in Australia}}
Australia has two national public networks, [[ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television|SBS]]. The ABC operates eight stations as part of its main network [[ABC1]], one for each [[Australian state|state]] and territory, as well as three digital-only networks, [[ABC2]], [[ABC3]] and [[ABC News 24]]. SBS currently operates two stations, [[SBS One]] and [[SBS Two]].

The first commercial networks in Australia involved commercial stations that shared programming in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and later [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], with each network forming networks based on their allocated channel numbers: [[TCN-9]] in Sydney, [[GTV-9]] in Melbourne, [[QTQ-9]] in Brisbane, [[NWS-9]] in Adelaide and [[STW-9]] in Perth together formed the [[Nine Network]]; while their equivalents on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channels 7 and 10 respectively formed the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]]. Until 1989, areas outside these main cities had access to only a single commercial station, and these rural stations often formed small networks such as [[Prime Television]]. Beginning in 1989, however, television markets in [[rural]] areas began to aggregate, allowing these rural networks to broadcast over a larger area, often an entire state, and become full-time affiliates to one specific metropolitan network.

As well as these [[Free-to-air]] channels, there are other's on Australia's [[Pay television]] network [[Foxtel]].

==New Zealand==
{{See also|Television in New Zealand}}
New Zealand has one public network, [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ), which consists of two main networks: [[TVNZ 1]] is the network's flagship network which carries news, current affairs and sports programming as well as the majority of the locally produced shows broadcast by TVNZ and imported shows. TVNZ's second network, [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]], airs mostly imported shows with some locally produced programs such as ''[[Shortland Street]]''. TVNZ also operates a network exclusive to pay television services, [[TVNZ Heartland]], available on providers such as [[Sky Network Television|Sky]]. TVNZ previously operated a non-commercial public service network, [[TVNZ 7]], which ceased operations in June 2012 and was replaced by the [[timeshift channel]] TV One Plus 1. The network operated by Television New Zealand has progressed from operating as four distinct local stations within the four main centers in the 1960s, to having the majority of the content produced from TVNZ's [[Auckland]] studios at present.

New Zealand also has several privately owned television networks with the largest being operated by [[MediaWorks New Zealand|MediaWorks]]. MediaWorks' flagship network is [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]], which competes directly with both TVNZ broadcast networks. MediaWorks also operates a second network, [[Four (New Zealand)|FOUR]], which airs mostly imported programmes with children's shows airing in the daytime and shows targeted at teenagers and adult between 15 and 39 years of age during prime time. MediaWorks also operates a timeshift network, TV3 + 1, and a 24-hour music network, [[C4 (TV channel)|C4]].

All relevision networks in New Zealand air the same programming across the entire country with the only regional deviations being for local advertising; a regional news service existed in the 1980s, carrying a regional news programme from TVNZ's studios in New Zealand's four largest cities, Auckland, [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]].

In the 1960s, the service operated at the time by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was four separate television stations – AKTV2 in Auckland, WNTV1 in Wellington, CHTV3 in Christchurch and DNTV2 in Dunedin – which each ran their own newscast and produced some in-house programmes, with other shows being shared between the stations. Programmes and news footage were distributed via mail, with a programme airing in one region being mailed to another region for broadcast the following week. A network was finally established in 1969, with the same programmes being relayed to all regions simultaneously. From the 1970s to the 1990s, locally produced programmes that aired on TV One and TV2 were produced out of one of the four main studios, with TVNZ's network hub based in Wellington. Today, most locally produced programmes that are aired by both TVNZ and other networks are not actually produced in-house, instead they are often produced by a third party company (for example, the TV2 programme ''Shortland Street'' is produced by [[South Pacific Pictures]]). The networks produce their own news and current affairs programs, with most of the content filmed in Auckland.

New Zealand also operates several regional television stations, which are only available in individual markets. The regional stations will typically air a local news programme, produce some shows in-house and cover local sports events; the majority of programming on the regional stations will be imported from various sources.

==Philippines==
{{See also|Television in the Philippines}}
In the Philippines, in practice, the terms "network," "station" and "channel" are used interchangeably as programming lineups are mostly centrally planned from the networks' main offices, and since provincial/regional stations usually just relay the broadcast from their [[parent company|parent]] network's [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station (usually based in the [[Mega Manila]] area). As such, networks made up of VHF stations are sometimes informally referred to by their over-the-air channel number in the Mega Manila area (for example, Channel 2 or ''Dos'' for [[ABS-CBN]], Channel 5 or ''Singko'' for [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], and Channel 7 or ''Siyete'' for [[GMA Network]]), while some incorporate their channel numbers in the network's name (for example, [[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]], [[Studio 23]] and [[Net 25]], which respectively broadcast on VHF channel 5, and UHF channels 23 and 25).

Unlike the United States, where networks receive programmes produced by various production companies, the two largest networks in the Philippines produce all of their prime time programmes except for [[Asianovela]]s. Other networks adopt block-time programming, which utilizes programming arrangements similar to the relationship between a U.S. network and station.

'''''Disney's The Little Mermaid''''' is an American animated television series produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] based on the [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|1989 Disney film of the same name]]. It features the adventures of [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] as a mermaid prior to the events of the film. This series is the first Disney television series to be spun off from a major animated film. Some of the voice actors of the film reprise their roles in the series, among them [[Jodi Benson]] as Ariel, [[Samuel E. Wright]] as Sebastian, [[Kenneth Mars]] as King Triton and [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Ursula. Other voice actors include [[Edan Gross]] and [[Bradley Pierce]] as Flounder, and [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] as Prince Eric.

''The Little Mermaid'' premiered in the fall of 1992 with the animated [[prime time]] special called "A Whale of a Tale", then moved to Saturday mornings. This series originally appeared on [[CBS]], with an original run from 1992 to 1994 (prior to Disney's purchase of rival [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]). [[Disney Channel]] reran the series from October 2nd, 1995 to September 7th, 2002 and again from September 5th, 2006, to July 4th, 2010. Some of the episodes contain musical segments, featuring original songs written for the series. The opening theme to the show is an instrumental combination of the songs "[[Part of Your World]]", "[[Under the Sea]]" and "[[Kiss the Girl]]". The overture for the stage musical of ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is similar to this.

==Premise==
''The Little Mermaid'' television series is a prequel to the movie of the same name. The story is set before the events in the 1989 film, and follows Ariel's adventures as a mermaid still living under the sea with her father, Sebastian the [[crab]] and Flounder the [[Coral reef fish|fish]]. Various episodes highlight her relationships with her friends, father and sisters, and usually involve Ariel foiling the attempts of various enemies that intend ill harm to her or her kingdom. A prequel film, ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', was released in 2008 containing events that contradict the television series (such as Ariel's youth and first meeting with Flounder), making the TV series and ''Ariel's Beginning'' independent continuities.

==Development==
After the success of the 1989 movie, [[The Walt Disney Company]] planned to produce a children's television series for its Disney Channel cable outlet called "The Little Mermaid's Island." The proposed series would feature puppets from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] interacting with a "live" Ariel. As the video release of ''The Little Mermaid'' soared in sales during 1990 and early 1991, Disney quietly dropped plans for "The Little Mermaid's Island" in favor of a more ambitious plan: an animated weekly series for the CBS network. The new show would concern the adventures of Ariel and her friends before the events in the movie.

Jamie Mitchell, an artist and graphic designer who worked on ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', was named the producer and director of the new series. Patsy Cameron and Tedd Anasti were the story editors and wrote almost all of the episodes for the show's second and third seasons. Their previous joint work included Hanna-Barbera's ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', the animated ''[[Beetlejuice (TV series)|Beetlejuice]]'' and Disney's ''[[DuckTales]]''. Some of the artists and technicians on the feature film also contributed to the TV series. [[Mark Dindal]], chief of special animated effects for the movie, was a consultant for special effects on the TV show. Robby Merkin, who worked with [[Alan Menken]] and [[Howard Ashman]] on arranging the songs for the movie, worked as the arranger and music producer for the first season of the TV show.

Conscious of the worldwide acclaim for the movie's superior artistry, [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] auditioned the best overseas animation studios. In the world of TV animation, farming most of the artwork out to Asian studios is an economic reality due to lower production costs and wages abroad. Studios in [[Korea]], Japan and the [[Philippines]] contributed to the series.

==Broadcast==
The show's broadcast debut in September 1992 was in the form of a half-hour prime-time special, "The Little Mermaid: A Whale of a Tale." 

Its Saturday morning debut came the very next day. The show's time slot was 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., following another new animated series, ''[[Fievel's American Tails]]'', based on the animated movie ''[[An American Tail]]''. ''The Little Mermaid'' series drew a fair bit of media attention, including more than one spot on [[Entertainment Tonight]], because it was the first series based directly on a Disney animated feature and was a rare television cartoon concerning a strong female character. The show kept its time slot the following year with its second season.

For the series' third season, the show was moved to the 8 a.m. time period and was the lead-in for a new Disney animated series, ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''. This was to be the show's last season in original production; CBS elected not to buy another batch of episodes. On October 2, 1995, [[Disney Channel]] began rerunning the show seven days a week.&lt;ref name="Disney Channel premiere"&gt;''The Disney Channel Magazine'', Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: pp. 36, 46, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was broadcast on [[Disney Channel]] until 2010.It was also shown on  [[Toon Disney]] until 2007. The series then aired on [[Disney Junior]] from the channel's launch in 2012 until 2014.

{{main|List of The Little Mermaid episodes}}
{{:List of The Little Mermaid episodes}}

The series had a total of 31 episodes over three seasons. The first episode, "Whale of a Tale", has Ariel adopting Spot, a baby killer whale, when he is separated from his family. The episode "The Evil Manta" features a flashback to Ariel and Flounder's first meeting when they were younger, and the episode "Red" has King Triton magically reverting into a merboy, which gives Ariel a glimpse of how her father used to be when he was younger, and that they aren't so different after all.

In the episode "Metal Fish" Ariel saves a human, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who is loosely based on the real life author of the original ''The Little Mermaid'', and the encounter inspired the character to "write" the story of ''The Little Mermaid''.  A voice-over at the end of the episode by [[Kenneth Mars]], who voices King Triton, talks about the real Hans Christian Andersen, while the image on-screen is of Ariel sitting on a rock in the style of the Little Mermaid statue in [[Copenhagen]] harbor. This meta situation is repeated in ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' episode "Tarzan and the Mysterious Visitor" where Tarzan meets his author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] who travels to Africa in search of inspiration for a new novel.

'''The Muppets Studio, LLC''', formerly '''The Muppets Holding Company, LLC''', is a wholly owned entertainment subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products]], formed in 2004 through [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s acquisition of [[The Muppets]] and ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' [[intellectual properties]] from [[The Jim Henson Company]].

==Background==
In the late-1980s, [[Jim Henson]] had been in talks with Disney [[CEO]] [[Michael Eisner]] to sell [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions]] to the Walt Disney Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Givens|first=Bill|title=The Mouse &amp; The Frog|url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/archives/1990_mouse_frog.shtml|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=Spring 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1989, the two officially announced a deal for Disney to purchase Jim Henson Productions for $150 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swansburg|first1=John|title=Muppet Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/jim-henson-the-biography-by-brian-jay-jones.html?_r=0|accessdate=September 28, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal fell through several months after Jim Henson's death in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287872,00.html|archiveurl= |archivedate= |title=The Death of Jim Henson |first=Ty|last=Burr|date=1997-05-16 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the collapse of the merger deal, by 1992, Disney and Jim Henson Productions had already struck a number of deals:
*Exclusive domestic rights to Henson theme park attractions in the western U.S. until May 1994 plus 2 year non-exclusively, including the design of two Muppet attractions at [[Walt Disney World]]
*[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Video]]'s worldwide distribution rights to Henson's 300 hours of programming and a financing deal for up to 3 home video projects
*Certain cable television distribution rights for [[Disney Channel]] until 1997
*International distribution rights for existing TV programming in free broadcast, cable or pay-per-view markets
*Theatrical distribution for ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992) and ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996)
*[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|''Dinosaurs'']] co-production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jim Henson's Children Put Together a String of Big Deals to Keep Alive|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1992-07-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/business/fi-5359_1_jim-henson|accessdate=2010-10-18|first=David|last=Willman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1996, the Jim Henson Company produced ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which had just been acquired by Disney.&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title='Muppets' Revived at ABC With 'Big Bang Theory' Co-Creator|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/muppets-revived-at-abc-big-786193|accessdate=April 6, 2015|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Henson family subsequently sold the entirety of the Jim Henson Company to German conglomerate [[Constantin Medien|EM.TV]] in 2000. In 2003, the Henson family repurchased The Jim Henson Company from EM.TV.&lt;ref name="NYT Muppets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Fuzzy Renaissance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/movies/21barn.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Muppets Holding Company===
Eisner, still interested in the Muppet properties, re-opened negotiations with the Hensons and announced the purchase of ''The Muppets'' and ''Bear in the Big Blue House'' assets from [[The Jim Henson Company]] for $75 million on February 17, 2004.&lt;ref name="NYT Muppets"/&gt;  The acquired Muppet assets were then placed into The Muppets Holding Company with Chris Curtin as general manager within [[Disney Consumer Products]].&lt;ref name=THRMuppets&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Kim|title=Kermit as Mogul, Farting Fozzie Bear: How Disney's Muppets Movie Has Purists Rattled|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-muppets-jason-segel-amy-adams-jim-henson-250805?page=3|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=20 October 2011|pages=3 of 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new website was launched in November 2004 and the Muppets made an appearance on the 2004 Christmas episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt;

The first Muppet production under full Disney control, ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', went into production immediately and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in May 2005.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney's plan to relaunch the Muppets|url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2005/051905.shtml|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Muppet Central.com|date=May 19, 2005|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2005, Animal and Pepe the King Prawn made appearance on The [[X Games]] 11 Preview show of All Access on [[ESPN2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cave|first1=Steve|title=THE MUPPETS GET A TASTE OF THE X GAMES|url=http://skateboard.about.com/od/events/a/XGames11Muppets.htm|website=About Sports|publisher=About.com|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bear's first appearance under Disney's control was in the reality show, ''[[Breakfast With Bear]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=dn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosby|first1=Sherry Joe|title=When a Bear Comes to Breakfast|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133427545.html|accessdate=February 24, 2015|work=Daily News|publisher=HighBeam Research.|date=November 25, 2013|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fiftieth birthday tour for Kermit, "Kermit's World Tour" was planned with leadership changes made just days before the tour began.  The tour made its initial three stops before being canceled: [[Kermit, Texas]],  [[Johnson Space Center]] tour and cake with [[The Rockettes]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]], NYC.&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt; Following Eisner's exit from Disney, new CEO [[Bob Iger]] removed the head of the Muppets Holding Company and several senior staff members hand-picked by Eisner.&lt;ref name=jhm&gt;{{cite news|last=Jim|first=Hill|title=Monday MouseWatch : Will the third time be the charm with Disney's Muppet revival project?|url= http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2007/04/30/monday-mousewatch-will-the-third-time-be-the-charm-for-disney-s-muppet-revival-project.aspx |accessdate=20 February 2013 |newspaper=jimhillmedia.com |date=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muppets Holding Company was then paired with [[Baby Einstein]] (before it was acquired by [[Kids II, Inc.]] in 2013) under Senior Vice President and General Manager R. Russell Hampton, Jr.&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbw&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suddath|first1=Claire|title=Meep Meep TV|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/new-muppets-sitcom-looks-to-take-prime-time|accessdate=September 29, 2015|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC, in October 2005, commissioned ''America's Next Muppet'', a script and five script outlines,&lt;ref name=vty&gt;{{cite web | last = Schneider  | first = Michael| title = Muppets pull strings at ABC  | publisher = Variety  | date = 2005-10-25  | url = https://variety.com/2005/scene/news/muppets-pull-strings-at-abc-1117931517/ | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Muppets' may return to primetime TV|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-10-25-muppets_x.htm|accessdate=February 24, 2015|work=USA Today|agency=AP|date=October 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ABC was reluctant to green light ''America's Next Muppet'',&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt; and it never got out of the planning stage.&lt;ref name="NYT Muppets"/&gt; Muppet Holding's new general manager instead licensed the Muppets out to [[TF1]], a French television network, to produce ''Muppet TV'' in September 2006.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{cite web   | last =James  | first =Alison | title =Les Muppets on a French roll  | publisher = Variety  | date =September 17, 2006 | url = https://variety.com/2006/scene/news/les-muppets-on-a-french-roll-1117950189/# | accessdate = November 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Muppets Studio===
In 2006, the Muppets Holding Company was transferred from the Disney Consumer Products unit to [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|The Walt Disney Studios]]; with studio executives passing on oversight, the unit was placed in the special events group.&lt;ref name="NYT Muppets"/&gt;&lt;ref name=THRMuppets/&gt; That same year, Disney contracted with [[Puppet Heap]] to rebuild, maintain, and create puppet characters for the Muppets Studio. In April 2007, the Muppets Holding Company changed its name to The Muppets Studio under new leadership by Special Events Group [[Senior vice president|SVP]] Lylle Breier.&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt;

In 2008, The Muppets Studio began a licensing agreement with [[F.A.O. Schwarz]], to create a Muppet-themed boutique where customers can design their own Muppet.&lt;ref name="NYT Muppets"/&gt; In 2013, [[Disney Theatrical Productions]] revealed that a show based on The Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by [[Thomas Schumacher]] to see how the technical components would work out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Gordon|title=Disney Theatrical Eyeing Muppets On Stage |url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/news/disney-theatrical-eyeing-muppets-on-stage-exclusive-1200495467/|accessdate=June 12, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was transferred in 2014 to Disney's new media unit, [[Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media]], specifically DCPI Labs.&lt;ref name=bbw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyle Laughlin |url= https://www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/Home/display.jsp?contentId=dcp_home_executives_global_kyle_laughlin |website= disneyconsumerproducts.com |publisher=Disney Consumer Products|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, 2015, a series of shorts named ''Muppets Moments'' premiered on [[Disney Junior]].

Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media became part of [[Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products]] in a March 2018 company reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Christine|title=Disney announces strategic reorganization, effective immediately|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/disney-announces-strategic-reorganization-effective-immediately.html|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=CNBC|date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Bolivar diGriz''', alias "'''Slippery Jim'''" and "'''The Stainless Steel Rat'''", is a fictional character and the [[antihero]] of a series of [[comic science fiction]] [[novels]] written by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]].

==Description==
'''James Bolivar diGriz''' goes by many aliases, including "'''Slippery Jim'''" and "'''The Stainless Steel Rat'''". He is a futuristic [[confidence trick|con man]], [[thief]], and all-round rascal. He is charming and quick-witted. He is also a master of disguise and martial arts, an accomplished bank robber, a criminal mastermind, an expert on breaking and entering, and (perhaps most usefully) a skilled liar. Master of self-rationalization, the Rat frequently justifies his crimes by arguing that he is providing society with entertainment; and besides which, he only steals from institutions that have [[insurance]] coverage. He displays a strong sense of morality, albeit in a much more restricted sense than is traditional. For example, diGriz will steal without compunction, but deplores killing.

The character was introduced in Harrison's short story "The Stainless Steel Rat", first published in 1957 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding]]'' magazine. The story introduces the Rat, who has just carried out a successful larceny operation, and subsequently details a complex bank robbery the Rat pulls off with ease; however, he is outfoxed by the mysterious "Special Corps" &amp;mdash; a crime-fighting organisation staffed with former criminals &amp;mdash; and recruited by them in order to fight crime. Harrison used the story, with minor modifications, as the introduction to the series' first full-length novel, also called ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat (novel)|The Stainless Steel Rat]]''. Like other characters created by Harrison, the Rat is a speaker of [[Esperanto]] and advocates [[atheism]].

==Books==
There are 13 works in the Stainless Steel Rat series.

| colspan="4" | Jim believes he has pulled off a successful bank job, but is out-conned into working for the Special Corps, the elite law-enforcement and [[spy]] agency led by the former greatest crook in the Galaxy, Harold P. Inskipp, and composed mostly of ex-criminals like himself. He believes he has escaped from the Corps, and meets his love interest, Angelina - also a criminal genius, but lacking in Jim's relatively high moral codes and strictures against killing. She is attempting to have an illegal space battleship built on an otherwise peaceful planet. Angelina was born unattractive and committed crimes to pay for her transformation into a beautiful woman; her psychological traumas are treated when Jim captures her, but she retains her allure and her criminal tendencies and joins in the Special Corps.

: ''The Stainless Steel Rat Omnibus'' (2008) anthologized the first three books:  {{ISBN|978-0-575-08171-0}} (Gollancz)

Based on information in ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' it is possible to work out when the timeline is set:  James is sent 32,598 years into the past to 1975, making events happen in and around 34,573 (in the [[Far future in science fiction and popular culture|346th century]]) – although Professor Coypu also mentions that they are now using a different calendar to the [[Gregorian calendar]].  Specifics of the new calendar are never mentioned.

==Spin-offs==

===Comics===
''The Stainless Steel Rat'', ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'' were adapted into comic strip form in early issues of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', written by [[Kelvin Gosnell]] and drawn by [[Carlos Ezquerra]]. Ezquerra drew Jim with an appearance modelled on the actor [[James Coburn]]. They appeared in the following issues of ''2000 AD'':

* ''The Stainless Steel Rat'', 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 140–151 (Nov. 1979 to Feb. 1980).
* ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'', 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 166–177 (June to Sep. 1980).
* ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', 12 episodes, 2000 AD progs 393–404 (Nov. 1984 to Feb. 1985).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/2kad7.html 2000AD Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of The Stainless Steel Rat in prog 140 was supposed to be preceded with a brief panel of explanation of who Jim was. However, an editorial error meant that the panel actually appeared at the end of the first episode, not the beginning. This prompted a letter to be printed in prog 148 from Harry Harrison himself pointing out the error, for which he won £3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacManus|first=Steve|title=The Mighty One: My Life in the Nerve Centre|year=2016|publisher=Rebellion|isbn=978-1-78108-475-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These three stories were colorized and reprinted by [[Eagle Comics]] in 1985 and 1986 as a six-issue limited series.

They were also collected in a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in July 2010 ({{ISBN|1906735514}}).

===Books===

====Gamebook====
Harrison also produced a [[gamebook]] in the style of the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] and [[Fighting Fantasy]] series, called ''You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat'' ({{ISBN|0-441-94978-9}}), the reader being told that their decisions would "determine whether he or she can find Prof. Geisteskrank on the planet Skraldespand&lt;ref&gt;"Skraldespand" being the Danish word for garbage can.&lt;/ref&gt; and bring him back before he activates a lethal new weapon". The reader generally cannot fail in this mission, regardless of his or her choices, although it is possible to get caught in an inescapable [[wiktionary:loop|loop]] at one point.

====Cameos====
In the tribute anthology ''[[Foundation's Friends]]'', Harrison wrote a story, ''The Fourth Law of Robotics'', which featured the Stainless Steel Rat in the setting of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]].

===Board game===
''The Return of the Stainless Steel Rat'', a [[board game]] inspired by the character, was published by [[Simulations Publications|SPI]] in their magazine ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares]]'' in the late 1970s. Designed by [[Greg Costikyan]], the game involved the Rat infiltrating a [[space station]] under hostile control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3531/the-return-of-the-stainless-steel-ra Boardgamegeek.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
===Angelina diGriz===
'''Angelina diGriz''' is a criminal mastermind much like the Rat, only less ethical and more willing to kill. As the Rat's first case for the Special Corps, he tracks Angelina down and ends up falling in love with her. After her capture, she undergoes [[psychosurgery|psycho surgery]] (not to be mistaken for "[[psychic surgery]]") to lessen her homicidal tendencies and she also joins the Corps; during that time she begins a relationship with the Rat that ends with them marrying in the last [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]] of her pregnancy. She later assists on many of the Rat's adventures, often providing advice and solutions that Jim himself is unable to see. While she is no longer a heartless killer, her suppressed homicidal tendencies occasionally come out, especially when she sees another woman in close proximity to her husband.

===James and Bolivar diGriz===
'''James''' and '''Bolivar diGriz''' are the twin sons of the Rat and Angelina. The Rat missed the first six years of their life because of his adventures in time, but they share their father's attitudes and many of his skills. They end up marrying the same woman, who falls in love with both of them and gets herself duplicated into two identical women sharing one mind.

===Harold Peters Inskipp===
'''Harold Peters Inskipp''' is the director of the Special Corps and one of the most powerful men in the Galaxy. He recruits the Rat, but is frequently infuriated by his insubordinate attitude and tendency to go rogue - committing independent crimes for sheer enjoyment. The Special Corps is composed almost entirely of former criminals&amp;mdash;Inskipp himself was a legendary fugitive known as "Inskipp the Uncatchable" before being recruited and eventually becoming the Corps' commander.

===Professor Coypu===
One of the few Special Corp members not taken from the criminal fraternity, '''Professor Coypu''' is a [[boffin]] who had developed a Time Helix device permitting [[time travel]] as well as a portal to [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]]. He also has a great deal of general scientific knowledge, and sent a copy of his mind with the Rat on his excursion to the 20th century to enable Jim to build a time helix and return to his native time.  Coypu is rarely described, apart from having prominent [[Malocclusion|buck teeth]] - a trait he shares with his namesake, the [[Coypu]], or "nutria".

===The Bishop===
'''The Bishop''' was a master criminal on ''Bit O'Heaven'', the Stainless Steel Rat's home planet. He was a lot less physical in his capers than Jim but undertook robberies, always leaving as his [[Calling card (crime)|calling card]] a picture of the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] chess piece. He retired from robbery before Jim was born, focusing instead on computer crime, and Jim only learnt of his existence from a fellow prisoner while briefly in jail.  Jim then contacted The Bishop by using his calling card in a robbery, however as a result The Bishop was forced out of retirement when he underestimated the Police's computer security systems after running a check on Jim himself. The Bishop eventually became Jim's mentor and taught him a great deal about their trade, as well as a code of ethics. Eventually Jim and The Bishop had to leave ''Bit O'Heaven'' and on their first off-planet adventure The Bishop was killed. As a parting gift he left Jim a note that he signed with his real name, although the name is not revealed to the reader.

===The Kekkonshiki===
'''The Kekkonshiki''', also known as "The Gray Men", are a human culture who initially prefer domination to coexistence. Their expertise lies in using technology to manipulate sentient minds, and they have manipulated both humans and aliens on a grand scale. Jim has experienced one of their techniques (in which a gray man agent seemingly severs his hands with an axe; this was an illusion). Jim has knowingly opposed them on two separate occasions (''The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge'' &amp; ''The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You'') however during conversation it is revealed by Kome that prior to ''The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You'' Jim has in fact thwarted their plans twice already, making this their third encounter. The text can also be read to say that the second time he thwarted their plans was with the alien invasion so the third encounter also happened during ''The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You'' when Jim invaded their home planet. They live on a harsh, icy world; this existence forced them to eliminate all emotion from their culture. This society is also completely patriarchal, with women being treated as nothing more than property. During Jim's interactions with Hanasu - a disgraced Kekkonshiki council leader - he persuades them to reinterpret their teachings, and they embark on a more peaceful co-existence with the rest of humanity. (Incidentally "Kekkonshiki" is the romanization of the Japanese word for "Marriage Ceremony" 結婚式.)

==In popular culture==
The [[MIT class ring]], commonly referred to as "The Brass Rat", when cast in [[Celestrium]] (also known as jeweler's steel) is often referred to as "The Stainless Steel Rat" in reference to The Stainless Steel Rat series.

The Chinese activist [[Liu Di]], writing under the screen name "Stainless Steel Rat" (不锈钢老鼠), became a high-profile symbol for democracy and free speech in China since her detention in November 2002. Her screen name is often translated as Stainless Steel Mouse.

In ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV Series)|The Librarians]]'' episode "And the Happily Ever Afters", Flynn Carsen refers to Ezekiel Jones, a thief, "master of technologies" as the "Stainless Steel Rat".

==Reception==
''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the first novel four stars out of five, saying "though pure entertainment, [it] underlines SF's role in providing speculative thought about potential problems."&lt;ref name="gale196208"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''Thomas Blaine Mullica''' (August 19, 1948 – February 18, 2016), was an American comedy [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] who performed on television specials, and appeared on TV many times including ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The World's Greatest Magic]]'', ''[[Viva Variety]]'' and ''[[Penn &amp; Teller's Sin City Spectacular|Penn &amp; Teller's Sin City]]''.

One of Mullica's most memorable appearances was on [[Late Night with David Letterman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|uOJ6T2d6mAI|Comic Magician Tom Mullica On Late Nite Talk Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which he performed his popular signature effect of the manipulation and vanishing of several cigarettes in his mouth.

In 1984 Mullica was awarded $5,000 cash for winning the Siegfried &amp; Roy Golden Lion Award at the Magic Desert Seminar in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tommullica.com/|title=Home|work=tommullica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also performed at the [[Just for Laughs| Just for Laughs Comedy Festival]] and toured the US and Canada with RED – A Performance Tribute, a [[Red Skelton]] Tribute show which Mullica wrote and starred in as Skelton and his characters. RED is the only Skelton tribute show authorized by the Skelton Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeltontribute.com/mullica.htm|title=TOM MULLICA|work=skeltontribute.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420205129/http://www.skeltontribute.com/mullica.htm|archivedate=2012-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Mullica helped dedicate the Red Skelton Museum &amp; Education Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamnerbarber.com/2013/07/16/tom-mullica-celebrates-100-years-of-red-skelton/|title=Tom Mullica Celebrates 100 Years Of Red Skelton|date=4 October 2012|work=Hamner Barber Theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was born Thomas Blaine Mullica in [[Waupun, Wisconsin]] on August 19, 1948. When Mullica was five years old, he wanted to be a clown. However, on his seventh birthday his mother bought him a "Sneaky Pete Magic Kit" for Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/tom-mullica.html|title=Tom Mullica - Biography - All About Magicians.Com|work=All About Magicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he graduated from Waupun High School in 1966, he enlisted in the Army at age 18, serving 3 years in Korea and Germany. Once he had finished his military service he moved to Colon, Michigan, where he built illusions and demonstrated magic for Abbott's Magic Company.

Mullica then moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] where he attended bartending school and opened his own nightclub called The Tom-foolery Magic Bar Theater which was open from 1976 until 1987.

Red Skelton visited the Tom-foolery in 1980 and they became fast friends. After the closure of Tom-foolery Mullica asked Skelton for his advice, and Skelton suggested that he take his best material and perform it pantomime to music, which would eliminate any language barrier so that he could perform anywhere in the world. Mullica took Skelton's advice and after six months of rehearsal moved to Paris, France where he worked at the [[Crazy Horse Saloon]].

Mullica returned to the United States in 1991 and continued his comedy magic career. In 1996, he began writing RED (A Performance Tribute) which he performed in theaters throughout America and Canada.

In 2010, Mullica was diagnosed with [[Acute myeloid leukemia|acute myelogenous leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.magician.org/blog/tom-mullica-giving-up-red--returning-to-magic?blogid=176|title=Tom Mullica Giving up Red; Returning to Magic - The International Brotherhood of Magicians|website=www.magician.org|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

'''Trudi Roth''' (2 April 1930 – 11 June 2016) was a Swiss stage and film actress who starred in Swiss German language cinema and television and stage productions.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Basel, Switzerland]], Roth lived in the [[Municipalities in the canton of Zürich|municipality of Zürich]]. Her first stage experiences date back to her childhood as she had a small role at the ''Stadttheater'' Basel in 1939. She attended the ''Konservatorium'' under Ernst Ginsberg in Basel, followed by performances beginning in 1947 with the ''cabaret-doodle-doo'', ''KiKeriKi'' with [[César Keiser]] and [[Cabaret Cornichon]] respectively ''Cabaret Fédéral''. Later she starred in comedies and musicals, and Trudi Roth acted for the radio in radio plays and for the Swiss television.

Roth's most popular role was the character of [[Fascht e Familie#Martha Aebersold (Trudi Roth)|''Martha Aebersold'']] in the Swiss comedy serial ''[[Fascht e Familie]]'' in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="faschtefamilie-martha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/fascht-e-familie/tante-martha|title=Tante Martha|accessdate=7 April 2015|language=German|work=SRF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, Trudi Ruth also starred in about a dozen plays, musicals and farces on [[Bernhard-Theater Zürich]] between 1965 and 2001.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Trudi_Roth|title=Trudi Roth|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|author=Mats Staub|language=German|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudi Roth motivated film director Marie-Louise Bless to create the television film ''[[Das Paar im Kahn]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name="srf-medienmappe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/medien/wp-content/uploads/chronik/upload/Medienmappe-_Das-Paar-im-Kahn__1.pdf.|title=Medienmappe Das Paar im Kahn|publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen SF|author=|language=German|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lewinsky]], creator of ''[[Fascht e Familie]]'', recalls that ''she played every summer the [[Chaschperli]] in Zürich, followed by appearances in films, television series and in the [[Bernhard Theater]]. At the age of 80, she still played a role in his play 'Huusfründe'.''&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160614"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/panorama/people/tante-martha-schweigt-fuer-immer-schauspielerin-trudi-roth-mit-86-jahren-gestorben-130349122|title=Tante Martha schweigt für immer: Schauspielerin Trudi Roth mit 86 Jahren gestorben|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]], in: ''Nordwestschweiz''|author=Dominique Waldmann|language=German|date=2016-06-14|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remembers the long conversations with Trudi Roth: ''It was impossible, to talk briefly with Trudi. When I told my wife, now I call on Trudi she said: 'I'll see you in an hour'.'' Trudi Roth was Charles Lewinsky sympathetic at the first co-operation, above all ''to have the gift of the gab''.&lt;ref name="g&amp;g-Tante Martha ist gestorben"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/play/tv/glanz-amp-gloria/video/glanz--gloria-nimmt-abschied-von-tante-martha-trudi-roth?id=596f7fa3-acb3-4d45-8b21-2218fff67c7e|title="Glanz &amp; Gloria" nimmt Abschied von "Tante Martha" Trudi Roth|publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen SF|language=German|date=12 June 2016|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g&amp;g-wegbegleiter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.srf.ch/sendungen/glanz-und-gloria/wegbegleiter-von-trudi-roth-erinnern-sich-an-die-schauspielerin|title=Wegbegleiter von Trudi Roth erinnern sich an die Schauspielerin|publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen SF|author1=Sandro Sabatini|author2=Michael Gerber|language=German|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
From 1953 to 1957 she lived in Düsseldorf while working for the German ''Kom(m)ödchen'' ensemble; Roth then returned to Basel. With her partner Hans Moeckel, conductor of the Swiss Federal entertainment orchestra, she moved to Zürich in the 1970s. Although in a relationship, she remained single and childless.

== Death ==
In the last years of her life, the actress sometimes did not recognize her brother Alfred, and forgot her former success as an artist. We were very close, "like twins," he said in an interview: ''She had a quirky sense of humor, was never jealous, spoke directly and lived modestly''." As Trudi Roth's family announced to the Swiss television SRF, the actress and cabaret artist died on the night of 11 June 2016 in a nursing home in Zürich. Cause of death was her age of 86, and dementia.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160614"/&gt;

'''Victor Calderone''' (born March 20, 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#!/profile.php?v=info&amp;ref=hpbday&amp;id=890555509 ''Victor's official Facebook page''] on ''[[Facebook]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an American electronic music producer, [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[remix]]er.

==History==
Raised in the [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] section of [[Brooklyn]], Calderone was introduced into [[New York City]]'s nightlife by his older brother, Cesar, who was very active in the club music business. Calderone began to dabble with turntables and other DJ-related equipment at the age of 15. A decade later, in 1991, music mogul [[Seymour Stein]] signed both Calderone and his partner Gene LaFosse (they collaborated on a short-lived techno act called ''Program 2'') to a contract deal with [[Sire Records]]. Shortly after the release of their first album, the group disbanded and Calderone took a self-imposed exile away from the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001214063400/http://www.djtimes.com/original/djmag/nov99/Calderone.htm ''Straight Outta Brooklyn If Madonna Calls DJs Should Listen Victor Calderone Did &amp; His Remixes Helped Propel Him to Global DJ Status''] from ''[[DJ Times]]'' date November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-profile.aspx?id=669 ''Victor Calderone Biography''] from ''www.residentadvisor.net''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time he removed himself from the club music industry, Calderone worked in the restaurant business but eventually was encouraged to work on new projects including his first solo record,''“Give It Up”''. Calderone later returned to #1 spot for two weeks in 2001 with "Are You Satisfied?," featuring vocals by [[Deborah Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Number-one dance hits of 2001 (USA)|''Number One Dance Hits of 2001'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further inspired by New York's then-thriving club scene, Victor landed gigs at many major events in the city. Calderone obtained residencies at both the [[Roxy NYC|Roxy]] in New York and Liquid&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.nightguide.com/data/n100859.htm Miami NightGuide - Liquid]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Miami Beach]]. Victor would then meet and commence a successful relationship with superstar singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 1998. Impressed by Calderone's innovative vision and style, he was commissioned to remix ''[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]'', the first single released from her ''[[Ray of Light]]'' album. Since 1998, he has remixed nine other singles for Madonna.

Following up on Madonna's recommendation, legendary singer [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] selected Calderone to remix his song ''"[[Desert Rose (Sting song)|Desert Rose]],"'' the second single from his 1999 ''[[Brand New Day (Sting album)|Brand New Day]]'' album. The [[United Kingdom|British]] singer did not only hire Calderone to remix the single, which was something he had never done before with his music, but even returned to the studio with him to re-record the vocals to match the remixed song's new dance-oriented rhythms. The song spent an impressive 80 weeks on the Billboard dance charts including nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madonnatribe.com/idol/victor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his work with Madonna and Sting, his credits as remixer includes work for such artists as [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Sarah Brightman]], amongst others.

He has also collaborated with other house music producers—including Mac Quayle and most notably [[Peter Rauhofer]], the first Grammy Award winner in the Dance Music category. Their joint effort, known as [[The Collaboration (music group)|The Collaboration]] released a popular multi-CD set and several hit single tracks.

After a long string of successful albums and singles, Calderone established his Evolve brand in 2005 as a way to coalesce his numerous residencies around the world, including Montreal, Tel Aviv, Bulgaria, and a monthly residency at New York's Pacha. With the Evolve brand now taking off globally, clubgoers have quickly begun to equate the word with joy-inducing, risk-taking sets that shatter musical boundaries and the conventions of what a DJ set “should” be.

==Personal life==
Calderone resides with his wife Athena, and their son in Brooklyn.

'''"Voices from the Other World"''' is a celebrated early [[poem]] by [[James Merrill]] (1926-1995). it marks the poet's first use of transcripts from a [[ouija board]], a trope later explored at great length in the poet's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[epic poem|epic]] "[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]" (1982).

[[File:JamesMerrillDavidJackson1973window.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[James Merrill]] and [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]] at home in [[Athens, Greece]], 14 October 1973. With the help of [[psychic|psychic readings]] transcribed by the couple from a home-made [[ouija board]], Merrill would compose "Voices from the Other World", the first of many poems to explore the ouija board conceit. (Photograph by Judith Moffett)]]
The poem, written in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] plural, consists of nine irregularly-rhymed five-line stanzas. The (unnamed) narrators of the poem are Merrill and his partner [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]], who together &amp;mdash; after a Ouija board had been given to Merrill as a present by his friend [[Frederick Buechner]] in the early 1950s &amp;mdash; would conduct hundreds of private [[séance]] sessions over the course of nearly four decades, an undertaking Merrill would come to mine extensively for "material." In this early [[Spirit|spiritual]] encounter, the ouija board voices warn Merrill and Jackson of the perils of speaking with the dead, though by poem's end the two mediums have been lulled into a sense of nonchalance about the enterprise.

"Voices from the Other World" was first published in book form in ''The Country of a Thousand Years of Peace'' (1959).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4932">'''Yasmeen Godder''' ({{lang-he|יסמין גודר}}), born in 1973, is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[choreographer]] and dancer.

==Biography==
Yasmeen was born and raised until the age of 14 in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. As a child, she danced at Professor Hasia Levi-Agron's class, and [[ballet]] at Yaakov Lipshitz's in Jerusalem. Her first performance was an end-of-year dance at [[Jerusalem International YMCA|YMCA Jerusalem]], when she was 6 years old.
In 1984, at the age of 11, Yasmeen and her family moved to [[New York City]]. She graduated from the [[High School of the Performing Arts]] there, and received a scholarship at the [[Martha Graham School]] in New York City, where she would dance every Saturday when she was 14 to 17. Her first creation was heavily inspired off of Admon Zabes' letters. Upon finishing her studies, she returned to Israel, though returned to the [[United States]] for her academic studies, and received her BA in concert dance from the ]]Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1997, where she presented her works for the first time, and at the same time studied in other institutions outside Tisch as well, among them Movement Center, where many concert dance teachers and artists with diverse opinions gather and discuss controversial concert dance issues.

Yasmeen finished her academic studies in 1997, and since then has been presenting her works in various places. The first place where she danced and presented her works was at [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]] Arts Exchange. Following, she was invited to present her works at Duncan Center in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. During her final year at Tisch, she worked on her piece ''A Car and a Bandage''. Then, she created two new pieces, the solo pieces ''Ina's Wall'' and ''Ring Ding Round Zero''.

Since 1999, she has been living in [[Tel Aviv]]. Her works have regularly been presented at the [[Suzanne Dellal Center]] in Tel Aviv, and extensively throughout the world, for example at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] Festival in New York, [[Hebbel am Ufer]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Place Theatre]] in [[London]], Montpellier Dance Festival in [[France]], and many more. To date, Yasmeen has created a total of 8 long works (over 1 hour long) and 6 short ones (up to 45 minutes long), including "Green Fields" for the Batsheva Ensemble and "UNDER2", a Matanicola Production in Berlin. The company had recently won the Ministry of Culture's Prize for Small Ensemble for the performance of Singular Sensation. In 2014, Godder created her first site-specific choreography for the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, Israel as part of the exhibition 'Set in Motion' (co-curated by Drorit Gur Arie, and Avi Feldman). Following the exhibition, the first artist book dedicated to the work of Godder was published under the title: 'Extremum - Reflections on the Works of Yasmeen Godder'.

Yasmeen is the artistic director of her dance company, where she teaches concert dance since her return to Israel. She has taught concert dance in several art schools in Israel, among them the [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance]] and Bikurei HaItim in Tel Aviv. In 2007, she established the Yasmeen Godder Studio at the Mendel Culture Center in [[Jaffa]], and to this day all of her activity is based there, as well as it being where the company's offices are situated, where the company mainly rehearses, and where she mainly teaches nowadays.

It was released for download through content delivery service [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 21 April, {{vgy|2009}}. The Xbox 360 version, entitled ''Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition'', was released 5 May 2010 and contains additional features not found in the PC version.

The PC version of the game was favorably received and received an aggregate score of 77/100 on [[Metacritic]] and 77.50% on [[GameRankings]]. The Xbox 360 version was also praised and gained an average 74/100 at Metacritic and 75.46% at GameRankings. Critics praised its strange yet robust setting and unique character designs. It was a finalist for Excellence in Visual Art at the 2009 [[Independent Games Festival]], was named 2009's Independent Game of the Year by ''[[PC Gamer]]'', and PC Game of the Month by [[IGN]] in April 2009.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Zeno Clash - Fight.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of the game in first-person perspective. The player is engaged in battle with several enemies in a forest.|''Zeno Clash'' places a heavy emphasis on first-person combat.]]
In the main story mode, players assume the role of Ghat and progress through the world of Zenozoik, visiting various locations in a linear sequence. Gameplay is presented in [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with occasional [[cutscene]]s in [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]]. When the player enters certain areas, it triggers a [[scripted sequence]], initiating a battle in which the player must defeat all enemies to proceed. Ghat is proficient in martial arts, and can dodge or counter enemy attacks. While there is a strong focus on unarmed combat, Ghat can also obtain unconventional melee and ranged weapons by several means, such as disarming enemies. Intermittent segments of the game play similarly to a linear progression shooter.&lt;ref name=rpsreview&gt;{{cite web | title=World Exclusive: The Zeno Clash Review | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/04/19/world-exclusive-the-zeno-clash-review/ | first=Gillen | last=Kieron |author2=Meer, Alec |author3=Rossignol, Jim |author4= Walker, John | publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | date=19 April 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash | url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/959/959787.html | author=Staff | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the single-player story, Challenge Mode allows the player to defeat enemies while climbing a tower or descending into a pit. The results are ranked through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] every time the player beats a tower floor's final [[boss (video gaming)|boss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash's Survival Mode | url=http://blogs.aceteam.cl/zenoclash/index.php?showentry=18 | last=Bordeu | first=Andre | publisher=[[ACE Team]] | date=25 February 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
[[File:Zeno Clash - Father-Mother.jpg|thumb|Father-Mother]]
The story takes place in a fictional fantasy world called Zenozoik, and begins in a town called Halstedom. The game commences with Ghat, the game's protagonist, regaining consciousness after setting off an explosion which kills Father-Mother, an ostensibly [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] creature, which has raised a large and influential family. Ghat is one of Father-Mother's children, who turned on it after discovering its secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Return | quote='''Golem''': It is by chance and not virtue, that Ghat discovered a flaw in Father-Mother. After that both Ghat's an Father-Mother's reaction was irrational and violent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghat runs away from the town,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Return | quote='''Golem''': After Ghat fought Father-Mother he ran away.}}&lt;/ref&gt; chased by his brothers and sisters seeking to kill him, and is banished from his family. He is accompanied by a female companion named Deadra who has saved Ghat from apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash. Interview with Carlos Bordeu | url=http://playhard.ru/Article.aspx?id=3218 | author=Unicorn | publisher=PlayHard | date=23 April 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Return | quote='''Golem''': And you, Deadra, were most kind, saving him from apathy and searching for safety with him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their travels away from Halstedom, Ghat explains to Deadra through partially interactive flashbacks the events that led up to his attempt on Father-Mother's life. One of the first things that is mentioned is that he lived for a time with the Corwid of the Free, the insane residents of the forests of Zenozoik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Zeno Clash trailer | url=http://blogs.aceteam.cl/zenoclash/index.php?showentry=25 | last=C | first=David | publisher=ACE Team | date=9 April 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=The Corwid of the Free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, Deadra and Ghat reach a large desert area. When Ghat returns from hunting rabbit-like creatures, he discovers a blind mercenary known only as the Hunter, who points a rifle at Deadra's head while she sleeps. The Hunter reveals that he was sent after them by Ghat's family, and was instructed to kill both him and Deadra. Ghat pleads for her life, and the Hunter agrees to let her live if Ghat will come to a secluded area with him to fight. Ghat manages to defeat the Hunter and then leaves with Deadra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Hunter Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghat and Deadra eventually reach the end of the world. It is there that they meet Golem, an ancient being placed there by an unknown group of people to wait there until he was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Return | quote='''Golem''': I had a duty to stay there. To watch, to wait. Long before you were born, I was there. .. The people who put me there were wise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golem has a complete knowledge of Ghat and Father-Mother's conflict, which he says he will end, along with all other conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Throne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Ghat's return to the city, he is confronted by his angry brothers and sisters once more. After this confrontation, a heavily wounded Father-Mother reveals itself, showing that it is still alive. It declares another fight with Ghat to end the strife once and for all. A ferocious battle ensues, in which Ghat defeats Father-Mother once more. With Father-Mother at his mercy, he decides neither to kill it, nor reveal its secret. However, Golem discloses the secret anyway&amp;mdash;that Father-Mother is actually a male creature that steals babies from their families. It is revealed that Ghat, upon inadvertently learning this, was chased out of town by Father-Mother in an attempt to protect his secret. The game ends after Golem makes several cryptic statements about their world and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=Zeno Clash | developer=ACE Team | date=21 April 2009 | level=Family Reunion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Zeno Clash - Vs.jpg|thumb|alt=A screenshot of the game, just before a fight commences. Portraits of the characters involved in the battle are shown on opposing sides of the screen.|''Zeno Clash'' uses slide-in versus screens before combat akin to many fighting games.]]
While ''Zeno Clash'' was ACE Team's first original game, they have been developing game [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web | title=Old ACE Team Games | url=http://blogs.aceteam.cl/zenoclash/index.php?showentry=30 | last=Bordeu | first=Edmundo | publisher=ACE Team | date=30 April 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their last project, ''Zenozoik'', was far larger in scope than ''Zeno Clash'', and attempted to incorporate the disparate elements of shooting, [[role-playing games|role-playing]], melee combat and [[sandbox game]]play. ACE Team later realized that it was too ambitious for a small independent studio, and decided to make a more focused game. ''Zeno Clash'' is what emerged&amp;mdash;player exploration is linear, and role-playing elements were excluded altogether.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The game was initially conceived as a total conversion modification using the [[Source engine]]. ACE Team showed a demo version to Valve, the creators of the engine, who were impressed by the game's quality. The two companies then negotiated an engine licensing and distribution deal.&lt;ref name=zillion /&gt;&lt;ref name=rps&gt;{{cite web | title=Unknown Pleasures 2009: Zeno Clash | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/01/30/unknown-pleasures-2009-zeno-clash/ | last=Walker | first=John | publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun | date=30 January 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, the developers have stated that they consider the game to be a "First-Person Fighter (with some shooter elements)". They also likened it to "[[Dark Messiah of Might and Magic|Dark Messiah]] meets [[Double Dragon]]", and stated that they have drawn a lot of inspiration from traditional fighting games&amp;mdash;this includes "versus screens" sliding in before combat is initiated.&lt;ref name=zillion&gt;{{cite web | title=ACE Team – Game development at World's end | url=http://www.zillionmonkey.com/?page_id=209 | publisher=ZillionMonkey | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the art style, they cited [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s paintings and [[John Blanche]]'s "punk fantasy" illustrations as visual inspirations.&lt;ref name=rps /&gt; They stated that publishers were unsure if consumers could relate to the art direction, but nonetheless stuck to their vision, creating a game that looks unlike anything else on the market.&lt;ref name=gamasutra&gt;{{cite web | title= Postmortem: ACE Team's ''Zeno Clash'' | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4156/postmortem_ace_teams_zeno_clash.php | last=Bordeu | first=Carlos | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | date=8 October 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get their desired organic look, they used static props exported from [[3D Studio Max]] with pre-rendered lighting instead of using brush-based geometry that Source was specialized for.&lt;ref name=gamasutra /&gt;

On October 2009, ACE Team announced that they partnered with [[Atlus]] to release a port of the game for [[Xbox Live Arcade]].&lt;ref name="xbla announcement"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=14 December 2010 |publisher=ACE Team |url=http://forums.aceteam.cl/index.php?s=1a5d1dcf4f9954fd980b21008bcc295e&amp;autocom=blog&amp;blogid=2&amp;showentry=38 |title=Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition for XBLA announced |date=1 October 2009 |first=Carlos |last=Bordeu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the game dubbed ''Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition'' adds new game modes and features such as [[cooperative gameplay]] for tower challenges in both offline and online games, new attacks, new weapons, a new voice actress for the character Deadra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=14 December 2010 |publisher=ACE Team |url=http://forums.aceteam.cl/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1159&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=8693 |title=New voice acting for Deadra? |date=10 March 2010 |first=Carlos |last=Bordeu |quote=Yes, correct.

In July 2009 [[source code]] of the game to allow easier modding was released by the developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2009/07/29/zeno-clash-devs-release-source-code-to-all/ Zenoclash devs release source code] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing and release ==
The game was first released for download through Valve's content delivery service, [[Steam (software)|Steam]], on 21 April 2009, and is available for purchase either directly through Steam or via Direct2Drive. It was published for retail by Noviy Disk in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash | url=http://www.giantbomb.com/zeno-clash/61-22011/ | publisher=[[Giant Bomb]] | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Iceberg Interactive in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Iceberg Interactive announces 2009 UK Q4 Line-Up | url=http://www.iceberg-interactive.com/index.php/news-mainmenu-33/1-latest/104-iceberg-interactive-announces-2009-uk-q4-line-up | publisher=Iceberg Interactive | date=10 September 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, [[Tripwire Interactive]] announced that it planned to publish the game for retail in [[North America]] "soon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tripwire Brings Zeno Clash To Retail | url=http://kotaku.com/5374615/tripwire-brings-zeno-clash-to-retail | last=Fahey | first=Mike | publisher=[[Kotaku]] | date=5 October 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlus]] has announced that they will be bringing an Ultimate Edition of the game to the [[Xbox 360]] as an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] download in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition Coming to Xbox Live | url=http://kotaku.com/5371627/zeno-clash-ultimate-edition-coming-to-xbox-live | last=Good | first=Owen | publisher=Kotaku | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACE Team continued to provide support post-release, releasing character models for use with another Source engine game, [[Garry's Mod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Zeno-Garry Collective | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/05/12/the-zeno-garry-collective/ | last=Meer | first=Alec | publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun | date=12 May 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; several new Challenge levels as free [[downloadable content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash Gets New DLC, Goes On Sale To Celebrate | url=http://kotaku.com/5302313/zeno-clash-gets-new-dlc-goes-on-sale-to-celebrate | last=Plunkett | first=Luke | publisher=Kotaku | date=24 June 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[software development kit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Punch!

''Zeno Clash'' received some press for its developers' reaction to [[copyright infringement]]. ACE Team member Carlos Bordeu left comments on many torrent sites saying that ACE Team did not intend to stop the unlicensed downloading of ''Zeno Clash'', but rather implored downloaders to purchase the game if they enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash Dev Tries Reasoning with Torrenters | url=http://kotaku.com/5237036/zeno-clash-dev-tries-reasoning-with-torrenters | last=Good | first=Owen |publisher=Kotaku | date=2 May 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Game Developer Flirts With Pirates on BitTorrent Sites | url=http://torrentfreak.com/game-developer-flirts-with-pirates-on-bittorrent-sites-090427/ | author=enigmax | publisher=TorrentFreak | date=27 April 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACE Team later claimed that their unique approach, while probably not changing the minds of potential infringers, accidentally generated press which helped to market the product.&lt;ref name=gamasutra /&gt;

The unique visual design and story received high praise from most critics. The reviewers from Rock, Paper, Shotgun stated that while the art of the game was "really unusual to look at" they felt that the visuals were "something of a reward".&lt;ref name=rpsreview /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Pearson called the game's environments "lushly crafted and massively colourful".&lt;ref name=eurogamer&gt;{{cite web| title = Zeno Clash Review | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/zeno-clash-review|accessdate = 23 April 2009|date=22 April 2009|publisher=Eurogamer | first = Dan | last = Pearson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamin Smith, reviewer for [[Videogamer.com]] felt that the "narrative that was (probably) conjured up during an intense drug induced trip."&lt;ref name="vg review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/zeno_clash_ultimate_edition/review.html |publisher=[[Videogamer.com]] |accessdate=20 January 2011 |title=Zeno Clash Ultimate Edition Review |first=Jamin |last=Smith |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to call the game world "incredibly cohesive" and stated that the story provided a perfect compliment to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="vg review" /&gt; Jason Ocampo of [[IGN]] remarked in his review that "thanks to smart design and storytelling, it feels refreshingly original and completely compelling."&lt;ref name=IGNrev&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeno Clash Review | url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/976/976395p1.html | last=Ocampo | first=Jason | publisher=IGN| date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers were divided on gameplay aspects. [[1UP.com]]'s Scott Sharkey felt that the first-person fisticuffs were convincing when combined with camera motion; he compared such aspects to ''[[Mirror's Edge]]''.&lt;ref name="1up review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3179150&amp;p=4 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |first=Scott |last=Sharkey |accessdate=20 January 2011 |date=5 May 2010 |title=Zeno Clash XBLA Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eduardo Reboucas of [[Game Revolution]] felt that the trigger-based controls of the ''Ultimate Edition'' took some getting used to and that some encounters with enemies can occasionally become frustrating.&lt;ref name="gamervew review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/xbox360/zeno-clash-ultimate-edition |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=20 January 2011 |title=Zeno Clash Ultimate Edition - Xbox360 |date=13 May 2010 |first=Eduardo |last=Reboucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Ocampo of IGN felt that the hand-to-hand combat was "a bit clumsy, but wholly satisfying at the same time."&lt;ref name=IGNrev /&gt; Brett Todd of [[GameSpot]] was less favorable, calling it "simplistic" and "monotonous," citing its lack of variety in gameplay.&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web| title = Zeno Clash Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/zenoclash/review.html|accessdate = 6 May 2009|date=22 May 2009|publisher=[[GameSpot]]| first = Brett | last = Todd }}&lt;/ref&gt;
