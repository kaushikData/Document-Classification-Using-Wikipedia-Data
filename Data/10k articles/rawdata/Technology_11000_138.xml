An '''A-frame''' is a basic structure designed to bear a load in a lightweight economical manner. The simplest form of an A-frame is two similarly sized beams, arranged in an angle of 45 degrees or less, attached at the top. These materials are often wooden or steel beams attached at the top by rope, [[welding]], [[Adhesive|gluing]], or [[rivet]]ing. 

[[File:Sawhorse.svg|thumb|150px|A [[sawhorse]] can be formed by connecting two A-frames along the length of a beam]]
A-frames can be used as-is, as part of [[Shear legs|shears]], or set up in a row along a longitudinal beam for added stability, as in a [[saw horse]]. More complex structures will often have [[crossmember]]s connecting the A-frames at different angles,&lt;ref&gt;"A-frame" (2009). ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0). Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; forming a [[truss]].

==Other structures that use A-frames==
* [[A-frame house]]
* A-frame [[hydroponics]] system
* A-frame contour measuring [[spirit level]]
* A frame camping [[tent]]
* [[A-frame complex]], a motif in chemistry
* Folding [[ladder]]
* [[Double wishbone suspension]] (cars)
* Some [[suspension bridge]]s
* Some [[swing bridge]]s
* At the stern of ships for fishing or research
* The main building of Florida's [[Disney's Contemporary Resort]], in which the [[Walt Disney World]] monorail has a station
* Some [[Wienerschnitzel]] and [[Whataburger]] restaurants use the A-frame
* The [[London Eye]] is supported by only one A-frame on one side.
* Some [[beam engine]]s use an A-frame

'''Ammonium permanganate''' is the [[chemical compound]] NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or [[ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]·[[permanganic acid|HMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is soluble in water. It is a strong [[oxidizer]], owing to its [[permanganate]] anion, and it is a moderately strong [[explosive]], owing to the combination of oxidizer permanganate anion and reducing [[ammonium]] cation. Dry ammonium permanganate can [[detonate]] by heat, shock, or friction, and it may explode at temperatures above 140&amp;nbsp;°F (60&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.textfiles.com/science/CHEMICALS/ammonium_permanganate.txt | title = MSDS Chemical Information File: Ammonium Permanganate |date=February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium permanganate decomposes explosively to [[manganese dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], and water:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Manganese |volume=17 |pages=569–571}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Ammonium permanganate was first prepared by [[Eilhard Mitscherlich]] in 1824 by reaction of [[silver permanganate]] with equal molar amount of [[ammonium chloride]], filtering the [[silver chloride]] and evaporating the water. It can be also prepared in a similar way from [[barium permanganate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].

Ammonium permanganate decomposes slowly in storage even at normal temperatures. A sample stored for 3 months was only 96% pure, after 6 months it assumed color of iodine and had strong smell of nitrogen oxides. It emits toxic fumes when decomposed by heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author1 = Seymour M. Kaye | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Explosives and Related Items | volume = 8 | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quaternary ammonium permanganate compounds can be prepared, such as tetrabutylammonium permanganate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://orgprepdaily.wordpress.com/2008/03/16/tetrabutylammonium-permanganate/ | title = Tetrabutylammonium Permanganate | date = March 16, 2008 | author = Org Prep Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=November 2009}}

The '''Bergeron diagram method''' is a method to evaluate the effect of a reflection on an electrical signal. This graphic method—based on the real characteristic of the line—is valid for both linear and non-linear models and helps to calculate the delay of an electromagnetic signal on an electric transmission line.

Using the Bergeron method, on the [[Electric current|I]]-[[Voltage|V]] characteristic chart, start from the regime point before the transition, then move along a straight line with a slope of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the line's [[characteristic impedance]]) to the new characteristic; then move along lines with −''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or +''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; slope until the new regime situation is reached.

The − value is considered always the same at every reflection because the Bergeron method is used only for first reflections.

The method was originally developed by a French hydraulic engineer, [[L. J. B. Bergeron]], for analysing water hammer effects in hydraulic systems.

Blue State Digital has offices in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and [[London]]. In December 2010, Blue State Digital was acquired by [[WPP plc|WPP]].

==History==
Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign pioneered new applications of new media to engage voters and raise campaign funds. In 2004, four former Dean staffers—[[Jascha Franklin-Hodge]], [[Clay Johnson (technologist)|Clay Johnson]], [[Joe Rospars]], and [[Ben Self]]—founded Blue State Digital&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101230005201/en/WPP-Digital-acquires-Blue-State-Digital-LLC|title=WPP Digital acquires Blue State Digital, LLC|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve technology solutions for political campaigns and provide online strategic services to complement the technology platform. The company launched with offices in Washington, DC, and Boston.

The following year, [[Thomas Gensemer]] joined Blue State Digital from [[America Coming Together]], a Democratic-allied advocacy organization, to serve as managing partner.

In 2007, Barack Obama's nascent presidential campaign recruited Blue State Digital to lead its digital efforts. Blue State Digital provided technology services—including web hosting, online fundraising tools, and a custom social networking platform—while Rospars built and led the campaign's internal new media strategy team. Over the course of the campaign, this team raised more than $500 million, mobilized millions of volunteers, and built an online community of 13 million supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Geeks Behind Obama's Web Strategy|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2009/01/08/the_geeks_behind_obamas_web_strategy/|publisher=Boston.com | first=David|last=Talbot|date=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue State Digital grew rapidly after the Obama campaign, opening offices in New York, Los Angeles, and London. It also grew its client base, working with clients like the [[American Red Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue State Digital Takes Over the World|url=http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/blue-state-digital-takes-over-world|publisher=TechPresident}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Way of America|United Way]], [[Carnegie Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web fundraiser that aided Obama acquired|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20101230/FREE/101239994|publisher=Crain's New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall Street Journal: Vogue Sees Web Lessons in Obama’s Campaign|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/11/23/vogue-sees-web-lessons-in-obamas-campaign/|publisher=Wall Street Journal | first=Russell|last=Adams|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2010, Blue State Digital announced that they had been wholly acquired by [[WPP Group|WPP Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluestatedigital.com/blog/entry/wpp-digital-acquires-blue-state-digital-llc/ WPP Digital Acquires Blue State Digital, LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 "Hillary Clinton 1984" YouTube video==
An employee of Blue State Digital, Philip de Vellis, admitted to having created a widely circulated video, "[[Hillary 1984]]," that edited clips from the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Hillary Clinton campaign]] into the famous [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 television advertisement]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. In a blog entry posted on ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', de Vellis indicated that he had resigned from Blue State Digital after making and publishing the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-de-vellis-aka-parkridge/i-made-the-vote-differen_b_43989.html | work=Huffington Post | title=I Made the "Vote Different" Ad | date=28 March 2008 | first1=Phil | last1=de Vellis | first2=Aka | last2=Parkridge47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company later released a statement claiming that they had terminated his employment. De Vellis stated in an interview with the [[Associated Press]] that he had created the video from home and that Blue State Digital had nothing to do with its creation.

The Obama campaign released a statement stating that it had no knowledge of and had nothing to do with the creation of the ad. De Vellis did claim that he helped design the Obama website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/23/nation/na-hillary23 | title=Ad creator claimed role in Obama campaign&amp;nbsp;— Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2014-01-30 | first=Dan | last=Morain | date=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vellis lived with Senator Obama's press secretary in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2977670&amp;page=1 ABC News: Anti-Clinton Ad Maker Lived With Obama Staffer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while they were both working on [[Sherrod Brown]]'s campaign for Senate.

== History ==
Changhong emerged from the Changhong Machinery Factory, which was a [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned]] large enterprise established in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Implementation of China's Science and Technology Policy|last=Yu|first=Q.Y.|publisher=Quorum Books|year=1999|isbn=1567203329|location=Westport, CT|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, which was part of the 156 key projects that were aided by the [[Soviet Union]], focused on the development and production of airborne fire control [[Radar|radar system]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By mid-1970s, Changhong began manufacturing products for civilian use when demand for military hardware declined, eventually focusing on the television product line.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Marketing: Creating Competitive Advantage, 2nd ed.|last=West|first=Douglas|last2=Ford|first2=John|last3=Ibrahim|first3=Essam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199556601|location=Oxford|pages=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next decade, it beefed up its technological capabilities with a series of partnerships with overseas companies such as the Japanese company National, where it imported tubes and advanced production lines to drive the volume production of television.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, the company already boasted the production of over 10,000 television units annually and by 1988, this number rose to almost a million units.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1994, the company was listed as a publicly traded company and, a year later, it was recognized as China's largest television manufacturer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Changhong has a minimal presence in North America, where it sells TVs through the online retailer [[Newegg]].

Another line of products is the manufacturing of [[Nickel–iron battery|nickel–iron batteries]]. Changhong is the sole manufacturer of batteries for the [[Chengdu J-10]].

In 2008, an offer was reportedly made by [[AMD]] for a 15% stake but was blocked by the Chinese government.

A '''civil engineer''' is a person who practices [[civil engineering]] – the application of planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating [[infrastructure]]s while protecting the public and [[environmental health]], as well as improving existing infrastructures that have been neglected.

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines because it deals with constructed environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Civil Engineering?|url = http://civil.columbia.edu/what-civil-engineering|publisher=Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics: Columbia University|accessdate = 17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including planning, designing, and overseeing construction and maintenance of building structures, and facilities, such as roads, railroads, airports, bridges, harbors, channels, dams, irrigation projects, pipelines, power plants, and water and sewage systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172051.htm|title = Civil Engineers|date = May 2014|accessdate = December 2015|website = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "civil [[engineer]]" was established by [[John Smeaton]] in 1750 to contrast engineers working on civil projects with the [[military engineer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Denny (2007). "Ingenium: Five Machines That Changed the World". p. 34. Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Civilized Engineer|last = Florman|first = Samuel|publisher = St. Martin's Griffin|year = 1987|isbn = 978-0-312-02559-5|location = New York|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked on armaments and defenses. Over time, various [[Civil engineering#Sub-disciplines|sub-disciplines]] of civil engineering have become recognized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sub-disciplines of Civil Engineering {{!}} Faculty of Engineering|url = http://engineering.iu.edu.sa/index.php/sub-disciplines-of-civil-engineering/|publisher=Islamic University of Madinah: Faculty of Engineering|accessdate = 17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much of military engineering has been absorbed by civil engineering.{{fact|date=February 2017}}  Other engineering practices became recognized as independent engineering disciplines, including [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]].

In some places, a civil engineer may perform [[land surveying]]; in others, surveying is limited to construction surveying, unless an additional qualification is obtained.

==Specialization==
Civil engineers usually practice in a particular specialty, such as [[construction engineering]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[structural engineering]], [[land development]], [[transportation engineering]], [[hydraulic engineering]], and [[environmental engineering]].  Some civil engineers, particularly those working for government agencies, may practice across multiple specializations, particularly when involved in [[critical infrastructure]] development or maintenance.

[[File:CBQreview.jpeg|thumb|left|While all civil engineers tend to spend at least some time working "on site", much of the modern civil engineering work is done in offices, working with plans or computers.]]

==Work environment==
Civil engineers generally work in a variety of locations and conditions. Many spend time outdoors at construction sites so that they can monitor operations or solve problems onsite.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The job is typically a blend of  in-office and on-location work. Most work full-time.

==Education and licensing==
In most countries, a civil engineer will have graduated from a post-secondary school with a degree in civil engineering, which requires a strong background in [[mathematics]] and the [[physical science]]s; this degree is typically a [[bachelor's degree]], though many civil engineers study further to obtain [[Master's degree|master's]], [[Engineer's degree|engineer]], [[doctoral]] and [[Postdoctoral researcher|post doctoral]] degrees. In many countries, civil engineers are subject to [[licensure]]. In some jurisdictions with mandatory licensing, people who do not obtain a license may not call themselves "civil engineers".

===Belgium ===
In Belgium, ''Civil Engineer'' (abbreviated '''Ir.''') ({{lang-fr|Ingénieur Civil}}, {{lang-nl|Civiel Ingenieur}}) is a legally protected title applicable to graduates of the five-year engineering course of one of the six [[university|universities]] and the Royal Military Academy. Their speciality can be all fields of engineering: [[civil engineering|civil]], [[structural engineering|structural]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]], [[engineering physics|physics]] and even [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facsa.ulg.ac.be/cms/index.php?page=ingenieur-civil-2|title=Faculté des Sciences Appliquées – Ingénieur Civil|publisher=[[University of Liège]]|language=French|accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the title may cause confusion to the English speaker as the Belgian "civil" engineer can have a speciality other than civil engineering. In fact, Belgians use the adjective "civil" in the sense of "civilian", as opposed to military engineers.

The formation of the civil engineer has a strong [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[science|scientific]] base and is more theoretical in approach than the practical oriented [[industrial engineer]] ('''Ing.''') educated in a five-year program at a [[institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|polytechnic]]. Traditionally, students were required to pass an entrance [[exam]] on mathematics to start civil engineering studies. This exam was abolished in 2004 for the [[Flemish Community]], but is still organised in the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]].

===Scandinavia===
In [[Scandinavia]]n countries, civil engineer (civilingenjör (Swedish), sivilingeniør (Norwegian), civilingeniør (Danish)) is a [[first professional degree]], approximately equivalent to [[Master of Science in Engineering]], and a protected title granted to students by selected [[institute of technology|institutes of technology]]. As in English the word has its origin in the distinction between civilian and military engineers, as in before the start of the 19th century only military engineers existed and the prefix "civil" was a way to separate those who had studied engineering in a regular University from their military counterparts. Today the degree spans over all fields within engineering, like civil engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, electronics engineering, etc.

There is generally a slight difference between a Master of Science in Engineering degree and the Scandinavian civil engineer degree, the latter's programme having closer ties with the industry's demands. A civil engineer is the most well-known of the two; still, the area of expertise remains obfuscated for most of the public. A noteworthy difference is the mandatory courses in mathematics and physics, regardless of the equivalent master's degree, e.g. computer science.

Although a 'college engineer' (högskoleingenjör, diplomingenjör/mellaningenjör (Swedish), høgskoleingeniør (Norwegian), diplomingeniør (Danish)) is roughly equivalent to a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor of Science]] in Scandinavia, to become a 'civil engineer' one often has had to do up to one extra year of overlapping studies compared to attaining a B.Sc./M.Sc. combination. This is because the higher educational system is not fully adopted to the international standard graduation system, since it is treated as a [[professional degree]]. Today (2009) this is starting to change due to the [[Bologna process]].

A Scandinavian "civilingenjör" will in international contexts commonly call himself "Master of Science in Engineering" and will occasionally wear an engineering [[class ring]]. At the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), the tradition with an [[NTH Ring]] goes back to 1914, before the Canadian [[iron ring]].

In Norway, the title "Sivilingeniør" is no longer issued after 2007, and has been replaced with "Master i teknologi". In the English translation of the diploma, the title will be "Master of Science", since "Master of Technology" is not an established title in the English-speaking world. The extra overlapping year of studies have also been abolished with this change to make Norwegian degrees more equal to their international counterparts.

===Spain ===
In [[Spain]], a [[civil engineering]] degree can be obtained after four years of study in the various branches of mathematics, physics, mechanics, etc. The earned degree is called ''Grado en Ingeniería Civil''. Further studies at a [[graduate school]] include master's and doctoral degrees.

Before the current situation, that is, before the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in 2010, a degree in civil engineering in Spain could be obtained after three to six years of study and was divided into two main degrees. 
In the first case, the earned degree was called ''Ingeniero Técnico de Obras Públicas'' (''ITOP''), literally translated as "Public Works Engineer" obtained after three years of study and equivalent to a Bachelor of Civil Engineering. 
In the second case, the academic degree was called ''Ingeniero de Caminos, Canales y Puertos'' (often shortened to ''Ingeniero de Caminos'' or ''ICCP''), that literally means "Highways, Canals and Harbors Engineer", though civil engineers in Spain practice in the same fields as civil engineers do elsewhere. This degree is equivalent to a Master of Civil Engineering and is obtained after five or six years of study depending on the school granting the title.

The first Spanish Civil Engineering School was the ''Escuela Especial de Ingenieros de Caminos y Canales'' (now called ''Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos''), established in 1802 in Madrid, followed by the ''Escuela Especial de Ayudantes de Obras Públicas'' (now called ''Escuela Universitaria de Ingeniería Técnica de Obras Públicas de la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid''), founded in 1854 in Madrid. Both schools now belong to the [[Technical University of Madrid]].

In Spain, a civil engineer has the technical and legal ability to design projects of any branch, so any Spanish civil engineer can oversee projects about structures, buildings (except residential structures which are reserved for architects), foundations, hydraulics, the environment, transportation, urbanism, etc.
 
In Spain, [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical]] and [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] engineering tasks are included under the [[Industrial engineering]] degree.

===United Kingdom===
A chartered civil engineer (known as certified or professional engineer in other countries) is a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], and has also passed membership exams. However a non-chartered civil engineer may be a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers or the Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors. The description "Civil Engineer" is not restricted to members of any particular professional organisation although "Chartered Civil Engineer" is.

===Eastern Europe===
In many Eastern European countries, civil engineering does not exist as a distinct degree or profession but its various sub-professions are often studied in separate university faculties and performed as separate professions, whether they are taught in civilian universities or military engineering academies. Even many [[List of institutions using the term "institute of technology" or "polytechnic"|polytechnic]] tertiary schools give out separate degrees for each field of study. Typically study in [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[structural engineering]] and [[urban engineering]] allows a person to obtain a degree in [[construction engineering]]. [[Mechanical engineering]], [[automotive engineering]], [[hydraulics]] and even sometimes [[metallurgy]] are fields in a degree in "Machinery Engineering". [[Computer sciences]], [[control engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] are fields in a degree in electrical engineering, while [[security]], [[safety]], [[environmental engineering]], [[transportation]], [[hydrology]] and [[meteorology]] are in a category of their own, typically each with their own degrees, either in separate university faculties or at polytechnic schools.

===United States===
In the United States, civil engineers are typically employed by municipalities, construction firms, consulting engineering firms, architect/engineer firms, the military, state governments, and the federal government. Each state requires engineers who offer their services to the public to be licensed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying; Licensure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |date=2012-11-01 }}, retrieved November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Licensure is obtained by meeting specified education, examination, and work experience requirements. Specific requirements vary by state.

Typically licensed engineers must graduate from an [[ABET]]-accredited university or college engineering program with a minimum of bachelor's degree,&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Civil_Engineering_Requirements_for_Becoming_a_Civil_Engineer.html Civil Engineering Study.com; Requirements for Becoming a Civil Engineer], retrieved December 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]], obtain several years of engineering experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer, then pass the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam]]. After completing these steps and the granting of licensure by a state board, engineers may use the title "Professional Engineer" or PE in advertising and documents. Most states have implemented mandatory continuing education requirements to maintain a license.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

==Professional associations==

=== ASCE ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10644">'''Controller–pilot data link communications''' ('''CPDLC'''), also referred to as '''controller pilot data link''' ('''CPDL'''), is a method by which [[air traffic controller]]s can communicate with pilots over a [[datalink]] system.

==Necessity==

The standard method of communication between an [[air traffic controller]] and a pilot is voice radio, using either [[Very high frequency|VHF]] bands for line-of-sight communication or [[High frequency|HF]] bands for long-distance communication (such as that provided by [[Shanwick Oceanic Control]]).

One of the major problems with voice radio communications used in this manner is that all pilots being handled by a particular controller are tuned to the same frequency.  As the number of flights air traffic controllers must handle is steadily increasing (for instance, Shanwick handled 414,570 flights in 2007, an increase of 5% - or 22,000 flights - from 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.iaa.ie/index.jsp?a=195&amp;n=211&amp;p=193 | title = Irish Aviation Authority North Atlantic Communications - History | accessdate = 2013-05-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130702090928/https://www.iaa.ie/index.jsp?a=195&amp;n=211&amp;p=193 | archivedate = 2013-07-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;), the number of pilots tuned to a particular station also increases.  This increases the chances that one pilot will accidentally override another, thus requiring the transmission to be repeated.  In addition, each exchange between a controller and pilot requires a certain amount of time to complete; eventually, as the number of flights being controlled reaches a saturation point, the controller will not be able to handle any further aircraft.

Traditionally, this problem has been countered by dividing a saturated air traffic control sector into two smaller sectors, each with its own controller and each using a different voice communications channel.  However, this strategy suffers from two problems:

*Each sector division increases the amount of "handover traffic".  That is the overhead involved in transferring a flight between sectors, which requires a voice exchange between the pilot and both controllers, plus co-ordination between the controllers.
*The number of available voice channels is finite, and, in high density airspace, such as central Europe or the Eastern US Seaboard, there may not be a new channel available.

In some cases it may not be possible or feasible to further divide down a section.

A new strategy is needed to cope with increased demands on air traffic control, and data link based communications offers a possible strategy by increasing the effective capacity of the communications channel.

==Use of CPDLC==
[[Image:A330 DCDU.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The datalink control and display unit (DCDU) on an [[Airbus A330]], the pilot interface for sending and receiving CPDLC messages.]]

Controller–pilot data link communication (CPDLC) is a means of communication between controller and pilot, using data link for ATC communication.  At the highest level, the concept is simple, with the emphasis on the continued involvement of the human at either end and the flexibility of use.

The CPDLC application provides air-ground data communication for the ATC service.  This includes a set of clearance/information/request message elements which correspond to voice phraseology employed by air traffic control procedures.  The controller is provided with the capability to issue level assignments, crossing constraints, lateral deviations, route changes and clearances, speed assignments, radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information.  The pilot is provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request clearances and information, to report information, and to declare/rescind an emergency.  The pilot is, in addition, provided with the capability to request conditional clearances (downstream) and information from a downstream air traffic service unit (ATSU).  A “free text” capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats.  An auxiliary capability is provided to allow a ground system to use data link to forward a CPDLC message to another ground system.

The sequence of messages between the controller and a pilot relating to a particular transaction (for example request and receipt of a clearance) is termed a ‘dialogue’.  There can be several sequences of messages in the dialogue, each of which is closed by means of appropriate messages, usually of acknowledgement or acceptance.  Closure of the dialogue does not necessarily terminate the link, since there can be several dialogues between controller and pilot while an aircraft transits the ATSU airspace.

All exchanges of CPDLC messages between pilot and controller can be viewed as dialogues.

The CPDLC application has three primary functions:

*the exchange of controller/pilot messages with the current data authority,
*the transfer of data authority involving current and next data authority, and
*downstream clearance delivery with a downstream data authority.

Simulations carried out at the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s William J. Hughes Technical Center have shown that the use of CPDLC meant that "the voice channel occupancy was decreased by 75 percent during realistic operations in busy en route airspace.  The net result of this decrease in voice channel occupancy is increased flight safety and efficiency through more effective communications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mitrecaasd.org/work/project_details.cfm?item_id=110 | title = MITRE CAASD &amp;#124;&amp;#124; Projects - Controller Pilot Data Link Communications | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070424234910/http://www.mitrecaasd.org/work/project_details.cfm?item_id=110 | archivedate = 2007-04-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Today, there are two main implementations of CPDLC:

* The [[FANS-1]] system originally developed by [[Boeing]], and by [[Airbus]] as [[FANS-A]], is now commonly referred to as [[FANS-1/A]], and is primarily used in oceanic routes by widebodied long haul aircraft. It was originally deployed in the South Pacific in the late 1990s and was later extended to the North Atlantic.  [[Future Air Navigation System|FANS]]-1/A is an [[ACARS]] based service and, given its oceanic use, mainly uses satellite communications provided by the [[Inmarsat]] Data-2 ([[Classic Aero]]) service.
* The ICAO Doc 9705 compliant ATN/CPDLC system, which is operational at [[Eurocontrol]]'s [[Maastricht]] Upper Airspace Control Centre and has now been extended by Eurocontrol's Link 2000+ Programme to many other European [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIRs).  The [[VHF Data Link|VDL Mode 2]] networks operated by [[ARINC]] and [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]] are used to support the European ATN/CPDLC service.

The following UACs offer CPDLC services:
* Karlsruhe UAC (EDUU), controlling Rhein UIR (above FL245)&lt;ref name="dfs-gen34"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfs.de/dfs_homepage/en/Services/Newsletter/Customer%20newsletter%20archive/2013/Customer%20newsletter%20edition%2002%7C2013/ed_gen_3_4_seite_41_bis_48.pdf|title=Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication|format=PDF|publisher=Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* London ACC (EGTT), controlling London UIR (above FL195 or FL285)
* Maastricht UAC (EDYY), controlling Amsterdam FIR, Hannover UIR and Brussels UIR (above FL245)&lt;ref name="dfs-gen34"/&gt;
* Scottish ACC (EGPX), controlling Scottish UIR (above FL195, FL245 or FL255)
* Budapest ACC, controlling Hungarian and Kosovo UIR
* Stockholm ATCC (ESOS) and Malmö ATCC (ESMM), controlling Sweden FIR
* Canarias ACC (GCCC), controlling Canarias FIR
* Prague IATCC (LKAA), controlling PRAHA FIR i.e. Czech airspace

Following the PETAL I and II (Preliminary Eurocontrol Trial Air Ground Data link) trials in 1995 including [[NEAN]] ([[VHF Data Link|VDL Mode 4]]), today both ATN ([[VHF Data Link|VDL Mode 2]]) and FANS 1/A services are supported.

More than 40 major airlines participate in the CPDLC programme with Maastricht UAC. Average end to end response times (ATC-cockpit-ATC) are well below 30 seconds.  More than 30,000 LOG-ONs were reported in 2007, leading to over 82,000 CPDLC uplinks, each saving precious frequency time.

ATC clearance (ACL), aircraft communication messages (ACM), and check mike (AMC) services are supported, including the automatic uplink of the SSR transponder code into the cockpit.

CPDLC will probably be a major enabler for following on projects as monitor message, route clearance uplink, 2-4 D trajectories, continuous descent approaches, and constraint coordination also.

==Safety==

All CPDLC deployments must be supported by an approved safety case demonstrating that all safety objectives for the applicable airspace have been met.  [[EUROCAE]] ED-120 ([[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]] DO-290) is the safety and performance requirements (SPR) for continental airspace and should be consulted for the safety objectives relevant to the use of CPDLC in continental airspace.

ED-120 provides a hazard analysis and identifies the hazards applicable to systems implementing the ATC services that CPDLC deployments are currently providing.  It then derives the safety objectives for such systems and the safety requirements with which they must comply.

Implementers of both ground and airborne systems must comply with these safety requirements if their products are to be approved and/or certified for operational use.

Safety objectives identified by ED-120/DO-290 include the need to ensure that messages are neither corrupted nor mis-delivered.  Equally important is the need for accurate timestamping and the rejection of out-of-date messages.  A consequence of these requirements is that CPDLC implementations, both on aircraft and at ATC centres, must have access to an accurate clock (to within 1 second of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).  For aircraft, this is typically provided by GPS.

The [[building design]], internal equipment, occupants, and outdoor weather conditions may affect the cooling load in a building using different [[heat transfer]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; The [[SI unit]]s are [[watt]]s.

== Overview ==
The cooling load is calculated to select [[HVAC]] equipment that has the appropriate [[cooling capacity]] to remove heat from the zone. A zone is typically defined as an area with similar heat gains, similar temperature and humidity control requirements, or an enclosed space within a building with the purpose to monitor and control the zone's temperature and humidity with a single sensor e.g. thermostat.&lt;ref name=ashrae901&gt;{{cite journal|title=Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings|date=2013|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling load calculation methodologies take into account heat transfer by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]. Methodologies include heat balance,&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; radiant time series,&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spitler|first1=Jeffrey D.|last2=Fisher|first2=Daniel E.|last3=Pedersen|first3=Curtis O.|title=The Radiant Time Series Cooling Load Calculation Procedure|journal=ASHRAE Transactions|date=1997|volume=103|issue=2|pages=503–515}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cooling load temperature difference calculation method|cooling load temperature difference]], transfer function,&lt;ref name=TFM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitalas|first1=G.P.|title=Transfer function method of calculating cooling loads, heat extraction, and space temperature|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=1973|volume=14|issue=12|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sol-air temperature]]. Methods calculate the cooling load in either steady state or dynamic conditions and some can be more involved than others. These methodologies and others can be found in [[ASHRAE Handbook|ASHRAE handbooks]], [[ISO]] Standard 11855, [[European Standard]] (EN) 15243, and EN 15255.&lt;ref name=FengD&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feng|first1=Jingjuan|title=Design and Control of Hydronic Radiant Cooling Systems|date=May 2014|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6qc4p0fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHRAE recommends the heat balance method and radiant time series methods.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;

== Differentiation from heat gains ==
The cooling load of a building should not be confused with its heat gains. Heat gains refer to the rate at which heat is transferred into or generated inside a building. Just like cooling loads, heat gains can be separated into sensible and latent heat gains that can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermophysical properties of walls, floors, ceilings, and windows, [[lighting power density]] (LPD), [[plug load]] density, occupant density, and equipment [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] play an important role in determining the magnitude of heat gains in a building.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; [[ASHRAE]] handbook of fundamentals refers to the following six modes of entry for heat gains:&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;

# Solar radiation through transparent surfaces
# Heat conduction through exterior walls and roofs
# Heat conduction through ceilings, floors, and interior partitions
# Heat generated in the space by occupants, lights, and appliances
# Energy transfer through direct-with-space ventilation and infiltration of outdoor air
# Miscellaneous heats gains

Furthermore, heat extraction rate is the rate at which heat is actually being removed from the space by the cooling equipment.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HCB /&gt; Heat gains, heat extraction rate, and cooling loads values are often not equal due to [[thermal inertia]] effects. Heat is stored in the mass of the building and furnishings delaying the time at which it can become a heat gain and be extracted by the cooling equipment to maintain the desired indoor conditions.&lt;ref name=HCB /&gt; Another reason is that the inability of the cooling system to keep dry bulb temperature and humidity constant.

== Cooling loads in air systems ==
In [[Forced-air|air systems]], convective heat gains are assumed to become a cooling load instantly. Radiative heat gains are absorbed by walls, floors, ceilings, and furnishings causing an increase in their temperature which will then transfer heat to the space's air by convection.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; Conductive heat gains are converted to convective and radiative heat gains. If the space's air temperature and humidity are kept constant then heat extraction rate and space cooling load are equal.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE18 /&gt; The resulting cooling load through different air system types in the same built environment can be different.&lt;ref name=schiavon2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiavon|first1=Stefano|last2=Lee|first2=Kwang Ho|last3=Bauman|first3=Fred|last4=Webster|first4=Tom|title=Simplified calculation method for design cooling loads in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=February 2011|volume=43|issue=2–3|pages=517–528|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.017|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5w53c7kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[signal processing]], '''data compression''', '''source coding''',&lt;ref name="Wade"/&gt; or '''bit-rate reduction''' involves encoding [[information]] using fewer [[bit]]s than the original representation.&lt;ref name="mahdi53"/&gt;  Compression can be either [[Lossy compression|lossy]] or [[Lossless compression|lossless]]. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]]. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.&lt;ref name="PujarKadlaskar"/&gt;

The process of reducing the size of a [[data file]] is often referred to as data compression. In the context of [[data transmission]], it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.&lt;ref name="Salomon"/&gt; Source coding should not be confused with [[channel coding]], for error detection and correction or [[line coding]], the means for mapping data onto a signal.

Compression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data. [[Computational resource]]s are consumed in the compression process and, usually, in the reversal of the process (decompression). Data compression is subject to a [[Space–time tradeoff|space–time complexity trade-off]]. For instance, [[#video|a compression scheme for video]] may require expensive [[Electronic hardware|hardware]] for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using [[lossy data compression]]), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.&lt;ref name="MittalVetter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tank"/&gt;

== Lossless ==
[[Lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]]s usually exploit [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]] to represent data without losing any [[Self-information|information]], so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding "red pixel, red pixel, ..." the data may be encoded as "279 red pixels". This is a basic example of [[run-length encoding]]; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.

The [[Lempel–Ziv]] (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.&lt;ref name="Optimized LZW"/&gt;  [[DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid-1980s, following work by [[Terry Welch]], the [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch]] (LZW) algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general-purpose compression systems. LZW is used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt; LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often [[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]. [[Grammar-based codes]] like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and Re-Pair.

The strongest modern lossless compressors use [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] models, such as [[prediction by partial matching]]. The [[Burrows–Wheeler transform]] can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling.&lt;ref name="mahmud2"/&gt; In a further refinement of the direct use of [[probabilistic model]]ling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a [[finite-state machine]] to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the [[probability distribution]] of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional (but not widely used) feature of the [[JPEG]] image coding standard.&lt;ref name=TomLane/&gt; It has since been applied in various other designs including [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[HEVC]] for video coding.&lt;ref name="HEVC"/&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

== Lossy ==
[[Lossy data compression]] is the converse of [[lossless data compression]]. In the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for compressing them emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used.&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt; In these schemes, some loss of information is acceptable. Dropping nonessential detail from the data source can save storage space. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in [[luminance]] than it is to the variations in color. [[JPEG]] [[image compression]] works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.&lt;ref name="Arcangel"/&gt;  There is a corresponding [[trade-off]] between preserving information and reducing size. A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including [[Psychoacoustics|those used in music]] files, images, and video.

Lossy [[image compression]] can be used in [[digital camera]]s, to increase storage capacities with minimal degradation of picture quality. Similarly, [[DVD]]s use the lossy [[MPEG-2]] [[video coding format]] for [[video compression]].

In lossy [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]], methods of [[psychoacoustics]] are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the [[Audio signal processing|audio signal]]. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; [[speech coding]], or voice coding, is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline from ''audio compression''. Different audio and speech compression standards are listed under [[audio coding format]]s. ''Voice compression'' is used in [[internet telephony]], for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.&lt;ref name="mahmud2"/&gt;

== Theory ==
The theoretical background of compression is provided by [[information theory]] (which is closely related to [[algorithmic information theory]]) for lossless compression and [[rate–distortion theory]] for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Coding theory]] is also related to this. The idea of data compression is also deeply connected with [[statistical inference]].&lt;ref name="Marak"/&gt;

=== Machine learning ===
{{see also|Machine learning}}
There is a close connection between [[machine learning]] and compression: a system that predicts the [[posterior probabilities]] of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [[arithmetic coding]] on the output distribution) while an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence."&lt;ref name="Mahoney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Market Efficiency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben-Gal"/&gt;

==== Feature space vectors ====
However a new, alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [[feature space vector]]s, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponds to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.&lt;ref name="ScullyBrodley"/&gt;

=== Data differencing ===
{{main|Data differencing}}
Data compression can be viewed as a special case of [[data differencing]]:&lt;ref name="RFC 3284"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vdelta"/&gt; Data differencing consists of producing a ''difference'' given a ''source'' and a ''target,'' with patching producing a ''target'' given a ''source'' and a ''difference,'' while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target, and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file. Thus, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a "difference from nothing." This is the same as considering absolute [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of [[relative entropy]] (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.

When one wishes to emphasize the connection, one may use the term ''differential compression'' to refer to data differencing.

== Uses ==
=== Audio ===
{{see also|Audio codec|Audio coding format}}
Audio data compression, not to be confused with [[dynamic range compression]], has the potential to reduce the transmission [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and storage requirements of audio data. [[List of codecs#Audio|Audio compression algorithms]] are implemented in [[software]] as audio [[codec]]s. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications. These algorithms almost all rely on [[psychoacoustics]] to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.&lt;ref name="mahdi53"/&gt;

In both lossy and lossless compression, [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] is reduced, using methods such as [[Coding theory|coding]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[linear prediction]] to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.

The acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB [[compact disc]] (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed [[high fidelity]] music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the [[MP3]] format at a medium [[bit rate]]. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.&lt;ref name="Olympus WS-120"/&gt;

Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]]. Compression ratios are around 50–60 % of original size,&lt;ref name="FLAC"/&gt; which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of [[waveform]]s and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like [[FLAC]], [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]], and [[TTA (codec)|TTA]] use [[linear prediction]] to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use [[convolution]] with the filter [-1 1] to slightly [[white noise|whiten]] or [[decorrelation|flatten]] the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon decompression.

When audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for [[Audio editing|editing]], it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.

A number of lossless audio compression formats exist. [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] was an early lossless format. Newer ones include [[Free Lossless Audio Codec]] (FLAC), Apple's [[Apple Lossless]] (ALAC), [[MPEG-4 ALS]], Microsoft's [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] (WMA Lossless), [[Monkey's Audio]], [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], and [[WavPack]]. See [[List of codecs#Lossless data compression|list of lossless codecs]] for a complete listing.

Some [[audio file format|audio formats]] feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].

Other formats are associated with a distinct system, such as:
* [[Direct Stream Transfer]], used in [[Super Audio CD]]
* [[Meridian Lossless Packing]], used in [[DVD-Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]]

==== Lossy audio compression ====
[[File:AudiodatenkompressionManowarThePowerOfThySword.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spectrogram]]s of audio in an uncompressed format and several lossy formats. The lossy spectrograms show [[bandlimiting]] of higher frequencies, a common technique associated with lossy audio compression.]]

Lossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to the direct applications (MP3 players or computers), digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the [[internet]], satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression (data of 5 percent to 20 percent of the original stream, rather than 50 percent to 60 percent), by discarding less-critical data.&lt;ref name="Jaiswal"/&gt;

The innovation of lossy audio compression was to use [[psychoacoustics]] to recognize that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human [[auditory system]]. Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.

Due to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers when a file is decompressed and recompressed ([[digital generation loss]]). This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, they are very popular with end users (particularly [[MP3]]) as a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.

===== Coding methods =====
To determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain. Once transformed, typically into the [[frequency domain]], component frequencies can be allocated bits according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components calculated using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]]—the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency—and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]]—where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weight the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called [[psychoacoustic model]]s.&lt;ref name="faxin47"/&gt;

Other types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. These coders use a model of the sound's generator (such as the human vocal tract with LPC) to whiten the audio signal (i.e., flatten its spectrum) before [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. LPC may be thought of as a basic perceptual coding technique: reconstruction of an audio signal using a linear predictor shapes the coder's quantization noise into the spectrum of the target signal, partially masking it.&lt;ref name="Jaiswal"/&gt;

Lossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive applications (such as the coding of speech for digital transmission in cell phone networks). In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications, and for such applications a codec designed to stream data effectively will usually be chosen.&lt;ref name="Jaiswal"/&gt;

Latency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. (Often codecs create segments called a "frame" to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.) The inherent [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.

In contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23 ms (46 ms for two-way communication)).

===== Speech encoding =====
[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate.

If the data to be compressed is analog (such as a voltage that varies with time), quantization is employed to digitize it into numbers (normally integers). This is referred to as analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into 256 intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to the same number. If 16-bit integers are generated, then the range of the analog signal is divided into 65,536 intervals.

This relation illustrates the compromise between high resolution (a large number of analog intervals) and high compression (small integers generated). This application of quantization is used by several speech compression methods. This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:
* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.
* Throwing away more of the data in the signal—keeping just enough to reconstruct an "intelligible" voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

Perhaps the earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[µ-law algorithm]].

==== History ====
[[File:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|size100px|right|thumb|Solidyne 922: The world's first commercial audio bit compression card for PC, 1990]]

A literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC), February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual (i.e. masking) techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back-end noiseless coding.&lt;ref name="Possibilities"/&gt; Several of these papers remarked on the difficulty of obtaining good, clean digital audio for research purposes. Most, if not all, of the authors in the JSAC edition were also active in the MPEG-1 Audio committee.

The world's first commercial [[broadcast automation]] audio compression system was developed by Oscar Bonello, an engineering professor at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="Solidyne"/&gt; In 1983, using the psychoacoustic principle of the masking of critical bands first published in 1967,&lt;ref name="Zwicker"/&gt; he started developing a practical application based on the recently developed [[IBM PC]] computer, and the broadcast automation system was launched in 1987 under the name [[Audicom]]. Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.

=== Video ===
{{see also|Video coding format|Video codec}}
Video compression is a practical implementation of source coding in information theory. In practice, most video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so-called ''[[digital container format|container format]]s''.&lt;ref name="CSIP"/&gt;

[[Uncompressed video]] requires a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]]. Although [[List of codecs#Lossless video compression|lossless video compression]] codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical [[MPEG-4]] lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.&lt;ref name="MSU2007"/&gt;

==== Encoding theory ====
Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames. Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly. 

Most [[video compression formats]] and [[video codec|codecs]] exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy (e.g. through difference coding with [[motion compensation]]). Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames (inter-frame coding) or spatially adjacent pixels (intra-frame coding).
[[inter frame|Inter-frame]] compression (a temporal [[delta encoding]]) is one of the most powerful compression techniques. It (re)uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. [[Intra-frame coding]], on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still-[[image compression]].&lt;ref name="faxin47"/&gt; And the intra-frame coding always uses lossy compression algorithms. 

A [[Video coding format#Intra-frame video coding formats|class of specialized formats]] used in camcorders and video editing use less complex compression schemes that restrict their prediction techniques to intra-frame prediction.

Usually video compression additionally employs [[lossy compression]] techniques like [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] that reduce aspects of the source data that are (more or less) irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in [[JPEG]] image compression.&lt;ref name="TomLane"/&gt; As in all lossy compression, there is a [[trade-off]] between [[video quality]], cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting [[compression artifact|artifacts]].

Other methods than the prevalent DCT-based transform formats, such as [[fractal compression]], [[matching pursuit]] and the use of a [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT), have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of [[wavelet compression|wavelet coding]] as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.&lt;ref name="faxin47"/&gt;

===== Inter-frame coding =====
{{main article|inter frame}}
Inter-frame coding works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. Individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the [[video codec|video compression codec]] sends only the [[residual frame|differences]] to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Usually the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the [[variable bitrate]].

==== Hybrid block-based transform formats ====
[[File:Hybrid video encoder processing stages.svg|thumb|upright=2|Processing stages of a typical video encoder]]
Today, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the [[ITU-T]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) share the same basic architecture that dates back to [[H.261]] which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU-T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using [[motion vector]]s, as well as nowadays also an in-loop filtering step.

In the prediction stage, various deduplication and difference-coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data.

Then rectangular blocks of (residue) [[pixel]] data are transformed to the frequency domain to ease targeting irrelevant information in quantization and for some spatial redundancy reduction. The [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) that is widely used in this regard was introduced by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="DCT"/&gt;

In the main lossy processing stage that data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception.

In the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] which often applies some form of arithmetic coding.

In an additional in-loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are [[deblocking filter]]s that blur out blocking artefacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.

==== History ====
All basic algorithms of today's dominant video codec architecture have been invented before 1979.
In 1950, the [[Bell Labs]] filed the patent on DPCM&lt;ref name="DPCM"/&gt; which soon was applied to video coding. Entropy coding started in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon–Fano coding]]&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; on which the widely used [[Huffman coding]] is based that was developed in 1950;&lt;ref name="Huffman"/&gt; the more modern [[context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding]] (CABAC) was published in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="CABAC"/&gt; Transform coding (using the [[Hadamard transform]]) was introduced in 1969,&lt;ref name="Hadamard"/&gt; the popular discrete cosine transform (DCT) appeared in 1974 in scientific literature.&lt;ref name="DCT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patents"/&gt;
The ITU-T's standard [[H.261]] from 1988 introduced the prevalent basic architecture of video compression technology.

===Genetics===
{{see also|Compression of Genomic Re-Sequencing Data}}
[[Compression of Genomic Re-Sequencing Data|Genetics compression algorithms]] are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for [[International HapMap Project|HapMap]] data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset.&lt;ref name="HapZipper"/&gt; Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).&lt;ref name="genome email"/&gt;&lt;ref name="genome contracts"/&gt;. For a benchmark in genetics/genomics data compressors, see &lt;ref name="Morteza"/&gt;

== Outlook and currently unused potential ==
It is estimated that the total amount of data that is stored on the world's storage devices could be further compressed with existing compression algorithms by a remaining average factor of 4.5:1.{{citation needed | date = January 2017 | reason = 1,300 exabytes of worldwide data storage capacity appears to be a calculated value (4.5 x 295). The cited paper for this sentence does not include this compression ratio estimate.}} It is estimated that the combined technological capacity of the world to store information provides 1,300 [[exabytes]] of hardware digits in 2007, but when the corresponding content is optimally compressed, this only represents 295 exabytes of [[Shannon information]].&lt;ref name="World Capacity"/&gt;

'''Directory-based coherence''' is a mechanism to handle [[Cache coherence]] problem in [[Distributed shared memory]] (DSM) a.k.a. [[Non-uniform memory access|Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). Another popular way is to use a special type of computer [[Bus (computing)|bus]] between all the nodes as a "shared bus" (a.k.a. [[System bus]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=319–360|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directory-based coherence uses a special [[Directory (computing)|directory]] to serve instead of the shared bus in the bus-based coherence protocols. Both of these designs use the corresponding medium (i.e. directory or bus) as tool to facilitate the communication between different [[Node (networking)|nodes]], and to guarantee that the coherence protocol is working properly along all the communicating nodes. In directory based cache coherence, this is done by using this directory to keep track of the status of all [[Cache memory|cache]] blocks, the status of each block includes in which cache coherence "[[State (computer science)|state]]" that block is, and which nodes are sharing that block at that time, which can be used to eliminate the need to [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] all the signals to all nodes, and only send it to the nodes that are interested in this single block.

Following are a few advantages and disadvantages of the directory based cache coherence protocol:
* '''Scalability''': This is one of the strongest motivations for going to directory based designs. What we mean by [[scalability]], in short,  is how good a specific system is in handling the growing amount of work that it is responsible to do . For this criteria, Bus based systems cannot do well due to the limitation caused when having a shared bus that all nodes are using in the same time. For a relatively small number of nodes, bus systems can do well. However, while the number of nodes is growing, some problems may occur in this regard. Especially since only one node is allowed to use the bus at a time, which will significantly harm the performance of the overall system. On the other hand, using directory-based systems, there will be no such bottleneck to constrain the scalability of the system.
* '''Simplicity''': This is one of the points where bus-system is superior. Since the bus structure itself can serve as an organizer for all the traffic that goes through the system, and ensure the [[Atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]] of all the signals passed through. Thus, there will be no need to put more effort in ensuring atomicity and ordering between signals as the case in directory based systems, which leads to several overhead faced in the later system design when dealing with issues like [[Consistency model|consistency]].
According to the above discussion, it is clear that using bus based systems seems more attractive for relatively small systems. However, directory based systems become crucial when the system scale up and the number of nodes grows. So there is a kind of [[trade-off]] between the simplicity and the scalability when comparing between Bus-based and Directory-based cache coherence designs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The idea of Directory-based cache coherence systems begun long time ago. Although the idea of '''DASH''' ('''D'''irectory '''A'''rchitecture for '''SH'''ared-memory) was first proposed by C.K. Tang&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=C.K.|title=Cache system design in the tightly coupled multiprocessor system|journal=AFIPS '76 Proceedings of the June 7–10, 1976, national computer conference and exposition|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 1970s. However, applying it to cache coherence was proposed a few years later, specifically in 1978, when researchers at [[Stanford University|Stanford university]] proposed the first version of this coherence systems called [[Stanford DASH]], in a paper&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Directory-Based Cache Coherence Protocol for the DASH Multiprocessor|url=http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/cs258/handouts/papers/p148-lenoski.pdf|journal=Computer Systems Laboratory|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described the system with the difficulties and improvements that come with such designs. Beside this approach, several attempts were done to provide a scalable systems. For instance, [[BBN Butterfly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=G.E.|title=The Butterfly Parallel Processor|journal=In proc. of ICS|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced in 1985, and IBM PR3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The IBM research parallel processor prototype PR3: Introduction and architicture|journal=In proceeding of the 1985 International conference of Parallel processing|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced in 1987, are some examples of [[Multiprocessor system-on-chip|multiprocessor systems]] that are scalable. However, both of these systems have a drawback; For example, BBN Butterfly does not have caches. Similarly, IBM PR3 does not provide hardware cache coherence, which limits the performance of both of these designs, especially when employing high performance processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Design of Scalable Shared-Memory Multiprocessors: The DASH approach|journal=Computer system laboratory, Stanford University|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This limitation in the other competitors, made it easier for DASH based systems to get chosen for design cache coherence systems and all other systems that need scalabality in cache-based nodes. In 1985, James Archibald&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ece.byu.edu/faculty/jka|title=James Archibald|website=ece.byu.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Loup Baer]] from the [[University of Washington]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=An economical solution to the cache coherence problem|journal=ISCA '84 Proceedings of the 11th annual international symposium on Computer architecture|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposes a more economical, expandable, and modular variation of the "global directory" approach in the term of hardware use in the design.

In 1992, Daniel Lenoski from Stanford university published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenoski|first=Daniel|last2=Laudon|first2=James|last3=Gharachorloo|first3=Kourosh|last4=Weber|first4=Wolf-Dietrich|last5=Gupta|first5=Anoop|last6=Hennessy|first6=John|last7=Horowitz|first7=Mark|last8=Lam|first8=Monica S.|date=1992-03-01|title=The Stanford Dash Multiprocessor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.121510|journal=Computer|volume=25|issue=3|pages=63–79|doi=10.1109/2.121510|issn=0018-9162}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing advances in cache coherence protocols for directory-based systems. In a 1996 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laudon|first=James|last2=Lenoski|first2=Daniel|date=1997-01-01|title=The SGI Origin: A ccNUMA Highly Scalable Server|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/264107.264206|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture|series=ISCA '97|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=241–251|doi=10.1145/264107.264206|isbn=0897919017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced the design of the [[SGI Origin 2000]], a family of server computers employing directory based cache coherence. The subsequent [[Origin 3000]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support1-sgi.custhelp.com/|title=Support Home Page|last=Corp.|first=Silicon Graphics International|website=support1-sgi.custhelp.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in July 2000.

== Protocols ==
Unlike [[Snoopy cache|Snoopy]] coherence protocols, in a directory based coherence approach, the information about which caches have a copy of a block is maintained in a structure called ''Directory''. In a directory based scheme, participating caches do not broadcast requests to all other sharing caches of the block in order to locate cached copies, instead it queries the directory to retrieve the information about which block have cached copies and sends only to those particular processors and hence traffic saving compared to a snoopy protocol is large. In well optimized applications, most data sharing is only for data that is read only, and there is little sharing for data that is frequently read and written. A directory approach can result in a substantial traffic saving compared to broadcast/snoopy approach in such applications.

[[File:Directory Scheme.png|thumb|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=319–361|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directory-based coherence scheme overview diagram showing various actors and messages.|538x538px]]

As shown in the data flow diagram, the actors involved in a distributed shared memory system implementing directory based coherence protocol are:
* '''Requestor Node''' : This node is the processor who is requesting for a read/write of a memory block.
* '''Directory Node''' : This node maintains the information of the state of each cache block in the system and requestor directs its requests to the directory node. 
* '''Owner Node:''' An owner node owns the most recent state of the cache block, note that directory might not be always up to date with latest data.
* '''Sharer Node''': One or many node which are sharing a copy of the cache block.
[[File:Directory Protocol State transtion diagram.png|thumb|Image 1: State transition diagram for directory based protocol|353x353px]]Requestor and Owner nodes maintain their state transition similar to a snoopy coherence protocols like [[MESI protocol]]. However, unlike a bus based implementation where nodes communicate using a common bus, directory based implementation uses [[Message Passing Interface|message passing]] model to exchange information required for maintaining [[cache coherence]].

Directory node acts as a serializing point and all communications are directed through this node to maintain correctness.

== Directory Node ==
A directory node keeps track of the overall state of a cache block in the entire cache system for all processors. It can be in three states :
* '''Uncached (U):''' No processor has data cached, memory up-to-date .
* '''Shared (S)''': one or more processors have data cached, memory up-to-date. In this state directory and sharers have clean copy of the cached block. 
* '''Exclusive/Modified (EM):''' one processor (owner) has data cached; memory out-of-date. Note that directory can not distinguish a block cached in an exclusive or modified state at the processor as processors can transition from an exclusive state to modified state with out any bus transaction.
Explanation of the Directory state transition [[Finite-state machine|Finite State Machine]] (refer image 1) is captured below in the table:
{| class="wikitable"
!Initial State
!Bus Request
!Response/ Action
!New State
|-
|'''U'''
|'''BusRd'''  or 
'''BusRdX'''
|
* Fetch block from memory as the directory is having the updated copy of the block.
* send the memory block to requestor using the message ('''ReplyD).'''
* if there are no sharers : requestor = first sharer, directory transitions into EM state.
|EM
|-
|'''EM'''
|'''BusRd'''
|
* Send intervention('''Int''') to the Owner
|S
|-
|
|'''BusRdX'''
|
* Send Invalidation('''Inv''') to the current owner.
| -
|-
|'''S'''
|'''BusRd'''
|
* Reply to the requestor with the memory block ('''ReplyD''')
| -
|-
|
|'''BusRdX'''
|
* Reply to the requestor with the memory block ('''ReplyD''')
* Invalidate('''Inv''') all sharers.
|EM
|-
|
|'''BusUpgr'''
|
* Invalidate('''Inv''') all sharers.
* Reply to the requestor that he can upgrade .('''Reply''')
|EM
|}

In addition to cache state, a directory must track which processors have data when in the shared state. This is required to for sending invalidation and intervention requests to the individual processor caches which have the cache block in shared state. Few of the popular implementation approaches are: 
* '''Full bit-vector''': A bit field for each processor at the directory node are maintained. The storage overhead scales with the number of processors. 
* '''Limited pointer:''' In this approach directory information of limited number of blocks is kept at the directory to reduce storage overhead.

Please note that the protocol described above is the basic implementation and [[race condition]]s can occur due to the fact that directory can be out of sync with the caches and also messages between processors can be overlapping. More complex implementations are available like [[Scalable Coherent Interface]] which have multiple states.

DASH&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; cache coherence protocol is another protocol that uses directory-based coherence scheme. DASH protocol uses a clustered approach, where processors inside a cluster are kept coherent using bus based snooping scheme, while the clusters are connected in a directory approach. Even though various protocols use different implementations for tracking cache blocks, however the concept of directory remains same.

An '''electronic viewfinder''' ('''EVF''') is a camera [[viewfinder]] where the image captured by the lens is projected electronically onto a miniature display. The image on this display is used to assist in aiming the camera at the scene to be photographed. It differs from a [[live preview]] screen in being smaller and shaded from ambient light.

The sensor records the view through the lens, the view is processed, and finally projected on a miniature display which is viewable through the [[eyepiece]]. Electronic viewfinders are used in digital [[still camera]]s and in [[video camera]]s.  

Some cameras (such as Panasonic, Sony, Fujifilm) have an automatic eye sensor which switches the display from screen to EVF when the viewfinder is near the eye. More modest cameras use a button to switch the display. Some have no button at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital-photography-school.com/should-i-use-the-lcd-or-viewfinder-on-my-digital-camera/ |title=Should I use the LCD or Viewfinder on my Digital Camera? |author=Darren Rowse |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Viewfinder-cutaway-comparison-dollar.jpg|thumb|Old video camera viewfinder cutway, note the miniature [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]]]

== In still photography ==
[[File:Olympus epl5 vf4 45mm 03.jpg|thumb|An [[Olympus PEN E-PL5]] mounted with an external EVF unit: the Olympus VF-4]]
[[File:EVF Panasonic Lumix DMC-G80.jpg|thumb|EVF of [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-G85/G80]] with 2,360,000 dots.]]
=== Advantages ===
Like the live preview screen, electronic viewfinders can show additional information, such as an [[image histogram]], [[focal ratio]], camera settings, battery charge, and remaining storage space.  Some have a [[focus peaking]] feature that highlights areas of the frame that are in focus.  They are also in several ways more accurate than an optical viewfinder (OVF):

* Show the scene from the same viewpoint as the camera lens, without [[parallax]]. 
* Cope with high zoom-ratio lenses, without needing a bulky [[single-lens reflex camera|reflex mirror]]. 
* Show approximately how the scene will look under the chosen exposure, including white balance, saturation, effects etc.
* Show a low-light scene brighter than it would appear with a OVF, just like the final image will look like.
* Show 100% coverage of the final image.
* It is possible to review taken images on the EVF. This might be helpful in bright sunlight.
* The EVF can also be used in video mode (which is not possible in a OVF)
* Uses less power than the big LCD screen.

=== Limitations ===
Electronic viewfinders have the following limitations:
* There may be a noticeable lag between the changes in the scene and the electronic viewfinder display.
* A very few EVFs do not have automatic gain control and become virtually blank in low-light conditions.
* EVFs of compact and bridge cameras with smaller sensors have difficulty operating in darker environments and tend to lag severely. 
[[File:Low-light Electronic Viewfinder (EV) Lag Panasonic Lumix FZ80 .webm|300px|thumb|The Panasonic Lumix FZ80/82, a bridge camera with a smaller 1/2.3" sensor, tends to perform poorly in low light due to its sensor limitations.]]
Electronic viewfinders have been in use with [[bridge camera]]s for some years but with limited resolution and image quality.  They are used in most mirrorless modern system cameras (e.g. Panasonic Micro Four Third System, Sony NEX, Sony SLT, Nikon V1).

Many professional [[photographer]]s and advanced amateurs prefer DSLR cameras that have a true optical through-the-lens viewfinder (OVF).  From 2006 some DSLR camera models provide both [[through-the-lens]] viewing and a  "[[Live-preview digital camera|live preview]]" on the LCD (as distinct from an electronic viewfinder).  These include, but are not limited to, the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] [[Olympus E-330|E-330]], [[Olympus E-410|E-410]], [[Olympus E-510|E-510]] and [[Olympus E-3|E-3]], the [[Panasonic Lumix]] [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-L1|DMC-L1]] and [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-L10|DMC-L10]], the [[Leica Digilux 3]], the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] [[Canon EOS 40D|EOS 40D]], [[Canon EOS 50D|EOS 50D]], [[Canon EOS 60D|EOS 60D]], [[Canon EOS 7D|EOS 7D]] and [[Canon EOS-1D Mark III|EOS-1D Mark III]], and the [[Nikon]] [[Nikon D3|D3]], [[Nikon D300|D300]] and [[Nikon D90|D90]].

==Hybrid viewfinder==

To get the advantage of both optical and electronic viewfinders some cameras have hybrid viewfinders. These display the image in an optical eyepiece viewfinder, or electronically on an LCD screen. Examples include some [[Fujifilm X-series]] cameras.

The '''Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System''' ('''E-THEMIS''') instrument is designed to scan the surface of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and identify areas of geologically recent resurfacing through the detection of subtle thermal anomalies. This 'heat detector' will provide high spatial resolution, multi-spectral thermal imaging of Europa to help detect active sites such as outflows and plumes. E-THEMIS will be launched on board the planned ''[[Europa Clipper]]'' [[astrobiology]] mission to Jupiter's moon Europa in 2022-2025.

The E-THEMIS uses technology inherited from the [[Thermal Emission Imaging System|THEMIS camera]] flown on board the 2001 ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter, and the ''[[OSIRIS-REx]]'' OTES instruments.&lt;ref name="Pittman 2015"&gt; {{cite news |last=Pittman |first=Kagan |url=https://www.engineering.com/PLMERP/ArticleID/10254/New-Thermal-Imaging-Technology-to-Look-for-Life-on-Jupiter-Moon.aspx |title=New Thermal Imaging Technology to Look for Life on Jupiter Moon |work=Engineering.com |date=11 June 2015 |accessdate=2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-THEMIS will identify areas of geologically recent resurfacing through the detection of subtle thermal anomalies. E-THEMIS will be fabricated by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies|Arizona State University with hardware contributions from Ball Aerospace Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coloradospacenews.com/ball-aerospace-to-partner-with-asu-on-key-instrument-for-europa-mission/ Ball Aerospace To Partner With ASU On Key Instrument For Europa Mission]. ''Colorado Space News''. 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Raytheon Vision Systems. The Principal Investigator is [[Philip Christensen]] at [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name="Pittman 2015"/&gt;  One of the primary science objectives of the Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System (E-THEMIS) is to determine the regolith particle size, block abundance, and sub-surface layering for landing site assessment and surface process studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016DPS....4812348R A review of thermophysical surface models in preparation for E-THEMIS observations of Europa].

''American Astronomical Society'', DPS meeting #48, id.123.48 Published by the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;  The E-THEMIS investigation is designed to characterize Europa's thermal behavior and identify any thermal anomalies due to recent or ongoing activity, which include multi-spectral infrared emission, at both day and night.&lt;ref name='Hayne 2017'&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017DPS....4920303H Occurrence and Detectability of Thermal Anomalies on Europa]. Hayne, Paul O.; Christensen, Philip R.; Spencer, John R.; Abramov, Oleg; Howett, Carly; Mellon, Michael; Nimmo, Francis; Piqueux, Sylvain; Rathbun, Julie A. ''American Astronomical Society'', DPS meeting #49. October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  To accomplish this, E-THEMIS will obtain thermal [[infrared]] images in three spectral bands from 7 to 70 μm at multiple times of day.

Thermal anomalies on Europa may be manifestations of subsurface melting due to hot spots, shear heating on faults, and eruptions of liquid water, which can be imaged in the [[infrared spectrum]].&lt;ref name='Hayne 2017'/&gt; Europa's water is suspected to lie {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the moon's ice crust.

==Objectives==

The specific objectives of the E-THEMIS investigation are: &lt;ref name='Christensen OPAG2015'&gt;[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/aug2015/presentations/day-1/8_e_christensen.pdf Europa Thermal Emission Imaging System (E-THEMIS)] (PDF). Philip Christensen. OPAG Meeting
August 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Detect and characterize thermal anomalies on the surface that may be indicative of recent resurfacing or active venting
*Identify active plumes
*Determine the [[regolith]] particle size, block abundance, and sub-surface layering for landing site assessment and surface process studies

To achieve this, E-THEMIS will image the surface at a resolution of 5 × 22 m from 25 km altitude; it will have a precision of 0.2 [[Kelvin|K]] for 90 K surfaces and 0.1 K at 220 K, with an accuracy of 1-2.2 K from 220-90 K; and E-THEMIS will obtain images with up to 360 cross-track pixels with a 10.1 km wide image swath from 100 km.&lt;ref name='Christensen OPAG2015'/&gt; The instrument can identify active vents, if existing, at the 1-10 meter scale. A [[Radiation hardening|radiation-hardened integrated circuit]] will be incorporated to meet the radiation requirements.

The '''fit-PC''' is a small, light, fan-less [[nettop]] computer manufactured by the [[Israel]]i company CompuLab.

Many fit-PC models are available. fit-PC 1.0 was introduced in July 2007, fit-PC Slim was introduced in September 2008, fit-PC 2 was introduced in May 2009, fit-PC 3 was introduced in early 2012, and fit-PC 4 was introduced spring 2014.  The [[Information appliance|device]] is power-efficient (fit-PC 1 was about 5 W) and therefore considered{{by whom|date=January 2011}} to be a [[green computing]] project, capable of using [[open source software]] and creating minimal [[electronic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tiniest Linux system, yet? | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2102697273.html | publisher = LinuxDevices.com | date = September 16, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tiny PC sips power, runs Linux | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS5551137361.html | publisher = LinuxDevices.com | date = July 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fit PC—A Tiny Linux PC that Fits Anywhere | url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2194862,00.asp | publisher = ExtremeTech | accessdate = 2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current models==

===fit-PC2===
On February 19, 2009, Compulab announced the fit-PC2, which is "a major upgrade to the fit-PC product line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New fit-PC model - fit-PC2 | url = http://www.fit-pc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=778 | publisher = CompuLab | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Detailed specifications for the fit-PC2 include an Intel Atom Z5xx ''[[Silverthorne (microprocessor)|Silverthorne]]'' processor (1.1/1.6/2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz options), up to 2GB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], 160GB SATA Hard Drive, GigaBit LAN and more. The fit-PC2 is also capable of HD video playback. Its declared power consumption is only 6W, and according to the manufacturer, it saves 96% of the power used by a standard desktop. fit-PC2 is the most power efficient PC on the [[Energy star|Energy-Star]] list.
The fit-PC2 is based on the [[GMA 500]] (Graphics Media Accelerator). Unfortunately the open source driver included in Linux kernel 2.6.39 does not support VA-API video or OpenGL/3D acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An Open-Source Intel GMA 500 Driver Appears | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTE0NQ | publisher = Phoronix | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fit-PC2 is being phased out and is being replaced by the fitlet, the fitlet was designed to replace the groundbreaking (and still popular) CompuLab fit-PC2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fit-pc.com/web/about/news/fitlet-announcement/&lt;/ref&gt;

===fit-PC2i===
On December 2, 2009, Compulab announced the fit-PC2i, a fit-PC2 variation targeting networking and industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = fit-PC2i announced - fit-PC2 | url = http://www.fit-pc2.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=1156/ | publisher = CompuLab | accessdate = 2009-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
fit-PC2i adds a second Gbit Ethernet port, [[Wake-on-LAN]], [[S/PDIF]] output and RS232 port, has two fewer USB ports, and no IR.

===fit-PC3===
The fit-PC3 has been released early 2012. 
See the [[fit-PC3]] article.

===fit-PC4===
The fit-PC4 has been released spring 2014.

===fitlet===
The fitlet has been announced January 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = fitlet announced - fitlet | url = http://www.fit-pc.com/web/products/fitlet/ | publisher = CompuLab | accessdate = 2015-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has 3 CPU/[[System on a chip|SoC]] variations, and 5 feature variations, though only 7 models have been announced so far.

==Obsolete models==

===fit-PC Slim===
On September 16, 2008, Compulab announced the Fit-PC Slim, which at 11 x 10 x 3&amp;nbsp;cm is smaller than fit-PC 1.0.

====Hardware====
fit-PC Slim uses 500&amp;nbsp;MHz AMD [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] [[Geode (processor)#Geode LX|LX800]] processor and has 512mb soldered-on RAM. The computer includes a VGA output, a serial port with a custom connector, Ethernet, b/g WLAN, and 3 USB ports (2 on the front panel). The system has an upgradeable 2.5" 60GB ATA hard drive.

====Software====
fit-PC Slim has General Software BIOS supporting [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]] and booting from a USB CDROM or USB thumb drive. It is pre-installed with either Windows Vista or with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 8.10 and [[Gentoo Linux]] 2008.0 . Also Windows Embedded can be used, or pre-installed on a FlowDrive.

====Availability====
The fit-PC Slim end-of-life was announced on 19 June 2009 with the general availability of fit-PC2.

===fit-PC 1.0===
fit-PC 1.0 is an earlier model that has the following differences
* Limited to 256mb RAM
* No Wi-Fi
* Dual 100BaseT Ethernet
* Larger form factor - 12 x 11.6 x 4&amp;nbsp;cm

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="722">A '''force meter''' is an instrument to measure the magnitude of a [[force]]. This is often just a spring contained within a cylinder that has a scale to mark the extension of the spring produced by the force. The unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|Newton]] (symbol N) in the [[International System of Units]] and in that case the meter may be referred to as a '''newtonmeter'''.

A spring-based force meter with uniformly marked scale intervals is relying on [[Hooke's law]] which states that the extension (or compression) of the spring is proportional to the applied force.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''GreenSun Energy''' is a [[Jerusalem]]-based Israeli company that has developed a new process for producing [[electricity]] from [[solar energy]]. As [[The Economist]] points out, solar energy is a logical development since "Israel is a country with plenty of sunshine, lots of sand and quite a few clever physicists and chemists."&lt;ref name=r1&gt; Solar energy in Israel; It's a knockout, Jul 23rd 2009, [[The Economist]] print edition [http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14082027]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Traditional [[photovoltaic cells]]  are made from thin sheets of [[silicon]] covered by glass plates.  In the GreenSun process, it is only the outer edges of the [[glass]] plates that are covered by thin strips of silicon.  The physicists and chemists at GreenSun, led by [[Renata Reisfeld]], coat the glass with metallic [[nanoparticle]]s and [[dye]]s to cause the sunlight falling on the glass to diffuse sideways toward the edges where the silicon strips turn it into electricity. &lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

A mixture of dyes is used to capture and absorb a wide spectrum of available light. Having absorbed the sunlight, the fluorescent dyes then re-radiate it. Interaction with the metallic nanoparticles turns light into a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]] known as [[surface plasmon]]s. The surface plasmons propagate over the glass surface and are intercepted by the silicon strips at the edges. The company would not reveal which metals are used in the process.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Because the process uses less silicon, it is far less expensive than conventional [[photovoltaic module]]s. It is also more efficient. In a conventional photovoltaic cell, much of the sun's energy is lost as heat because the energy of light varies across the spectrum (red light is less energetic than blue, for example). Only a particular amount of energy is needed to knock an [[electron]] free from the silicon [[atom]]s. If the sunlight is more energetic than necessary, more energy than usual is lost as heat. Sunlight scatters its energy, but the dye/nanoparticle mix in the GreenSun process delivers plasmons and [[photons]] of the right energy to knock electrons free more efficiently.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Economics==
GreenEnergy CEO [[Amnon Leikovich]] claims that the process, once put into production, could deliver electricity at about double the cost of a conventional power station.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;!-- this says the process is much less efficient than conventional one --&gt; Traditional photovoltaic modules deliver electricity at about five times the cost of a conventional power plant. Leikovich hopes that costs can be brought down even further.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; 

According to corporate spokesmen Eitan Shmueli, GreenSun's photovoltaic panels are capable of producing electricity from  low-intensity sunlight on cloudy days and from sunlight that reaches them from any angle.  The company claims that can turn the windows or walls of buildings into electricity-generating photovoltaic panels.&lt;ref&gt;New tech could coat buildings in efficient solar-energy panels, Avi Bar-Eli, HaAretz, July 30, 2009 [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1104003.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
While the perception of audio quality can be gauged through perceptual measurements, the testing is time-consuming to undertake. Consequently, a number of metrics have been developed to allow audio quality to be evaluated without the need for human listening. Standardized examples from [[telephony]] include [[PESQ]], [[POLQA]], [[PEVQ]] and [[PEAQ]]. HASQI was originally developed by Kates and Arehart to evaluate how the distortions introduced by [[hearing aids]] degrade quality.&lt;ref name="kates2010" /&gt; They also produced a new version in 2014.&lt;ref name="kates2014" /&gt;

Kressner et al.&lt;ref name="kressner" /&gt; tested a speech corpus different from the dataset used to develop HASQI and showed that the index generalizes well for listeners without a hearing loss with a performance comparable to [[PESQ]]. Kendrick et al.&lt;ref name="kendrick2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendrick|first1=Paul|last2=Li|first2=Francis|last3=Fazenda|first3=Bruno|last4=Jackson|first4=Iain|last5=Cox|first5=Trevor|title=Perceived Audio Quality of Sounds Degraded by Nonlinear Distortions and Single-Ended Assessment Using HASQI|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|date=2015|volume=63|issue=9|pages=698–712|url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17873}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that HASQI can grade the audio quality of music and geophonic, biophonic, and anthrophonic quotidian sounds, although their study used a more limited set of degradations.

== Method ==
HASQI and its 2014 revision are double-ended methods requiring both a clean reference and the degraded signal to allow evaluation. The index attempts to capture the effects of noise, nonlinear distortion, linear filtering and spectral changes, by computing the difference or correlation between key audio features. This is done by examining short-time signal envelopes to quantify the degradation caused by noise and nonlinear filtering, and long-time signal envelopes to quantify the effects of linear filtering. Version 2 of HASQI includes a model to capture some aspects of the peripheral [[auditory system]] for both normal and hearing impaired listeners.

Kendrick et al. developed a blind (single-ended) method, bHASQI, using machine learning. This enables the audio quality to be evaluated from just the degraded signal without needing the clean reference.&lt;ref name="kendrick2015" /&gt;

There are certain situations during which [[hand washing]] with water and soap are preferred over hand sanitizer, these include: eliminating bacterial spores of ''[[Clostridioides difficile (bacteria)|Clostridioides difficile]]'', parasites such as ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', and certain viruses like [[norovirus]] depending on the concentration of alcohol in the sanitizer (95% alcohol was seen to be most effective in eliminating most viruses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Nina A. |last2=Avva |first2=Usha |title=Alcohol Sanitizer |journal=StatPearls |date=2018 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513254/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if hands are contaminated with fluids or other visible contaminates, hand washing is preferred as well as when after using the toilet and if discomfort develops from the residue of alcohol sanitizer use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seal |first1=Kelsey |last2=Cimon |first2=Karen |last3=Argáez |first3=Charlene |title=Summary of Evidence |journal=PubMed Health |date=9 March 2017 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0097316/ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, CDC recommends hand sanitizers are not effective in removing chemicals such as pesticides.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Hand&gt;{{cite journal |title=When &amp; How to Wash Your Hands  {{!}} Handwashing {{!}} CDC |website=www.cdc.gov |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html |language=en-us|date=2018-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
===Fire===
Alcohol gel can catch fire, producing a translucent blue flame.  This is due to the [[flammable]] alcohol in the gel.  Some hand sanitizer gels may not produce this effect due to a high concentration of water or moisturizing agents. There have been some rare instances where alcohol has been implicated in starting fires in the operating room, including a case where alcohol used as an antiseptic pooled under the surgical drapes in an operating room and caused a fire when a cautery instrument was used. Alcohol gel was not implicated. To minimize the risk of fire, alcohol rub users are instructed to rub their hands until dry, which indicates that the flammable alcohol has evaporated.&lt;ref name=CDC_20030915&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/firesafety/default.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403230557/http://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/firesafety/default.htm| archivedate=2007-04-03| title = Alcohol-Based Hand-Rubs and Fire Safety |date=September 15, 2003| accessdate = 2007-04-26| publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire departments suggest refills for the alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be stored with cleaning supplies away from heat sources or open flames.&lt;ref&gt;Ohio OAC 1301:7-7-3405.5&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Skin===
Research shows that alcohol hand sanitizers do not pose any risk by eliminating beneficial microorganisms that are naturally present on the skin. The body quickly replenishes the beneficial microbes on the hands, often moving them in from just up the arms where there are fewer harmful microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Aiello  | title =Consumer antibacterial soaps: effective or just risky?  | journal =Clin Infect Dis  | year =2007  | doi =10.1086/519255  | first1 =A.

A study also shows that disinfecting hands with an antimicrobial detergent results in a greater barrier disruption of skin compared to alcohol solutions, suggesting an increased loss of skin lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Löffler  | first =Harald  |author2=Günter Kampf  | title = Hand disinfection: How irritant are alcohols?  | journal = Journal of Hospital Infection  | year = 2008  | volume = 70  | doi =10.1016/S0195-6701(08)60010-9  | pages =44–8  | pmid =18994681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=L.K.|year=2005|title=Less skin irritation from alcohol-based disinfectant than from detergent used for hand disinfection|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|volume=153|issue=6|pages=1142–1146|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06875.x|pmid=16307649|author2=E.

===Ingestion===
In the United States, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) controls antimicrobial handsoaps and sanitizers as [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) because they are intended for topical anti-microbial use to prevent disease in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.issa.com/data/files/articles/88/generalchemical.pdf| title =GENERAL GUIDE TO CHEMICAL CLEANING PRODUCT REGULATION| publisher =International Sanitary Supply Association, Inc.| last =Daniel S.

There have been reported incidents of people [[Surrogate alcohol|drinking the gel]] in prisons and hospitals, where alcohol is not allowed, to become intoxicated leading to its withdrawal from some establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8272799.stm| title =Prisoner 'drunk on swine flu gel'| publisher =BBC news online| date=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/well/live/dont-drink-the-hand-sanitizer.html Don’t Drink the Hand Sanitizer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514020528/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/well/live/dont-drink-the-hand-sanitizer.html |date=2017-05-14 }} NY Times Retrieved March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-alcohol based===
On April 30, 2015, the FDA announced that they were requesting more scientific data based on the safety of hand sanitizer. Emerging science also suggests that for at least some health care antiseptic active ingredients, systemic exposure (full body exposure as shown by detection of antiseptic ingredients in the blood or urine) is higher than previously thought, and existing data raise potential concerns about the effects of repeated daily human exposure to some antiseptic active ingredients. This would include hand antiseptic products containing alcohol and [[triclosan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm445002.htm| title =FDA issues proposed rule to address data gaps for certain active ingredients in health care antiseptics| publisher =U.S. Food and Drug Administration| date =2015-04-30| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150702001329/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm445002.htm| archivedate =2015-07-02| df =}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Consumer alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and [[health care]] ''hand alcohol'' or ''alcohol hand antiseptic agents'', are [[antiseptic]] products used to avoid transmission of [[pathogen]]s. These exist in liquid, foam, and easy-flowing gel formulations. The level of [[alcohol]] varies between 60% and 95%.

== Types ==
Alcohol-based hand rubs are extensively used in the hospital environment as an alternative to antiseptic soaps. Hand-rubs in the hospital environment have two applications: hygienic hand rubbing and surgical hand disinfection. Alcohol based hand rubs provide a better skin tolerance as compared to antiseptic soap.&lt;ref name="Boyce 2000 442"/&gt;
Hand rubs also prove to have more effective microbiological properties as compared to antiseptic soaps.

The same ingredients used in over-the-counter hand-rubs are also used in hospital hand-rubs: alcohols such [[ethanol]] and [[isopropanol]], sometimes combined with [[quats]] (quaternary ammonium cations) such as [[benzalkonium chloride]].  Quats are added at levels up to 200 parts per million to increase antimicrobial effectiveness. Although allergy to alcohol-only rubs is rare, fragrances, preservatives and quats can cause contact allergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal
| author= de Groot AC
| title = Contact allergy to cosmetics: causative ingredients
| journal = Contact Dermatitis
| volume = 17
| year = 1987
| pmid=3652687
| issue=1
| pages=26–34
| doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1987.tb02640.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These other ingredients do not evaporate like alcohol and accumulate leaving a "sticky" residue until they are removed with soap and water.

The most common brands of alcohol hand rubs include Aniosgel, Avant, Sterillium, Desderman and Allsept S. All hospital hand rubs must conform to certain regulations like EN 12054 for hygienic treatment and surgical disinfection by hand-rubbing. Products with a claim of "99.99% reduction" or 4Log reduction are ineffective in hospital environment, since the reduction must be more than "99.99%".&lt;ref name="cvvs"/&gt;

The hand sanitizer dosing systems for hospitals are designed to deliver a measured amount of the product for staff.  They are dosing pumps screwed onto a bottle or are specially designed dispensers with refill bottles. Dispensers for surgical hand disinfection are usually equipped with elbow controlled mechanism or infrared sensors to avoid any contact with the pump.

=== Surgical hand disinfection ===

Hands must be disinfected before any surgical procedure by hand washing with mild soap and then hand-rubbing with a sanitizer. Surgical disinfection requires a larger dose of the hand-rub and a longer rubbing time than is ordinarily used.  It is usually done in two applications according to specific hand-rubbing techniques, EN1499 (hygienic handwash), and EN 1500 (hygienic hand disinfection) to ensure that antiseptic is applied everywhere on the surface of the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | doi= 10.1053/jhin.2002.1357 |vauthors=Kampf G, Ostermeyer C | title = Inter-laboratory reproducibility of the hand disinfection reference procedure of EN 1500 | journal = J Hosp Infect| volume = 53 | issue=4 |pages=304–6 | date = Apr 2003 | pmid= 12660128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alcohol-free ===
[[File:Alcohol Free Hand Sanitizer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alcohol-free hand sanitizer]]

Some hand sanitizer products use agents other than alcohol to kill microorganisms, such as [[povidone-iodine]], [[benzalkonium chloride]] or [[triclosan]].&lt;ref name="Boyce John M., Pittet Didier"/&gt;

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC recommends "persistent" antiseptics for hand sanitizers.  Persistent activity is defined as the prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents or inhibits the proliferation or survival of microorganisms after application of the product. This activity may be demonstrated by sampling a site several minutes or hours after application and demonstrating bacterial antimicrobial effectiveness when compared with a baseline level. This property also has been referred to as "residual activity." Both substantive and nonsubstantive active ingredients can show a persistent effect if they substantially lower the number of bacteria during the wash period.

Laboratory studies have shown lingering benzalkonium chloride may be associated with antibiotic resistance in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increase in Resistance of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-Lactams Caused by Mutations Conferring Resistance to Benzalkonium Chloride, a Disinfectant Widely Used in Hospitals| pmc= 89614 | year = 1999 | last1 = Akimitsu | first1 = N | last2 = Hamamoto | first2 = H | last3 = Inoue | first3 = RI | last4 = Shoji | first4 = M | last5 = Akamine | first5 = A | last6 = Takemori | first6 = KI | last7 = Hamasaki | first7 = N | last8 = Sekimizu | first8 = K | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 3042–3043 | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | pmid = 10651623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3_supp/levy.htm| title = Antibacterial Household Products: Cause for Concern| accessdate = 2001-06-01| publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010816054514/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol7no3_supp/levy.htm| archivedate = 2001-08-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while no mechanism for resistance to alcohol has ever been described in bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/400/400_2c1feat6.html| title = CDC's Endorsement of Alcohol Hand Rubs Launches New Era in Hand Hygiene| date = December 1, 2002| first = Kathy| last = Dix| journal = Infection Control Today| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033742/http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/articles/400/400_2c1feat6.html| archivedate = January 23, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where alcohol sanitizers utilize 62%, or higher, alcohol by weight, only .1 to .13% of benzalkonium chloride by weight provides equivalent antimicrobial effectiveness.

A series of studies show that photodegradation of triclosan produced [[2,4-dichlorophenol]] and 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD).

Alcohol-free hand sanitizers may be effective immediately while on the skin, but the solutions themselves can become contaminated because alcohol is an in-solution preservative and without it, the alcohol-free solution itself is susceptible to contamination. However, even alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can become contaminated if the alcohol content is not properly controlled or the sanitizer is grossly contaminated with microorganisms during manufacture. In June 2009, alcohol-free Clarcon Antimicrobial Hand Sanitizer was pulled from the US market by the FDA, which found the product contained gross contamination of extremely high levels of various bacteria, including those which can "cause opportunistic infections of the skin and underlying tissues and could result in medical or surgical attention as well as permanent damage".  Gross contamination of any hand sanitizer by bacteria during manufacture will result in the failure of the effectiveness of that sanitizer and possible infection of the treatment site with the contaminating organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm164845.htm |accessdate=2009-06-15 |title=Consumers Warned Not to Use Clarcon Skin Products |date=June 15, 2009 |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614130646/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm164845.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Some products claim to kill microorganisms naturally, although these claims are not substantiated in any FDA monograph. All hand sanitizer products require [[National Drug Code]] designation in the United States and [[natural product number]] designation in Canada. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

These engines may be based on a number of [[#Thermodynamic cycles|thermodynamic cycles]] encompassing both open cycle devices such as those of [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]]&lt;ref name="caley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/cayley|title=Cayley's life and Air Engines|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Ericsson]]&lt;ref name="haeericsson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson|title=Ericsson's life and Air Engines|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the closed cycle engine of [[Robert Stirling]]&lt;ref name="haestirling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/stirling|title=Stirling's life and Air Engines|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hot air engines are distinct from the better known internal combustion based engine and steam engine.

In a typical implementation, air is repeatedly heated and cooled in a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] and the resulting expansion and contraction is used to move a [[piston]] and produce useful [[mechanical work]].

==Definition==

[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01481.00001(1).jpg|thumb|A [[praxinoscope]] made by Ernst Plank, of [[Nuremberg]], Germany, and powered by a miniature hot air engine. It is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].]]

The term "hot air engine" specifically excludes any engine performing a [[thermodynamic cycle]] in which the working fluid undergoes a [[phase transition]], such as the [[Rankine cycle]]. Also excluded are conventional [[internal combustion engine]]s, in which heat is added to the working fluid by combustion of fuel within the working cylinder.  Continuous combustion types, such as [[George Brayton]]'s Ready Motor and the related [[gas turbine]], could be seen as borderline cases.

==History==
The expansive property of heated air was known to the ancients. [[Hero of Alexandria]]'s ''Pneumatica'' describes devices that might be used to automatically open temple doors when a fire was lit on a sacrificial altar. Devices called hot air engines, or simply ''air engines'', have been recorded from as early as 1699. In 1699, [[Guillaume Amontons]] (1663–1705) presented, to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, a report on his invention:  a wheel that was made to turn by heat&lt;ref name="haeamontons-hae04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/amontons/amontons-heated-air-engine/|title=Amontons' Fire Wheel|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The wheel was mounted vertically.  Around the wheel's hub were water-filled chambers.  Air-filled chambers on the wheel's rim were heated by a fire under one side of the wheel.  The heated air expanded and, via tubes, forced water from one chamber to another, unbalancing the wheel and causing it to turn.  

See:
*  Amontons (20 June 1699) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_czOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Moyen de substituer commodement l'action du feu, à la force des hommes et des chevaux pour mouvoir les machines"] (Means of conveniently substituting the action of fire for the force of men and horses in order to move [i.e., power] machines), ''Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences'', pages 112-126.  The ''Mémoires'' appear in the ''Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences, année 1699'', which was published in 1732.  The operation of Amontons' ''moulin à feu'' (fire mill) is explained on pages 123-126; his machine is illustrated on the plate following page 126.
*  For an account of Amontons' fire-powered wheel in English, see:  Robert Stuart, ''Historical and Descriptive Anecdotes of Steam-engines and of Their Inventors and Improvers'' (London, England:  Wightman and Cramp, 1829), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YU01AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 130-132] ; an illustration of the machine appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=YU01AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA351#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 351].&lt;/ref&gt; around the time when the [[Gas laws|laws of gasses]] were first set out, and early patents include those of [[Henry Wood (engineer)|Henry Wood]], Vicar of High Ercall near [[Coalbrookdale]] Shropshire (English patent 739 of 1759) and  [[Thomas Mead (engineer)|Thomas Mead]], an engineer from Sculcoats Yorkshire (English patent 979 of 1791),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Sier|title=Hot air caloric and stirling engines. Vol.1, A history, page 56|edition=1st Edition (Revised)|publisher=L.A. Mair|year=1999|isbn=0-9526417-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter in particular containing the essential elements of a [[displacer]] type engine (Mead termed it the transferrer). It is unlikely that either of these patents resulted in an actual engine and the earliest workable example was probably the open cycle [[furnace]] gas engine of the English inventor [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] {{circa|1807}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://engine.stirling.cz/tedom-stirling-engine-history.html Stirling engine history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamair.co.uk/book2.htm Detailed contents of the book ''Hot air caloric and stirling engines. Vol.1, A history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that [[Robert Stirling]]'s air engine of 1818, which incorporated his innovative ''Economiser'' (patented in 1816) was the first air engine put to practical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Finkelstein, T  |author2=Organ, A.J|title=Chapter 2.2 Air Engines|publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing|year=2001|isbn=1-86058-338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economiser, now known as the [[Stirling engine#Regenerator|regenerator]], stored heat from the hot portion of the engine as the air passed to the cold side, and released heat to the cooled air as it returned to the hot side. This innovation improved the efficiency of Stirling's engine and should be present in any air engine that is properly called a [[Stirling engine]].

Stirling patented a second hot air engine, together with his brother James, in 1827. They inverted the design so that the hot ends of the displacers were underneath the machinery and they added a compressed air pump so the air within could be increased in pressure to around 20 atmospheres. It is stated by Chambers to have been unsuccessful, owing to mechanical defects and to “the unforeseen accumulation of heat, not fully extracted by the sieves or sin ill passages in the cool part of the regenerator, of which the external surface was not sufficiently large to throw off the unrecovered heat when the engine was working with highly compressed air.” 

Parkinson and Crossley, English patent, 1828 came up with their own hot air engine. In this engine the air-chamber is partly exposed, by submergence in cold water, to external cold, and its upper portion is heated by steam. An internal vessel moves up and down in this chamber, and in so doing displaces the air, alternately exposing it to the hot and cold influences of the cold water and the hot steam, changing its temperature and expansive condition. The fluctuations cause the reciprocation of a piston in a cylinder to whose ends the air-chamber is alternately connected.

In 1829 Arnott patented his air expansion machine where a fire is placed on a grate near the bottom of a close cylinder, and the cylinder is full of fresh air recently admitted. A loose piston is pulled upwards so that all the air in the cylinder above will be made to pass by a tube through the fire, and will receive an increased elasticity tending to the expansion or increase of volume, which the fire is capable of giving it.

He is followed the next year (1830) by Captain Ericsson who patented his second hot air engine. The specification describes it more particularly, as consisting of a “circular chamber, in which a cone is made to revolve on a shaft or axis by means of leaves or wings, alternately exposed to the pressure of steam; these wings or leaves being made to work through slits or openings of a circular plane, which revolves obliquely to, and is thereby kept in contact with the side of the cone.”

Ericsson built his third hot air engine (the caloric engine) in 1833 which excited so much interest a few years ago in England; and which, if it should be brought into practical operation, will prove the most important mechanical invention ever conceived by the human mind, and one that will confer greater benefits on civilized life than any that has ever preceded it. For the object of it is the production of mechanical power by the agency of heat, at an expenditure of fuel so exceedingly small, that man will have an almost unlimited mechanical force at his command, in regions where fuel may now be said hardly to exist.

1838 sees the patent of Franchot hot air engine, certainly the hot air engine that was best following the Carnot requirements.

So far all these air engines have been unsuccessful, but the technology was maturing. In 1842, James Stirling, the brother of Robert, build the famous Dundee Stirling Engine. This one at least lasted 2-3 years but then was discontinued due to improper technical contrivances.
Hot air engines is a story of trials and errors, and it took another 20 years before hot air engines could be used on an industrial scale. The first reliable hot air engines were built by Shaw, Roper, Ericsson. Several thousands of them were built. 

==Thermodynamic cycles==
{{Main article|Thermodynamic cycle}}
A hot air engine [[thermodynamic cycle]] can (ideally) be made out of 3 or more [[Thermodynamic process|process]]es (typical 4). The processes can be any of these:
* [[isothermal process]] (at constant temperature, maintained with heat added or removed from a heat source or sink)
* [[isobaric process]] (at constant pressure)
*[[isochoric process|isometric / isochoric process]] (at constant volume)
*[[adiabatic process]] (no heat is added or removed from the working fluid)
** [[isentropic process]], [[reversible adiabatic process]] (no heat is added or removed from the working fluid - and the [[entropy]] is constant)
*[[isenthalpic process]] (the [[enthalpy]] is constant)

Some examples (not all hot air cycles, as defined above) are as follows:
{{Table of thermodynamic cycles}}

Yet another example is the [[Vuilleumier cycle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6617">The general use of the phrase ‘input lag’ is used to describe the delay between an electrical input from the point of stimulation to action, for example, pressing a button and seeing the event after as little as 1/24th of a second.

In [[video games]], '''input lag''' is either the delay between the television or monitor receiving a signal and it being displayed on the screen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flatpanelshd.com/focus.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1229335064|title=Input lag test - FlatpanelsHD|website=www.flatpanelshd.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[input lag#Display lag|display lag]] below), or the delay between pressing a button and seeing the game react.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/2803|title=Exploring Input Lag Inside and Out|last=Wilson|first=Derek|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronic hardware development, input lag is the delay between an electronic input signal being generated (pressing a button as above) and processed (I/O ports have been read, and memory updated to reflect the state of the input). In this field, the phenomena detailed below, are referred to as Output Lag. More formally, the terms 'Input Latency' and 'Output Latency' are also used. Due to gamers being largely unaware of the phenomenon of input lag at this low level, the terms input lag and output lag became confused over time, and the above description, where input and output lag are combined into a singular phenomenon known as input lag, has become popular.

Overall, the correct terminology is clear - A delay between a physical input occurring (e.g., I/O pin voltage change) and it being processed electronically (I/O pins read by processor and memory registers updated to reflect the state of the pins) is input lag, and a delay between an electronic output being sent (e.g., memory register set to reflect the desired state of an output) and it being processed into a physically observable phenomenon (e.g., memory register read and I/O pin voltage modified accordingly), is output lag. In short, Input Lag occurs on input devices, Output Lag occurs on output devices.

The following are descriptions based on the colloquial use of the term, as used by gamers.

==Potential causes of delay from pressing a button to the game reacting==
The potential causes for "input lag"- according to the second definition- are described below (steps which have negligible contributions to the input lag have been omitted). Each step in the process increases "input lag", however the net result may be unnoticeable if the overall "input lag" is low enough.

===Controller sends signal to console===
For wired controllers, this lag is negligible. For wireless controllers, opinions vary as to the significance of this lag. Some people claim to notice extra lag when using a wireless controller, while other people claim that the 4–8 milliseconds of lag is negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lockergnome.com/uncategorized/2011/08/26/wireless-controller-latency-is-it-a-problem/|title=Wireless Controller Latency: is It a Problem? - LockerGnome|date=2011-08-27|website=LockerGnome|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network lag (online gaming only)===
Since the game requires information on the location of other players, there is sometimes a delay as this information travels over the network. This occurs in games where the input signals are "held" for several frames (to allow time for the data to arrive at every player's console/PC) before being used to render the next frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://skullgirls.com/2011/09/skullgirls-ggpo-and-you/|title=Skullgirls, GGPO… and You « Skullgirls 2nd Encore|website=skullgirls.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 25 FPS, holding 4 frames adds {{nowrap|160 ms}} to the overall input lag. However, very few modern online games use this method. The view angle of every modern AAA shooter game is completely unaffected by network lag, for example. In addition, lag compensating code makes classification a complex issue.

===Console/PC processes next frame===
A [[videogame console]] or [[personal computer|PC]] will send out a new [[frame rate|frame]] once it has finished performing the necessary calculations to create it. The rate at which this is achieved is measured with the [[frame rate]]. Using common 60&amp;nbsp;Hz monitor as an example, the maximum theoretical frame rate is 60 [[frames per second|FPS]] (frames per second), which means the minimum theoretical input lag for the overall system is {{nowrap|17 ms (1 second/60FPS)}}. Theoretical maximum FPS is usually limited by the video monitor, since the game cannot display more frames per second than the monitor's refresh rate (with exception of turning vertical sync (v-sync) off which in turn causes graphical artifacts). In situations where the CPU and/or GPU load is high, FPS can drop below the monitors refresh rate.

===Display lag===
{{main|Display lag}}
This is the lag caused by the television or monitor (which is also called "input lag" by the first definition above, but "output lag' by the second definition). Image processing (such as upscaling, 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, motion smoothing, edge smoothing) takes time and therefore adds some degree of input lag. It is generally considered that input lag of a television below {{nowrap|30 ms}} is not noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/monitors/2009/02/06/the-dark-side-of-overdrive/4|title=The Dark Side of Overdrive|website=bit-tech|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the frame has been processed, the final step is the [[pixel response time]] for the pixel to display the correct colour for the new frame.

== Typical overall response times ==
Testing has found that overall "input lag" (from controller input to display response) times of approximately {{nowrap|200 ms}} are distracting to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-lag-factor-article?page=2|title=Console Gaming: The Lag Factor|page2=|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears that (excluding the monitor/television display lag) {{nowrap|133 ms}} is an average response time and the most sensitive games ([[fighting games]], [[first person shooters]] and [[rhythm games]]) achieve response times of {{nowrap|67 ms}} (excluding display lag).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Image:Jet aerator at paper mill.jpg|thumb|Jet aerators operating in a waste sludge tank at a paper mill.]]

==Working principle==
Jet aerators are applied across a wide range of water, [[wastewater]] and [[biosolids]] treatment applications. Their primary purpose is to transfer oxygen to the liquid or sludge. A jet aerator works through aspirating technology by simultaneously introducing large volumes of high kinetic energy liquid and air through one or more jet nozzles. The high velocity liquid exits the inner, primary jet and rapidly mixes with the incoming air in the outer jet. This intense mixing and high degree of turbulence in the gas/liquid cloud travels outward from the jet along the basin floor prior to the vertical rise of the gas bubble column to the liquid surface.

==Applications, features and benefits== 

===Oxygen transfer efficiency and energy savings===

In most industrial wastewater and biosolids applications jet aerators exhibit superior oxygen transfer efficiency compared to other aeration technologies. The hydrodynamic conditions within the jet and fine bubble cloud produces continuous surface renewal at the gas/liquid interface resulting in higher alpha factors. This results in superior process oxygen transfer performance in the presence of surfactants, extracelluar enzymes and high MLS concentrations.

===Process flexibility===

Jet aerators do not require any external air source (i.e. compressor), except for the surrounding atmosphere. Jet aerators can be installed either as submersible units or piped through the tank wall using an external dry-installed chopper pump to feed the aspirating ejector(s). Jet aerators are easily configured into any basin geometry including circular, rectangular, looped reactors and sloped wall basins. Jet aerators are ideally suited for deep tank processes. The jet oxidation ditch is an example of technology innovation where the combination of a deeper basin design, bottom to top mixing and conservation of momentum combines to make a very efficient treatment process. In this and other applications the independent control of oxygen transfer and mixing is a valuable feature for both process control and energy savings.

===Applications===

* Equalization basins at [[sewage treatment plant]]s
* Sewage wet wells and lift stations
* [[Aerobic digester]]s
* [[Leachate]] processing from [[landfill]]s
* Waste processing at [[slaughterhouse]]s, poultry abattoirs, fish processing plants, etc.

A '''magic tee''' (or '''magic T''' or '''hybrid tee''') is a [[hybrid coil|hybrid]] or [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Hybrids|3 dB coupler]] used in [[microwave]] systems. It is an alternative to the [[rat-race coupler]]. In contrast to the rat-race, the three-dimensional structure of the magic tee makes it less readily constructed in planar technologies such as [[microstrip]] or [[stripline]].

The magic tee was originally developed in World War II, and first published by W. A. Tyrell of [[Bell Labs]] in a 1947 IRE paper.&lt;ref&gt;"Hybrid circuits for microwaves", W. A. Tyrell, [[Proc. IRE]], vol. 35, pp. 1294-1306; November 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert L. Kyhl and [[Robert H. Dicke|Bob Dicke]] independently created magic tees around the same time.

==Structure==
The magic tee is a combination of [[E-plane and H-plane|E and H plane]] tees. Arm 3 forms an H-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arm 4 forms an E-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arms 1 and 2 are sometimes called the ''side'' or ''collinear'' arms. Port 3 is called the ''H-plane port'', and is also called the ''Σ port'', ''sum port'' or the ''P-port'' (for "parallel"). Port 4 is the ''E-plane port'', and is also called the ''Δ port'', ''difference port'', or ''S-port'' (for "series"). There is no one single established convention regarding the numbering of the ports.

To function correctly, the magic tee must incorporate an internal matching structure. This structure typically consists of a post inside the H-plane tee and an inductive iris inside the E-plane limb, though many alternative structures have been proposed. Dependence on the matching structure means that the magic tee will only work over a limited frequency band.

==Operation==
The name ''magic tee'' is derived from the way in which power is divided among the various ports. A signal injected into the H-plane port will be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, and will be in phase. A signal injected into the E-plane port will also be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, but will be 180 degrees out of phase. If signals are fed in through ports 1 and 2, they are added at the H-plane port and subtracted at the E-plane port.&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Microwave Techniques and Laboratory Manual" By M. L. Sisodia, Published by New Age International, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, with the ports numbered as shown, and to within a phase factor, the full [[scattering parameters|scattering matrix]] for an ideal magic tee is

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\
  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \\
 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
(the signs of the elements in the fourth row and fourth column of this matrix may be reversed, depending on the polarity assumed for port 4).

==Magic==
If, by means of a suitable internal structure, the E-plane (difference) and H-plane (sum) ports are simultaneously matched, then by [[bilateral symmetry|symmetry]], [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]] and [[conservation of energy]] it may be shown that the two collinear ports are also matched, and are 'magically' isolated from each other.

The E-field of the dominant mode in each port is perpendicular to the broad wall of the [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]. The signals in the E-plane and H-plane ports therefore have orthogonal polarizations, and so (considering the symmetry of the structure) there can be no communication between these two ports.

For a signal entering the H-plane port, a well-designed matching structure will prevent any of the power in the signal being reflected back out of the same port. As there can be no communication with the E-plane port, and again considering the symmetry of the structure, then
the power in this signal must be divided equally between the two collinear ports.

Similarly for the E-plane port, if the matching structure eliminates any reflection from this port, then the power entering it must be divided equally between the two collinear ports.

Now by reciprocity, the coupling between any pair of ports is the same in either direction (the scattering matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]]). So if the H-plane port is matched, then half the power entering either one of the collinear ports will leave by the H-plane port. If the E-plane port is also matched, then half power will leave by the E-plane port. In this circumstance, there is no power 'left over' either to be reflected out of the first collinear port or to be transmitted to the other collinear port. Despite apparently being in direct communication with each other, the two collinear ports are 'magically' isolated.

The isolation between the E-plane and H-plane ports is wide-band and is as perfect as is the symmetry of the device. The isolation between the collinear ports is however limited by the performance of the matching structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">'''Market urbanism''' is an [[urban planning|urban policy]] theory which advocates for the liberalization of [[urban planning]] and [[transportation]] policy. Market urbanists espouse a wide array of views, but generally they support ideas and programs such as loosening  urban land use and [[zoning]] regulations, implementing [[congestion pricing]] on public roads, and applying [[classical liberal]] thought to urban policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketurbanism.com/2008/07/16/amateur-economist-zoning-hurts-housing-affordability/ Amateur Economist: Zoning Hurts Housing Affordability]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketurbanism.com/2009/04/23/why-pricing-eliminates-congestion/ How Pricing Tolls Right Eliminates Congestion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketurbanism.com/2016/02/21/who-plans-jane-jacobs-hayekian-critique-of-urban-planning/ Who Plans?: Jane Jacobs’ Hayekian critique of urban planning]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Adam Hengels, founder of the [http://www.marketurbanism.com ''Market Urbanism''] blog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/02/28/can-market-urbanism-revive-u-s-cities/ Can Market Urbanism Revive U.S. Cities?]

[[File:Welcome doormat.JPG|thumb|A doormat inscribed with a message]]
A '''mat''' is a piece of [[textile|fabric]] material that generally is placed on a [[floor]] or other flat surface. Mats serve a range of purposes including:
* serving to clean items passed over it, such as a doormat, which removes dirt from the soles of shoes
* protecting that which is above the mat, such as a wrestling or [[Mat (gymnastics)|gymnastics mat]], or an anti-vibration mat
* protecting that which is beneath the mat, such as a [[place mat]] or the [[mat (picture framing)|matting]] used in archival framing and preservation of documents and paintings
* providing a regular or flat surface, such as a cushioned computer [[mousepad]]

==Types==
=== In domestic settings ===
* A doormat or door-mat&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd Ed. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; is a flat, usually rectangular, object placed immediately outside or inside the entrance to a house or other [[building]], to allow people to easily scrub or wipe the soles of their [[shoes]] before entering. Doormats are usually made from tough, long-lasting material such as [[coir]], palmyra ([[Borassus|palm]]) fibres and stalks, nylon, rubber, cloth, or aluminium and other metals. A doormat may also be known as a welcome mat, as its location at an entrance constitutes a "welcome" to visitors, and may therefore also bear some word, message or sign of [[greeting]]. This in turn has given rise to a subculture of cartoons featuring characters returning home to find (to the reader) a humorous message on the doormat. The lowly purpose for which doormats exist has also led to informal use of the term as a reference to people who behave timidly or passively when exploited by others{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} (see also [[Caspar Milquetoast]]).
* A cabinet mat is a [[Rubber mat|mat made of rubber]] that protects kitchen cabinets, more particularly kitchen sink base cabinets, from leaks, water damage, mold and household item spills that commonly occur in the kitchen sink cabinet.
* A bath mat is a device used on the floor of a [[bathroom]] to provide a warm non-slip surface, and to absorb small amounts of [[water]], much like a [[towel]].
* A place mat or serving mat is a flat piece of fabric or other type of  material used on a table at the points at which dishes and plates will be located during a meal. One of the common purposes of such mats is to provide a thermal and physical barrier between that which is placed on the table, and the table itself—for instance, to stop hot objects from marring the table's finish.

=== Car mats ===
{{Main|Vehicle mat}}
A [[car mat]] is designed to help protect a [[vehicle]]'s carpeted floors. One major use of a car mat is to keep mud, sand and snow from contacting the carpeted floors. Some require fixation points to ensure they remain fixed in position.

[[Carpet]] mats and rubber mats differ in a number of ways. Carpet mats are generally tufted and have a rubberised anti-slip backing. On the other hand, rubber car mats are heavy duty and higher durability. While some car mats are the plain colour of [[rubber]], many contain branded company logos, cartoon characters or advertisements. Some are in textile form of carpet material. They can also come in a wide range of colours. The terms universal and custom fit mats differentiate between floor mats that will fit a multitude of different cars and those that are specifically designed to fit only one chassis.

=== Anti-fatigue mats ===
"Anti-fatigue mats" are designed to help a person who is working in a standing position for prolonged periods of time. Most anti-fatigue matting is a combination of an ergonomic pattern and a cushioning underlay. The cushioning causes constant subconscious balance checks and micro movements that stimulate blood flow through the legs and lower extremities. This results in better circulation and less fatigue. The cushioning underlay insulates the feet from the hard surface, cold floors, vibrations, moisture and sound.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notrax.eu/cm/208/industrial-matting|title=Industrial Matting – Notrax® Ergonomic Anti-Fatigue &amp; Safety Matting – Notrax® Mats for Professional Use|website=notrax.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their unique design encourages the user to make continual micro-movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matcentre.co.uk/our-blog/anti-fatigue-mats-study.html|title=Anti Fatigue Mats – The Unique Rubber Matting|website=matcentre.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223151749/http://www.matcentre.co.uk/our-blog/anti-fatigue-mats-study.html|archivedate=2014-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a wealth of health benefits, such as minimizing back pain, foot pain, weariness, stress, etc. Anti-fatigue mats are one of the approaches to prevent injuries, caused by working in a standing position. In a study at the Center of Ergonomics at the University of Michigan in 1987, ergonomist Mark Redfern concluded that different standing surfaces can have dramatic effects on physical fatigue. Workers who stood on anti-fatigue mats were able to reduce the level of fatigue and discomfort by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstmats.co.uk/blogs/buying-guides/guide-to-anti-fatigue-mats|title=Anti-Fatigue Mats - The Ultimate Buyer Guide {{!}} First Mats UK|website=www.firstmats.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mat is recommended by Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The range of common materials for manufacturing anti-fatigue mats includes vinyl, wood, PVC tubing, rubber, PVC closed cell foam, polypropylene, nitrile rubber. Anti-fatigue mats were initially used in factories and production lines where staff has to stand for the majority of their working shifts.

Anti-fatigue mats come in various types and materials for industrial or commercial applications for a variety of workplace conditions that exist as well as the variety of workplace designs from individual work benches, to large assembly lines or complex manufacturing work stations. Work place environments can vary from dry areas to wet or extremely oily areas. Plus specialized industries may need additional properties such as fire retardant matting for welding, static dissipative matting for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, anti-microbial for food industry applications.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Today, this type of ergonomic mat is commonly used during trade shows for floor covering, in hospitals and clinics during surgeries to cover the floor near surgical tables to minimize surgeons fatigue resulted from continuous standing. Also these mats are used in housekeeping, especially for kitchen floors to alleviate fatigue during cooking.

=== Cleanroom mats ===
{{Main|Sticky mat}}
The purpose of a [[clean room mat]] is to keep sterile the areas that require ultimate protection from dirt, [[bacteria]] and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats are made up of multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign [[pollution]] elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.

An alternative clean room mat is one made from polymeric material. Polymeric products are made from a blend of pure polymeric compounds and have a three- to five-year life cycle. When a polymeric surface becomes dirty, operators can clean it with a sponge and a mop with detergent and dry the surface with a squeegee. This quick cleaning process can be incorporated into the facility’s regular wet-clean cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T. |title=Examination of air and surface particulate levels from cleanroom mats and polymeric flooring|journal=[[EJPPS (journal)|European Journal of Parenteral and Pharmaceutical Sciences]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=110–117|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mats differ by composition:

* One-piece mats are usually used on the permanent basis. One-piece mats can be handcrafted or factory-made. The standard shapes of one-piece mat are rectangular, [[square (geometry)|square]], round and elliptic. One-piece mats are produced in the huge variety of sizes and colors. Real and synthetic materials are used for one-piece mats production.
* Linear length mats are manufactured as rolls that can extend 20 meters up to 40 meters for long production lines, assembly lines and packing lines. Mats are manufactured in standard lengths or factory-made to custom sizes.
* Modular mats, also well known as interlocking tiles or interlocking floor mats, are manufactured using the “jigsaw puzzle” [[structure]]. Unlike one-piece mats, modular mats consist of numerous elements that are easily and seamlessly assembled. Compared to other types of mats, interlocking mats come in several sizes, depending on the number of pieces in one kit. Modular mats are a good solution for non-rectangular areas where standard shape mats are useless. Interlocking mats are commonly used on a one-time or temporary basis: fitness centres and [[sport]] competitions, trade shows and conferences. Modular mats require less place for storage and can be easily transported.

=== Others ===
* an anti-vibration mat, which performs the function of isolating vibration between that which is above the mat and that which is below. Such a mat might typically be used when mounting a heavy machine which [[Vibration|vibrates]], onto a concrete floor; in the absence of the anti-vibration mat, the machine tend to erode the floor through abrasion. Contrawise, some machines, such as the [[lithography]] machines used in [[integrated circuit|chip]] [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]]s, need to be isolated from vibrations in their locale, and so are mounted on anti-vibration mats.
* a [[slipmat]], a circular piece of slippery cloth or synthetic material designed to allow [[disc jockey]]s to turn or stop [[vinyl records]] on [[phonograph|record player]]s, or to [[Scratching|scratch]].
* a [[bar mat]] (not [[beermat]]), a rectangular piece of rubber or towelling material that is used to protect the counter top and/or soak up spilt drinks in a bar or pub.
* an entrance mat, which performs the function of trapping and retaining dust and soil at the entrances. It will also trap moisture to prevent slip and fall accidents. The purpose is having better indoor environment and better air quality. It should be easier to clean the entrance mat than all the interiors.

==History==
{{Update-EB|section=y|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Dry grass mat, also called "Korai paai" and found widely in Tamil Nadu.JPG|thumb|The mats made from ''[[Cyperus pangorei]] (Korai grass in Tamil) are called "Korai paai" in Tamil and can be found widely in the households of Tamil Nadu, usually in the size 6 feet by 3 feet.]]

'''Matting''' or  '''floor covering'''  or  '''rugs''' is any of many coarse [[woven]] or [[Braid|plait]]ed fibrous materials used for covering floors or furniture, for hanging as screens, for wrapping up heavy merchandise and for other miscellaneous purposes. In the [[United Kingdom]], under the name of "[[coir]]" matting, a large amount of a coarse kind of [[carpet]] is made from [[coconut]] fibre; and the same material, as well as strips of cane, [[manila hemp]], various grasses and rushes, is largely employed in various forms for making doormats. Large quantities of the coconut fibre are woven in heavy looms, then cut up into various sizes, and finally bound round the edges by a kind of rope made from the same material. The mats may be of one colour only, or they may be made of different colours and in different designs. Sometimes the names of institutions are introduced into the mats.
Due to the silky nature and tensile strength, '''jute mats''' or '''mattings''' have started being used as floor covering or doormats, runners and in different forms.  Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute Mats and mattings starting from 1&amp;nbsp;m width to 6&amp;nbsp;m width and of continuous length are easily being woven in Southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and in different weaves such as boucle, Panama, anlold herringbone. Jute mats and rugs are made on both powerlooms and handlooms  in large volumes in Kerala, India. Indian jute mattings / rugs are being widely used in USA and European countries, due to its soft nature.  Jute can be easily bleached, colored or printed, similar to textile fibres, with eco-friendly dyes &amp; chemicals.  Hand-knotted Jute carpets &amp; mattings are also being made from Kerala, India.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another type of mat is made exclusively from the above-mentioned coir rope by arranging alternate layers in sinuous and straight paths, and then stitching the parts together. It is also largely used for the outer covering of ships' fenders. [[Perforated]] and otherwise prepared [[rubber]], as well as wire-woven material, are also largely utilized for door and floor mats. Matting of various kinds is very extensively employed throughout [[India]] for floor coverings, the bottoms of bedsteads, fans and fly-flaps, etc.; and a considerable export trade in such manufactures is carried on. The materials used are numerous; but the principal substances are [[straw]], the bulrushes [[Typha]] elephantina and Typha angustifolia, leaves of the [[date palm]] (Phoenix sylvestris), of the dwarf palm ([[Chamaerops]] Ritchiana), of the Palmyra palm ([[Borassus]] flabelliformis), of the [[coconut palm]] (Cocos nucifera) and of the [[screw pine]] (Pandanus odoratissimus), the munja or munj grass ([[Saccharum]] Munja) and allied grasses, and the mat grasses ''[[Cyperus textilis]]'' and ''[[Cyperus pangorei]].

The mats made from Cyperus pangorei (Korai in Tamil) are called "Korai paai" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industreecrafts.org/Natural%20fibres%20-%20Korai%20grass.htm|title=Indus Tree Crafts Foundation – Natural fibers – Korai grass|website=industreecrafts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found widely in the households of [[Tamil Nadu]], usually in the size 6 feet by 3 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-others/tp-variety/grass-mats-still-hold-their-own-here/article2194340.ece|title=Grass mats still hold their own here|website=The Hindu Business Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually dyed in colors of bright red, green or purple, resulting in patterns. These mats differ in their levels of flexibility, fineness and price. [[Pattamadai]] paai (named after the region Pattamadai, near [[Tirunelveli]]) is generally considered the finest "paai". Many of these Indian grass-mats are  examples of elegant design, and the colors in which they are woven are rich, harmonious and effective.&lt;ref&gt;http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/6356/1/NPR%208(5)%20542-545.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mats made from [[Vandavasi]] are also famed and used commonly. These days, along with these natural grass mats, one can also find plastic mats, which are easier to maintain and are cheaper.  This class of work obtains in India, [[Japan]] and other Eastern countries. Vast quantities of coarse matting used for packing [[furniture]], heavy and coarse goods, [[flax]] and other plants, etc., are made in [[Russia]] from the bast or inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the [[lime tree]]. This industry centres in the great forest governments of [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Viatka]], [[Nizhniy-Novgorod]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Perm]] and [[Simbirsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |title=Matting |volume=17 |page=902 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/902/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting safety and health==
Quality floor mats improve [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) and safety in [[Commerce|commercial]] and [[residential]] applications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Studies have shown that most toxic chemicals that end up inside a home are tracked in on people's shoes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A well-used door mat can trap and hold dirt and [[allergens]], preventing their spread into the rest of the building, significantly improving IAQ and reducing the need for extensive [[Floor cleaning|cleaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study:  Improving IAQ and Facility Cleanliness|url=http://www.eaglemat.com/blog/case-study-improving-iaq-and-facility-cleanliness-with-recessed-grill-mats/|publisher=Eagle Mat and Floor Products|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally many floor mats are resistant to welding sparks and can keep employees from slipping on industrial lubricants or water.

Floor mats also provide safe surfaces on which to walk, preventing slips and falls that cause injury and liability damages. Anti-slip mats are now required in many areas to ensure maximum protection for both employees and customers. Specialized anti-slip mats are now available that provide extra resistance to the chemicals and grease that are sometimes found in industrial and food service settings.

Custom made anti-fatigue mats are also used in work areas where employees are required to stand for long periods of time. Employers have found that much muscle strain and injury endured by workers is caused by improper flooring conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Retail Grocery Stores|url=https://www.osha.gov/ergonomics/guidelines/retailgrocery/retailgrocery.html|publisher=OSHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-supportive surfaces cause fatigue and foot, back and neck pain due to impaired circulation. Anti-fatigue mats were shown to improve worker productivity by reducing the number of sick-days and injuries sustained by workers whose mobility would otherwise be restricted. Mat has a good taste.

'''Michael Chorost''' (born December 26, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] book author, essayist, and public speaker. Born with severe loss of hearing due to [[rubella]], his hearing was partially restored with a [[cochlear implant]] in 2001 and he had his other ear implanted in 2007. 

He wrote a memoir of the experience, titled ''Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2005, {{ISBN|0-61-837829-4}}). Its paperback version has a different subtitle, ''Rebuilt: My Journey Back to the Hearing World'', {{ISBN|0-61-871760-9}}. In August 2006 ''Rebuilt'' won the [http://www.penusa.org/awards/winners PEN/USA Book Award for Creative Nonfiction]. 

His second book, ''World Wide Mind: The Coming Integration of Humanity, Machines, and the Internet'', {{ISBN|1-43-911914-7}}, was published by [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] on February 15, 2011.

Dr. Chorost has published in ''Wired'', ''New Scientist'', ''Astronomy Now'', ''The Futurist'', ''The Scientist'', ''Technology Review'', the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', and ''SKY''. He co-wrote a PBS television show titled ''The 22nd Century'' which aired in January 2007. He was a member of the [[San Francisco Writers Workshop]].

Dr. Chorost is frequently interviewed as an authority on cochlear implants and neurally controlled prosthetics by national media such as ''PBS Newshour'', the ''New York Times'' and ''The Economist''. 

He lectures frequently at universities, conferences, corporations, and organizations for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michaelchorost.com/mchorost-speaking-upcoming.htm |title=Michael Chorost |publisher=Michael Chorost |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520215634/http://www.michaelchorost.com/mchorost-speaking-upcoming.htm |archivedate=2012-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="703">A '''multrum''' is a large [[composting]] vessel, predominantly meant to decompose [[Human waste|toilet excreta]] but also other organic residue. It is originally a composite word consisting of "multna" which means moldering or composting in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and "rum" which is the Swedish word for room. A multrum has over several decades become a noun and has come to mean any large composting chamber connected to a [[toilet]]. This should not be confused with [[Clivus multrum]] which is a proprietary product.  In [[Scandinavia]] there are many kinds of [[composting toilet]] multrums like Mullis,  [http://www.compostera.org CompostEra] besides Clivus Multrum.

In 1995, professor [[Massimo Grattarola]] of the [[Biophysics]] and Electrical Engineering Department (DIBE) at the [[University of Genoa]], in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], created an undergraduate and graduate program named '''neurobioengineering''' (also referred to as '''neuroengineering''').&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Marco Bove, In Memoriam Website for Dr. M. Grattarola, University of Genova, Italy - https://web.archive.org/web/20020714024312/http://www.bio.dibe.unige.it/people/Grattarola/grattarola.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; The program was designed to amalgamate [[anthropomorphic robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], [[bioelectronics]],&lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"&gt;Bioelectronics - MOSFETs, Biosensors and Neurons - M.

Neurobioengineering deals with the study and application of bio-compatible neuro-prosthetic implants, neural sensors and interfaces with the nervous system.

The goal of that branch is to develop a bio-artificial brain of cultured neurons capable of replicating human behaviour in an artificial robotic system. The European Union F.E.T. funded the neurobioengineering department to pursue this ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Physics, Journal of Neural Engineering Vol 5, Issue 4. http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1741-2552/2/4/E01/jne5_4_e01.pdf?request-id=6f3a87c4-a31f-486e-b2b0-3756a52e060c&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The neurobioengineering program spawned numerous journal publications by the departmental scientific pioneers (Dr. Marco Bove, Dr. Sergio Martinoia, Dr. Renato Zaccaria, and many others) and a university course textbook [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070031746  Bioelectronics, MOSFETS, Biosensors and Neurons] &lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"/&gt; published by Massimo Grattarola. Members of the department were collaborating with researchers throughout the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and [[North America]]. Students from throughout the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] enrolled in the program.

==Comparable international efforts==
At the time (1995), a small number of universities offered specialized bioelectronics and/or implantable neuro-prostheses-related research (but no specialized undergraduate programs) internationally for example: [[University of Utah]], [[MIT]], [[UCSF]] ([[United States]]); [[McGill University]] ([[Canada]]), among others.

==First European School on Neuroengineering==
In 2003, following professor Grattarola's death, the University of Genova announced Europe's first neurobioengineering conference in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Paper Neuroengineering School http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/2003/0037.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The First European School on Neuroengineering 'Massimo Grattarola' was also founded in 2004, with the goal of establishing a long-term formal educational program to foster future pioneers in neurobioengineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unige.it&lt;/ref&gt;

In a state of transition, the neurobioengineering department renamed itself the neuroengineering and bio-nanotechnology group in 2005. By 2008, the core researchers of the original department had formalized the educational process into a formal long-term program at the University of Genova named School of Neuroengineering, fulfilling Massimo Grattarola's original ambitions, offering degrees in Humanoid Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;# ^ Neuroengineering School http://www.neuro-it.net/pipermail/general/2003-April/000018.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The current and former neurobioengineering (or neuroengineering) students continue his research interests throughout Europe and North America, some of whom have established related businesses, or hold positions of authority in neuroscience/biomedical institutions worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">'''Neville Moray''' (May 27, 1935 &amp;ndash; 15 December 2017) was a British/Canadian academic and Professor at the Department of Psychology of the [[University of Surrey]],&lt;ref name="NM CV 2014"&gt;[http://www.moraysatmagagnosc.com/curriculum-vitae.php Neville Moray Curriculum vitae] at moraysatmagagnosc.com. Accessed March 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; known from his 1959 research of the [[cocktail party effect]].

== Biography ==
Moray started studying medicine at [[Worcester College, Oxford]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="HFES 2014"&gt;[http://www.hfes.org/web/awards&amp;fellows/fellowprofiles/profile_moray.pdf Neville Moray] Fellow Profile at hfes.org. Accessed March 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his BA in Philosophy, Psychology and Physiology  in 1957, his MA in Psychology in 1959, and his D.Phil. in 1960 all from [[Oxford University]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="NM CV 2014"/&gt;

Moray started his academic career as Assistant Lecturer in Psychology at the [[University of Hull]] in 1959. The next year he moved to the [[University of Sheffield]] and became lecturer in Psychology, and senior lecturer in 1966. In 1970 he moved to Canada where he became Associate Professor at the [[University of Toronto]], and Professor of Psychology in 1972. In 1974 he moved back to Scotland to become Professor of Psychology at the [[University of Stirling]] and Chairman of Department of Psychology since 1977. In 1981 back at University of Toronto he was appointed Professor of Industrial Engineering, and member of its Institute of Nuclear Engineering since 1984. In 1988 he moved to the United States to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where until 1995 he had a joint appointment as Professor at the Departments of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering; the Department of Psychology; and the Institute of Aviation. From 1995 to 1997 he was a Professor at the [[University of Valenciennes]] in France, and from 1997 until his retirement in 2001 he was a Professor of Psychology at [[University of Surrey]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="HFES 2014"/&gt;

Moray was elected Fellow of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society in 1991; Fellow of the [[Ergonomics Society]] in 1998; Fellow of the [[Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors]]; and Fellow of the [[International Ergonomics Association]]. The [[International Ergonomics Association]] awarded him the Ergonomics Development Award and the President's Award in 2000. In 2000, Stirling University inaugurated the annual prize for best Combined Honours Student, to be named the  "Neville Moray Prize."&lt;ref name="NM CV 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HFES 2014"/&gt;

He died on 15 December 2017 at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/221014/moray Moray]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Cocktail party phenomenon===
Moray became known for his scientific contributions to the [[cocktail party effect]], which became his major research interest for about two decades.&lt;ref name="HFES 2014"/&gt; This effect concerns the phenomenon of being able to focus one's auditory attention on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli. The effect was first defined and named "the [[cocktail party problem]]" by [[Colin Cherry]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Cherry 1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherry|first1=E. Colin|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America| volume=25| issue=5| year=1953| pages=975–79| issn=0001-4966| doi=10.1121/1.1907229 |url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Cherry53-cpe.pdf|bibcode=1953ASAJ...25..975C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry found that participants were able to detect their name from the unattended channel, the channel they were not shadowing.&lt;ref name="Moray 1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moray|first1=Neville|title=Attention in dichotic listening: Affective cues and the influence of instructions|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology| volume=11| issue=1|year=1959|pages=56–60|issn=0033-555X|doi=10.1080/17470215908416289|url=https://www.msu.edu/~ema/802-readings/Ch3-1a-Moray59.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moray build his research using Cherry's shadowing task. He was able to conclude that almost none of the rejected messages were able to penetrate the block set up, except subjectively "important" messages.&lt;ref name="Moray 1959" /&gt;

Neville Moray used Cherry's shadowed dichotic listening task in his 1959 research and was able to conclude that almost none of the rejected messages were able to penetrate the block set up, except subjectively "important" messages.&lt;ref name="moray"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moray|first=Neville|title=Attention in Dichotic Listening: Affective Cues and the Influence of Instructions|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1959|pages=1156–11560|doi=10.1080/17470215908416289|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal names, taboo language, and backward language are the "subjectively" important messages that have been found to date. Moray's 1959 study found a 33% detection rate for personal names, which revealed that participants sometimes notice their name in an ignored auditory channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Noelle|author2=Cowan, Nelson|title=The Cocktail Party Phenomenon Revisited: How Frequent Are Attention Shifts to One's Name in an Irrelevant Auditory Channel?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1995|volume=21|issue=1|pages=255–260|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.21.1.255|pmid=7876773}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to selectively attend to one's own name has been found in infants as young as five months of age and appears to be fully developed by thirteen months of age.

Rochelle S. Newman in a 2005 study found that five-month-old infants listened longer to their names when the target voice was 10&amp;nbsp;dB, but not 5&amp;nbsp;dB more intense than the background noise.  Nine-month-olds also failed at 5&amp;nbsp;dB, but thirteen-month-olds succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=Rochelle S|title=The Cocktail Party Effect in Infants Revisited: Listening to One's Name in Noise|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2005|volume=41|issue=2|pages=352–362|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.2.352|pmid=15769191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This success in recognizing one's own name in the unattended channel can be explained using Cherry's initial report on dichotic shadowing.  Cherry found that the verbal content of the message in the unattended channel was completely blocked, so that the words were treated as merely sounds.&lt;ref name="cherry"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherry|first=Colin E|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=1953|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|doi=10.1121/1.1907229|bibcode=1953ASAJ...25..975C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the subject to know that something has stimulated the ear whose message is rejected.  It may be thought of as a general warning signal, that a sound has occurred to which the subject might need to respond.&lt;ref name="moray" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31690">In [[computing]], '''Open Database Connectivity''' ('''ODBC''') is a standard [[application programming interface]] (API) for accessing [[database management system]]s (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and [[operating system]]s. An application written using ODBC can be ported to other platforms, both on the client and server side, with few changes to the data access code.

ODBC accomplishes DBMS independence by using an ''ODBC driver'' as a translation layer between the application and the DBMS. The application uses ODBC functions through an ''ODBC driver manager'' with which it is linked, and the driver passes the [[Query language|query]] to the DBMS. An ODBC driver can be thought of as analogous to a printer driver or other driver, providing a standard set of functions for the application to use, and implementing DBMS-specific functionality. An application that can use ODBC is referred to as "ODBC-compliant". Any ODBC-compliant application can access any DBMS for which a driver is installed.  Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like [[address book]] systems and [[Microsoft Excel]], and even for text or [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) files.

ODBC was originally developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[Simba Technologies]] during the early 1990s, and became the basis for the [[Call Level Interface]] (CLI) standardized by [[SQL Access Group]] in the [[Unix]] and [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] field. ODBC retained several features that were removed as part of the CLI effort. Full ODBC was later ported back to those platforms, and became a [[de facto standard]] considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.

==History==

===Before ODBC===
The introduction of the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]-based [[relational database]] during the 1970s led to a proliferation of data access methods. Generally these systems operated together with a simple command processor that allowed users to type in English-like commands, and receive output. The best-known examples are [[SQL]] from [[IBM]] and [[QUEL query languages|QUEL]] from the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] project. These systems may or may not allow other applications to access the data directly, and those that did use a wide variety of methodologies. The introduction of [[SQL]] aimed to solve the problem of ''language'' standardization, although substantial differences in implementation remained.

Also, since the SQL language had only rudimentary programming features, users often wanted to use SQL within a program written in another language, say [[Fortran]] or [[C (programming language)|C]]. This led to the concept of [[Embedded SQL]], which allowed [[PostQUEL|SQL]] code to be ''embedded'' within another language. For instance, a SQL statement like &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM city&lt;/code&gt; could be inserted as text within C source code, and during [[compiler|compiling]] it would be converted into a custom format that directly called a function within a [[Library (computing)|library]] that would pass the statement into the SQL system. Results returned from the statements would be interpreted back into C data formats like &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; using similar library code.

There were several problems with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform – a system that allowed calls into [[IBM]]'s [[IBM DB2|DB2]] would look very different from one that called into their own [[IBM SQL/DS|SQL/DS]].{{Dubious|Before-ODBC section|reason=different, how?|date=February 2013}} Another key problem to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program's source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as ''static SQL'', versus ''dynamic SQL'' which could be changed at any time, like the [[command-line interface]]s that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s.

Older mainframe databases, and the newer [[microcomputer]] based systems that were based on them, generally did not have a SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a [[command line interface]] or interactive forms system in the case of [[dBASE]] and similar applications. Data from dBASE could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. Those programs may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems.

===Early efforts===
By the mid-1980s the rapid improvement in microcomputers, and especially the introduction of the [[graphical user interface]] and data-rich [[application program]]s like [[Lotus 1-2-3]] led to an increasing interest in using personal computers as the client-side platform of choice in [[client-server]] computing. Under this model, large mainframes and [[minicomputer]]s would be used primarily to serve up data over [[local area network]]s to microcomputers that would interpret, display and manipulate that data. For this model to work, a data access standard was a requirement – in the mainframe field it was highly likely that all of the computers in a shop were from one vendor and clients were [[computer terminal]]s talking directly to them, but in the micro field there was no such standardization and any client might access any server using any networking system.

By the late 1980s there were several efforts underway to provide an abstraction layer for this purpose. Some of these were mainframe related, designed to allow programs running on those machines to translate between the variety of SQL's and provide a single common interface which could then be called by other mainframe or microcomputer programs. These solutions included IBM's Distributed Relational Database Architecture ([[DRDA]]) and [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Data Access Language]]. Much more common, however, were systems that ran entirely on microcomputers, including a complete [[protocol stack]] that included any required networking or file translation support.

One of the early examples of such a system was  [[Lotus Development]]'s [[Lotus DataLens|DataLens]], initially known as Blueprint. Blueprint, developed for 1-2-3, supported a variety of data sources, including SQL/DS, DB2, [[FOCUS]] and a variety of similar mainframe systems, as well as microcomputer systems like [[dBase]] and the early Microsoft/Ashton-Tate efforts that would eventually develop into [[Microsoft SQL Server]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan McGlinn, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=6D4EAAAAMBAJ Blueprint Lets 1-2-3 Access Outside Data"], ''InfoWorld'', 4 April 1988, p. 1, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later ODBC, Blueprint was a purely code-based system, lacking anything approximating a command language like SQL. Instead, programmers used [[data structure]]s to store the query information, constructing a query by linking many of these structures together. Lotus referred to these compound structures as ''query trees''.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=65}}

Around the same time, an industry team including members from [[Sybase]] (Tom Haggin), [[Tandem Computers]] (Jim Gray &amp; Rao Yendluri) and Microsoft (Kyle G) were working on a standardized dynamic SQL concept. Much of the system was based on Sybase's DB-Library system, with the Sybase-specific sections removed and several additions to support other platforms.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=86-87}} DB-Library was aided by an industry-wide move from library systems that were tightly linked to a specific language, to library systems that were provided by the [[operating system]] and required the languages on that platform to conform to its standards. This meant that a single library could be used with (potentially) any programming language on a given platform.

The first draft of the ''Microsoft Data Access API'' was published in April 1989, about the same time as Lotus' announcement of Blueprint.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=56}} In spite of Blueprint's great lead – it was running when MSDA was still a paper project – Lotus eventually joined the MSDA efforts as it became clear that SQL would become the de facto database standard.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=65}} After considerable industry input, in the summer of 1989 the standard became ''SQL Connectivity'' (''SQLC'').{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=106}}

===SAG and CLI===
In 1988 several vendors, mostly from the [[Unix]] and database communities, formed the [[SQL Access Group]] (SAG) in an effort to produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, what they called a [[Call Level Interface]] (CLI).{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=165}} While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.

The new SQLC "gang of four", MS, Tandem, DEC and Sybase, brought an updated version of SQLC to the next SAG meeting in June 1990.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=186-187}} The SAG responded by opening the standard effort to any competing design, but of the many proposals, only [[Oracle Corp]] had a system that presented serious competition. In the end, SQLC won the votes and became the draft standard, but only after large portions of the API were removed – the standards document was trimmed from 120 pages to 50 during this time. It was also during this period that the name Call Level Interface was formally adopted.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=186-187}}  In 1995 SQL/CLI became part of the international SQL standard, ISO/IEC 9075-3.&lt;ref name="ISO/IEC 9075-3"&gt;ISO/IEC 9075-3 – Information technology – Database languages – SQL – Part 3: Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI)&lt;/ref&gt; The SAG itself was taken over by the [[X/Open]] group in 1996, and, over time, became part of [[The Open Group]]'s [[Common Application Environment]].

MS continued working with the original SQLC standard, retaining many of the advanced features that were removed from the CLI version. These included features like [[Cursor (databases)#Scrollable cursors|scrollable cursors]], and [[metadata]] information queries. The commands in the API were split into groups; the Core group was identical to the CLI, the Level 1 extensions were commands that would be easy to implement in drivers, while Level 2 commands contained the more advanced features like cursors. A proposed standard was released in December 1991, and industry input was gathered and worked into the system through 1992, resulting in yet another name change to ''ODBC''.{{sfn|Geiger|1995|p=203}}

===JET and ODBC===
During this time, Microsoft was in the midst of developing their [[Microsoft Jet Database Engine|Jet]] database system. Jet combined three primary subsystems; an [[ISAM]]-based database engine (also named ''Jet'', confusingly), a C-based interface allowing applications to access that data, and a selection of driver [[Dynamic-Link Libraries|dynamic-link libraries]] (DLL) that allowed the same C interface to redirect input and output to other ISAM-based databases, like [[Paradox (database)|Paradox]] and [[xBase]]. Jet allowed using one set of calls to access common microcomputer databases in a fashion similar to Blueprint, by then renamed DataLens. However, Jet did not use SQL; like DataLens, the interface was in C and consisted of [[data structure]]s and function calls.

The SAG standardization efforts presented an opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and other databases as well. What was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with [[Simba Technologies|PageAhead Software]] to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA was used as a parser above Jet's C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to other databases, this also allowed SIMBA to query other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables.&lt;ref name=simba&gt;{{cite book | last= Harindranath | first= G | author2= Jože Zupančič | title= New perspectives on information systems development: theory, methods, and practice | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O8Loa-c0TyoC | accessdate= 2010-07-28 | year= 2001 | publisher= Springer | isbn= 978-0-306-47251-0 | page= 451 | quote= The first ODBC drivers […] used the SIMBA query processor, which translated calls into the Microsoft Jet ISAM calls, and dispatched the calls to the appropriate ISAM driver to access the backend […] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and continued development===
ODBC 1.0 was released in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easysoft.com/developer/interfaces/odbc/linux.html#what_is_odbc |title=Linux/UNIX ODBC – What is ODBC?}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, there was little direct support for SQL databases (versus ISAM), and early drivers were noted for poor performance. Some of this was unavoidable due to the path that the calls took through the Jet-based stack; ODBC calls to SQL databases were first converted from [[Simba Technologies]]'s SQL dialect to Jet's internal C-based format, then passed to a driver for conversion back into SQL calls for the database. [[Digital Equipment]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] both contracted [[Simba Technologies]] to develop drivers for their databases as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simba.com/simba-history.htm "Our History"], Simba Technologies&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 1993, [[OpenLink Software]] shipped one of the first independently developed third-party ODBC drivers, for the [[Progress DBMS|PROGRESS DBMS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Idehen|first=Kingsley|title=ODBC and progress V7.2d|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.databases/ZDdiftnvkj4/AK0K2M0a0WoJ|work=Usenet Newsgroup comp.databases|accessdate=13 December 2013|authorlink=Kingsley Uyi Idehen |date=October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon followed with their UDBC (a cross-platform API equivalent of ODBC and the SAG/CLI) SDK and associated drivers for [[Progress Software|PROGRESS]], Sybase, Oracle, and other DBMS, for use on Unix-like OS ([[AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Linux]], etc.), [[OpenVMS|VMS]], [[Windows NT]], [[OS/2]], and other OS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Idehen|first=Kingsley|title=Need ODBC/Ingres driver for DEC OSF/1|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.databases.oracle/HSHhNjjBgf4/47PGF35h93AJ|work=Usenet Newsgroup comp.databases.oracle|accessdate=13 December 2013|authorlink=Kingsley Uyi Idehen|date=1995-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the CLI standard effort dragged on, and it was not until March 1995 that the definitive version was finalized. By then, Microsoft had already granted [[Visigenic Software]] a [[source code]] license to develop ODBC on non-Windows platforms. Visigenic ported ODBC to a wide variety of Unix platforms, where ODBC quickly became the de facto standard.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sippl, [http://www.drdobbs.com/sql-access-groups-call-level-interface/184410032 "SQL Access Group's Call-Level Interface"], Dr. Dobbs, 1 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; "Real" CLI is rare today. The two systems remain similar, and many applications can be ported from ODBC to CLI with few or no changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iisclzos/v9r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.fed.classic.clientsref.doc/topics/iiyfcodbcclisimdiff.html "Similarities and differences between ODBC and CLI"], InfoSphere Classic documentation, IBM, 26 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, database vendors took over the driver interfaces and provided direct links to their products. Skipping the intermediate conversions to and from Jet or similar wrappers often resulted in higher performance. However, by then Microsoft had changed focus to their [[OLE DB]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal2020.com/2011/09/25/ole-db-and-sql-server-history-end-game-and-some-microsoft-dirt/]&lt;/ref&gt; concept (recently reinstated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2017/10/06/announcing-the-new-release-of-ole-db-driver-for-sql-server/ |title=Announcing the new release of OLE DB Driver for SQL Server}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which provided direct access to a wider variety of data sources from [[address book]]s to text files. Several new systems followed which further turned their attention from ODBC, including [[ActiveX Data Objects]] (ADO) and [[ADO.net]], which interacted more or less with ODBC over their lifetimes.

As Microsoft turned its attention away from working directly on ODBC, the Unix field was increasingly embracing it. This was propelled by two changes within the market, the introduction of [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) like [[GNOME]] that provided a need to access these sources in non-text form, and the emergence of [[open software]] database systems like [[PostgreSQL]] and [[MySQL]], initially under Unix. The later adoption of ODBC by Apple for using the standard Unix-side [[iODBC]] package [[Mac OS X 10.2]] (Jaguar)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Andrew|title=Open Database Connectivity in Jaguar|url=http://oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/2003/06/20/odbc.html|work=O'Reilly MacDevCenter.com|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=2003-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which [[OpenLink Software]] had been independently providing for Mac OS X 10.0 and even Mac OS 9 since 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sellers|first=Dennis|title=ODBC SDK update out for Mac OS Classic, Mac OS X|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1018465/odbc.html|work=MacWorld|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=2001-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) further cemented ODBC as the standard for cross-platform data access.

[[Sun Microsystems]] used the ODBC system as the basis for their own open standard, [[Java Database Connectivity]] (JDBC). In most ways, JDBC can be considered a version of ODBC for the programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]] instead of [[C (programming language)|C]]. JDBC-to-ODBC ''bridges'' allow Java-based programs to access data sources through ODBC drivers on platforms lacking a native JDBC driver, although these are now relatively rare. Inversely, ODBC-to-JDBC bridges allow C-based programs to access data sources through JDBC drivers on platforms or from databases lacking suitable ODBC drivers.

===ODBC today===
ODBC remains in wide use today, with drivers available for most platforms and most databases. It is not uncommon to find ODBC drivers for database engines that are meant to be embedded, like [[SQLite]], as a way to allow existing tools to act as front-ends to these engines for testing and debugging.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Werner, [http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/ "SQLite ODBC Driver"]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the rise of [[thin client]] computing using [[HTML]] as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases – MySQL being very common. In these scenarios, there is no direct client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active as it once was.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Drivers and Managers==

===Drivers===
ODBC is based on the [[device driver]] model, where the driver encapsulates the logic needed to convert a standard set of commands and functions into the specific calls required by the underlying system. For instance, a [[printer driver]] presents a standard set of printing commands, the API, to applications using the printing system. Calls made to those APIs are converted by the driver into the format used by the actual hardware, say [[PostScript]] or [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

In the case of ODBC, the drivers encapsulate many functions that can be broken down into several broad categories. One set of functions is primarily concerned with finding, connecting to and disconnecting from the DBMS that driver talks to. A second set is used to send SQL commands from the ODBC system to the DBMS, converting or interpreting any commands that are not supported internally. For instance, a DBMS that does not support [[Cursor (databases)|cursors]] can emulate this functionality in the driver. Finally, another set of commands, mostly used internally, is used to convert data from the DBMS's internal formats to a set of standardized ODBC formats, which are based on the C language formats.

An ODBC driver enables an ODBC-compliant application to use a ''data source'', normally a DBMS. Some non-DBMS drivers exist, for such data sources as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files, by implementing a small DBMS inside the driver itself. ODBC drivers exist for most DBMSs, including  [[Oracle database|Oracle]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]] (but not for the [[SQL Server Compact|Compact aka CE edition]]), [[Adaptive Server Enterprise|Sybase ASE]], [[SAP HANA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db-engines.com/en/system/SAP+HANA|title=SAP HANA System Properties|website=[[DB-Engines]]|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/66/a4169b84b2466892e1af9781049836/content.htm|title=Connect to SAP HANA via ODBC - SAP HANA Developer Guide for SAP HANA Studio - SAP Library|website=help.sap.com|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IBM DB2|DB2]]. Because different technologies have different capabilities, most ODBC drivers do not implement all functionality defined in the ODBC standard.  Some drivers offer extra functionality not defined by the standard.

===Driver Manager===
Device drivers are normally enumerated, set up and managed by a separate Manager layer, which may provide additional functionality. For instance, printing systems often include functionality to provide [[spooling]] functionality on top of the drivers, providing print spooling for any supported printer.

In ODBC the Driver Manager (DM) provides these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sybase|title=Introduction to ODBC|url=http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.help.sdk_12.5.1.aseodbc/html/aseodbc/aseodbc5.htm|work=infocenter.sybase.com |publisher=Sybase|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DM can enumerate the installed drivers and present this as a list, often in a GUI-based form.

But more important to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a ''Data Source Name'' (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a ''specific'' data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same [[MySQL]] driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.

The DM also includes the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. All of this is included in the driver and the DSNs.

==Bridging configurations==
A ''bridge'' is a special kind of driver: a driver that uses another driver-based technology.

===ODBC-to-JDBC (ODBC-JDBC) bridges===
An ODBC-JDBC bridge consists of an ''ODBC'' driver which uses the services of a [[JDBC type 1 driver|JDBC driver]] to connect to a database. This driver translates ODBC function-calls into JDBC method-calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when they lack an ODBC driver for some database but have access to a JDBC driver. Examples: [https://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc-jdbc-st/ OpenLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge], [https://www.progress.com/odbc/sequelink SequeLink ODBC-JDBC Bridge].

===JDBC-to-ODBC (JDBC-ODBC) bridges===
A JDBC-ODBC bridge consists of a [[JDBC driver]] which employs an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This driver translates JDBC [[Method (computer science)|method]] calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks a JDBC driver, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. [[Sun Microsystems]] included one such bridge in the [[JVM]], but viewed it as a stop-gap measure while few JDBC drivers existed. (The built-in JDBC-ODBC bridge was dropped from the JVM in Java 8.) Sun never intended its bridge for production environments, and generally recommended against its use. {{As of|2008}} independent data-access vendors deliver JDBC-ODBC bridges which support current standards for both mechanisms, and which far outperform the JVM built-in.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Examples: [https://uda.openlinksw.com/jdbc-odbc-st/ OpenLink JDBC-ODBC Bridge], [https://www.progress.com/jdbc/sequelink SequeLink JDBC-ODBC Bridge].

===OLE DB-to-ODBC bridges===
An OLE DB-ODBC bridge consists of an [[OLE DB]] Provider which uses the services of an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This provider translates OLE DB [[Method (computer science)|method]] calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an OLE DB provider, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Microsoft ships one, MSDASQL.DLL, as part of the [[MDAC]] [[system component bundle]], together with other database drivers, to simplify development in COM-aware languages (e.g. [[Visual Basic]]). Third parties have also developed such, notably [[OpenLink Software]] whose 64-bit OLE DB Provider for ODBC Data Sources filled the gap when Microsoft initially deprecated this bridge for their 64-bit OS.&lt;ref name="msdasql"&gt;''Microsoft'', "Data Access Technologies Road Map", Deprecated MDAC Components, ''Microsoft'' [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/ado270/htm/mdrefodbcprovspec.asp "ADO Programmer's Guide" Appendix A: Providers, Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC], retrieved July 30, 2005.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005101137/http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=%2Flibrary%2Fen-us%2Fado270%2Fhtm%2Fmdrefodbcprovspec.asp |date=October 5, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Microsoft later relented, and 64-bit Windows starting with [[Windows Server 2008]] and [[Windows Vista SP1]] have shipped with a 64-bit version of MSDASQL.) Examples: [https://uda.openlinksw.com/oledb-odbc-st/ OpenLink OLEDB-ODBC Bridge], [https://www.progress.com/oledb/sequelink SequeLink OLEDB-ODBC Bridge].

===ADO.NET-to-ODBC bridges===
An ADO.NET-ODBC bridge consists of an [[ADO.NET data provider|ADO.NET Provider]] which uses the services of an ODBC driver to connect to a target database. This provider translates ADO.NET [[Method (computer science)|method]] calls into ODBC function calls. Programmers usually use such a bridge when a given database lacks an ADO.NET provider, but is accessible through an ODBC driver. Microsoft ships one as part of the [[MDAC]] [[system component bundle]], together with other database drivers, to simplify development in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Third parties have also developed such. Examples: [https://uda.openlinksw.com/dotnet-odbc-st/ OpenLink ADO.NET-ODBC Bridge], [https://www.progress.com/net/sequelink SequeLink ADO.NET-ODBC Bridge].

It had a pioneering role in the development of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], providing the first [[superconducting magnet]]s for this application. The first commercial MRI [[Whole body imaging|whole body scanner]] was manufactured at its [[Osney Mead]] factory in Oxford in 1980 for installation at [[Hammersmith Hospital]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MRI Scanner (1980)|url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/mri.html|work=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme|publisher=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further innovations included the development of active shielding, whereby fringe fields hazardous to pacemaker wearers, causing difficulty and expense in siting, were virtually eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?Index=239|title=Superconducting magnets: The heart of NMR|publisher=Ingenia|date=February 2004|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford Instruments was not able to capitalise on these inventions itself, granting royalty-free license to [[Philips]] and [[General Electric]] whilst developing a joint venture with [[Siemens]] in 1989: this was dissolved in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=111668|title=Siemens Acquires Oxford Instruments' Stake in Oxford Magnet Technology|agency=PR Newswire|year=2004|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ParAccel, Inc.''' was a [[California]]-based software company. 
It provided a [[database management system]] designed for advanced [[analytics]] for [[business intelligence]]. ParAccel was acquired by [[Actian]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Actian"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Actian Picks Up ParAccel to Boost Analytics Portfolio |work= Silicon Angle |date= April 29, 2013 |author= Maria Duetscher |url= http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/04/29/actian-picks-up-paraccel-to-boost-analytics-portfolio/ |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ParAccel was a venture-backed company focused on developing software for data analysis.
It acquired some [[intellectual property]] from the company XPrime, which ended operations in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Warehouse appliances: boom or bust? |work= The Register |date= December 13, 2005 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/13/warehouse_appliances/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParACCEL up and running: The new boy on the data warehouse appliance block  |work= The Register |date= March 30, 2006 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/30/paraccel_enters_datawarehouse_market/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was officially incorporated in February 2006, founded by Barry Zane who became chief technology officer, and was first funded by [[angel investor]]s.
In August 2006 the first series of [[venture capital]] came from  [[Mohr Davidow Ventures]], Bay Partners and Tao Venture Partners.
In 2007 the company was based in [[San Diego, California]], with an office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. David J. Ehrlich was chief executive, and Bruce Scott, vice president of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Company: Accelerating Business Intelligence |work= Old ParAccel web page |url= http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070820103518/http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |archivedate= August 20, 2007 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, a second round of $20 million included previous investors and was led by Walden Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Notice of Sale of Securities [Regulation D and Section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933], item 06 |publisher= US Securities and Exchange Commission |date= November 28, 2007 |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/07/9999999997-07-050041 |format= PDF |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December the company opened an office in [[Cupertino, California]] (part of [[Silicon Valley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParAccel Secures $20 Million in Venture Financing and Opens Cupertino Office |date= December 10, 2007 |work= Press release |url= http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045326/http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |archivedate= May 17, 2008 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast Maverick was designed as a stand-alone data store.&lt;ref name="part2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Corporate Brief |work= HP partner web site |date= March 4, 2009 |url= http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/download/partner/Corporate%20Brief%20on%20ParAccel%20Data%20Warehousing%20v6_1236198035276.pdf |accessdate= January 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
ParAccel discontinued Amigo in favor of the stand-alone offering which evolved into the ParAccel Analytic Database (PADB).{{When |date= January 2014}}

The ParAccel Analytic Database was a parallel relational database system using a [[shared-nothing architecture]] with a columnar orientation, [[adaptive compression]], memory-centric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Partial join order optimization in the paraccel analytic database |work= Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data |pages= 905–908 |authors= Yijou Chen,  Richard L.

ParAccel's DBMS engine is built for analytics, initially based on [[PostgreSQL]].  ParAccel began phasing in a new optimizer (Omne) in release 2.0 and made significant changes to Omne in subsequent releases (3.1 released in June 2011).
ParAccel implements compiled queries, and a proprietary interconnect protocol for inter-node communications. It integrated with [[storage area network]] technologies such as those from [[EMC Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Update |author= Thomas C.

ParAccel offered on-demand integration (ODI) modules for analytics and data outside of the ParAccel Analytic Platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7830">In [[mesoscopic physics]], a '''quantum wire''' is an [[electrical conductor|electrically conducting]] [[wire]] in which [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects influence the transport properties. Usually such effects appear in the dimension of nanometers, so they are also referred to as [[nanowires]].

== Quantum effects ==
If the diameter of a wire is sufficiently small, [[electrons]] will experience [[quantum confinement]] in the transverse direction. As a result, their transverse energy will be limited to a series of discrete values. One consequence of this [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] is that the classical formula for calculating the [[electrical resistance]] of a wire,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R=\rho{l \over A}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;
is not valid for quantum wires (where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the material's [[resistivity]], &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the wire).

Instead, an exact calculation of the transverse energies of the confined electrons has to be performed to calculate a wire's resistance. Following from the quantization of electron energy, the [[electrical conductance]] (the inverse of the resistance) is found to be quantized in multiples of &lt;math&gt;2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]]. The factor of two arises from [[spin (physics)|spin]] degeneracy. A single [[ballistic transport|ballistic]] quantum channel (i.e. with no internal scattering) has a conductance equal to this [[quantum of conductance]]. The conductance is lower than this value in the presence of internal scattering.&lt;ref&gt;S. Datta, ''Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-59943-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the quantization is inversely proportional to the diameter of the [[nanowire]] for a given material. From material to material, it is dependent on the electronic properties, especially on the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of the electrons. Physically, this means that it will depend on how conduction electrons interact with the atoms within a given material. In practice, [[semiconductor]]s can show clear conductance quantization for large wire transverse dimensions (~100&amp;nbsp;nm) because the electronic modes due to confinement are spatially extended. As a result, their Fermi wavelengths are large and thus they have low energy separations. This means that they can only be resolved at [[cryogenic]] temperatures (within a few degrees of [[absolute zero]]) where the thermal energy is lower than the inter-mode energy separation.

For metals, [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] corresponding to the lowest [[energy state]]s is only observed for atomic wires. Their corresponding wavelength being thus extremely small they have a very large energy separation which makes resistance quantization observable even at room temperature.

[[File:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using [[tight binding]] approximation for (6,0) CNT ([[zigzag]], [[metal]]lic), (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT ([[armchair nanotube|armchair]], metallic).]]

==Carbon nanotubes==

The [[carbon nanotube]] is an example of a quantum wire. A metallic single-walled carbon nanotube that is sufficiently short to exhibit no internal scattering ([[ballistic transport]]) has a conductance that approaches two times the [[conductance quantum]], &lt;math&gt;4e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;. The factor of two arises because carbon nanotubes have two spatial channels.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Dresselhaus, G. Dresselhaus, and Phaedon Avouris, ''Carbon nanotubes: synthesis, structure, properties, and applications'', Springer, 2001, {{ISBN|3-540-41086-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (''n'',''m'') nanotube, if ''n'' = ''m'', the nanotube is metallic; if ''n'' − ''m'' is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate [[semiconductor]]. Thus all armchair (''n'' = ''m'') nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.&lt;ref name="Curvature"&gt;{{cite journal|first=X.|last=Lu|first2=Z.|title=Curved Pi-Conjugation, Aromaticity, and the Related Chemistry of Small Fullerenes (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) and Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=105|pages=3643–3696|year=2005|doi=10.1021/cr030093d|issue=10|last2=Chen|pmid=16218563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Electronic devices===
[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|400px|Atomistic simulation result for formation of inversion channel (electron density) and attainment of threshold voltage (IV) in a nanowire MOSFET. Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45V.]]
Nanowires can be used for transistors. [[Transistors]] are used widely as fundamental building element in today's electronic circuits. One of the key challenges of building future transistors is ensuring good gate control over the channel. Due to the high aspect ratio, if the gate dielectric is wrapped around the nanowire channel, we can get good electrostatic control of channel potential, thereby turning the transistor on and off efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Toward nanowire electronics|journal= IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|volume= 55|issue= 11|pages= 2827|url= https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&amp;context=nanodocs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Dzh-CN%26q%3Dnanowire%2Belectronics%26btnG%3D%26lr%3D#search=%22nanowire%20electronics%22|doi=10.1109/TED.2008.2008011|year= 2008|last1= Appenzeller|first1= Joerg|last2= Knoch|first2= Joachim|last3= Bjork|first3= Mikael T.|last4= Riel|first4= Heike|author4-link=Heike Riel|last5= Schmid|first5= Heinz|last6= Riess|first6= Walter|bibcode= 2008ITED...55.2827A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensing using semiconductor nanowires===
In an analogous way to [[field-effect transistor]] (FET) devices in which the modulation of conductance (flow of [[electrons]]/[[Electron hole|hole]]s) in the device, is controlled by [[electrostatic potential]] variation (gate-electrode) of the [[charge density]] in the conduction channel, the methodology of a Bio/Chem-FET is based on the detection of the local change in charge density, or so-called “field effect”, that characterizes the recognition event between a target molecule and the surface receptor.

This change in the surface potential influences the Chem-FET device exactly as a ‘gate’ voltage does, leading to a detectable and measurable change in the device conduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=Yoni |author2=Elnathan, R. |author3=Pevzner, A. |author4=Davidi G. |author5=Flaxer E. |author6=Patolsky F. |title=Supersensitive Detection of Explosives by Silicon Nanowire Arrays|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=2010|volume=49|issue=38|pages=6830–6835|doi=10.1002/anie.201000847 |pmid=20715224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6084">[[File:Radiator Reflector installation process composite.jpeg|thumb|Radiator reflector panels being installed behind a domestic radiator]]
A '''radiator reflector''' is a thin sheet or foil applied to the wall behind, and closely spaced from, a domestic heating [[radiator (heating)|radiator]]. The intention is to reduce heat losses into the wall by reflecting radiant heat away from the wall.  It is a form of [[radiant barrier]]{{cn|date=February 2018}} and is intended to reduce energy losses and hence decrease fuel expenditure. 


== Effectiveness ==
Studies based both on modelling and experiments have demonstrated modest improvements in energy losses through the walls of houses through this method. Harris &lt;ref 
name="Harris1995"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Use of metallic foils as radiation barriers to reduce heat losses from buildings | journal=Applied Energy | volume=52 | issue=4 | date=1995-01-01 | issn=0306-2619 | doi=10.1016/0306-2619(95)00018-6 | pages=331–339 | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306261995000186 | access-date=2018-03-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; shows that plain aluminium foil was only "marginally" less effective than a propriety shaped foil that claimed to avoid temperature stratification. He reports that "reductions in the overall energy consumption of the [test] room of up to 6% were recorded by installing [pain] foil behind a radiator, while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30% of the original value".  In his 3m cubed test room with a 1 x 0.5 m radiator and walls of average U value 0.44 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K, he found that for a radiator temperature of 43 °C the heat flux through the wall behind the radiator reduced from 7.1 to 3.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that the average heat loss in the room was not reduced by such a large percentage as only part of the surface of the room was covered by radiators. He concludes that "in the test room used, which is the size of a small bedroom or sitting room, the total energy saved in a typical year in the UK’s climate would be of the order of 60 kWh".

Baldinelli et al. &lt;ref name="Baldinelli2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Reflecting panels for radiators in residential buildings: Theoretical analysis of energy performance | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-02-27 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5167195/ | access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; support these findings and note that their "results show how the performance of the reflecting panel depends strictly on the insulation level of the external wall facing the radiator; more specifically, efficiency increases when the thermal resistance decreases, reaching energy savings of up to 8.8% in worst insulation conditions."

Although the foils are termed "reflectors", they do not have much effect on [[thermal radiation|radiated heat]] or its reflection. As radiators work at a relatively low temperature, the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]&lt;ref group="note" &gt;The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] states that the effectiveness of a thermal radiator is proportional to the fourth power of its [[absolute temperature]]. A hot-water radiator at {{convert|77|C|K}} has only 1/4 the radiated power of a stove at {{convert|220|C|K}}, or 1/16 that of a radiant element at {{convert|427|C|K}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that they are weak radiators of heat. Most heat from a domestic radiator is as [[convection]] currents of heated air. Where a reflector foil also has some insulating ability against [[thermal conduction|conduction]] (i.e. losses through the wall), it may have some useful effect. This is most pronounced when the wall itself has poor insulation performance: in a wall constructed to modern standards of insulation, even this effect may be reduced to a negligible benefit.{{source?|date=November 2014}}

The effect of placing a 10mm combined insulation and reflection behind radiators is about the same as that of 15mm insulation without a reflective layer. When the wall thickness behind the radiator is at minimum 1980 German standards this will reduce total heat losses of a building by about 4%. For a (by 1980s standards) well-insulated building heat losses can be reduced by about 1.6%.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;N. König: "Der Einfluß von wäremreflektierenden Folien in Heizkörpernischen auf den Heizenergieverbrauch eines Hauses" https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ibp/de/documents/Publikationen/IBP-Mitteilungen-optimiert/058.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely believed that a literal radiator reflector of ordinary aluminium [[Tin foil|kitchen foil]] is useful. This highly reflective foil is used with the shiny side facing towards the back of the radiator. However, as little of the radiator's heat is released by radiation anyway, there is little advantage in reducing losses to it.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} There is also a risk that [[wikt:reflector|reflector]]s made from kitchen foil may soon become inefficient, as [[aluminium]] [[oxidation|oxidizes]] very quickly and then loses its reflective quality.

A more effective [[DIY]] radiator reflector is a thin insulating layer (against conduction) of a lightweight insulator such as [[expanded polystyrene]] foam veneer&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Widely sold in 2mm sheet rolls as an insulator beneath [[wallpaper]].&lt;/ref&gt; or 3mm [[polyethylene]] foam, as used for [[laminate flooring]] underlay.

== Commercially available products ==

There are only two radiator reflectors approved for use in the UK Government's [[Carbon Emission Reduction Target]] (CERT) Scheme administered by [[Ofgem]] (the UK Regulator of energy companies) – Radflek&lt;ref name="radflek" &gt;{{cite web

The '''radio spectrum scope''' (also radio '''panoramic receiver''', '''panoramic adapter''', '''pan receiver''', '''pan adapter''', '''panadapter''', '''panoramic radio spectroscope''', '''panoramoscope''', '''panalyzor''' and '''band scope''') was invented by [[Marcel Wallace]] and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more [[radio band]]s - e.g. [[shortwave bands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2279151 Panoramic radio receiving system US 2279151 A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~cbmcg/Panadaptors.html Chuck N7RHU: Panadapters] Quote: "...The panoramic spectrum display, invented by Marcel Wallace in the 1930s, provides a radio operator with a graphic display of radio signal amplitudes at frequencies close to the  signal to which his radio is currently tuned..."&lt;/ref&gt; A spectrum scope is normally a lot cheaper than a [[spectrum analyzer]], because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.

The spectrum scope use can be to:
* find radio channels quickly of known and unknown signals when receiving.
* find radio amateurs activity quickly e.g. with the intent of communicating with them.

[[File:Chapaticooking.jpg|thumb|[[atta flour|Atta]] dough being rolled with a rolling pin during the preparation of [[chapati]]]]
A '''rolling pin''' is a cylindrical [[List of food preparation utensils|food preparation utensil]] used to shape and flatten [[dough]]. Two styles of rolling pin are found: rollers and rods. Roller types consists of a thick cylinder with small handles at each end; rod type rolling pins are usually thin tapered batons. Rolling pins of different styles and materials offer advantages over another, as they are used for different tasks in cooking and baking.

==Types of rolling pins==
[[File:Rollingpin (Japanese).jpg|thumb|A tapered (top) and straight (bottom) "rod" type rolling pins]]
*'''Rod''': Thin rods typically made of wood around 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. They are used by rolling the rod across the dough using one's palm. The pins may be tapered at one or both ends for more pivot control in certain tasks such as making small [[jiaozi]] skins or [[pie]] shells. Most [[East Asian]] or [[France|French]] style rolling pins, and the [[Turkey|Turkish]] ''Oklava'' are rod-style.
*'''Roller''': Consists of a thick heavy roller made of a variety of materials around 7–10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter with thinner handles which extend through the roller. They are used by grasping the handles and pushing the pin across the dough. Many [[Western culture|Western]] rolling pins are roller types.
*'''Textured''': Some specialized rolling pins have textured surfaces that mark and indents the dough surfaces for special breads and pancakes.  They may even be embossed with writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Anna|title=Personalize Your Pastries With Embossed Rolling Pins|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/85997/personalize-your-pastries-embossed-rolling-pins|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chappati-0013.jpg|thumb|A wooden ''belan'' rolling pin is used on a round ''chakla'' to make [[chapati]]s]]
* '''Chakla Belan''': In [[Indian cuisine]], the rolling pin (''belan'') is used in combination with a ''chakla'' (flat circular rolling board). The dough for [[chapati]]s is rolled on the ''chakla'' with the help of the ''belan''.&lt;ref name=chakla1&gt;Nandita Godbole, 2016, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=YfNhDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=chakla+roti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4kemi26rZAhXDvI8KHVeJC-kQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chakla%20roti&amp;f=false Roti: Easy Indian Breads &amp; Sides].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chakla2&gt;Chitra Agrawal, 2017, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=M1ZcDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=chakla+roti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4kemi26rZAhXDvI8KHVeJC-kQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=chakla%20roti&amp;f=false Vibrant India: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes from Bangalore to Brooklyn], page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Devices like [[Rotimatic]] and Rotillicious combine the functions of ''chakla'', ''belan'' and round electric cooking griddle also known as ''[[tava]]''.

==Material==
Rolling pins come in a variety of sizes, shapes and materials including [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[Acrylic polymer|acrylic]], [[bakelite]], [[copper]], [[brass]], [[aluminium]], [[silicone]], [[wood]], [[stainless steel]], [[marble]], and [[plastic]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Pins by Reginald King.2010''&lt;/ref&gt; Some are hollow and are able to be filled with cold or warm water to better roll a desired food. Marble rolling pins are often cooled in a [[Domestic refrigerator|refrigerator]] for maintaining a cold dough while making [[puff pastry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Heloise (columnist)|Heloise]]'s ''Kitchen Hints by Heloise'', Prentice-Hall, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scarabeo 9'' has a length of {{convert|115|m}} and a breadth of {{convert|78|m}}. Its gross tonnage is 36,863, dead weight tonnage 23,965, and net tonnage 11,059 tonnes.&lt;ref name=dnv/&gt;  The vessel is powered by eight [[Wärtsilä]] 12V32 diesel engines.&lt;ref name=dnv/&gt;  It is equipped with two cranes.&lt;ref name=saipem/&gt;

The rig includes quarters for up to 200 workers. There is also a helicopter deck suitable for MI8, S61, and EH101 helicopters.&lt;ref name=saipem/&gt;  The rig has been described by the industry sources as "the latest technology for deepwater drilling operations."&lt;ref name=cda/&gt;

==Construction and delivery==
[[File:TAISUN with SCARABEO 9.JPG|thumb|left|[[Taisun]] crane at the [[Yantai Raffles Shipyard]] holds the 17,100&amp;nbsp;metric ton deck box of ''Scarabeo 9'' in the air as the barge is moved out from underneath.]]
''Scarabeo 9'' was ordered by Frigstad Offshore, a [[Singapore]] based offshore drilling rigs management service company.  For this purpose, a special project company Frigstad Discoverer was established in 2006.  The original name of the vessel was decided to be ''Frigstad Oslo''. In 2007, the project company was acquired by Italian engineering and offshore services provider company Saipem and it was decided to rename the rig ''Scarabeo 9''.&lt;ref name=frigstad/&gt;

The rig cost US$750&amp;nbsp;million to build.&lt;ref name=bbc151111&gt;

==Compliance with the embargo against Cuba==
The rig was specifically built for drilling in the waters of [[Cuba]]. It is compliant with the [[United States embargo against Cuba]], which limits the amount of American technology that can be used in equipment used there, as less than 10% of its parts are American-made.&lt;ref name=reuters180511&gt;

'''Seine '''({{IPAc-en|s|eɪ|n}} {{respell|SAYN|'}})''' fishing''' (or seine-haul fishing) is a method of [[fishing]] that employs a [[fishing net]] called a seine, that hangs vertically in the water with its bottom edge held down by weights and its top edge buoyed by floats. Seine nets can be deployed from the shore as a beach seine, or from a boat.

Boats deploying seine nets are known as [[Fishing vessel#Seiners|seiners]]. Two main types of seine net are deployed from seiners: ''purse seines'' and ''Danish seines''.

==Etymology==
The word ''seine'' has origins in the Old French ''seigne'', the Latin ''sagena'', and the Greek σαγήνη ''sagēnē'' (a draw-net).&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (1926) 13th edition, volume 23, page 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seines have been used widely in the past, including by [[stone age]] societies. For example, the [[Māori people|Māori]] used large canoes to deploy seine nets which could be over a kilometer long. The nets were woven from green flax, with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Paul [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-hi-ika-maori-fishing/2 "Te hī ika – Māori fishing"] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Updated 2 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fishermen horse seining for salmon on the Columbia River, nd (COBB 99).jpeg|thumb|Haul seining with horses on the [[Columbia River]], undated photo by [[John Nathan Cobb]]]]
Native Americans on the [[Columbia River]] wove seine nets from spruce root fibers or wild grass, again using stones as weights. For floats they used sticks made of cedar which moved in a way which frightened the fish and helped keep them together.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Courtland L [http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/seine_fishing/ Seine fishing] ''Oregon Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 23 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seine nets are also well documented in [[History of the Mediterranean region|ancient cultures in the Mediterranean region]]. They appear in [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian tomb paintings]] from 3000 BC. In ancient Roman literature, the poet [[Ovid]] makes many references to seine nets, including the use of cork [[Fishing net#Floats|floats]] and lead weights.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe W (1926) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/118679# ''Fishing from the Earliest Times''] John Murray, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson1999&gt;Johnson WM and Lavigne DM (1999) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120124152238/http://www.monachus-guardian.org/library/mededelingen35_2008a.pdf ''Monk Seals in Antiquity''] Fisheries, pp. 48–54. Netherlands Commission for International Nature Protection.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilroy, Clinton G (1845) [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/clinton-g-gilroy/the-history-of-silk-cotton-linen-wool-and-other-fibrous-substances-includin-rli/page-44-the-history-of-silk-cotton-linen-wool-and-other-fibrous-substances-includin-rli.shtml "The history of silk, cotton, linen, wool, and other fibrous substances: including observations on spinning, dyeing and weaving"] pp. 455–464.

==Purse seine==

A common type of seine is a purse seine, named such because along the bottom are a number of rings. A line (referred to as a purse-line) passes through all the rings, and when pulled, draws the rings close to one another, preventing the fish from "sounding", or swimming down to escape the net. This operation is similar to a traditional style purse, which has a drawstring.
The purse seine is a preferred technique for capturing fish species which [[Shoaling and schooling|school]], or aggregate, close to the surface: [[sardine]]s, [[mackerel]], [[anchovies]], [[herring]], and certain species of [[tuna]] (schooling); and [[salmon]] soon before they swim up rivers and streams to spawn (aggregation). Boats equipped with purse seines are called [[Factory ship#Purse seiner|purse seiners]].

[[File:Purse seining boat, location unknown, nd (COBB 314).jpeg|thumb|Purse seiner on the U.S. Pacific Coast, photo by [[John Nathan Cobb]]]]
Purse seine fishing can be a relatively [[Sustainable fishery|sustainable]] [?] way of fishing, as it can result in smaller amounts of by-catch (unintentionally caught fish), especially when used to catch large species of fish (like herring or mackerel) that [[Shoaling and schooling|shoal]] tightly together.&lt;ref name = "gp"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/purse-seining-when-fishing-methods-go-bad-20100518 Purse-seining: when fishing methods go bad], Greenpeace, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; When used to catch fish that shoal together with other species, or when used in parallel with [[fish aggregating device]]s, the percentage of by-catch greatly increases.&lt;ref name = "gp" /&gt;

Use of purse seines is regulated by many countries. In Sri Lanka, using this type of net within 7 kilometers of the shore is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lanka fisheries authorities and navy to act against local fishermen using illegal fishing methods|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_13B/Oct21_1382334068JV.php|newspaper=Colombopage|date=21 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they can be used in the deep sea, after obtaining permission from authorities. Purse seine fishing can have negative impacts on fish stocks because it can involve the bycatch of non-target species and it can put too much pressure on fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/purse-seining-when-fishing-methods-go-bad-20100518|title=Overfishing - emptying our seas - Greenpeace UK|author=|date=|website=greenpeace.org.uk|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The power block is a mechanized pulley used on some seiners to haul in the nets. According to the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], no single invention has contributed more to the success of purse seine net hauling than the power block.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[[FAO]] [http://www.fao.org/fi/website/FIRetrieveAction.do?dom=equipment&amp;xml=powerblock.xml Fishing Equipment: Power block]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Puretic power block]] line was introduced in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining. The combination of these blocks with advances in fluid hydraulics and the new large synthetic nets changed the character of purse seine fishing. The original Puretic power block was driven by an endless rope from the warping head of a winch. Nowadays, power blocks are usually driven by hydraulic pumps powered by the main or auxiliary engine. Their rpm, pull and direction can be controlled remotely.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

A minimum of three people are required for power block seining; the skipper, skiff operator, and corkline stacker. In many operations a fourth person stacks the leadline, and often a fifth person stacks the web.

===Drum===
[[File:Drum net seiner.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Drum net seiner in [[Johnstone Strait]], British Columbia&lt;/center&gt;]]

In certain parts of the western United States as well as Canada, specifically on the coast of British Columbia, drum seining is a method of seine fishing which was adopted in the late 1950s and is now used exclusively in that region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.seattlepressonline.com/article-1093.html A Paean to Purse Seiners and Seafood Fest] ''Seattle Press Online'', 15 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drum seine uses a horizontally mounted drum to haul and store the net instead of a power block.  The net is pulled in over a roller, which spans the stern, and then passes through a spooling gear with upright rollers. The spooling gear is moved from side to side across the stern which allows the net to be guided and wound tightly on the drum.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/1004/en Fishing Techniques: Drum seining] Rome. Retrieved 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages to the drum seine over the power block. The net can be hauled very quickly - at more than twice the speed of using a power block, the net does not require overhead handling, and the process is therefore safer. The most important advantage is that the drum system can be operated with fewer deckhands. However, it is illegal to use a seine drum in the state of [[Alaska]].

==Danish seine==
A Danish seine, also occasionally called an anchor seine, consists of a conical net with two long wings with a bag where the fish collect. Drag lines extend from the wings, and are long so they can surround an area.

A Danish seine is similar to a small [[trawling|trawl]] net, but the wire warps are much longer and there are no otter boards.  The seine boat drags the warps and the net in a circle around the fish. The motion of the warps herds the fish into the central net.

Danish seiner vessels are usually larger than purse seiners, though they are often accompanied by a smaller vessel. The drag lines are often stored on drums or coiled onto the deck by a coiling machine. A brightly coloured buoy, anchored as a "marker", serves as a fixed point when hauling the seine. A power block, usually mounted on a boom or a slewing deck crane, hauls the seine net.

Danish seining works best on [[demersal fish]] which are either
scattered on or close to the bottom of the sea, or are aggregated ([[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]]). They are used when there are flat but rough seabeds which are not trawlable. It is especially useful in northern regions, but not much in tropical to sub-tropical areas.

The net is deployed, with one end attached to an anchored dan (marker) buoy, by the main vessel, the [[Fishing vessel#Seiners|seiner]], or by a smaller auxiliary boat. A drag line is paid out, followed by a net wing. As the seiner sweeps in a big circle returning to the buoy, the deployment continues with the seine bag and the remaining wing, finishing with the remaining drag line. In this way a large area can be surrounded. Next the drag lines are hauled in using rope-coiling machines until the catch bag can be secured.

The seine netting method developed in Denmark. Scottish seining ("fly dragging") was a later modification. The original procedure is much the same as fly dragging except for the use of an anchored marker buoy when hauling, and closing the net and warps and net by winch.

'''Succade''' is the candied [[peel (fruit)|peel]] of any of the [[citrus]] species, especially from the [[citron]] or ''Citrus medica'' which is distinct with its extra-thick peel; in addition, the taste of the inner rind of the citron is less bitter than those of the other citrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhN0VK2608QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA159&amp;dq=succade&amp;ei=xkafR8bNE4G4zASpu7SuDg&amp;sig=g2c6B0imgrlemt6C9KLAc1xh_Og|title=World Spice Plants|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is also occasionally applied to the peel, root,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-sAOJoEWb0C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=succade&amp;ei=xkafR8bNE4G4zASpu7SuDg#PPA278,M1|title=The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge Made by Andrew Borde, of ...|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even entire fruit or vegetable like [[parsley]], [[fennel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDwUYfZEm2oC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=succade&amp;ei=xkafR8bNE4G4zASpu7SuDg&amp;sig=vORgeIWwevyScJJjtbrea4M5gJ0|title=The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cucurbita]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_MCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=succade&amp;lr=&amp;ei=zE-fR-KiN5HCzAS_qt3vCg|title=The Treasury of Botany|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have a bitter taste and are boiled with [[sugar]] to get a special "sweet and sour" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AxsOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=succade&amp;dq=succade&amp;lr=&amp;ei=a0ufR7aQJ5XaygTN-aD5CQ&amp;pgis=1 Publications]

==Name==
The word '''succade''' is most probably derived from the [[Latin]] ''succidus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZASAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA888&amp;dq=succade&amp;lr=&amp;ei=a0ufR7aQJ5XaygTN-aD5CQ|title=Das lateinische Sprachmaterial im Wortschatze der deutschen, französischen ...|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to others the name may have originated from the Hebrew word [[sukkah]], the temporary booth that Jews build on the holiday of [[Sukkot]]. The [[citron]], known in [[Hebrew]] as an ''[[etrog]]'', is one of the symbolic [[Four Species]] used on that holiday. After Sukkot, some Jews candy the ''etrog'' or make [[marmalade]] from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Citr_lim.html?redirect=1|title=Spice Pages:  Lemon (Citrus limon)|author=Gernot Katzer|work=gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simanim.jpg|thumb|A pure citron, of any kind, has a large portion of [[Mesocarp#Mesocarp|albedo]], which is important for the production of ''Succade''.]]
[[File:Orange cross section description.png|thumb|Location of mesocarp or albedo in a [[Citrus × sinensis|sweet orange]]]]
While the word ''Succade'' was widely used in [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RF4SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=succade&amp;ei=xkafR8bNE4G4zASpu7SuDg#PPA505,M1|title=A New English-German and German-English Dictionary: German and English|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; today it is usually called ''Zitronat''. The [[France|French]] called it '' fruit glacé '' or '' fruit confit '', and is also known as ''candied fruit'' or ''crystallized fruit''. It has been around since the 14th century.

==Production==
The ''citron'' fruits are halved, depulped, immersed in seawater or ordinary salt water to ferment for about 40 days, the [[brine]] being changed every two weeks; rinsed, and put in denser brine in wooden barrels for storage and for export. After partial de-salting and boiling to soften the peel, it is candied in a strong sugar solution. The candied peel is sun-dried or put up in jars for future use. Candying is traditionally done in [[Livorno]], [[Italy]], where they gathered the [[Corsican citron]]s from [[Corsica]], the [[Diamante citron]]s from [[Liguria]], [[Naples]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]], and the [[Greek citron]] from [[Greece]] through [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQYXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA736&amp;lpg=PA736&amp;dq=candied+citron+leghorn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XZNW39VpGu&amp;sig=A95QGYASjKGJxeN4Uu8_ZGyIJIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z7XWU5CgH6XgsATzjYLwDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=candied%20citron%20leghorn&amp;f=false Citron Leaves book]

The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with [[sugar]], thereby preventing the growth of [[Food microbiology|spoilage microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92425/candied-fruit|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia — Candied Fruit|accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eastern Bloc]], [[ersatz good|ersatz]] succade and [[orangeat]] were prepared from unripe tomatoes and carrots respectively, as citrus fruits were scarce goods that could not be produced domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13490070.html |title=Geheimsache Süßtafel |date=22 April 1991 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Succade is sometimes used in [[cakes]], as a filling for [[pound cake]], [[oliebol]], [[plum pudding]], [[Florentine biscuit|florentine]]s, [[sfogliatelle]], [[fruitcake]] or [[ontbijtkoek]]. It is also added to [[raisin bread]]. Succade is often combined with  [[Ribes|currant]]s, [[raisin]]s, [[cherries]] and [[hazelnut]]s.  Candied citron peel is often coated in [[chocolate]] and eaten as [[confectionery]]. Chopped succade is also used in [[cannoli]].
[[File:Halv sukat.JPG|thumb|A citron halved and depulped, cooked in sugar.]]

===Recipes===
Recipes vary from region to region, but the general principle is to boil the fruit, [[Steeping|steep]] it in increasingly strong sugar solutions for a number of weeks, and then dry off any remaining water.

The high sugar content of finished glacé fruits inhibits the growth of microorganisms, and glacé fruits will keep for a number of years without any additional methods of preservation.

Fruits that hold up well to being preserved in this manner include [[Cherry|cherries]], [[plum]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[pear]]s, [[Carambola|starfruit]], [[pineapple]], [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]]s and [[clementine]]s. [[Angelica archangelica|Angelica]] is rarely seen in Western cooking except as a glacé fruit.

[[image:tinapa.jpg|thumb|Tinapa]]
'''''Tinapa''''', a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term, is [[fish]] cooked or preserved through the process of [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]]. It is a native delicacy in the [[Philippines]] and is often made from [[blackfin scad]] (''Alepes melanoptera'', known locally as ''galunggong''), or from [[milkfish]], which is locally known as ''bangus''.

Though ''tinapa'' is very much accessible in the country, it is also possible for one to cook it at home. ''Tinapa'' recipe mainly involves the process of washing the fishes and putting it in brine for an extended amount of time (usually 5 – 6 hours), air drying and finally smoking the fishes. The fish species which are commonly used for making ''tinapa'' could either be ''galunggong'' (scads) or ''bangus'' (milkfish).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pinoycook.net/tinapa-smoked-fish-2/ "Tinapa (smoked fish)."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615210737/http://pinoycook.net/tinapa-smoked-fish-2/ |date=2010-06-15 }} [http://pinoycook.net Pinoycook.net]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://recipenijuan.com/tinapa-recipe/ "Tinapa Recipe Preparation and Method"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''tinapa'' can also refer to smoked meat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Leo  |title=English &amp;mdash; Tagalog Dictionary |publisher=Congregation of The Most Holy Redeemer |date=1989 |origyear=1st.
