* Automatic file handling (listeners interact with multiple MP3 files as a single book).
* Chapter-based, instead of file-based navigation.
* Extensive bookmarking and note-making capabilities.
* Series-based library organization (titles in a series are ordered by chronological date, not alphabetically).
* Automatic bookmark history prevents listeners from losing their place
* Sleep timer stops the audio book playback during nighttime listening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambling BookPlayer Pro Android App Review|url=http://www.androidappdictions.com/archives/1508|publisher=Android App Dictations|access-date=2012-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429040316/http://www.androidappdictions.com/archives/1508|archive-date=2012-04-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AppGuide - Ambling BookPlayer Pro|url=http://www.pcworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=449915|publisher=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1601">The '''Bagnolo steles''' are two  stone boulders found in Ceresolo-Bagnolo, [[Malegno]] commune, [[Brescia]] province, [[Lombardia]], Northern [[Italy]], at the base of Monte Mignone, at an altitude of ca. 700 m. '''Bagnolo 1'''  was discovered in 1963, bearing  depictions of 14 items, engraved by hammering. Recognizable are drawings of a [[Sun]], an [[axe]] and several [[dagger]]s of the "[[Remedello]]" type, a belt and an [[ibex]]. [[File:Bagnolo2.jpg|thumb|Bagnolo stele 1]]

In 1972, '''Bagnolo 2''' was discovered, a similar stele with 16 engravings, showing the same daggers and axes, and a Sun, as well as a figure of a dog, and a ploughman with a team of two oxen, and patterns interpreted as necklaces and pendants. [[File:Bagnolo1.jpg|thumb|Bagnlo stele 2]]

Fragments of other engraving were found in nearby Ossimo and Borno.

From the style of the daggers depicted, the engravings have been dated to the Italian [[Chalcolithic]], early to mid 3rd millennium BC, probably predating the presence of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] on the peninsula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3163">The '''Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships''' were established in 1993 and were offered annually to professional artists who had demonstrated a consistent commitment to their art practice. The Fellowships were an internationally renowned programme open to all artists; national and international. Located in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], England, the Fellowships were intended to give artists a period of time when they could reflect upon their practice and focus on the development of their work, responding to the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its coastal location.&lt;ref&gt;The Berwick Gymnasium Fellowships: An Archival Record, ed.

The fellowships were jointly funded by [[English Heritage]] and [[Arts Council England]] until 2011. The fellowships came to an end in 2011 after English Heritage announced funding cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future of gym gallery in doubt|url=http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/local/all-news/future-of-gym-gallery-in-doubt-1-1706086|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=Berwick Advertiser|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boboli Gardens''' ({{lang-it|Giardino di Boboli}}) is a park in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], that is home to a collection of sculptures dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries, with some Roman antiquities.

==History and layout==
[[File:Boboli-gardens-from-palazzo.jpg|thumb|Boboli Gardens Amphitheatre, viewed from the Palazzo Pitti]]
The Gardens, directly behind the [[Pitti Palace]], the main seat of the [[Medici]] grand dukes of [[Tuscany]] at [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable "built" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: [[grotto]]s, [[nympheum]]s, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties ever took place in the gardens.

The Boboli Gardens were laid out for [[Eleonora di Toledo]], the wife of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Boboli Gardens | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a corruption of "Bogoli", a family from whom land had been bought to construct the garden.&lt;ref name="Hibbert2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|title=The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzV9uDSjjEcC|accessdate=28 December 2015|date=1979|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141927145|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was scarcely begun by [[Niccolò Tribolo]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; before he died in 1550, then was continued by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]], with contributions in planning from [[Giorgio Vasari]], who laid out the grottos, and in sculpture by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]].&lt;ref name=zucconi&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year=1995 | title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | edition=2001 Reprint | publisher=Arsenale Editrice | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto (Vr) | ISBN=| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden is by Buontalenti.

The garden lacks a natural water source.  To water the plants in the garden, a conduit was built from the nearby [[Arno River]] to feed water into an elaborate irrigation system.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep [[amphitheater]]&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; that is reminiscent in its shape of one half of a classical [[hippodrome]] or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[Boboli obelisk]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; brought from the [[Villa Medici]] at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] (known to the irreverent Florentines as the "Fountain of the Fork" for Neptune's trident), with the sculpture of Neptune by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]] visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.

[[Giulio Parigi]] laid out the long secondary axis, the ''Viottolone'' or ''Cyprus Road'' at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the [[bosquet]]s on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the ''Grotto of Vulcan'' (''Grotticina di Vulcano'') along this axis.

The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 45,000&amp;nbsp;meters² (111&amp;nbsp;acres).&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.

In the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean sculpted by [[Giambologna]], then transferred to another location within the same garden. The small Grotto of Madama, and the Large Grotto, were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt;

Even while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto's statues are still on display and represent defining examples of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the fountain is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, that is a natural refuge to allow shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed ''The Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]] (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the [[Pope Julius II]]. Other rooms in the Grotto contain [[Giambologna|Giambologna's]] famous ''Bathing Venus'' and an 18th-century group of ''Paris and Helen'' by [[Vincenzo de' Rossi]].

==The Fountain of Neptune==
In the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the ''Fountain of Neptune''. The main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of ''Neptune'' (1565-1568) by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]]. This fountain was being constructed contemporaneously with it more famous counterpart, [[Bartolomeo Ammannati|Ammannati's]] ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The conceit here recalls the story of the competition of Athena and Neptune to be patrons of Athens. In that legend, Neptune struck the ground with his trident to spring forth water from the land. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of ''Abundance'' (''Dovizia'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LYoXoEQyOF0C The Italian Garden: Art, Design and Culture], article : Hard times in Baroque Florence: The Boboli Garden and the grand ducal public works administration, by Malcolm Campbell, editor: John Dixon Hunt, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Isolotto==
[[File:Boboli, isolotto, andromeda 02.JPG|thumb|Andromeda rises above the ''Isolotto'' centered in its pool: the luxuriant and naturalistic plant growth is a 19th-century development.]]
The Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree enclosed pond nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, while in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromedae (school of [[Giambologna]]). The Isolotto was laid out (circa 1618) by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40562">The '''Budapest Museum Quarter''' is a proposed new cultural and [[Tourist attraction|tourist site]] to be located on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and has at its core the merger of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike.

==Background==

===Hungarian national museum system===
National museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state–owned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] as specialized complementary institutions to the original [[Hungarian National Museum]]. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system — including the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum|Museum of Natural History]], [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]], [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]] and pre–World War II, the [[National Library of Hungary|National Library and Archives]] — operated autonomously with their own board and endowment.  However, with the introduction of [[Communism in Hungary|Communism into Hungary]] in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apor|first=Péter|title=The National Museum in Hungary: Approaches to Its Analysis|journal=Conference on Building National Museums: 1750–2010|date=March 30 – April 1, 2011|url=http://www.eunamus.eu/bologna-reports/hungary.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hungarian National Museum]] is an important symbol of [[national identity]] because it played a major role in the anti-Habsburg [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Gov't, civil organizations reach deal on sharing Budapest streets on March 15|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120217/govt-civil-organizations-reach-deal-on-sharing-the-streets-on-march-15/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidesz government (2010)===

====Cultural policy====
After winning a two–thirds parliamentary majority in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 elections]], [[Fidesz]] or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a "hands–on cultural policy" that included appointing a media watchdog "that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center–right government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) when the prior, Socialist–appointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. [[Francesca von Habsburg|Francesca Von Habsburg]] was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front–runner in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=After censorship row, what next in Hungary?|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles//23070|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire Gábor Gulyás, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surprise appointment at Budapest's Mucsarnok|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/comings-and-goings/2011/3|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, László Harsanyi, the director of the [http://old.hdke.hu/index.php?changelang=eng Holocaust Memorial Center] and his chief historical adviser, Judit Molnár, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, András Levente Gál, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary’s interwar leader [[Miklós Horthy]]. Saying that "this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension," Gál drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Molnár, "we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history." A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee László Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Győrgy Szabó, director of [http://www.trafo.hu/en-US Trafó] — a leading contemporary art center — by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest’s Új Szinház theater, István Márta by György Dörner, an actor with extreme right–wing political affiliations. According to art historian Éva Forgács, “the government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.” However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition.&lt;ref name=Michalska&gt;{{cite news|last=Michalska|first=Julia|title=Hungary's government tightens grip on arts|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungary%E2%80%99s-government-tightens-grip-on-arts/25561|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Arts Newspaper|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Karácsony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the [[Hungarian National Museum]] system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=LMP: múzeumok fognak bezárni|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20120411_lmp_muzeumok_bezaras|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=hvg.hu|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional changes====
On January 1, 2012, [[Constitution of Hungary#2011 Constitution|amendments created in the spring of 2011]] by Fidesz to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution]] took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Some of these changes included "a [[preamble]] committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the [[electoral process]]. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarians protest against new Fidesz constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16387117|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was "high time" for the changes to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarian government defends controversial Constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16395791|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support his May 2010 remarks that “Hungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations”, as well as publicize the legislative changes, [[Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Orbán]] opened a special government–organized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state–commissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orbán himself.&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt;

Facing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid–January 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casert|first=Raf|title=Hungary plans changes to controversial legislation|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/01/18/international/i065206S24.DTL|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=SFGate|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==

===Initial proposals===
The concept of a separate museum district within [[Budapest]] was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the [[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Western Railway Station]] to the current [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], located on [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]], to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]] would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to "serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre" and be realized over a period of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidesz announces plans for budapest museum quarter|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20100303/fidesz-announces-plans-for-budapest-museum-quarter/|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=MTI|date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal was unveiled by [[István Tarlós]], who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became [[mayor of Budapest]] later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that "the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue".&lt;ref name=Melyi&gt;{{cite news|last=Mélyi|first=József|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]], due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and [[Contemporary art|contemporary fine art]], much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.&lt;ref name="Melyi"/&gt; After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a "special museum island" that would complement the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|journal=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current plans===
In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] officially announced plans to build a new structure along [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] close to [[Városliget|City Park]] and near the existing [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] and [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok).  This building would house the collections of the current [[Hungarian National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=MTI&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andrássy Quarter.&lt;ref name=Foldes&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiákerek az Andrássyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian–only zone that hasn't existed on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=DAmato&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Amato|first=Erik|title=The mad plan to kill off Budapest's best walking street|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20110926/the-mad-plan-to-kill-off-budapests-best-walking-street/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]], there would also be changes made to [[Városliget|City Park]]. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after [[Harry Houdini]], whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]].&lt;ref name="Foldes"/&gt; After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hungary around the clock|title=Planned Budapest "museum quarter" could be completed by 2017, official says|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111028/planned-budapest-museum-quarter-could-be-completed-by-2017-official-says/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural design for this "New Gallery" will be chosen based on an international competition.&lt;ref name=Unwin&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest 'mega–project' to defy the downturn|url=http://www.aica.hu/doc/baan_interview_tan_november.pdf|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointments and resignations===
According to the Hungarian News Agency ([[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]]), on October 1, 2011 László Baán was appointed to a two–year term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]].  In his new post, Baán will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay.  He will be responsible for “preparing the concept, execution and architectural design–tender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest’s 56–ers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]]".&lt;ref name="MTI"/&gt;

Baán has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

In early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]]— called the merge process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and opposition==

===Political===
This is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location.  The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]. However, that proposal — which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources — was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jámbor|first=Gyula|title=Kormány negyed nélkül|url=http://mno.hu/migr_1834/kormany_negyed_nelkul-365046|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace March for Hungary 2012.01.21 (10).JPG|thumb | left | 2012 Pro Government demonstration]]
There was speculation by historian András Gerő that [[Fidesz]]'s recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti–communist stance, which "is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunai|first=Márton|title=Hungary's Orban seeks to wipe out Communist past|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/uk-hungary-communism-idUSLNE81001C20120201|work=Reuters|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Csák was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition [http://www.mng.hu/en/exhibitions/hosok_nyito_en ''Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary''] which he criticized by saying, “The government shouldn’t have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn’t be getting involved in politics.”&lt;ref name=Michalska/&gt;

Moving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the [[Buda Castle]] empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Mozgólépcső vinne a Várba a Duna–partról|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/14/mozgolepcso_vinne_a_varba_a_duna_partrol/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buda Castle Day.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle — current home of the National Gallery]]

===Economic===

In November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to [[junk status]] by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Patricia|title=The five projects we are watching|url=http://www.bbj.hu/business/the-five-projects-we-are-watching_61671|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Budapest Business Journal|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, László Baán defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are "making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated." However, he also added that "it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega–project of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message".&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

===Legal===
There is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the [[Városliget|City Park]] is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The [[zoning laws]] are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.&lt;ref name=Foldes/&gt;

===Social===
In addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree–lined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty — a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy — and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists.&lt;ref name="DAmato"/&gt;

[[File:Andrassy-ut-budapest.jpg|thumb | left|Andrássy út in Budapest]]

Art professionals have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled "Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sármány-Parsons|first=Ilona|title=Information on the Proposed Dissolution of the Hungarian National Gallery as an Independent Institution|url=http://www.thearttribune.com/Information-on-the-Proposed.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Tribune|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA)|title=Standpoint|url=http://aica.hu/mng_allasfoglalas.html|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baán dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre–1957 state and give it more prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Múzeumi negyed: a kormánybiztos visszautasítja a félremagyarázást|url=http://www.stop.hu/kultura/muzeumi-negyed-a-kormanybiztos-visszautasitja-a-felremagyarazast/953219/|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Stop.hu|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar places worldwide==

Despite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location.

===Europe===
The [[Museumplein]] of Amsterdam — a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events — lies in the heart of the museum quarter in [[Amsterdam]] surrounded by the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk]] and the [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumplein|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/locations/museumplein/1ef2bca0-e72c-5602-e1f75b6471e3f3b0|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five institutions that are all part of the [[Berlin State Museums]] are located on the northern half of an island in the [[Spree River]] in [[Berlin]], Germany and make up what is referred to as [[Museum Island]].

More than a dozen museums in [[Frankfurt]], Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the [[Museumsufer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumsufer Frankfurt|url=http://www.kultur-frankfurt.de/portal/en/Museums/MuseumEmbankmentFrankfurt/1503/0/0/0/1441.aspx|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 2001, the [[Museumsquartier|Museum Quarter in Vienna]] is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area. It is also home to restaurants, cafés and shops, attracting about 3.8 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the MQ|url=http://www.mqw.at/en/the+mq/about+the+mq/|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was created in order to coordinate the work of various museums after the establishment of a federal museum law.&lt;ref name="Melyi"/&gt; [[File:Museumsquartier.jpg|thumb | MuseumsQuartier Vienna]]

===North America===
[[Museum Campus Chicago|Chicago's Museum Campus]], which houses the [[Shedd Aquarium]], [[Field Museum]], [[Adler Planetarium]], and [[Soldier Field]], came to be in 1998 when the area next to [[Lake Michigan]] was replanned and landscaped with the intention of tying the institutions together with the use of green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago's Museum Campus|url=http://gochicago.about.com/od/chicagomuseums/ss/museum_campus.htm|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dallas arts district|Dallas Arts District]] was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. [[Meyerson Symphony Center]], the [[Crow Collection of Asian Art]], the [[Nasher Sculpture Center]], the [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]], and the [[AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center]] have all been moved or newly built in the area.

==Related issues==
In addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's [[cultural heritage management]].

===Kossuth Square===
A new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the [[Kossuth Square]] in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]]. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, [[Attila József]] would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister [[Gyula Andrássy]]. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that "the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.”&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt; However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space "without asking the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Socialists plant tree to protest reconstruction of area around parliament|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120423/socialists-plant-tree-to-protest-reconstruction-of-area-around-parliament/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the statues of [[Kossuth Square]] being in danger, the fate of the [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnographic Museum]] that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grabow|first=Elisabeth K.|title=Taking a stand on Kossuth square|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2012/03/02/taking-a-stand-on-kossuth-square/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Budapest Times|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the [[Institute of Political History]] that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]], but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Tízmilliárdokat emésztene fel a Kúria áthelyezése (in Hungarian)
|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120421_kuria_uj_helye|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural History Museum===
In mid–2011, the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Marian|title=Hungarian natural history under threat|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110607/full/474139a.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Nature|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] to the completed Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sajtoiroda|title=A Közigazgatási és Igazságügyi Minisztérium és a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum sajtóközleménye a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum elhelyezéséröl|url=http://www.mttm.hu/modules/Kozmuvelodes/sajtokozlemeny.jpg|work=Press Release|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Krasznahorkacivertanlegi3.jpg|thumb| Krásna Hôrka Castle before the fire of 2012]]

===Hopp Southeast Asia Museum===
A private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on [[Andrássy út]] in September 2011 as part of the new [[Zelnik István Southeast Asian Gold Museum|Southeast Asian Gold Museum]].  One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of "museum" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rózsa|first=Mihály|title=L'ouverture du Musée Zelnik|url=http://www.lepetitjournal.com/culture-budapest/85596-culture-louverture-du-musee-zelnik.html|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Le Petit Journal (in French)|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is both complimentary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum István Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the György Ráth Museum is uncertain. Due to financial constraints, they are both only open for half–days on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments [http://www.nemzetimuemlek.hu/ (MNG)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamvay|first=Péter|title=A Hoppnak annyi?|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=520094&amp;referer_id=friss#null|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Népszava Online|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krásna Hôrka Castle===
While [[Krásna Hôrka Castle]] is a National Cultural Monument of the [[Slovak Republic]], it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections.&lt;ref "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/261533-slovensky-hrad-krasna-horka-shorel-kvuli-dvema-detem-s-cigaretou.html?ref=zpravy-dne|title=Slovenský hrad Krásná Hôrka shořel kvůli dvěma dětem s cigaretou|last=Šubrt|first=Pavel |date=11 March 2012|publisher=Novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tizenévesek okozhatták a krasznahorkai tüzet|url=http://index.hu/kulfold/2012/03/11/tizenevesek_okozhattak_a_krasznahorkai_tuzet/|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography==

===Early life===
'''The Honourable Charlotte Mary Thérèse Bingham''' was born on 29 June 1942 in [[Haywards Heath]], Sussex.&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlottebingham.com/childhood.html|title=Charlotte Bingham – Childhood|first=|last=|publisher=CharlotteBingham.com|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308010002/http://www.charlottebingham.com/childhood.html|archivedate=8 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[John Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris]], wrote detective stories and was a secret member of [[MI5]]. Her mother, Madeleine Bingham, née Madeleine Mary Ebel, was a playwright. Bingham first attended a school in London, but from the age of seven to 16, she went to the Priory of Our Lady's Good Counsel school in Haywards Heath.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt; After she left school, Bingham went to stay in Paris with some French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] with the intention of learning French. She had written since she was 10 years old and her first piece of work was a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] called ''Death's Ticket''.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt; Bingham wrote her humorous autobiography, called ''Coronet Among the Weeds'', when she was 19, and not long before her twentieth birthday a literary agent discovered her celebrating at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz]]. He was a friend of her parents and he took off the finished manuscript of her autobiography.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt; In 1963, this was published by [[Heinemanns]] and was a best seller.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===TV work===
In 1966, Charlotte Bingham's first novel, called ''[[Lucinda (book)|Lucinda]]'', was published. This was later adapted into a TV screenplay. In 1972, ''Coronet Among the Grass'', her second autobiography, was published. This talked about the first ten years of her marriage to fellow writer [[Terence Brady (writer)|Terence Brady]]. The couple, who have two children, later adapted ''Coronet Among the Grass'' and ''Coronet Among the Weeds'', into the TV sitcom ''[[No, Honestly]]''. Bingham and her husband collaborated on the scripts for three early episodes of ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', "[[Board Wages]]", "[[I Dies from Love]]" and "[[Out of the Everywhere (Upstairs, Downstairs)|Out of the Everywhere]]". They later wrote an accompanying book called ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)#Novelisations|Rose's Story]]''. They also wrote the episodes of ''[[Take Three Girls]]'' featuring Victoria ([[Liza Goddard]]). In the 1970s, Brady and Bingham wrote episodes for the TV series ''[[Play for Today]]'', ''[[Three Comedies of Marriage]]'', ''[[Yes, Honestly]]'' and ''[[Robin's Nest]]''. During the 1980s and 1990s, they continued to write for the occasional TV series and adapted [[Jilly Cooper]]'s novel ''[[Riders (Cooper novel)|Riders]]'' for the [[television film]] ''[[Riders (1993 film)|Riders]]'' (1993).

===Later work===
Since the 1980s, Bingham has become a romantic novelist, writing novels including ''To Hear a Nightingale'', ''The Business'' and ''In Sunshine or in Shadow''. Most of her books are set in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1996, she won the [[Romantic Novel of the Year Award]] from the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]].

The '''Clach a' Mheirlich''' (literally, the "Thief's stone") or '''Rosskeen Stone''' is a [[standing stone]] in a field near [[Rosskeen]], [[Easter Ross]], [[Scotland]]. 

The stone itself is [[Bronze Age]] in origin, but has on it three incised Pictish-style symbols barely visible on the surface of the stone, making it a Class I [[Pictish stones|Pictish symbol stone]].

'''The Council of Architecture''' ('''COA''') is a body corporate by the [[Government of India]] under the provisions of the Architects Act, 1972, enacted by the [[Parliament of India]], which came into force on 1 September 1972. The Act provides for registration of Architects, standards of education, recognized qualifications and standards of practice to be complied with by the practicing architects. The Council of Architecture is charged with the responsibility to regulate the education and practice of profession throughout India besides maintaining the register of architects. For this purpose, the Government of India has framed Rules and Council of Architecture has framed Regulations as provided for in the Architects Act, with the approval of Government of India.

==Overview==
Any person desirous of carrying on the profession of '[[Architect]]' must have registered himself with Council of Architecture. For the purpose of registration, one must possess the requisite qualification as appended to the Architects Act, after having undergone the education in accordance with the Council of Architecture (Minimum Standards of Architectural Education) Regulations, 1983. The registration with Council of Architecture entitles a person to practice the profession of architecture, provided he holds a Certificate of Registration with up-to-date renewals. The registration also entitles a person to use the title and style of Architect. The title and style of architect can also be used by a firm of architects, of which all partners are registered with COA. Limited Companies, Private/Public Companies, societies and other juridical persons are not entitled to use the title and style of architect nor are they entitled to practice the profession of architecture. If any person falsely claims to be registered or misuses title and style of architect, such acts tantamount to committing of a criminal offence, which is punishable under section 36 or 37 (2) of the Architects Act, 1972.

The practice of profession of an architect is governed by the Architects (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 1989 (as amended in 2003), which deals with professional ethics and etiquette, conditions of engagement and scale of charges, architectural competition guidelines etc. Pursuant to these Regulations, the Council of Architecture has framed guidelines governing the various aspects of practice. An architect is required to observe professional conduct as stipulated in the Regulations of 1989 and any violation thereof shall constitute a professional misconduct, which will attract disciplinary action as stipulated under section 30 of the Architects Act, 1972.

==Functions==
As of July 2018, there are 463 approved institutions,&lt;ref name=CoA&gt;{{cite web |title=Status with Intake of Architectural Institutions in India As on July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.coa.gov.in/show_img.php?fid=396 |publisher=Council of Architecture |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which impart architectural education in India leading to recognized qualifications.

[[File:Daly's Theatre and Leicester Square, London.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Daly's Theatre and Leicester Square, c. 1905]]
'''Daly's Theatre''' was a theatre in the [[City of Westminster]]. It was located at 2 Cranbourn Street, just off [[Leicester Square]].  It opened on 27 June 1893, and was demolished in 1937.

==Early years==
The theatre was originally built for American producer [[Augustin Daly]] by the English theatre manager [[George Edwardes]].  The architect was Spencer Chadwick, who was assisted by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]].  The theatre was one of the first in London to be built using the [[cantilever]] system, and the Italian Renaissance and neo-classical facade was more elaborate than that of most London theatres.  Likewise, the entrance hall and foyer were elaborately executed and decorated.  The Victorian style to minimize colouring and design in the auditorium was abandoned, and instead bold designs and colours were used.  It had a seating capacity of over 1,200 in three tiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Graphic'', 28 June 1893, reprinted in Mander &amp; Mitchenson's ''Lost Theatres of London''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre opened with ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', with Daly's star from his American company, [[Ada Rehan]], playing Katharina. This was followed by Sheridan Knowles's ''The Hunchback'', with [[Violet Vanbrugh]], and in 1894 by ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'' and the younger Dumas's ''La Dame aux camélias'', with [[Eleonora Duse]].

==The Edwardes years==
[[File:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the Vocal Score]]
In 1894, Edwardes took over management of the theatre himself.  He hired [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] as the resident composer and music director, and the theatre became well known for a string of highly successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] productions composed mostly by Jones, many with additional songs by [[Lionel Monckton]].

[[File:Daly's Theatre.PNG|right|thumb|Daly was no longer involved with the theatre by 1899]]The shows represented a step forward in the evolution of [[musical theatre]]. They had coherent plots and music specifically composed for the plot of each piece. After the first few of these pieces, they became more like what musical comedy was to become at maturity than their [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] siblings, the more [[revue]]-like "Girl" musicals.  The early Daly's Theatre shows, mostly with books by critic-turned-playwright [[Owen Hall]] and lyrics by [[Harry Greenbank]] and the prolific [[Adrian Ross]], included the breakout hit, ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1894), ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895), and the three most successful musical comedies of the era: ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896), ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898) and ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899).  The shows starred actors such as leading lady [[Marie Tempest]], dancer-soubrette [[Letty Lind]], leading men [[C. Hayden Coffin]] and [[Scott Russell (tenor)|Scott Russell]], and comics [[Huntley Wright]] and [[Rutland Barrington]].

These were followed by ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902) and ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), with books by [[James T. Tanner]]. Edwardes was clever at gauging the changing tastes of his audiences. For a time, he successfully presented English adaptations of continental European operettas, like ''[[The Little Michus]]'' (1905), ''[[The Merveilleuses]]'' (1906), the highly successful ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), [[Gipsy Love (operetta)|Gipsy Love]] (1912) and ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' (1915).  In this series, [[Percy Greenbank]] replaced his brother Harry, who had died at the age of 33, songwriter [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] joined the team, and new actors joined or replaced the older ones, including leading men [[Bertram Wallis]], [[Courtice Pounds]] and [[Robert Evett]], and leading ladies [[Gertie Millar]], [[Lily Elsie]], [[Gabrielle Ray]], [[Isabel Jay]], [[Louie Pounds]] and [[Evie Greene]].

==After Edwardes==
[[File:Jose Collins Maid.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'']]
Edwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate in considerable debt.  The theatre continued to be managed by Robert Evett as part of Edwardes's estate.  Evett directed and produced ''[[The Happy Day]]'' (1916) and the smash hit, ''[[The Maid of the Mountains]]'' (1917), both starring [[José Collins]]. The show ran for a record-breaking three years and saved the Edwardes estate.  This was followed by ''[[A Southern Maid]]'' (1917; revived 1920) and ''Our Peg'' (later adapted into ''Our Nell'').  Evett also directed revivals of ''[[The Dollar Princess]]''.

Later, other managements took over the theatre.  In 1927, [[Noël Coward]]'s famous flop ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' played at Daly's.  After this failure, Daly's returned to musical comedies but found little further success.  ''That's a Pretty Thing'' played in 1933, ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' was revived in 1934, and ''Young England'' was transferred there in 1935.  The theatre eventually closed in 1937 after the last performance of ''The First Legion'' and was sold to [[Warner Brothers]] who demolished the theatre and built a large theatre and cinema called the Warner Theatre designed by [[Thomas Somerford]] and E. A. Stone with a marble facade sculpted by [[Edward Bainbridge Copnall|Bainbridge Copnall]], featuring a large relief panel in two corners depicting the spirits of sight and sound.&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite web|title=Vue West End|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3778| work=cinematreasures.org| publisher=Cinema Treasures| accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building was demolished, but the marble frontage was retained, and the site was redeveloped as the ''[[Warner Village Cinemas|Warner Village]] cinema complex''. It changed hands again, and is now the ''[[Vue West End]]''.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

The '''Early English Text Society''' ('''EETS''') is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1864, dedicated to the editing and publication of early English texts, especially those only available in manuscript. Most of its volumes contain editions of [[Middle English]] or [[Old English]] texts. It is known for having been the first to print many important English manuscripts, including [[Cotton Library|Cotton Nero A.x]], which contains ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and other poems.

==History==
[[File:Blickling homilies leaf 141.png|thumb|left|A page of the [[Blickling Homilies]] in facsimile, as reproduced in ''The Blickling Homilies of the Tenth Century: from the Marquis of Lothian's unique MS A.D. 971'', edited and translated by [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]], EETS o.s. vols 58, 63, 73 (1874–80)]]
The Society was founded in England in 1864 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]]. Its stated goal in a report of its first year of existence was, "on the one hand, to print all that is most valuable of the yet unprinted {{abbr|MSS.|manuscripts}} in English, and, on the other, to re-edit and reprint all that is most valuable in printed English books, which from their scarcity or price are not within the reach of the student of moderate means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 Nov 2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17000/17000-h/17000-h.htm#report |title=Report of the Committee, January, 1865 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2016, the Society had published 347 volumes in its Original Series; 126 volumes in its Extra Series, published between 1867 and 1935, comprising texts previously printed, but only in unsatisfactory or rare editions; and 25 volumes in its Supplementary Series, an occasional and irregular series initiated in 1970. The Society keeps the majority of its older publications in print, excepting only those which have been superseded by subsequent editions in its own series. Volumes are now published on behalf of the Society by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~eets/list-of-all-publications-2015.pdf |title=List of Publications 2015 |publisher=Early English Text Society |accessdate=30 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
[[File:Alfred-jewel-ashmolean.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]]]]
The Society emblem is a modified representation of the Anglo-Saxon [[Alfred Jewel]], incorporating a scroll bearing the name of the Society.

==Notable members==
Notable members of the society when it was formed in 1864 included [[Frederick James Furnivall|Furnivall]] himself, [[Alfred Tennyson]] ([[poet laureate]]), [[Warren de la Rue]] (inventor of the [[lightbulb]]), [[Richard Chenevix Trench]] (Irish ecclesiastic), Stephen Austin (a [[Hertford]]-based printer), Edith Coleridge (granddaughter of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), the Rev. [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]] (the editor of 12 volumes between 1862 and 1880), and others.

'''East Street Arts''' is  a contemporary arts organisation and [[registered charity]] based in Leeds, [[England]]. It was established in 1993 by Karen Watson and Jon Wakeman to provide space, services, facilities, opportunities and support for artists.&lt;ref name="esaweb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esaweb.org.uk/page.asp?sectionIdentifier=2005119_59563845&amp;pageIdentifier=200645_63637942 |title=ESA - Facilitating Visual Artists |publisher=Esaweb.org.uk |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The arts organisations is dedicated to making art accessible to all. It operates on an international scale, supporting artists at all levels and stages of their careers. East Street Arts aims to sustain the alternative and challenge the norm through creating the space, time and resource for artists to be innovative, pioneering and successful. At the heart of its philosophy is developing unique, provocative and experimental environments for artists, residents, businesses and tourists to convene.

East Street Arts occupies places, bringing creativity, vibrancy and life to urban environments: from artistic commissions which reimagine public space to its portfolio of temporary and permanent arts properties.

Led by a dynamic trio of directors, its property portfolio spans the length and breadth of the country providing artistic workspaces and studios, exhibition venues, community arts hubs and, most recently, the UK’s first independent Art Hostel, creating a home-from-home for an international community of artists and curious tourists alike.

'''Ensemble librarianship''' (or performance librarianship) is an area of [[music librarianship]] which specializes in serving the needs of [[musical ensemble]]s, including [[symphony]] and chamber [[orchestra]]s, [[opera house]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[ballet]] companies, wind ensembles and educational institutions. Ensemble librarians acquire printed music and prepare it for performance.

== History ==

Ensemble or performance librarianship is a relatively new and evolving field with an oral history, so in many instances, there is no written history upon which to rely. Aside from a few surveys and recorded interviews, there are very few documents describing the history of the profession at this point in time. Many of the musicians who developed and defined the job as it exists today are still living (for example, librarian [https://web.archive.org/web/20111002083408/http://www.polyphonic.org/contributor.php?id=80 Clinton Nieweg]). Historically, music librarians were only required to handle acquisitions and distribution – they did not have the requirements many librarians have today to mark individual parts for performance, correct errors, work in close consultation with the music director and/or artistic staff, and conduct scholarly research. Traditionally, many orchestra librarians were string players, since they already possessed a working knowledge of [[Bow (music)|bowings]] (markings made in string parts). “Until 1970s, in all but the largest orchestras the librarian had a playing position in the orchestra and engaged in part time library work to supplement his or her income.  In other cases the librarian had retired from playing and still wished to remain a part of the orchestra.  A survey at the 1998 MOLA annual conference (conducted by Andrew S. Holmes) revealed that in some smaller orchestras..., the library position had remained part-time for the most part until the mid 1980's to early 1990's.”&lt;ref name="mola-inc"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Holmes |first=Andrew S. |title=Classification of the Performance Librarian within the Orchestra: A Thesis in Music |date=May 1998 |chapter=The History of the Performance Librarian |page=34 |url=http://www.mola-inc.org/PressRoom/HolmesThesis.pdf |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724225057/http://www.mola-inc.org/PressRoom/HolmesThesis.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organizations, librarian duties were alternatively fulfilled by an administrative staff member (i.e. personnel manager or orchestra manager) and this is still the case with many smaller organizations today. Gradually, particularly with the larger orchestras and bands, the role of music librarian has become a job obtained on an audition basis and which requires the demonstration of extensive knowledge of not only music notation, history, and performance practice, but also specialized technique and research ability. Today, larger and more established organizations can have multiple librarians and a hierarchy has developed, where a principal librarian is often identified and compensated accordingly (much like principal string or wind/brass/percussion players in an orchestral setting). This principal librarian may then work with one or more assistant librarians and can delegate tasks.&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

== Education ==

=== Formal education ===

A professional ensemble librarian requires a diverse and extensive musical, research, and often administrative-oriented background. Currently, there is no formal degree program specifically for ensemble or performance librarianship offered at any academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, primary forms of training include degree programs or their equivalent in Music Performance (instrumental), Music Theory, Musicology, or related fields, in conjunction with mentoring, internships, and on-the-job training. In the United States, work as an apprentice with a career librarian is a common and invaluable educational tool.&lt;ref name="polyphonic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnackenberg|first=Karen|title=Training to Become a Performance Librarian|url=http://www.polyphonic.org/article.php?id=131|accessdate=6 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002083433/http://www.polyphonic.org/article.php?id=131|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ensemble librarians hold degrees in Library Science (LIS, MLIS). "Most music schools and many library / information science schools have programs that offer a variety of related course work which could be applied to orchestra librarianship.”&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=The Orchestra Librarian: A Career Introduction|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/orchlib.html|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While such experience can be very helpful, this is not typically a specific requirement to work as an ensemble librarian. Ideally, “training for orchestra librarianship should include a broad and intensive education in all aspects of music and the liberal arts. This career requires a combination of formal education and extensive practical experience in a symphonic organization."&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Required skills and abilities ===
&lt;big&gt;Qualifications&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Quoted with permission from Russ Girsberger's "A Manual for the Performance Library"&lt;ref name="Girsberger2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance&lt;br /&gt; Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
The following list describes the qualifications that are desirable to function successfully as a performance librarian. Not every position requires all of these abilities, but professional performance librarians use these skills on a regular basis in their work.

&lt;big&gt;Library Auditions&lt;/big&gt;

In the U.S., some professional ensemble librarians must now endure a process similar to instrumental orchestral auditions in order to obtain their jobs. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110413173239/http://www.kennedy-center.org/nso/orchestra/meet_musicians/?mode=administration Marcia Farabee (Principal Librarian, National Symphony]) explains that today some orchestras have adopted a similar audition process for librarians. These 'librarian auditions' involve interviews as well as written tests which ask questions to which a qualified candidate should know the answers."&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt; Experience, formal education, and references provided on the auditionee's résumé play an important role, but the candidate may be required to pass this live audition and interview component, as well. As noted, larger orchestras and the more prestigious summer fellowships may require a candidate to pass a written exam demonstrating knowledge of composers, important historical facts, publishers, and repertoire. Librarians wishing to pursue this career study long hours in order to prepare for these auditions and therefore, professional ensemble librarianship is becoming a competitive field in North America. In Europe, many ensemble librarians currently obtain their positions via a more standard job interview process.

== Functions of the performance librarian ==

=== Music acquisition and cataloging ===

The ensemble librarian is often the primary individual responsible for research, acquisition (via purchase, rental, commission, or lending), receipt of materials, and cataloging of performing materials (scores and parts) for a musical organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Music Library Association|title=Music Librarianship: Is it for you?|year=2009|url=http://musiclibraryassoc.org/employment.aspx?id=78|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The librarian consults and collaborates with the music director, other artistic or administrative staff members, and/or soloists to identify the correct edition or version of the work to be acquired and its source, then works to determine its cost, delivery time, method of delivery, and any other associated concerns. The librarian may also be responsible for locating and obtaining perusal materials (scores and/or recordings for study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important component of the acquisition process, particularly in the case of renting works under copyright, can be obtaining permission and licensing for any recording, broadcast (radio or World Wide Web), or other types of mechanical use that may be planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tarlow, L.  |author2=Sutherland, R.|title=The Music We Perform: An overview of royalties, rentals, and rights|year=2004 |orig-year=1998 |page=6|url=http://www.mola-inc.org|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the purchase or commission of performance materials, the librarian may be obligated to create and/or maintain a catalog of the musical organization’s physical holdings of performance and reference material. This can be as simple as an itemized listing of materials owned or as complex as designing and implementing a custom-made electronic catalog for the ensemble. Many organizations utilize pre-existing database programs such as [http://fineartssoftware.com OPAS]. Upon receipt of purchased or donated materials, the librarian inventories the scores and parts, stamps or otherwise marks them with the organization’s name and identifying information, and prepares them for storage. Cataloging can also extend to maintaining a record of conductor markings and dates of use, condition of materials, and performance and lending history.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Part preparation and distribution ===

The most essential task of the ensemble librarian is to provide adequately prepared [[Part (music)|parts]] to the players of the ensemble. Collaboration with conductors and soloists is often necessary in order to determine the specific requirements concerning the part preparation process. The goal is to ensure smooth flow of rehearsals and performances.
Music arriving from a [[Publishing|publisher]] or rental agent is rarely ready for use as such; most parts will need adjustments to make them more suitable for the performer. This most frequently includes marking string bowings, fixing bad page turns, adding and/or coordinating rehearsal figures, clarifying illegible notation and correcting [[Erratum|errata]]. Editing of [[tempo]]s, [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulations]], inserts, and cuts or transposition into a singer's preferred [[Range (music)|vocal range]] or instrumentalist's preferred [[Key (music)|key]] may also be required. Additional [[proofreading]] may also be necessary, due to mistakes or inconsistencies in published editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the parts have been prepared appropriately, the orchestra librarian will assemble concert folders or arrange part pick-up for the musicians. The concert folder contains all the music for the complete [[concert]] for an individual musician (e.g. [[Oboe]] I) or a single desk of musicians (such as [[Violin]] I / Desk 1).  Assembling the concert folders needs to be finished well in advance of each series of performances to make sure the musicians have time to practice. In some orchestras, the librarian is responsible for delivering concert folders to the music stands on stage for all rehearsals and performances.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

Once the performances are over, the librarian disassembles the concert folders, tracks down any missing parts and stores any performance materials owned by the orchestra. Hired or rented sets are returned, and archival copies of bowings are usually made for future reference.

=== Preservation ===
The ensemble librarian is responsible for the care and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of the ensemble's music collection. In addition to the purchase cost of printed [[sheet music]], the value of the library collection increases with information added during rehearsals and preparation work done to the parts. This value is inherent and often irreplaceable.

Damage to printed music may occur due to environmental sources (sunlight, temperature, humidity, pests, dust), physical handling, and improper storage. Appropriate humidity and temperature, protection from light sources (especially ultraviolet light) and from acid materials are key factors in ensuring the long life of printed music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditions ===
One common recruitment process of musicians for professional orchestras and bands is an audition and the ensemble's librarian is often responsible for preparing the materials required for such auditions. These usually include a round consisting of excerpts from standard orchestral repertoire that the auditionee is required to perform for the audition committee. The orchestra librarian is usually in charge of preparing the audition materials for the auditionees and audition committee. Care must be taken that starts, stops, [[Key signature|key]] and [[time signature]]s, [[Tempo|tempo markings]] and transpositions are properly indicated. The librarian is often responsible for acquiring publishers' permissions for reproducing the audition excerpts of works still under [copyright].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods and tools ===
In the area of [[research]], [[cataloging]], storage and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of music, [[Music library|music libraries]] share many methods in common with ensemble libraries.&lt;ref name="polyphonic" /&gt;   Many ensemble librarians use a comprehensive computerized [[database]] such as [http://fineartssoftware.com OPAS] that integrates information about the [[composer]], [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and performance history of standard orchestral works.

Use of the internet has provided librarians easier access to information, especially research and reference materials. The online forum of the [http://www.mola-inc.org Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA)] has greatly increased communication between professional librarians and provided excellent opportunities for networking and exchange of information.&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

The tools traditionally used for the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherrill|first=Steven|title=Symphony Orchestra Library|url=http://www.orchestralibrary.com/|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part preparation process is traditionally done by hand for every single part to be used on stage. Bowings need to be marked into the string parts using pencil, since they are likely to change on stage during rehearsals, and the players need to be able to incorporate the alterations easily. The same applies to conductors' personal tempo indications and dynamic markings. Temporary musical edits (such as cuts and inserts) are done in a way which allows their easy removal afterward.

In addition to common library tools, ensemble librarians often utilize music engraving software for incorporating last-minute musical changes such as transpositions, "concert" endings, inserts or other musical edits to the performance material at hand.

On occasion, digital image processing software (such as Adobe [[Photoshop]]) is used for correcting errata and enhancing print quality of problematic performance materials of public domain musical works. Use of digital technology is becoming common in the task of preparing audition excerpts for the musician recruitment process.,&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative duties ===
In addition to the artistic roles ensemble librarians play within their organizations, many also manage duties that are administrative in nature. The administrative duties of an ensemble librarian differ depending on the type of musical organization for which the librarian works. The ensemble librarian's administrative tasks can range from control of the receipt and delivery of the performance materials to managing invoices and payments and creating an annual budget for the library; support for the program planning on issues related to [[instrumentation (music)]], off-stage music, different versions or editions, correct instrumentation. . .; providing assistance and support to the conductors, musicians, singers, [[choir]], soloists and all professionals involved in concert production; managing the lending of musical materials to other institutions; providing additional notes or information for the printed concert program; coordinating the obtaining of rights for [[performance]], recording or [[broadcast]].&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

== Areas of practice ==

=== Symphony and chamber orchestras ===
Many ensemble librarians work in the field of [[Symphony orchestra|symphony]] and [[chamber orchestra]]s, forming the most typical professional profile of a performance librarian. Performance librarianship in professional symphony and chamber orchestras is characterized by frequently changing programs and a large total number of works performed, reflecting in the large number of performance materials and sets of parts to be prepared. Many full-time, professional, North American symphony orchestras employ two or even three music librarians (typically, a principal librarian and one or more assistant librarians). In Europe, full-sized symphony orchestras operate with fewer resources. For example, The [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and the [[Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra]] all are single-librarian orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=MOLA Member Organizations and Librarians|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/cgi-bin/moladb/membershiplistnew.cgi|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony orchestra librarian is in frequent contact with conductors and soloists to coordinate the editions and versions of works to be used, possible alterations or edits required, and their appropriate implementation. These can include cuts, inserts, supplemental rehearsal markings, transpositions and doublings. The librarian may also be involved in providing information to the orchestra administration for program planning purposes, such as information on the duration and instrumentation of the works in question, and any rental or purchase costs. This is essential information for the symphony orchestra repertoire planning process and the librarian can play an integral role.

=== Opera ===
The complexity of opera [[librarianship]] is due to the diversity and quantity of performance materials required (such as vocal scores, chorus scores, full scores, orchestral parts, off-stage parts), plus the sheer duration of operatic works makes the job a challenge. [[Opera]] productions are often subject to revision; occasionally sections of the music are skipped ("cuts" are made) or otherwise altered, and some excerpts may be [[transposition (music)|transposed]] to a different key to accommodate the vocal range of the soloists. Several [[opera]]s have different musical versions: different historical versions, versions sung in different languages or recent revisions made in [[Historical editions (music)|editions]] of the work. [[Translation]]s and [[transliteration]]s may have to be inserted into the vocal scores, and most often this is organized by the librarian. In addition, as [[opera]] is a scenic art form, some musical considerations can develop due to the [[stage direction]]. Consequently, the [[librarian]] is in charge of implementing the necessary edits into the performance material provided by the opera library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Opera: Friend or Foe|year=2011 (2009)|publisher=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ballet ===
Music in [[ballet]] is often subject to extensive revision, re-ordering and adaptation by the [[choreographer]]. This creates additional and varied duties for the ballet librarian, as opposed to the symphony or opera librarian. The [[choreography]] often requires cuts and sequence changes to the music, and therefore the librarian must be able to make the cuts logical and smooth in a musical sense. Knowledge of standard ballet repertoire and major ballet choreographers is necessary, since there are often several adaptations and arrangements of these works available.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Bands ===
The [[concert band]] or wind ensemble librarian's duties greatly resemble those of an orchestral performance librarian, but certain variations exist. For example, bands do not include the string sections for which orchestral librarians mark bowings into individual parts. A few examples of bands that might employ librarians are [[military band]]s, wind ensembles, [[brass bands]], [[marching band]]s, [[jazz band]]s, ensembles at educational institutions, and popular music groups. The band librarian's work is greatly dependent on the performance venues and number of performances of the band - some military bands may perform in several ceremonies each day, and often a vast body of music must be ready to go on short notice. Marching, military, or brass bands may also perform in parades. In addition, many bands perform concerts on tour.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Educational institutions ===
Many top-level music schools and conservatories employ either professional and/or student ensemble librarians. Professionals often hold staff positions with the institution and job titles can range from “Music Librarian” to “Band Department Administrative Assistant” or “Orchestra Manager.” In addition to performance librarian duties on par with professional organizations, educational institution positions often entail extensive administrative duties for the music department and personnel manager tasks, as well. Librarians in the university setting can oversee not only orchestras, bands, and choirs, but also wind or brass repertoire, conducting, and master classes; placement auditions; chamber music ensembles and more.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro"/&gt;

The work of an academic librarian can vary from that of a professional ensemble's librarian in many ways. For example, university ensembles tend to employ part rotation for educational purposes, whereas professional groups more often have one designated player per part or string seating position. Consequently, librarians at educational institutions must develop different types of part distribution systems than may be used at the professional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the academic librarian may be obligated to coordinate greater circulation of materials to faculty, rotating and guest conductors, student recitals, and community organizations. This can present additional work to mark and re-mark parts each time they are to be used by the primary ensemble.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;  Educational institutions may also provide significantly more practice parts and allow the check-out of parts much earlier by students in order to provide ample practice time, whereas professional musicians may not require this provision for as many of the scheduled works.

=== Music festivals ===
An alternative career or summer opportunity for the ensemble librarian is to work for a music festival, either professional or educational. Such positions are often part-time or seasonal and can afford the ensemble librarian with experience preparing different types of repertoire and working with different types of musicians. Various organizations compile and maintain listings of current classical music festivals, including professional music organizations such as [http://www.americanorchestras.org/ The League of American Orchestras]' publication “[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/symphonyonline/may_jun_2010/#/48 Symphony],” university music departments like [http://precollege.juilliard.edu/pages/festivals_competitions.htm#festivals The Juilliard School], and student organizations such as [[Sigma Alpha Iota]]. [http://www.mola-inc.org MOLA] maintains a listing of summer festival job openings, which is available in PDF format under the “Job Openings” tab.

== Professional organizations ==
For various reasons (such as the limited number of professionals in a particular geographical area, the dynamic scenario of working for a performing arts organization, and the lack of a formal academic degree program in the field), cooperation among professional ensemble librarians is not only helpful, but essential. International and national organizations facilitate the collaboration among ensemble library professionals and offer further opportunities for professional development and training.

The most notable organizations for ensemble librarians are as follows:

[http://www.mola-inc.org Major Orchestra Librarians’ Association] (MOLA): The Major Orchestra Librarians' Association, founded in 1983, is composed of nearly 250 professional performance organizations around the world, represented by more than 400 librarians. MOLA facilitates communication between professional performance librarians, educates and assists them in providing service to their organizations, provides support and resources to the performing arts, and works with publishers to achieve the highest standards in music performance materials for the professional musician. Today, MOLA's membership includes symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, music academies, professional bands and other types of ensembles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=Home page|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.iaml.info International Association of Music Libraries] (IAML): Founded in 1951, the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres has ca. 2,000 individual and institutional members in ca. 45 countries. IAML works to promote international cooperation and to support the interests of the profession. It has national branches in 22 countries, five professional branches, four subject commissions and various working groups, and is responsible for several large-scale documentation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaml.info/what-iaml|title=What is IAML?|last=International Association of Music Libraries|first=|date=27 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the professional ensemble librarian, the [http://www.iaml.info/organization/branches/broadcasting_and_orchestra_libraries#activities Broadcasting and Orchestra Libraries Branch] is the most essential of IAML's professional branches.

== Current issues ==
An ongoing issue in discussion among ensemble or performance librarians is the adequacy of available performance materials, in comparison to today's needs and standards required for professional use. Therefore, challenges arise, such as the deterioration of materials only available on a rental basis, the need to meet the recommended requirements for editing music in terms of format, size, page turns, etc.; the problem of [[erratum|errata]] present in many editions; the delivery of materials in digital format (common in the case of direct distribution from composers to the user), from which the librarian must then create physical parts for performance; the quality of service provided by [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]] and the accessibility of the information they provide; the emergence of [http://www.estand.com/info/ digital music stands] and the associated changes such media may bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnackenberg|first=Karen|title=Send REAL Parts, please!!|url=http://kschnack.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/send-real-parts-please/|work=From the Orchestra Library|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the typical concerns professional ensemble librarians face, another major issue is ensuring compliance with [[copyright]] laws. With the constant evolution of new technology, streaming performances on the Internet and other digital use of recorded music have become reality, and new forms of copyright-related questions therefore arise. For example, the performed work may be in the [[public domain]] where the orchestra originates, but may still be under copyright in some of the geographical areas where, for instance, a webcast may be accessible. The modern ensemble librarian is charged with the duty to self-educate regarding these new technological advances, in order to avoid violation of copyright law and to protect the organization for which they work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11009">A '''background actor''' or  '''extra''' is a [[performer]] in a [[film]], [[television show]], stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging (silent) capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). [[War film]]s and [[epic film]]s often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term "cast of thousands"). Likewise, [[grand opera]] can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.

On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as "atmosphere", "background talent", "background performers", "background artists", "background cast members" or simply "background", while the term "extra" is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tophollywoodactingcoach.com/2012/01/background_actors_extra_atmosphere/ Background Actors, Extras or Atmosphere?] ''tophollywoodactingcoach'' Published by Ross, Mae; 3-2-1 Acting. Accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as "[[supernumeraries]]". In opera and ballet, they are called either "extras" or "supers".

==Casting==
Casting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no [[acting]] experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftbWjFvRMZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=extra+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Rs_Upa2IoTtigK2mYHYBQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=extra%20actor&amp;f=false|title=The Truth About Being an Extra: How to Become a Good Background Actor|author=Jo Kelly|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory ''Contacts'' published annually by [[Spotlight (Casting Services Company)|Spotlight]] lists all accredited agencies and productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/about/extra|title=How to be an Extra|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt; Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. [[stage combat]]), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10557/How-movie-extra.html|title=How to be a movie extra|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific "look", such as "high school students" or "affluent senior citizens", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as [[rollerblading]], or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also "fittings" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a "costume double" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired ''en masse'' with little formality.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

The length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a group of 150 "core background actors" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming.

==Salary and working conditions==
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2010}}

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors [[trade union]]s [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU)]] and [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], and the various commercial trade and production bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectu.org.uk/get-involved/background-artistes |title=Background Artistes |publisher=BECTU |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production.&lt;ref name="EquityRA" /&gt; Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time.&lt;ref name=MMagpie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|title=Make money being a film or TV extra|publisher=Money Magpie|accessdate=1 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730221918/http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|archivedate=30 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment.&lt;ref name="EquityRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equity.org.uk/resource-centre/rates-and-agreements/|title=Rates and Agreements - Members Guide &amp; Pamphlet|publisher=[[Equity (trade union)|Equity]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most major film and television productions used to fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) or [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]].  The two unions have merged into [[SAG-AFTRA]].

SAG-signatory [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|producers]] are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from [[Trade Union|union]]-scale rates to "copy and credit" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job.

Between 1946 and 1992, background actors in film and television were largely represented by the '''Screen Extras Guild.''' SEG was disbanded on 1 June 1992 and transferred its jurisdiction to SAG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_n8_v115/ai_12624085 Television and movie agreement - collective bargaining agreement; Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers], Monthly Labor Review, August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The silent film ''[[The Extra Girl]]'' (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to [[Hollywood]] and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom.

The British television sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively.

In the Hindi [[black comedy]] film ''[[Mithya]]'' (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] lands him in trouble.

The Filipino [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[Ekstra]]'' (''The Bit Player'') (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose [[temporary work|odd job]] as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college.&lt;ref name=ekstravariety&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/global/the-bit-player-review-toronto-1200607975/|title=Toronto Film Review: ‘The Bit Player’|last=Kuipers|first=Richard|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is a [[social commentary]] on the exploitation and mistreatment of the [[marginalized]] sector in the [[television production]] industry in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ekstra blog"&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://said-fred.blogspot.com/2013/07/ekstra-excellent-paradox.html|title=EKSTRA: An Excellent Paradox|last=Hawson|first=Fred|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstraINQ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/59179/ekstra-the-country-in-miniature|title='Ekstra': The country in miniature|last=Jimenez-David|first=Rina|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 19, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstrarev&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://ilusyonaryo.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/a-review-paper-for-ekstra-2013-a-film-by-jeffrey-jeturian/|title=A review paper for Ekstra (2013): A film by Jeffrey Jeturian|&lt;!--author=migibytes--&gt;|website=ilusyonaryo.com|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geodesign includes project conceptualization, analysis, design specification, stakeholder participation and collaboration, design creation, simulation, and evaluation (among other stages). 

==History==
Geodesign builds greatly on a long history of work in [[geographic information science]], [[computer-aided design]], [[landscape architecture]], and other [[environmental design]] fields. See for instance, the work of [[Ian McHarg]] and [[Carl Steinitz]].  

Members of the various disciplines and practices relevant to geodesign have held defining discussions at a workshop on [http://ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/scdg/ Spatial Concepts in GIS and Design] in December 2008 and the [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/ GeoDesign Summit] in January 2010. GeoDesign Summit 2010 Conference Videos from [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-one.html Day 1] and [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-two.html Day 2] are an important resource to learn about the many different aspects of GeoDesign.  ESRI co-founder Jack Dangermond has introduced each of the GeoDesign Summit meetings.  Designer and technologist [[Bran Ferren]], was the keynote speaker for the first and fourth Summit meetings in Redlands, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2013/02/08/a-250-year-plan-for-the-planet/|title=A 250-Year Plan for the Planet {{!}} Esri Insider|website=blogs.esri.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth conference he presented a provocative view of how what is needed is a 250-year plan, and how GeoDesign was a key concept in making this a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Minutes into the Future: An Argument for Taking a Longer View|url=https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2119&amp;title=five-minutes-into-the-future-an-argument-for-taking-a-longer-view|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Steinitz was a presenter at both the 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=esri|title=GeoDesign Summit 2010: Carl Steinitz: Ways of Designing (Part 4 of 4)|date=2010-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmYxTzPnLY|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Esri Events|title=Esri 2015 Geodesign Summit: Experiments in Geodesign Synthesis|date=2017-12-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIeEJoEvuo|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summits.

The 2013 Geodesign Summit drew a record 260 attendees from the United States and abroad ([http://video.esri.com watch video coverage of the summit]). That same year, a master's degree in Geodesign — the first of its kind in the nation — began at [[Philadelphia University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0113/educating-the-next-generation-in-geodesign.html Goldberg, Debbie. Educating the Next Generation in Geodesign ''ArcWatch'', january 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Goetz Phillips, director of Landscape Architecture and GeoDesign at [[Philadelphia University]] says "it is very exciting to be at the forefront of this exciting and relevant paradigm shift in how we address twenty-first-century global to local design and planning issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0313/geodesign-in-motion Wheeler, Carla. Geodesign in Motion ' 'ArcWatch'', march 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The theory underpinning Geodesign derives from the work of [[Patrick Geddes]] in the first half of the twentieth century and [[Ian McHarg]] in its second half. They advocated a layered approach to regional planning, landscape planning and urban planning. McHarg drew the layers on translucent overlays. Through the work of [[Jack Dangermond]], Carl Steinitz, Henk Scholten and others the layers were modeled with  [[Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The three components of this term each say something about its character. 'Geographical' implies that the layers are geographical (geology, soils, hydrology, roads, land use etc.). 'Information' implies  a positivist and scientific methodology. 'System' implies the use of computer technology for the information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific aspects of Geodesign contrast with the cultural emphasis of [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] but the two approaches to landscape planning share a concern for layered analysis &lt;ref&gt;Pe, R. (2012) Hyper-localism and Parametric Mapping for Collaborative Urbanism. ''Digital Landscape Architecture conference, 31 May 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; which sits comfortably with [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[post-postmodernism|post-postmodern]] theory.

==Technologies==
Nascent geodesign technology extends [[geographic information systems]] so that in addition to analyzing existing environments and [[geodata]], users can synthesize new environments and modify geodata.  See, for example, [[CommunityViz]] or [[marinemap]].

"GeoDesign brings geographic analysis into the design process, where initial design sketches are instantly vetted for suitability against myriad database layers describing a variety of physical and social factors for the spatial extent of the project. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving land-use planners, engineers, transportation planners, and others involved with design, the tools to leverage geographic information within their design workflows."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer09articles/gis-designing-our-future.html Dangermond, Jack.

[[File:Wanna live here? It will be a nice price! (8225766410).jpg|thumb|Section of a mural of ''[[tong lau]]'' on [[Graham Street]] by Alex Croft]]

In [[Hong Kong]] there are a few types of graffiti that are utilized for different reasons. The face of artist [[Ai WeiWei]] is one of the more well-known caricatures in the region. Journalist and commentators have considered the graffiti as "street-art", "creative" and the "voice of the young".&lt;ref name="Cheung2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Chi-wai Cheung|title=Media Power in Hong Kong: Hyper-Marketized Media and Cultural Resistance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nSPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|date=12 February 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-26657-0|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti is often a mode of expression much like other artistic outlets. It can allow artists to vent emotions as well as their opinions on the politics or society around them. Unlike other places around the world, Graffiti in Hong Kong can be used as a way of advertisement for some companies.

Similar to other countries however, graffiti is considered defacing public property and is technically an illegal act in Hong Kong. While graffiti is not prosecuted as commonly as in the United States, fines and arrest still do occur.&lt;ref name="vice_IWen"&gt;{{Cite web| title = I Went Bombing with Hong Kong's Biggest Graffiti Writers| author = Mock, Ray| work = Vice| date = 2016-07-17| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9b8kgy/hong-kong-graffiti-tour-xme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of graffiti==
[[Graffiti]] is a term applied to a range of illegally created marks in which there has been an attempt to establish some sort of coherent composition that people could resonate with, or one that conveys messages.  Such marks are made by an individual or individuals, who might not be professional artists, upon a [[wall]] or other surface that is usually visually accessible to the public.

==Different styles of graffiti in Hong Kong==

===Calligraphy graffiti===
[[Tsang Tsou Choi]], also known as the "King of Kowloon", was the founder of [[Hong Kong]] [[calligraphy]] graffiti.  His graffiti work is different from general [[spray painting]]; he used [[ink brush]]es to write [[word]]s on walls instead of spray painting to express his ideas and thoughts towards society. The [[aesthetic]] value of his works of art stirred up much controversy over Hong Kong. Still, most Hong Kong citizens still pay respect and attention to his graffiti, even though he died in 2007.&lt;ref name="scmp_Whyg"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Why graffiti has never taken off in oh-so-law-abiding Hong Kong| author = Sin, Ben | author2 = Westcott, Ben| work = South China Morning Post| date = 2016-06-05| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1962466/why-graffiti-has-never-taken-oh-so-law-abiding-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spray painted graffiti===
Spray painting graffiti is one of the most popular styles adopted by graffiti artists. Hong Kong graffiti artists have a unique sense on where to do graffiti to reflect different aesthetic feelings of their works. For instance, [[drawing]] on [[rust]]y surfaces like iron walls produces a vintage feeling of the work. Drawings on uneven [[stone]] walls gives a strong dimensional sense.

===Ai WeiWei's portrait===
[[Ai WeiWei]], a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[contemporary artist]] and [[activist]], was arrested by [[Beijing]] authorities for "economic crimes" . Ai's [[portrait]] was later painted on walls facing streets in Hong Kong by a teenage girl, who attempted to raise awareness of [[human rights]] and reveal the dark side of the [[Chinese government]]. Ai's portrait was even projected on Wall of the [[People's Liberation Army]] Building via [[laser]].&lt;ref name="reut_Pro-"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Pro-Ai graffiti in Hong Kong sparks warning by Chinese army| last = Staff | first = Reuters| work = Reuters| date = 2011-04-30| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-grafitti-ai/pro-ai-graffiti-in-hong-kong-sparks-warning-by-chinese-army-idUSLNE74101720110502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==
Per [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|basic law]], modifying a [[public property]] without permission is illegal in Hong Kong. On 13 July 2009, a French graffiti artist name Zevs painted a [[Chanel]] [[logo]] on the outside wall of an Armani store in central Hong Kong. He was arrested for his illicit spray-painting and was detained in Hong Kong until August. In 2011, a painted portrait of [[Ai WeiWei]] resulted in an investigation by [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] and the Crime Investigate Detective. Invader, another famous graffiti artist, has been spreading his work in Hong Kong since 2001; he has painted at least 74 [[mosaic]] print tiles on city streets. Most of them have been removed. In 2014, a [[Pac-Man]] print in [[Tin Hau]] also produced by Invader was removed for safety reasons. Such actions have stirred up much disagreement. The public did not agree that tile mosaics on walls would cause any harm and danger to [[society]]. Some news articles and journals criticised the [[Government of Hong Kong|government]] for their actions towards [[street art]]. However, the government continued to take down Invader's work.

Though [[painting]] on public properties without permission is illegal, Hong Kong's government promised to preserve the painted works of King of Kowloon [[Tsang Tsou Choi]], though most have already been cleaned away. The [[wall of fame]] in [[Mong Kok]]'s [[Argyle Street, Hong Kong|Argyle Street]] provides a canvas for Hong Kong graffiti artists.&lt;ref name="hong_Mong"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Mongkok's Graffiti Wall of Fame!| author = | work = Hong Kong Hustle| date = 3 July 2013| accessdate = 2018-03-08| url = https://www.hongkonghustle.com/art-design/7944/hong-kong-graffiti-wall-of-fame-mongkok-bute-luen-wan-street-argyle-alley-kowloon-hk-china-street-art-mk-style-artist-piece/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government seems to have accepted the street as a "graffiti community" even though street artists are violating the law. Paintings extend over the wall for two blocks.

==Purposes of doing graffiti in Hong Kong==
Graffiti in Hong Kong can be divided into three aspects — as an [[emotion]]al outlet, for [[political dissent|political dissatisfaction]], and as [[advertisement]].

===Emotional Outletting===
Graffiti related to emotions can generally be seen in [[tunnel]]s and under bridges, where the public might not easily notice. For instance, spray painted words like "free" or "heart broken" can be seen painted on walls. The reason for such placement is to provide artists with an outlet to [[artistic expression|express]] their personal emotions. Many people express their feelings through writing and talking. However, there are people who aren't good at oral or written [[communication]]. Instead, they are more comfortable with [[drawing]] and [[art]]. Graffiti is an illegal street art, and some people are attracted to the exciting and rebellious feeling of doing illegal things in an attempt to voice their opinions.

===Political dissatisfaction===
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK) (2).jpg|Graffiti on the road (Mong Kok, HK)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Graffiti can also be used to voice [[opinion]]s and dissatisfaction towards [[government authority|authorities]]. For instance, there was graffiti related to "real [[universal suffrage]]" being drawn in [[Admiralty (HK)|Admiralty]] during [[2014 Hong Kong protests|the Occupy Central protests in 2014]]. Individuals voiced their [[anger]] and depression towards both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments through graffiti work. They hoped to make common cause with Hong Kong [[citizen]]s through graffiti art in order to gain more support for universal suffrage. For example,  protesters not only did chalk paint graffiti, but also created a [[mural]] made from thousands of [[Post-it note|Post-It notes]] with citizens' wishes written on each. Couplets with citizens' petitions were also hung on a [[footbridge]].

===Advertisement===
Graffiti can also be used cheaply as a medium to advertise in Hong Kong. It is quite common to see advertisements spray-painted on [[public buildings|public facilities]], [[letter box|mailslots]], [[transformer]] boxes, [[street sign]]s, and so on. Company names and contact data might be written or drawn in an attempt for publication purposes. Such graffiti can be commonly seen in traditional [[Districts of Hong Kong|districts]] such as [[Sham Shui Po]] and [[Kwun Tong]]. It is a style of graffiti unique to Hong Kong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42620">The following is '''a list of unproduced Guillermo del Toro projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his decades-long career, Mexican film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] has worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] and are presumably canceled.

==1990s==

===''The Sandkings''===
Around 1995, before directing ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'', del Toro approached [[George R. R. Martin]] with the intent to make a film adaptation of his famous novelette ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-breaking-bad-game-of-thrones-interview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121042914/http://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-breaking-bad-game-of-thrones-interview/ |archivedate=2016-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was quickly scrapped after the novel was adapted into the first episode of the television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.

===''Domu: A Child's Dream''===
In the late 1990s, del Toro expressed interest in directing a [[Domu: A Child's Dream#Film adaptation|live-action film adaptation]] of [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Domu: A Child's Dream]]''. In 2002, after the success of ''[[Blade II]]'', del Toro said that he tried to make the film in the following years, but his efforts were hamstrung by international legalities. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Goddamn it, we haven't even got the rights. We've been negotiating the rights for four years, which goes to prove Japanese lawyers are even more complex than American lawyers. The moment we have the rights I would go ahead and write it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-27/guillermo-del-toro-on-domu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150426/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-27/guillermo-del-toro-on-domu |archivedate=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2000s==

===''Blade 3''===
In approximately 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] was in talks with del Toro to keep him on as director for ''Blade 3'', due his directing work on ''[[Blade II]]. However, D''el Toro turned down the offer in order to direct ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/hitfix/david-goyer-directing-blade-3-was-the-most-painful-thing-ive-ever-been-through/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182045/http://uproxx.com/hitfix/david-goyer-directing-blade-3-was-the-most-painful-thing-ive-ever-been-through/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blade 3'' film ended up becoming the critically snubbed ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', directed by screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]], and released in 2004.

===''The Wind in the Willows''===
In 2003, del Toro reported that he was working with [[The Walt Disney Company]] on an [[The Wind in the Willows#Film and television|animated film adaptation]] of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The film would have been animated using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animation]], but the project was abandoned following many delays.&lt;ref&gt;http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=15120/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120309/http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=15120%2F |date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''===
In 2003, del Toro was in talks to direct ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', the third installment of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] based on [[J. K. Rowlings]]' [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119031251/http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chose instead to direct ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', and ''The Prisoner of Azkaban'' was directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]].

===''I Am Legend''===
On September 13, 2005, [[Warner Bros.]] approached del Toro and asked him to direct the third film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/features/helmer-takes-on-legend-for-wb-1117929062/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120084856/http://variety.com/2005/film/features/helmer-takes-on-legend-for-wb-1117929062/ |archivedate=2016-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, del Toro chose to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' instead.

On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro stated that the remake would reflect his original vision for the film, and that it had been planned even when the first version was in production. "Even when we produced [[The Orphanage (film)|the Spanish movie]], I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." Del Toro also praised the new film's director. "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'' and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.ie/movies/news/a333542/guillermo-del-toro-orphanage-remake-will-be-different.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Uddin, Zakia|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2012|title=Guillermo del Toro: 'Orphanage remake will be different'}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress [[Amy Adams]] was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film.

He said that he loved the character of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and wished to incorporate more original [[Norse mythology]] into the film; including a "really dingy [[Valhalla]], [with] [[Vikings]] and mud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2012/08/guillermo_del_toro_reveal.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227234716/http://www.blastr.com/2012/08/guillermo_del_toro_reveal.php |archivedate=2017-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, del Toro left the project to direct [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film adaptation.]] ''Thor'' was released in 2011 and directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]].

===''The Hobbit''===
In April 2008, it was reported that del Toro would direct a two-part film adaptation of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Del Toro envisioned the first film as a direct adaptation of the novel, with the second bridging the gap between ''The Hobbit'' and the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films. After spending two years in New Zealand working on pre-production, del Toro left the project due to ongoing delays and was replaced by ''Lord of the Rings'' director [[Peter Jackson]]. The films were expanded to a trilogy during production, and were released as ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' (2012), ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'' (2013), and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' (2014), with del Toro still credited as co-writer of all three.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080730161821/http://www.wetanz.com/holics/index.php?itemid=695&amp;catid=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119142503/http://www.comingsoon.net/horror |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/66472-guillermo-del-toro-confirms-hobbit-delay |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923203942/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/66472-guillermo-del-toro-confirms-hobbit-delay |archivedate=2016-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hellboy III''===
On July 10, 2008, del Toro expressed his interest in directing a third ''[[Hellboy]]'' film, saying that he would work on the film after finishing ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=771034116/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120405/http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=771034116%2F |date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, during the production of the unmade ''At the Mountain of Madness'', del Toro mentioned that he would direct ''Hellboy III'' after his next project, even though the script was not yet written.&lt;ref&gt;http://collider.com/2010/06/25/guillermo-del-toro-interview-the-hobbit-hellboy-3-frankenstein-at-the-mountains-of-madness-saturn-and-the-end-of-days/#more-34233 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206020646/http://www.collider.com/2010/06/25/guillermo-del-toro-interview-the-hobbit-hellboy-3-frankenstein-at-the-mountains-of-madness-saturn-and-the-end-of-days/ |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 8, 2013, del Toro said that the film was unlikely to be released, and suggested the possibility of telling its story in comic book form. ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]] refused to accept the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/hellboy-3-news-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710225239/http://collider.com/hellboy-3-news-guillermo-del-toro/ |archivedate=2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Reddit]] AMA on July 11, 2014, del Toro said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, you know, we don't have that movie on the horizon, but the idea for it was to have Hellboy finally come to terms with the fact that his destiny, his inevitable destiny, is to become the beast of the Apocalypse, and having him and Liz face the sort of, that part of his nature, and he has to do it, in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the 3rd film. He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time, he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/ciuvi56/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525050751/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/ciuvi56 |archivedate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Drood''===
On June 1, 2010, [[MTV News]] reported that del Toro was set to direct a film adaptation of ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]],'' a novel by [[Dan Simmons]], for [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2436584/guillermo-del-toro-leaves-the-hobbit-so-whats-next-for-the-director/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119181927/http://www.mtv.com/news/2436584/guillermo-del-toro-leaves-the-hobbit-so-whats-next-for-the-director/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project fell into [[development hell]] and del Toro abandoned it.

===Untitled [[Van Helsing]] project===
On June 10, 2010, del Toro stated that he was working on an untitled film about [[Van Helsing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/2010/06/10/guillermo-del-toro-writingproducing-new-van-helsing-film/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233857/http://thefilmstage.com/2010/06/10/guillermo-del-toro-writingproducing-new-van-helsing-film/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there have been no updates on the film since 2010.

===''At the Mountains of Madness''===
On July 28, 2010, del Toro announced that he would direct a film adaptation of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]], with Canadian film director [[James Cameron]] as producer. The movie was originally set up as a [[DreamWorks]] project in 2004, but was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671 |title=Cameron to Produce Del Toro's 'Madness' for Universal |work=TheWrap |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801174443/http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671 |archivedate=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron suggested casting [[Tom Cruise]] in the lead role and releasing the film in [[3D film|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/unproduced-and-unfinished-films-a-ongoing-film-comment-project/|title=Unproduced and Unfinished Films: An Ongoing Film Comment project - Film Comment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, del Toro said that the adaptation probably would not happen at all. He stated, "It doesn't look like I can do it. It's very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it's tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/next-guillermo-del-toro/|title=What Next For Guillermo Del Toro?|last=Williams|first=Owen|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron and Del Toro put forward the idea to Universal, who greenlit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=James Cameron Talks 9 Minutes of AVATAR Re-Release Footage, Shooting the Sequels Back to Back, 3D Conversions, and AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS |work=Collider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814124924/http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro |archivedate=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that same year, del Toro had also asked [[S.

'''''Hibiscus Town''''' ({{zh|t=芙蓉鎮|s=芙蓉镇|p=Fúróng zhèn|}}) is a 1986 Chinese film directed by [[Xie Jin]], based on a novel by the same name written by [[Gu Hua]]. The film, a [[melodrama]], follows the life and travails of a young woman who lives through the turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and as such is an example of the "scar drama" genre that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s that detailed life during that period. The film was produced by the [[Shanghai Film Studio]].

The film won Best Film for 1987 [[Golden Rooster Awards]] and [[Hundred Flowers Awards]], as well as Best Actress awards for [[Liu Xiaoqing]] at both ceremonies. It was also selected as the Chinese entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[60th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

The village in [[Hunan]] province where the film was made, was initially known as Wang Village ({{lang|zh|王村}}; [[pinyin]]: ''Wáng cūn''). In 2007, the village was renamed Furong zhen ({{lang|zh|芙蓉镇}}) owing to this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh}} http://you.ctrip.com/sight/xiangxi496/17371.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
* [[Liu Xiaoqing]] as Hu Yuyin, the film's heroine, a young woman who is caught up in the political turmoil of China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. She originally sells rice [[beancurd]] with her husband.
* [[Liu Linian]] as Li Guigui, Yuyin's first husband
* [[Jiang Wen]] as Qin Shutian, a "bourgeoisie" rightist who falls in love with Yuyin
* [[Zheng Zaishi]] as Gu Yanshan, the granary director
* [[Zhu Shibin]] as Wang Qiushe
* [[Xu Songzi]] as Li Guoxiang 
* [[Zhang Guangbei]] as Li Mangeng

==Plot==
The film follows Hu Yuyin (Liu Xiaoqing), a young and hardworking woman in a small Chinese town on the eve of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. She is happily married and runs a successful roadside food stall selling spicy [[beancurd]]. Yuyin is supported by Party members Li Mangeng (Zhang Guangbei), who once wanted to marry her, and Director Gu (Zheng Zaishi), a war veteran in charge of the granary. But in 1964 the [[Four Cleanups Movement]] sends a Party work-team to root out Rightists and [[capitalist roader]]s. The team is led by Li Guoxiang (Xu Songzi), a single woman, assisted by Wang Qiushe (Zhu Shibin), a former poor peasant who has lost his land because of his drinking. At a public [[struggle session]], Yuyin is declared to be a "new rich peasant." Both her home and business are taken from her and her husband, Li Guigui (Liu Linian) is executed for trying to kill Li Guoxiang.

After the first waves of the Revolution have ended, Yuyin, now relegated to a lowly street sweeper, returns to the town. She then falls in love with Qin Shutian ([[Jiang Wen]]), who had come in the 1950s to collect local folksongs but was declared to be one of the [[Five Black Categories]]. When Yuyin becomes pregnant, however, this loving relationship attracts the outrage of Li Guoxiang and Wang Qiushe, who themselves are having a secret affair. Shutian is sent to [[reform through labor]] and it is not until [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s reforms in 1978 that his case is reviewed and he is allowed to return and help Yuyin re-establish their food stall. At the end of the film, Li Guoxiang continues to hold a position in the bureaucracy while Wang Qiushe loses his mind.

==Reception==
The film was very well received domestically and was voted by Chinese film audiences as one of the three best films of 1987. It remains however quite obscure outside China.

[[Gilbert Adair]] of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine gave the film his endorsement, calling it "a potent blend of the political and personal":

:"Xie's portrait of China's traumatic, turbulent history ranges from '63 to the post-'[[Gang of Four]]' years, his palette the changing fortunes of an entangled group of individuals. It's impressive both for the elegant precision with which the director fills his scope frame with small, significant details, and for the discreet understatement that controls his own special brand of epic melodrama. In some ways similar to the classic romances of [[Frank Borzage]], ''Hibiscus Town'' is a moving account of survival in the face of widespread social and political madness, told with clarity, compassion and insight."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeout.com/london/film/hibiscus-town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Indigenous Futurisms''' is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities. 

Like [[Afrofuturism]], Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzmán|first1=Alicia Inez|title=Indigenous Futurisms|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/indigenous-futurisms/|website=InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Grace Dillon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaertner|first1=David|title=“WHAT’S A STORY LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?”: CYBERSPACE AND INDIGENOUS FUTURISM|url=https://novelalliances.com/2015/03/23/whats-a-story-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this-cyberspace-and-indigenous-futurism-in-neal-stephensons-snow-crash/#_ftn1|website=Novel Alliances: Allied Perspectives on Literature, Art and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Dillon|url=https://www.pdx.edu/nas/grace-l-dillon-2|website=Portland State University|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-space-ndns-star-map/|title=The Space NDN’s Star Map|last=Cornum|first=Lou Catherine|date=January 26, 2015|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5214">The '''International Federation of Landscape Architects''' ('''IFLA''') is an organisation which represents the [[landscape architecture|landscape architectural]] profession globally.  It aims to provide leadership and networks to support the development of the profession and its effective participation in the realization of attractive, equitable and sustainable environments.  IFLA currently represents 76 member associations from Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, and a newly emerging region in the Middle East. The Federation's mission is to create globally sustainable and balanced living environments for the benefit of humanity worldwide.

Through its Member Associations, IFLA officially represents approximately 25,000 landscape architects across the world – the actual number of landscape architects is estimated to be about three times that.

IFLA has 11 aims:
# To increase respect for the profession through the high esteem in which the Federation is held by international and regional organisations including various United Nations Agencies.
# To provide access to decision-making authorities and processes at international level that have global implications for landscape architecture
# To represent and promote the profession to international authorities, governments, NGO’s and the general public.
# To provide a platform for the exchange of knowledge and expertise.
# To offer powerful institutional support to fight legislative threats to the integrity of the profession.
# To provide a global platform for educational and professional opportunities.
# To serve as a repository of information concerning landscape architecture, its heritage and capacities.
# To grant access to projects which provide value to landscape architects at every stage of their career such as the Global Professional Standards Survey, Student Design Competition, Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe Award.
# To raise the profile of the profession worldwide by supporting the development of new member associations and regions.
# To provide access to international thought leaders demonstrating the capacity of landscape to meet global challenges such as water and food security, climate change, conflict, migration and depletion of natural resources.
# To provide a global platform for engaging landscape architects (and those from related industries) in improving the conditions, aims and context of the profession long-term.
The governing body of IFLA is its World Council which comprises officers of the Executive Committee and the duly appointed delegates of the member associations which have been admitted to IFLA as members.

The [http://iflaonline.org/about/structure-governance/executive-committee/ IFLA Executive Committee] develops and implements an action plan which realises three key strategic pillars of i) raising the profile of the profession; ii) building advocacy and; iii) providing member services that serve anyone connected to landscape architecture. IFLA's work is primarily delivered through projects, a matrix of working groups and collaboration with national, regional and international partners.

==History==
IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Presently IFLA's Headquarters are in Brussels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13582">[[File:Jean-Pierre Ponnelle Strasbourg 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]]
'''Jean-Pierre Ponnelle''' (19 February 1932 – 11 August 1988) was a French opera [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenographer]] and [[costume designer]].

==Biography==
Ponnelle was born in Paris. He studied philosophy, art, and history there and, in 1952, began his career in Germany as a theatre designer for [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s opera ''[[Boulevard Solitude]]''. He was greatly influenced by the work of art director [[Georges Wakhévitch]] who also designed sets and costumes for the theatre, the ballet, and the opera.

In 1962, Ponnelle directed his first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in [[Düsseldorf]]. His production of that opera at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1981 was widely praised as one of the most aesthetically beautiful in its history.

His work throughout the world included stage productions at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[San Francisco Opera]]; productions for television (a ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' in 1974 notable for performances by [[Mirella Freni]] and the young [[Plácido Domingo]]); and filmed versions of operas such as the well-known [[Karl Böhm]]-conducted ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. His 1969 production of [[Mozart]]'s then neglected ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'' for [[Cologne]] helped re-establish this work in the repertory. Ponnelle also was a frequent guest at the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/dieinstitution/geschichte/  Salzbug Festival website (in English)] Retrieved 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, his productions were controversial. His 1986 ''[[Aida]]'' at [[Covent Garden]], in which he replaced the usual ballet dancers with young boys, was soundly booed and never revived, though his earlier ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' at the same theatre had been a triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, ''San Francisco Chronicle'': "Welcome as it may be to find Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's infamous 1975 Eurotrash production of the work, presented as "The Steersman's Dream", (which held the War Memorial stage for three of the company's five presentations of the piece) banished, presumably forever, it can still be a strain to discern ''Dutchman''.&lt;/ref&gt; as were his interpretations of well-known works.
&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Andrew, ''The Times'': "Only in recent years have directors taken it upon themselves to rewrite Wagner's stage actions, to intervene, to move from simplification to new invention. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's idea at Bayreuth, in 1981, was that Isolde should not appear in Act Three but be an off-stage voice sounding in Tristan's mind"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatfield-Taylor, p. 63: "Some critics felt that there was...perversity in Ponnelle's conception of ''(Rigoletto)'' as a flashback that begins with Gilda already dead, lying on the floor during the Prelude".&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Munich]], Germany in 1988 of a [[pulmonary embolism]] following a tragic fall into the orchestra pit during rehearsals for a production of ''Carmen'' with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Zubin Mehta]]. His son is the orchestra conductor [[Pierre-Dominique Ponnelle]] and his nephew is [[Jean Pierre Danel]].

'''KWANPEN''' is a [[Singapore]]-based manufacturer and retailer specializing in [[crocodile]] [[leather]] goods.

==History==
The company was founded by Kwan Pen Seng in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-brand-carves-niche-luxury-market-20110417-153809-448.html |title=Singapore brand carves niche in luxury market - Yahoo News Singapore |publisher=Sg.news.yahoo.com |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started out in the leatherworking industry by offering restoration services for leather handbags owned by the wives of British officers and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin |first=Andrea |url=http://is.asia-city.com/city-living/article/made-singapore |title=Made in Singapore &amp;#124; SG Magazine Online |publisher=Is.asia-city.com |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the founder to start his trade in manufacturing crocodile leather bags from his home-based workshop. Kwanpen gradually expanded in mid-1970s to include contract work from top Western labels and the first Kwanpen retail shop opened on [[Orchard Road]] in 1976. In 1980, Mr Leonard Kwan, current president of the company, took over the business from his father and the brand’s logo, inspired by the family’s first name, was created in 1989. The first Kwanpen overseas retail outlet was opened in [[Hong Kong]] in 1999. Since then, Kwanpen has expanded its reach internationally to countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Korea]] and [[Hong Kong]] and also operate at department store standalone counters in [[Bangkok]], [[Seoul]] and [[Busan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwanpen.com/boutiques/ |title=Boutiques |publisher=Kwanpen |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getsingapore.sg/brands/kwanpen/locations/ |title=GET SINGAPORE - KWANPEN - Bags of quality and craftsmanship |publisher=Getsingapore.sg |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
All Kwanpen bags are still manufactured in Singapore using the center belly-cut crocodile leather where most of the manufacturing is done manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwanpen.com/kwanpen/handmade/ |title=Handmade |publisher=Kwanpen |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main collections in the Kwanpen lineup are the ''Raffles'', ''Droplet'', ''Signature'' and ''Classic'' collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwanpen.com/category/women/handbags/ |title=Women's Handbags |publisher=Kwanpen |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Raffles'' handbag was launched in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwanpen.com/showcase_item/3568-raffles-1819/?stayincat=11 |title=Raffles 1819 Handbag |publisher=Kwanpen |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the oldest design still in production is the Lady’s ''Classic'' handbag first created in 1983.

===Conservation===
The company, who has been a member of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and Natural Resources/ Crocodile Specialist Group since 1985, only buys crocodile skin that comes with certification from [[CITES]]. All goods produced and exported by Kwanpen are accompanied with this certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalblue.com/destinations/singapore/kwanpen-singapore/ |title=Kwanpen Singapore |publisher=Global Blue |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Assemblée des six-comtés painting.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Assembly of the Six Counties'', 1890, by Charles Alexander Smith.]]

'''''L'Assemblée des six-comtés''''' (French for "The Assembly of the Six Counties"), also known as '''''Manifestation des Canadiens contre le gouvernement anglais, à Saint-Charles, en 1837''''' ("Demonstration of the [[Canadien]]s against the English government, at Saint-Charles, in 1837"), is a large [[oil painting]] executed on [[canvas]] by [[Ontario]] artist [[Charles Alexander Smith]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mnba.qc.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=1702&amp;langue=en « Je me souviens ». When Art Imagines History]", in mnba.qc.ca, retrieved Sept. 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts the [[Assembly of the Six Counties]], an event in 1837, part of the [[history of Quebec]] and the [[Patriote movement]]. It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] in [[Quebec City]].

==Composition==
The picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time. It features a number of Patriote leaders, upon the stage at the right, with accurate appearance. Patriote leader [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] is shown in a speech to the crowd. At the bottom right stand three flags. From the left, [[Flag of France|the first]] represents the influence the Patriotes received from the [[French Revolution]], the second is the [[Patriote flag]] and [[Flag of the United States|the third]] embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the [[American Revolution]]. The Patriote flag remains a visual [[leitmotiv]] across the composition.

The right field profusely displays [[maple leaves]], a symbol of the [[French Canadian]]s of the time (they have now been discarded by their modern-day [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] and [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] successors because of their appropriation by the [[Canada|Canadian federation]]). In the same section is the [[Coat of arms of Quebec]], leaning upon the wooden stage structure (one [[anachronism|anachronistic]] detail, as this version, contemporary to the painting's execution, is the first arms of Quebec post-Confederation, granted in 1868).

The crowd, mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineau's much celebrated oratory skills, holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans. Many in attendance wear the [[tuque]]s and [[Ceinture fléchée|ceintures fléchées]] belts characteristic of the Patriote [[symbology]]. The [[Colonne de la liberté (Quebec)|Colonne de la liberté]] stands tall in the background (the one from [[Henri Julien]]'s [[:Image:Colonne de la liberte (Quebec).png|illustration]] and the contemporary replica appear much shorter). Finally, a very young girl at the immediate left-of-the-middle evocatively stares at the spectator.

==History==
Smith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament of Quebec City]]. However, the government of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville]] did not accept it, and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec collection.

Located in Room 10, it is a part of the permanent exhibition of [[Quebec history|Quebec history-related]] art called ''Je me souviens&amp;nbsp;: Quand l’art imagine l’histoire'' ("[[Je me souviens]] [motto of Quebec]. When Art Imagines History"). The picture has seen [[art conservation and restoration|restoration]]. Nowadays, a great number of books related to the Patriotes, or their era in Quebec, use the painting, often cropped, to illustrate their cover page.

In a similar fashion, initial plans to erect a statue in honour of Louis-Joseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the then-controversial aspect of what was seen as a [[revolutionary]] figure. A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s.

==Subject==
{{main|Assembly of the Six Counties}}
The Assembly of the Six Counties gathered [[Patriote]] leaders and approximately 4,000 followers in [[Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Quebec|Saint-Charles]], [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) on October 23 and October 24, 1837. Presided by [[Wolfred Nelson]], it is the most famous of [[Patriote popular assemblies|the various popular assemblies]] held during that year protesting the [[Russell Resolutions]]. It was a prelude to the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic. Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government, but, as one part supported economic [[boycott]]s of British products, the other appealed to an armed uprising.

'''''Little White Duck: A Childhood in China''''' is a 2012 [[children's book]] written by Na Liu and illustrated by her husband, Andrés Vera Martínez;&lt;ref name=Holmbergp95&gt;{{cite web|author=Holmberg, Ryan|url=http://yishu-online.com/wp-content/uploads/mm-products/uploads/2013_v12_01_holmberg_r_p095.pdf|title=Li Kunwu: A Chinese Life|work=[[Yishu: Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art]]|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95-105 (cited: p. 95)|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Graphic Universe]] is its publisher. It discusses Na Liu's childhood in China during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite web|author=Bird, Elizabeth|url=http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/2012/09/04/review-of-the-day-little-white-duck-by-na-liu/|title=Review of the Day: Little White Duck by Na Liu|publisher=''[[School Library Journal]]''|date=2012-09-04|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Na Liu, who grew up in [[Wuhan]],&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/andres-vera-martinez/little-white-duck-childhood-china/|title=LITTLE WHITE DUCK|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=2012-04-25|accessdate=2018-11-29}} - Print date: September 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is an oncologist and hematologist.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7613-8115-0|title=Little White Duck: A Childhood in China |publisher=''[[Publisher's Weekly]]''|date=2012-06-04|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband is from [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

Ryan Holmberg stated in an article for ''[[Yishu: Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art]]'' that ''Little White Duck'' is "primarily a book designed to sensitize American children today to the poverty a distant, now-wealthy country experienced only a generation ago."&lt;ref name=Holmbergp96&gt;{{cite web|author=Holmberg, Ryan|url=http://yishu-online.com/wp-content/uploads/mm-products/uploads/2013_v12_01_holmberg_r_p095.pdf|title=Li Kunwu: A Chinese Life|work=[[Yishu: Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art]]|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95-105 (cited: p. 96)|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmberg stated that therefore the Communist ideology present in China at the time is not the primary theme of the book.&lt;ref name=Holmbergp96/&gt;

==Story and contents==
The book's story is in eight parts. The book includes Na Liu's reaction to the death of [[Mao Zedong]]. Elizabeth Bird, an [[Evanston Public Library]] Collection Development Manager and a previous [[New York Public Library]] materials specialist, stated how Na Liu cries since the other persons around her are also crying is "very realistic".&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt; 

The book includes supplementary materials, such as maps, translations of [[hanzi]], a glossary, and a timeline of Chinese history.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Reception==
Bird gave a favorable review to the book in an article for the ''[[School Library Journal]]''. Bird cited how it "simply tells a true story about some of the people who were helped by Mao’s rule" and has "universal stories from her youth that anybody can enjoy", even though it was one of several works around the [[Cultural Revolution]], a common theme in children's books about China available in the United States, and used that particular setting.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt; Bird stated that a coworker who grew up in China in the same period confirmed to her that the book's details were authentic.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

''[[Publisher's Weekly]]'' stated described Na Liu as a "storyteller whose words are enlivened by Martinez’s enthusiastic and energetic art, and their respective tones complement each other fluidly."&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] stated that the book is "Beautifully drawn and quietly evocative."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Appearances==

===In films===
In the original ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', Nancy is a 16-year-old girl who has begun experiencing nightmares about a mysterious, [[Freddy Krueger|disfigured man]] in a red and green sweater. The man has "knives for fingers", which he scrapes along objects in the dream. She learns that her friend Tina is having similar nightmares; Tina is murdered in her sleep later that night. Tina's boyfriend Rod tells Nancy that he saw four "invisible" razors cutting her at the same time, a revelation which convinces her that the man from her dreams is connected to the murder. Nancy begins relying on [[caffeine]] to stay awake, and eventually discovers that she can pull things out of her dream after she takes the killer's hat, labelled "Fred Krueger". Her mother explains that Krueger was a child killer who was burned to death by vengeful parents after being freed from prison on a technicality. Nancy becomes convinced that he is exacting his revenge on the children of his killers from beyond the grave. Being tormented by Krueger every time she fall asleep causes a tremendous stress to Nancy that her hair went prematurely grey. With all of her friends dead, Nancy forms a plan to face Krueger alone and pull him into the real world, where he falls victim to a series of [[booby trap]]s she has set up. Nancy finally defeats Krueger by taking back the energy she has given him and stripping away his power.&lt;ref name="N1 film"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Wes Craven]] (Director)|title=[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]|medium=DVD|location=[[United States]]|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nancy does not appear in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'', she maintains a presence when a new family moves into the house where she battled Freddy Krueger. Teenager Jesse Walsh, who inhabits Nancy's old room, and his girlfriend Lisa discover Nancy's old diary—which chronicles the events of the first film. It tells them of the murders of Nancy's friends, and also reveals Krueger's strengths and weaknesses. This helps Jesse and Lisa conquer Freddy in their own struggle with him.&lt;ref name="N2 film"&gt;{{cite video|people=Jack Sholder (Director)|title=[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=New Line Cinema|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', at age 22, Nancy is re-introduced as the new intern at Westin Hills Mental Institution, where she meets the last surviving children of the parents who killed Freddy Krueger. When she realizes the children are falling victim to Freddy, Nancy begs that they be prescribed Hypnocil, an experimental drug, which she has been using to suppress her dreams, in an effort to protect the teenagers from Freddy. In a therapy session, Nancy uses hypnosis to put everybody to sleep and teach them how to use their "dream powers" to their advantage. However, she and Dr Neil Gordon are fired when Hypnocil is blamed for a patient falling into a coma. Neil and Nancy learn that in order to defeat Freddy they must lay his bones to rest; Nancy contacts her father, Donald Thompson, to find out what the town's parents did with Freddy's remains. As Neil and Donald go to bury Freddy's bones, Nancy returns to Westin Hills and rejoins the patients in the dream world, where they use their dream powers against Freddy. Freddy tricks Nancy when he appears to her as Donald, and stabs her in the abdomen with his clawed glove. After rising a final time to stab Freddy with his own glove before he can kill Kristen, Nancy dies, and Krueger disappears as Neil covers Freddy's remains in [[holy water]] and a [[crucifix]], and buries them. Kristen then states that she intends to place Nancy into a "beautiful dream."&lt;ref name="N3 film"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Chuck Russell]] (Director)|title=[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=New Line Cinema|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy's tombstone is seen briefly in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]''.&lt;ref name="N4 film"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Renny Harlin]] (Director)|title=[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]|medium=DVD|location=United States|publisher=New Line Cinema|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some extent Nancy reappears in ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]''. The story, which is set in the "[[Metafiction|real world]]", focuses on actress Heather Langenkamp being stalked by a malevolent entity. Over the course of the film, Heather learns from Wes Craven that the entity was locked in Freddy Krueger's character throughout the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series. With the film series being ended after ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' the entity has been set free, and wants to cross over into the real world in the form of Freddy Krueger. It views Heather as an enemy, seeing her as Nancy, who originally defeated him. In times, like Nancy, Heather's hair also went prematurely grey under the stress by Krueger's attacks. In order to battle the entity, who has kidnapped her son Dylan, Heather enters the dream world, where she traps him in a furnace and seemingly destroys him. However, it is referred by Krueger's creator that the entity is imprisoned to the film franchise's make-believe world once more.&lt;ref name="N7 film"&gt;{{cite video|people=Wes Craven (Director)|title=[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]|medium=DVD|location=[United States|publisher=New Line Cinema|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though she only appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', she maintains somewhat of a presence: her former home is now occupied by [[Lori Campbell]].

Nancy appears in the documentary film ''[[The Nightmare (2015 American film)|The Nightmare]]'' (2015).

====Nancy Holbrook====
[[File:Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Rooney Mara]] as Nancy Holbrook in the remake ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (2010).]]
In the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|2010 remake]], Nancy's last name is changed to "Holbrook", portrayed by [[Rooney Mara]]. In this film, she is portrayed as a socially unavailable outcast who loves art. Quentin Smith ([[Kyle Gallner]]), another high school outcast, crushes on her, and tries hard constantly to hit on her, but ends up failing. However, she does take partnership with him as they try to investigate the deaths of their three friends: Dean Russell ([[Kellan Lutz]]), Kris Fowles ([[Katie Cassidy]]), and Jesse Braun ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), all of which died in their sleep, and both claiming to see a man matching the same description: a burnt face. When they discover that both she, Quentin, Kris, Jesse, and Dean all went to preschool together when they were little, they don't understand, seeing how they didn't know each other until high school. When Nancy's mother Gwen ([[Connie Britton]]) catches the both of them, she finally admits that as children, they and all the kids in the preschool were molested by a man named [[Freddy Krueger|Fred Krueger]], the school gardener who resided in the preschool's basement. She claims that Freddy fled the area before they could turn him in, and that their dreams of Freddy are just [[repressed memories]]. However, when Quentin learns the truth through one of Freddy's dreams when he falls asleep in swim class, they both confront Quentin's father Alan ([[Clancy Brown]]) for killing Freddy when the parents had chased him down, and Alan through a fire-lit gasoline gallon into a shed where Freddy hid, despite not there being any evidence that he was molesting them. Alan admits regret for his actions, but also defends them, saying they were only trying to protect them. Quentin storms out in anger, as a guilt-stricken Alan instructs Nancy to never reveal to anyone who Freddy was. Still unable to understand, Nancy and Quentin decide to go to the preschool to find answers, and when they arrive, it is revealed that Freddy was in fact molesting the children when they discover pictures of Nancy as a child (though never shown only implied). With their memories back, they realize that Freddy isn't after them because they lied about him, but because they told the truth about him. When Nancy sees a piece of Freddy's sweater she pulled out from a dream sequence before, she realizes that Freddy needs to be pulled into the real world to be defeated. When she does, she defeats Freddy by slicing off his clawed hand with a broken paper cutter blade, and finishes the job by slicing his throat. They burn down the preschool with Freddy's corpse inside, and she and Quentin escape, with Quentin hospitalized. Nancy also reciprocates Quentin's feelings for her. Nancy returns home, and thanks her mother for trying to protect her, but Freddy appears in a mirror behind Gwen. He kills her, and drags her body into the mirror, with Nancy screaming.

===In literature===
Nancy's spirit appears in the story "Asleep at the Wheel" from the 1991 short stories collection ''The Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams'', appearing in the dreams of the character Ian to warn him that Freddy is real and not just an urban legend or the result of [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref name = "SevenSweetestDreams"&gt;{{cite book|last = Greenberg|first = Martin|title = Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams|publisher = St. Martin's Press|date = October 1991|isbn = 0-312-92585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy returned in ''Nightmares on Elm Street'', a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] six-issue comic book series published by Innovation Comics from 1991 to 1992.  In the story, Nancy teams up with several other characters from the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|film series]], including Neil Gordon, Jacob Johnson and [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Alice Johnson|Alice Johnson]], to fight Freddy in his nightmare world. The events of this series were meant to fill in the time period between the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' films. The series was written by Andy Mangels. The first two issues of the story explain to the readers about Nancy's life in between parts one and three. After the events of part one, Nancy had been sent to an institution by her father until she was "rational" again. Around the time she was in college after she was released, her father sold 1428 Elm Street to the Walsh family in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge|Freddy's Revenge]]''. In college, she studied psychology and sleep disorders, and made two friends in her roommates Cybil Houch and Priscilla Martin. After Nancy was fatally wounded by Freddy at the end of part three, Kristen had dreamed her soul into the Beautiful Dream, the good side of the dream world, where Nancy now acts as its agent as Freddy acts as an agent for the nightmare realm. In the story, Freddy begins targeting Cybil and Priscilla in an attempt to get to Nancy. He actually succeeds in killing Priscilla and Cybil's husband, James, before Nancy rescues Cybil. She is then reunited with Neil Gordon and the three of them realize that it might be impossible to fully destroy Freddy since he is pure evil, but it is possible to weaken him. Freddy is stopped and weakened by the dream-selves of unborn children, such as Cybil's unborn daughter, in a realm in the Beautiful Dream. The next four issues, titled ''Loose Ends'', deals with the characters from previous ''Nightmare'' movies teaming up to defeat Freddy again. Here, Nancy is reunited with the soul of her father, who Freddy uses to try to kill her but is unsuccessful. Nancy defeats Freddy and manages to stop his plan of using Jacob Johnson to break into the real world with help from Neil Gordon and [[Devonne (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Devonne]], a psychotic former accomplice of Freddy's.

Nancy makes an appearance in the final issue of the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] comic series ''[[Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors]]''. In a battle against Freddy Krueger, Dream Master [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Jacob Johnson|Jacob Johnson]] summons the spirits of Freddy's past victims, including [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Amanda Krueger|Amanda Krueger]] and the Dream Warriors.  Nancy also appears, reuniting with Neil Gordon to help him read the ''[[Necronomicon]]''s' passages needed to banish Freddy.  With Freddy defeated, Nancy leaves Neil and returns to the afterlife with the other spirits.&lt;ref name = "NightmareWarriors"&gt;{{Cite comic |Writer = Jeff Katz and James Kuhoric|Penciller = Jason Craig|Title = Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors|Issue = 1-6|Date = 2009|Publisher = Wildstorm Starring: Robert Eugland and Heather Langenkamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In video games ===
In her debut game appearance, Nancy is a playable character in the 1989 ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' video game. Released by Monarch Software and Westwood Associates, Nancy and the Dream Warriors are on a quest to stop Freddy Krueger. As each character has a dream power, Nancy has the ability to freeze enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/freddy-pcgame/|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's Forgotten PC Game|last=|first=|date=|website=I-Mockery|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not playable, Nancy makes a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in Freddy's ending in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (2011). Nancy is mentioned in Quentin Smith's biography in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'': 
:"When he heard that Nancy’s mother had disappeared, Quentin Smith knew instantly that their success had been short-lived. Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again. But Quentin wasn’t about to give up. It may take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow they would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn’t, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost..."
Nancy was originally meant to be a playable survivor but the developers couldn't obtain the rights to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadbydaylight.com/manual/lore/|title=Dead by Daylight - Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=Dead by Daylight|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024203543/http://www.deadbydaylight.com/manual/lore/|archive-date=2017-10-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=November 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In merchandise===
Nancy Thompson is the only character featured in several ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' merchandise. Kristen Parker is only featured in Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (a diorama released by Mezco Toys in 2007). Debbie, in mid-transformation as a cockroach, is featured as a Cinema of Fear 4 action figure (released by Mezco Toys in 2009).

In 2008, Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 released a Nancy Thompson [[action figure]]—which recreates the famous bathtub scene in the original film. Within the same year, the Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 also released the diorama Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street. The diorama recreates the bedroom scene in which Freddy creeps along the wall above a sleeping Nancy. McFarlane Pop Culture Masterworks released an ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-D'' poster, with Nancy featured prominently as the central figure. In 2002, NECA released an A Nightmare on Elm Street Snowglobe. The female within the globe resembles Nancy, with a stalking Freddy Krueger forming the globe's outside base. However, the product information never confirms if it is actually the character. In 2004, NECA also released a [[lunchbox]] and thermos set with the poster image from A Nightmare on Elm Street.

Since May 2011, there has been an online petition for manufacturers to create a Nancy Thompson doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Petition-for-a-Nancy-Thompson-doll/135902366426339|title=Petition for a Nancy Thompson Doll (Facebook)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=February 19, 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In fan films ===
Although not considered a part of the official film canon, Nancy Thompson has appeared in various fan films:
* ''Krueger (A Tale from Elm Street)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1tAaLZo9w&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLII0IHAsOo5GAjIw-pF2Wuq7eDEQPC8y8|title=KRUEGER (A Tale from Elm Street)|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011; Blinky Productions): The film takes place during Lieutenant Donald Thompson's interrogation of Freddy Krueger. During the course of the interrogation, Donald shows a picture of his daughter Nancy in order to gain a confession from Freddy. She would figure into the events of future fan films produced by the same production company. In ''Krueger (A Walk Through Elm Street)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=blinky500|title=KRUEGER (A Walk Through Elm Street)|date=2014-01-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqJvLMz8Uxk|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddy interacts with Marge Thompson who is pregnant with Nancy.

Donald Thompson (prior to his becoming a lieutenant) and Nancy Thompson make cameos in the film. 
* ''Don't Fall Asleep: The Film''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=3 Count &amp; Go|title=Don't Fall Asleep : The Film|date=2016-09-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM98xWLARPc&amp;t=487s|accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016; Produced by 3 Count &amp; Go): Taking place between ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'', Nancy Thompson (played by Diandra Lazor) is struggling to maintain her sanity after she is checked into a psychiatric ward. The film includes narration from Heather Langenkamp. There are brief appearances by the canon characters Donald Thompson and Alice Johnson. The characters Cybil Houch and Priscilla Martin from the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (comics)|Nightmares on Elm Street]]'' six-issue comic book series (published by Innovation Comics in 1991) also make brief appearances.
*''Before the Nightmare''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Occult Classic|title=BEFORE THE NIGHTMARES (Fan-made Elm Street Prequel)|date=2017-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsHDr-qO4Ug|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2017; Produced by Occult Classic): Taking place before ''A Nightmare on Elm Street,'' Donald Thompson (prior to his becoming a lieutenant) has a greater incentive to catch Freddy Krueger, as the "Springwood Slasher" has set his sights on an elementary school-aged Nancy Thompson.

==Conception==

In Wes Craven's original script for ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', Nancy Thompson was initially named Nancy Wilson. In the scene in which Tina, Nancy, and Glen are at Tina's house, Nancy describes a dream in which Freddy Krueger leered at her obscenely. Soon afterwards, when conversing with Glen, Nancy shows an earlier interest (at least when compared to the actual film) into why her and Tina dreamed of the same individual. While Nancy's character differs little than the actual film, the original script has scenes that emphasize her headstrong nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare_on_elm_street_script.pdf|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street (Original Script)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205011749/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare_on_elm_street_script.pdf|archive-date=2008-12-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest change was in the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'' script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare_on_elm_street_3_wes_craven_script.pdf|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (Original Script)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195621/http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare_on_elm_street_3_wes_craven_script.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy was closer to her personality in the first film. She was not a dream researcher, nor did she have the mature and calm demeanor portrayed in the actual film. Instead, Nancy was brazen and street smart—at times heading straight into a potentially dangerous situation. Nancy's stubbornness was evident in that she had traveled through five states in search of her missing father, Donald Thompson (named "John" in the script). When first attacked by Freddy Krueger, Nancy tried to physically fend him off with her bare hands—despite being shocked from dreaming again after a five-year time period. This contrasts with the actual film, in which she used a broken mirror shard to injure Freddy. While Nancy cared about the Westin Hill patients, the age disparity between her and the teenagers was not as emphasized. In fact, some of the teenaged patients and hospital workers initially mistake Nancy for a patient. Thus, Nancy was not written as acting maternal. Instead, Nancy acts more like a big sister to the patients. There are instances in which Nancy fights back against the medical authorities, dismissing Dr. Neil Gordon's (named Neil Guinness in the original script) insistence that she has Delayed Stress Syndrome. As with the first movie, Nancy dismisses any attacks on her sanity—as she knows that Freddy Krueger is real.

With regard to ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'', Heather Langenkamp stated her viewpoints about Nancy Thompson's characterization:

:“The connection with Nancy was there. I never felt that comfortable in the skin of that role because...I just felt like the dialogue that they gave Nancy was so stiff and there was no sense of humour at all. She had barely anything going in that department at all and then she’s supposed to be having this quasi-love affair with Craig Wasson’s character...None of it really seemed to have a dynamic energy behind it and as a result I felt I didn’t know what Nancy was anymore. I was struggling to make something of her because she didn’t have that big of a role in some way. She was like a facilitator, she was always showing things like 'let me show you how to do this', 'let’s do it together' but she was never really moving the plot forward herself that much and as a result I didn’t feel like I did a very good job in that role. Then when I saw the movie I thought 'oh it’s not as bad as I thought' because actually the relationship I had with the kids does come through and she is a kind of a reassuring presence in the movie rather than this fighting, battle warrior that she was in the first movie. So I just had to get used to this different role that Nancy played..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staticmass.net/interviews/exclusive-interview-with-heather-langenkamp/|title=Exclusive Interview, Heather Langenkamp|last=Samuel|first=Patrick|date=|website=Static Mass|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In his book ''Horror films of the 1980s'', John Kenneth Muir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=0-78645-501-2|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; references Nancy Thompson, stating the following:

:"As written by Craven and performed by Langenkamp, Nancy is a rarity in the horror genre: an intelligent and insightful youth who is capable of connecting the important things in her life. Only Nancy can recognize the link between worlds for what it is, and look below the surface of reality because she is already trained to do so, through family history. Nancy is prepared in her battle with Freddy because, one senses, she has already detected the dark truth lurking beneath the affluent surface of Elm Street. She has suffered her parent's divorce, her father's absence, and her mother's alcoholism...Nancy is even compared explicitly to Hamlet...in that Hamlet stamps out the lies of his mother, an act which Nancy will repeat during the course of the film..."

:"So the key to defeating her Freddy...is something that goes against Nancy's most prominent characteristic. She must turn her back on the dream demon. She must take back all the energy she gave him...This is Nancy's crisis: knowing when to dig for truth and confront the lies, and when to turn her back on the corruption and lies she has discovered..."

:"The final girl must actively take steps to protect herself and vanquish evil. For example, Nancy buys a survivalist, self-defense manual and in the conclusion of ''Elm Street'', baits Freddy into chasing her. She then runs him through a punishing course of booby traps...Unlike Laurie, whom ''Halloween'' depicts as a victim of unchangeable 'fate,' someone who must mount a defense on the fly, Nancy is armed for battle and ready to rock."

In his book ''Horror Movie Freak'', Don Sumner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Movie Freak|last=Sumner|first=Don|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2010|isbn=1-44021-563-4|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) also notes how Nancy was a different "final girl" despite following the rules of avoiding sex, drugs, and juvenile behavior. He mentions that "the stereotypes of the victimized female screaming in terror and hiding in the closet do not apply to Nancy as she sets out to trap Freddy and attack him with all of the vigor of a killer herself. Her active role and anti-victim posture broke the mold of the horror heroine..." In her book ''Visions of the Night: Dreams, Religion, and Psychology'', Kelly Bulkeley&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visions of the Night: Dreams, Religion, and Psychology|last=Bulkeley|first=Kelly|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1999|isbn=0-79144-284-5|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares Nancy Thompson to Dorothy Gale in ''Wizard of Oz'' in that "Nancy ultimately finds in her dreams the deep resources of personal strength to overcome an evil that the adult social world had failed to defeat." Nancy's death in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'' is even given some interpretation. In her book ''Phallic Panic: Film, Horror and the Primal Uncanny'', Barbara Creed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phallic Panic: Film, Horror and the Primal Uncanny|last=Creed|first=Barbara|publisher=Melbourne Univ. Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-522-85172-4|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that as "Nancy embraces her father's/Freddy's body and tells him that she has always loved him she is torn apart by his finger-blades. The point is that it is dangerous for children to want the love of their parents--disappointment, even death, is the final result."
[[File:Heather Langenkamp 02 (14947900239).jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Heather Langenkamp]] portrayed Nancy in the original series.]]
The documentary ''The Making of Nightmare on Elm Street'' features a segment concerning the casting of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. According to Sara Risher, Langenkamp was chosen because Wes Craven wanted a "young girl who was smart-looking, obviously pretty, vulnerable, but clearly had a good head on her shoulders." Langenkamp herself said that she identified with Nancy Thompson the most, stating that Nancy "had a great sense that she could solve problems without anybody's help at all. I try to be like her, actually." In the same documentary, Langenkamp also characterizes Nancy as the "good girl" whereas the Tina Gray character is contrasted as giving the feeling that "she wasn't going to make it."

In her documentary ''I Am Nancy'', Heather Langenkamp laments how Freddy Krueger became an iconic character while Nancy Thompson disappeared into the background. To explore why this phenomenon occurred, Langenkamp visits six horror conventions, and tries to discern why the villain became the celebrated figure. After interviewing several attendees, Langenkamp learns that while Nancy Thompson's impact on fans is subtle, she still represents strength and intelligence in the hearts and minds of many. For the advertising campaign, campaign buttons were given out that displayed "I am Nancy". A Facebook page allowed Nancy fans to share their artwork, photographs, and sentiments about the character. The film won a Best Editing Award at the Amsterdam Film Festival. In addition to interviewing Nancy fans, the documentary also features interviews with Wes Craven, Robert Englund and Jessica Craven (Wes Craven's daughter). Langenkamp learned from Craven that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staticmass.net/news/exclusive-interview-with-heather-langenkamp-part-2/|title=Exclusive Interview, Heather Langenkamp (Part 2)|last=Samuel|first=Patrick|date=|website=Static Mass|access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I never knew it but now that I’ve talked to him about it, he always thought that Nancy was the centre of his story. It wasn’t this typical horror movie where you’re going to kill off everybody. He knew that she was the heart and soul of ''Nightmare On Elm Street'' so I think it made a lot of sense for him to bring her back, but I didn’t know all of this until recently, after conducting my own interviews with him and asking him myself..."

When developing her documentary, Langenkamp also learned that Nancy Thompson is considered a gay icon. Although Nancy Thompson is heterosexual, Langenkamp shared her theories of why gay and lesbian audience members would be drawn to the character:

:"I read a lot of these PhD {{sic|thesis’}} that talk about the final girl, sexuality and sexuality of horror… they’re kind of on to something but I don’t know if they’re onto the right thing. One theory goes that Nancy is not a particularly feminine hero; she’s not androgynous but she’s not scarily beautiful and as a result she can easily identified by both men and women and I don’t know if that’s the key to her popularity..."

:"I think that people like these movies at a time in their lives when they’re also understanding who they are sexually so it makes sense that they make connection and they see things in these movies that express who they are...For the gay population out there, I’m not sure if its just a great movie or there is something to it that gives a gay man or woman a sense of strength maybe...that watching inspirational characters helps you be true to yourself and find the strength you need to do whatever you need to do..."

'''Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra''' (Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco) was established in 1912 by José Rolón as the Guadalajara Symphonic Orchestra in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]] in [[Mexico]]. The Orchestra resides at [[Teatro Degollado]] located in the historic district of Guadalajara.

It has been conducted by [[Enrique Bátiz]], [[Neeme Järvi]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, [[Plácido Domingo]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, [[Mu-Hai Tang]], [[Claudio Abbado]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, [[Antal Doráti]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, [[Eduardo Mata]] and [[Charles Dutoit]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7355">'''Palatability''' is the [[Reward system|hedonic reward]] (i.e., [[pleasure]]) provided by foods or fluids that are agreeable to the "[[palate]]", which often varies relative to the [[homeostatic]] satisfaction of [[nutrition|nutritional]], [[Fluid_balance|water]], or [[Food_energy|energy]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman MI, Stricker EM. (1976). The physiological psychology of hunger: a physiological perspective. Psychol Rev. 83(6):409-31. {{PMID|1005583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palatability of a food or fluid, unlike its [[flavor]] or [[taste]], varies with the state of an individual: it is lower after [[eating|consumption]] and higher when [[hunger|deprived]]. It has increasingly been appreciated that this can create a hunger that is independent of homeostatic needs.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;Lowe MR, Butryn ML. (2007). Hedonic hunger: a new dimension of appetite? Physiol Behav. Jul 24;91(4):432-9. {{PMID|17531274}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain mechanism==
[[File:Scott &amp; Bowne's Palatable Castor Oil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Advertisement of [[Castor oil]] as a medicine by Scott &amp; Bowne company, 19th century]]
The palatability of a substance is determined by [[opioid receptor]]-related processes in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and ventral [[pallidum]].&lt;ref name="Wassum"&gt;Wassum KM, Ostlund SB, Maidment NT, Balleine BW. (2009). Distinct opioid circuits determine the palatability and the desirability of rewarding events. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.  106:12512–12517 {{PMID|19597155}} {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0905874106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opioid processes involve [[mu opioid receptor]]s and are present in the rostromedial shell part of the nucleus accumbens&lt;ref&gt;Peciña S, Berridge KC. (2005). [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/50/11777 Hedonic hot spot in nucleus accumbens shell: where do mu-opioids cause increased hedonic impact of sweetness?] J Neurosci. 14;25(50):11777-86. {{DOI|10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2329-05.2005}} {{PMID|16354936}} &lt;/ref&gt;  on its [[Medium_spiny_neuron|spiny neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley AE, Bakshi VP, Haber SN, Steininger TL, Will MJ, Zhang M. (2002). Opioid modulation of taste hedonics within the ventral striatum. Physiol Behav. 76(3):365-77. {{PMID|12117573}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has been called the "opioid eating site".&lt;ref&gt;Peciña S, Berridge KC. (2000).Opioid site in nucleus accumbens shell mediates eating and hedonic 'liking' for food: map based on microinjection Fos plumes. Brain Res. 863(1-2):71-86. {{PMID|10773195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rewardfulness of consumption associated with palatability is dissociable from desire or incentive value which is the motivation to seek out a specific commodity.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; Desire or incentive value is processed by [[opioid receptor]]-related processes in the [[basolateral amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; Unlike the liking palatability for food, the [[incentive salience]] wanting is not downregulated by the physiological consequences of food consumption and may be largely independent of homoeostatic processes influencing food intake.&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson G, King N, Blundell J. (2008).  The role of implicit wanting in relation to explicit liking and wanting for food: implications for appetite control. Appetite. 50(1):120-7. {{PMID|17655972}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Though the wanting of incentive salience may be informed by palatability it is independent and not necessarily reduced to it.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; It has been suggested that a third system exists that links opioid processes in the two parts of the brain: "Logically this raises the possibility that a third system, with which the accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, and basolateral amygdala are associated, distributes the affective signals elicited by specific commodities across distinct functional systems to control reward seeking... At present we do not have any direct evidence for a system of this kind, but indirect evidence suggests it may reside within the motivationally rich circuits linking hypothalamic and brainstem viscerogenic structures such as the parabrachial nucleus.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt;

It has also been suggested that "hedonic hunger" can be driven both in regard to “wanting” and “liking”&lt;ref name="Lowe"/&gt; and that a palatability subtype of neuron may also exist in the basolateral amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanini A, Grossman SE, Figueroa JA, Katz DB. (2009). Distinct subtypes of basolateral amygdala taste neurons reflect palatability and reward. J Neurosci. 29(8):2486-95. {{PMID|19244523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satiety and palatability==

[[Appetite]] is controlled by a direct loop and an indirect one. In both the direct and indirect loops there are two feedback mechanisms. First a positive feedback involving its stimulation by palatability food cues, and second, a negative feedback due to satiation and satiety cues following ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Smith GP. (2000).  The controls of eating: a shift from nutritional homeostasis to behavioral neuroscience. Nutrition. 16(10):814-20. {{PMID|11054585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the indirect loop these cues are learnt by association such as meal plate size and work by modulating the potency of the cues of the direct loop.&lt;ref&gt;Smith GP. (1996). The direct and indirect controls of meal size. Neurosci Biobehav Rev. 20(1):41-6. {{PMID|8622828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these processes can exist without subjective awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge KC. (1996). Food reward: brain substrates of wanting and liking. Neurosci Biobehav Rev. ;20(1):1-25. {{PMID|8622814}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cessation of a desire to eat after a meal "satiation" is likely to be due to different processes and cues.&lt;ref&gt;Blundell JE.  Rogers PJ. (1991). Hunger, hedonics, and the control of satiation and satiety. pp. 127–148. In: M.I. Friedman, M.G. Tordoff and M.R. Kare, (Editors) Appetite and nutrition, Dekker, New York {{ISBN|978-0-8247-8371-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More palatable foods reduce the effects of  such cues upon satiation causing a larger food intake.&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans MR, Lee MD, Gray RW, French SJ. (2001). [http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n8/pdf/0801653a.pdf Effects of test-meal palatability on compensatory eating following disguised fat and carbohydrate preloads.] Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 25(8):1215-24. {{PMID|11477507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson TM, Gray RW, Yeomans MR, French SJ. (2005).Test-meal palatability alters the effects of intragastric fat but not carbohydrate preloads on intake and rated appetite in healthy volunteers. Physiol Behav. 84(2):193-203. {{PMID|15708771}} &lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, unpalatability of certain foods can serve as a deterrent from feeding on those foods in the future. For example, the [[Euphydryas chalcedona|Variable Checkerspot butterfly]] contains [[iridoid]] compounds that are unpalatable to avian predators, thus reducing the risk of [[predation]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, M. D. "Unpalatability as a Defense Strategy of Western Checkerspot Butterflies (Euphydryas Scudder, Nymphalidae)." Evolution 35.2 (1981): 367-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Patrologia Latina''''' ([[Latin]] for ''The Latin Patrology'') is an enormous collection of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] and other ecclesiastical writers published by [[Jacques-Paul Migne]] between 1841 and 1855, with indices published between 1862 and 1865. It is also known as the '''Latin series''' as it formed one half of Migne's '''''Patrologiae Cursus Completus''''', the other part being the ''[[Patrologia Graeca|Patrologia Graeco-Latina]]'' of [[patristic]] and [[Byzantine Greek|medieval Greek]] works with their (sometimes non-matching) medieval [[Latin]] translations.

Although consisting of reprints of old editions, which often contain mistakes and do not comply with modern standards of scholarship, the series, due to its availability (it is present in many academic libraries) and the fact that it incorporates many texts of which no modern critical edition is available, is still widely used by scholars of the [[Middle Ages]] and is in this respect comparable to the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

The ''Patrologia Latina'' includes Latin works spanning a millennium, from [[Tertullian]] (d. 230) to [[Pope Innocent III]] (d. 1216), edited in roughly chronological order in 217 volumes; 
volumes 1 to 73, from Tertullian to [[Gregory of Tours]], were published from 1841 to 1849, and volumes 74 to 217, from [[Pope Gregory I]] to Innocent III, from 1849 to 1855. 
Although the collection ends with Innocent III,&lt;ref&gt;It includes some authors of the second quarter of the 13th century, such as [[John Halgren of Abbeville]], and (exceptionally) [[John of Garland]] (died c. 1270) in volume 150, among authors of the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt;
Migne originally wanted to include documents all the way up to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; this task proved too great, but some later commentaries or documents associated with earlier works were included.

Most of the works are ecclesiastic in nature, but there are also documents of literary, historical or linguistic (such as the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] bible in vol. 18) interest.

The printing plates for the ''Patrologia'' were destroyed by fire in 1868, but with help from the Garnier printing house they were restored and new editions were printed, beginning in the 1880s. These reprints did not always correspond exactly with the original series either in quality or internal arrangement, and caution should be exercised when referencing to the ''PL'' in general.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://pld.chadwyck.co.uk/help/about2.htm ProQuest – Central To Research Around The World]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rah'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Meltzer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/28/gap-year-spoof-youtube |title=The gap-year video spoof that went viral &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-03-28|accessdate=2013-09-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pejorative term referring to a stereotypical affluent young [[Social structure of Britain#Upper class|upper class]] or [[Social structure of Britain#Upper middle class|upper-middle class]] person (male or female) in the [[United Kingdom]]. The characteristics of a rah are similar to those of the [[Sloane Ranger]] stereotype also recognised in the UK, though a rah is generally younger, typically around university age (18–25). An important feature of the rah stereotype is the enjoyment of an affluent/party lifestyle with excessive financial assistance from their parents.

The term is possibly an onomatopoeic reference to how those fitting the stereotype are perceived to talk, with the word 'rah' being associated with upper-middle class affluence since at least the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNHia4_HDyc#t=603s |title=The Young Ones (episode 1 series 2) Bambi part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of the stereotype==
Rahs stereotypically study at prestigious institutions such as [[Russell Group]] universities, having previously attended a private boarding or day school, or sometimes a [[grammar school]] or [[faith school]] in an affluent area. Another stereotype is that rahs have taken a [[gap year]], usually in Africa, South America, or South East Asia.

Certain clothing is often associated with rahs; mid-market names such as [[Jack Wills]] are common. For girls, [[pashmina]]s, [[jodhpurs]], [[Ugg boots]] and [[cable knitting|cable-knit]] jumpers combined with scruffy hair arranged in a bun or drastic side partings are common. Boys are stereotyped with [[chinos]], [[board shorts]], [[boat shoes]], and sports team clothing. [[Gilet]]s, quilted jackets, jogging bottoms, sunglasses, and flip-flops are common for both sexes. In colder seasons, [[British country clothing|country attire]] and outdoor wear is popular, especially brands such as [[Hunter Boot]] and [[J. Barbour &amp; Sons]].

[[Rugby union]] is popular for male rahs. Other sports such as [[skiing]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby Fives|Rugby]] and [[Eton Fives]], [[canoeing]], [[fencing]], [[lacrosse]], [[polo]], [[shooting]] and [[yachting]] are also popular.

==In popular culture==
*The ''[[Gap Yah]]'' sketch, by [[The Unexpected Items]], features a typical rah.

The '''Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac''' is an ancient [[paleo-Indian]] sculpture carved in a [[pleistocene]]-era bone of a prehistoric [[Camel#Evolution|camel]]. It was found by Mexican naturalist Mariano Bárcena in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesoweb.com/features/jpl/113.html Mesoweb]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered among the earliest pieces of art from the American continent.&lt;ref&gt;de Anda, Luis Aveleyra Arroyo. "The Pleistocene Carved Bone from Tequixquiac, Mexico: A Reappraisal." American Antiquity (1965): 261-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Palacio Municipal de Tequixquiac (4).JPG|thumbnail|left|Mural inside the Municipality House.]]

A sacrum bone found in [[Tequixquiac]] is considered a work of prehistoric art.  These people were nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering [[fruit]]s as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found here, called the '''Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac''', which had no purpose but which reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a [[camelid]].

This artifact is located in the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15096a.htm |language=Spanish |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Tequixquiac |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527201737/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15096a.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sada Louise Cowan''' (1882–1943)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sada Cowan – Women Film Pioneers Project|url = https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-sada-cowan/|website = wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American writer who began her career as a playwright. She soon switched to writing feature films and is best known for her work on the films ''[[Don't Change Your Husband]]'' and ''[[Why Change Your Wife?]]''. Cowan worked closely with director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] throughout her career.

==Early life==

Sada Louise Cowan was born on September 8, 1882 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. She attended a private boarding school in the Boston area.&lt;ref name="Representative One-Act Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner Mayorga|first1=Margaret|title=Representative One-Act Plays by American Authors|date=1919|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wZaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=sada+cowan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FTFg0kDdUy&amp;sig=_BUTperTHAGW_74OxWzUomP7HAw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eMJaVO6VKYifgwSi-4K4BA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=sada%20cowan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a teenager Cowan moved to [[Germany]] to study music. After finding that writing music was not fulfilling enough for her she switched to writing plays.&lt;ref name="Representative One-Act Plays"/&gt; In [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt, Germany]] she wrote her first hit play from start to finish in two hours titled, ''Sintram of Skagerrak''. Cowan's inspiration for writing this play was hearing [[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederick Lamond]]’s piano recital of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]].&lt;ref name="Representative One-Act Plays"/&gt; She started to write plays that got her name on the map. These were titled ''The State Forbids'', ''In the Morgue'', ''Playing the Game'', ''The Moonlit Way'', ''The Wonder of the Age'', ''The Honor of America'' and ''Pomp,'' respectively.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sada Cowen|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-sada-cowan/#ccp |website=Women Film Pioneers Project|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silent film==
After success writing plays, Cowan switched over to writing full length silent films. In 1919, at thirty-six years old, her first film, “[[The Woman Under Cover]]”, starring [[Fritzi Brunette]], was completed. The film was described by the ''[[Exhibitors Herald]]'' as heavily dramatic but with frequent and smartly placed bits of humor dispersed within it.&lt;ref name="Exhibitors Herald"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Motion Pictures|journal=Exhibitors Herald|date=1919|volume=9|url=https://archive.org/stream/exhibitorsherald09exhi#page/n983/mode/2up|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This successful film led to Cowan’s writing of numerous others, in which she worked with directors such as [[Harry Garson]] and Cecil B. DeMille.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; Some of Cowan’s most popular films include ''The Reckless Lady'' and ''[[The Charmer (1925 film)|The Charmer]]''.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt;

==''Why Change Your Wife?''==
''Why Change Your Wife?'', directed by Cecil B. DeMille, was one of Cowan’s most successful films. This film blazed a trail of “light and merry” films to follow it and included the wealth, clothing, and romance for which the 1920s are remembered.&lt;ref name="A History of the Movies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hampton|first1=Benjamin B.|title=A History of the Movies|date=1931|publisher=Covici, Friede|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofmovies00hamp#page/n527/mode/2up|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Bebe Daniels]] and depicted the story of a man’s marriage trials and tribulations between his first and second wives.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; The film cost $130,000 to produce and made $1,000,000.&lt;ref name="A History of the Movies"/&gt; This was Cowan’s first film that she wrote under director Cecil B. Demille. At the time she was making only $25 a week, which was eventually raised to $60 per week.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; At first, DeMille dismissed her as a “failed writer” and believed her to be not capable of success. However after the success of this film, and the many others she worked on with DeMille, she became one of his top writers and highest-paid staff members.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt;

==Themes in film and Impact on the Industry==
The majority of Cowan’s films revolve around the themes of marriage, divorce, love and infidelity.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; Cowan was a pioneer for women’s writers in film. She was joined in her time by two other prominent women writers in the industry, [[Frances Marion]] and [[June Mathis]]. Cowan was one of the first American writers to travel abroad to Europe and work with foreign directors.&lt;ref name="The Film Daily"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Motion Pictures|journal=The Film Daily|volume=19-20|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily1920newy#page/n549/mode/2up|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written and received writing credit on numerous famous films from the 1920s and '30s.

==Personal life==
Cowan was married two times, with both marriages resulting in divorce. Her first marriage was to [[Frederick James Pitt]].&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; In 1929, Cowan remarried to Dr. [[Ernest L. Commons]]. After her second marriage, Cowan’s whereabouts were relatively unknown, with many speculating she was traveling around Europe or the Orient. However, in 1932 that she came back into the picture of American writers.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt;

==Death==
Cowan died on July 31, 1943, at the age of 60, in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt; The final film that she wrote, titled ''Samson and Delilah'' was released in 1950, seven years after her passing.&lt;ref name="Women Film Pioneers Project"/&gt;

'''San Martino a Gangalandi''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] parish (pieve) church in the Gangalandi neighborhood of [[Lastra a Signa]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. It is located via Leon Battista Alberti. Adjacent to the church is a small Museo Vicariale (Vicarial Museum) displaying some works of art.

==History==
The church in this district was first documented by 1108. A church was first erected in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-style in the 12th-century as an oratory for a Marian confraternity apparently established following the visit to Florence of [[Saint Peter Martyr]]. The dedication to [[St Martin of Tours]] suggests an earlier Carolingian and Frankish foundation. The church underwent a refurbishment in the 15th-century by the Renaissance architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.touringclub.it/destinazione/215234/pieve-di-s-martino-a-gangalandi Touring Club of Italy], short entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Midway along the left flank is a slim tall bell tower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oobJOE0pHLYC Arte e Storia] by Guido Carroci, 1895, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior is notable for frescoes (1433) in the chapel of the Baptistry by [[Bicci di Lorenzo]]. The 15th-century baptismal font has sculpted marble reliefs. Other paintings in the interior include:&lt;ref&gt;List derived from Italian Wikipedia entry&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Five Saints'' by [[Pietro Salvestrini]]
*''Madonna and Child between St Lawrence and the Guardian Angel'' attributed to [[Antonio del Ceraiolo]] 
*''Virgin of the Assumption between Saints Charles Borromeo, Bartholomew, Francis and Martin'' (1615) by [[Matteo Rosselli]] 
*''San Cristoforo'' (fresco left wall)
*''Life of St Donnino'' (13th-century) 
*''Annunciation'' attributed to [[Domenico Passignano]], derived from Oratory of Santissima Annunziata
*''Tomb of [[Agnolo Pandolfini]]'' (1421) 
*''Death of St Joseph'' by [[Francesco Conti]]

The adjacent museum, established in 1986 with the financing by the Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, displays a ''Madonna of the Humility'' (circa 1405) painted by [[Lorenzo Monaco]]. There is also a [[triptych]] attributed to Lorenzo di Bicci and to his son Bicci di Lorenzo: the panels depict ''Virgin giving her girdle to Saint Thomas'' in the center, flanked by Saints Nicholas of Bari, Andrew, John the Baptist, and Anthony the Abbot. The museum displays a ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Jacopo del Sellaio]]. Three panels depicting the ''Decollation of John the Baptist between Saints Francis of Paola and Carlo Borromeo'' attributed to [[Filippo Paladini]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.piccoligrandimusei.it/en/blog/portfolio_page/museum-of-sacred-art-of-san-martino-gangalandi/ Piccoli e Grandi Musei] website, entry on museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uranometria orion.jpg|thumb|Johann Bayer's ''Uranometria'' showing the constellation Orion. Orion the Hunter is star lore created by the ancient Greeks.]]
'''Star lore''' or '''starlore''' is the creating and cherishing of [[mythology|mythical]] stories about the [[star]]s and star patterns ([[constellation]]s and [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]]); that is, [[folklore]] based upon the stars and star patterns. Using the stars to explain religious [[doctrine]]s or actual events in [[history]] is also defined as star lore. Star lore has a very long history; it has been practiced by nearly every culture recorded in history, dating as far back as 5,500 years ago. It was practiced by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures of the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods as well.

==Orion and Scorpius==
One example of star lore is the inventing of the story of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the Hunter and the [[Scorpius]] the [[Scorpion]] by the ancient [[Greeks]]. This ancient culture saw a very startling pattern of bright stars in the winter [[sky]] that, from their point of view, resembled a mighty hunter, which they named [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. During the summer, they saw another startling pattern of bright stars that resembled a scorpion. They noticed that the constellations of Orion and the scorpion were positioned at opposite ends of the sky and were never seen in the sky simultaneously. As one constellation rose above the eastern [[horizon]], the other was setting below the western horizon, and when either one was high in the sky, the other was completely absent. The ancient Greeks felt compelled to explain this [[phenomenon]] by composing a story or myth based on the two constellations{{Citation needed|reason=The order of events is counterintuitive.|date=November 2013}}.

The story was that Orion was a mighty and proud hunter who was stung by a scorpion. Orion died of the scorpion's sting and was placed among the stars by the gods. Although the scorpion was destroyed by the gods in vengeance for killing Orion, it was also placed among the stars. In order to prevent Orion and the scorpion from quarreling and fighting with each other in the sky, the gods placed Orion and the scorpion at opposite ends of the sky, and in opposite [[season]]s, so that both of them can never be seen in the sky at the same time.

==Andromeda==
Another example of star lore is the story behind the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], also known at "the chained woman". Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of [[Ethiopia]], King  [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. The story goes that because Cassiopeia bragged so much of Andromeda's beauty to the [[Nereids]], daughters of [[Poseidon]], that they complained to their father, who sent a sea monster to destroy the coast of Ethiopia. Cepheus consulted an oracle for assistance and learned that the only way to save his lands was to sacrifice his daughter to Poseidon's monster.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellationsofwords.com/Constellations/Andromeda.htm Andromeda: the Chained Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andromeda was chained to a rock and left for the sea monster. [[Perseus]], the hero of the story who had just killed the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] found Andromeda in her distress and immediately, the two fell in love. Perseus asked for her name and refused to leave until he knew it, talking to her until she gave in. Andromeda told him her name, her country, and the reason for her imprisonment on the rock. He then consulted with Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and they decided that if Perseus rescued Andromeda from the sea monster, he could marry her. The story of how he then defeats the monster varies. [[Ovid]] describes his killing of the monster as a drawn out bloody battle. Other sources say that Perseus killed the sea monster with the aid of Medusa's head, turning the monster to stone. Andromeda and Perseus were married soon after,&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.comfychair.org/~cmbell/myth/andromeda.html Andromeda]&lt;/ref&gt; despite already being promise to her uncle, Phineus. At the wedding, Phineus and Perseus got into an altercation, and Perseus turned Phineus to stone using Medusa's head.

The constellation is said to have astrological influences as well. It is said that any man born at the same time Andromeda is said to rise from the sea will be one without mercy; he will be emotionally unmoved even in the presence of grieving parents. The constellation also influences the birth of the executioner, a man who will kill swiftly for money and kill willingly. Sources describe men born with the rise of Andromeda as one who would feel nothing if faced with Andromeda chained to her rock, just as Perseus did and fell in love with the girl.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellationsofwords.com/Constellations/Andromeda.htm Andromeda: the Chained Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draco==
The [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] is another example of star lore. In Roman mythology, the constellation is representative of [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon that guarded the golden apples inside the garden, [[Hesperides]]. The tree was a wedding gift to [[Hera]] when she and [[Zeus]] were married, and she planted it on [[Mount Atlas]]. Hera tasked the Hesperides to guard the tree and put Ladon around the tree as well to ensure that the Hesperides would not steal the apples. In some sources, Ladon is called the child of [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], who was half woman and half viper, and had hundreds of heads. In other versions of Ladon's story, the number of heads he had is not at all mentioned and he is described as the offspring of [[Ceto]] and [[Phorcys]], two sea [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/draco-constellation/ Draco Constellation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastingly, in Roman mythology, Draco was one of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] who waged war on the Olympic gods for ten years. He was killed by [[Minerva]] in the battle and thrown into the sky.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/draco-constellation/ Draco Constellation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Apotheosis of Homer''''' is a grand 1827 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], now exhibited at the [[Louvre]] as INV 5417. The symmetrical composition depicts [[Homer]] being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith. 

==History==
A state commission to decorate a ceiling of the musée [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time.&lt;ref name="Condon_110"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly—it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition.&lt;ref name="Condon_110"/&gt; The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he can be seen making the composition and the details more and more precise. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of [[Nicolas Poussin]], which is directly copied from Poussin's [[:File:Nicolas Poussin 078.jpg|1650 self-portrait]] now in the Louvre. 

The composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a [[Neoclassicism|classical]] way in front of an [[ancient Greek]] temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition describes it as "Homer receiving homage from all the great men of [[ancient Greece|Greece]], [[ancient Rome|Rome]] and modern times. The Universe crowns him, [[Herodotus]] burns [[frankincense|incense]].&lt;ref&gt;Behind Homer, to the left, with his head covered to make a sacrifice, as was customary in classical religious practice, as with the [[Via Labicana Augustus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] sit at his feet."
[[File:Study for Phidias in 'The Apotheosis of Homer' by Ingres, San Diego Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|Study for Phidias in ''The Apotheosis of Homer'', oil on canvas, 1827, [[San Diego Museum of Art]]]]

The final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of [[fresco]]. Ingres wished to compete with [[Raphael]] through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's ''[[The Parnassus|Parnassus]]'') and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by [[Apelles]] (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include [[Dante]] who is shown being led by [[Virgil]] as in the former's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (extreme left, behind Poussin) and [[Molière]] (right, by the feet of the personification of the ''Odyssey'').

The art historian [[Robert Rosenblum]] said ''The Apotheosis of Homer'' represents "Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum 1990, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s ''[[Death of Sardanapalus|The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' at the same year's [[Paris Salon]]. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. ''The Apotheosis of Homer'' was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=15321 The Balzes' copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figures shown==
Surrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern—the modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]] worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients. The figures are:&lt;ref name="Radius_103"&gt;Radius 1968, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later repetitions==
Ingres revisited the subject in several later works, including an undated watercolour (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and paintings such as ''Homer and His Guide'' (1861; Brussels, Royal Collection) and ''The Odyssey'' (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). In 1854 be began work on a drawing of the composition to be used as a model for the engraver [[Luigi Calamatta|Calamatta]].&lt;ref name="Condon_112"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing, in which Ingres announced his intention to "amplify and complete" his conception, was not completed until 1865,&lt;ref name="Condon_112"/&gt; as the artist deliberated at length in choosing the appropriate historical personages to be included. He ultimately added dozens of new figures, including [[Ictinus]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[John Flaxman]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Plutarch]], [[Cosimo de Medici]], [[Louis XIV]], and [[Pope Leo X]].&lt;ref name="Radius_103"/&gt; Ingres also refined his selection by excluding Shakespeare, Tasso, and Camões from the 1865 drawing, as he had come to believe that they were too closely related to the Romantic tendency epitomized by his rival Delacroix.&lt;ref name="Radius_103"/&gt;

"'''The Brave Little Tailor'''" or "'''The Valiant Little Tailor'''" or "'''The Gallant Tailor"''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Das tapfere Schneiderlein'') is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 20.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Household Tales'',"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm020.html The Brave Little Tailor]"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Jacobs]] collected another variant "A Dozen at One Blow" in ''European Folk and Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''European Folk and Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/european/dozenblow.html "A Dozen at One Blow" ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Blue Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/295.htm "The Brave Little Tailor"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another of many versions of the tale appears in ''[[A Book of Giants]]'' by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].

In the [[Aarne–Thompson–Uther system]] of [[classifying folktales]], it is type 1640,&lt;ref name="Heiner" /&gt; with elements of several other story types.&lt;ref name="Ashliman" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
A [[tailor]] is preparing to eat some [[jam]], but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading "Seven at One Blow". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a [[giant]] who assumes that "Seven at One Blow" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a "rock" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.

Impressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.

The tailor enters the royal service, but the other [[soldier]]s are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the [[king]] that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabbed the heart of the giants.

The king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a [[unicorn]], another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a [[wild boar]], but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.

Duly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the kings servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says "Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm020.html&lt;/ref&gt; Terrified, the kings servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.

==Characterization==
* Tailor – this character is clever, intelligent, and confident. He uses [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] and other cunning to trick other characters. For example, various forms of [[psychological manipulation]] to influence the behavior of others, such as turning the pair of giants against each other, and playing on the assassins' and the earlier giants' assumptions and fears.  Similarly, he uses [[decoy]] tactics to lure the [[quest]] animals (unicorn, boar) into his traps, and to avoid being killed in the first giant's bed.  This reliance on trickery and manipulation by the [[protagonist]] is a feature of the stock character of the [[antihero]].
* King – this character is very mistrusting and judgmental, who uses the promise of half the kingdom to persuade the protagonist to take on seemingly deadly tasks. The king is one-dimensional as a character, and is essentially a [[plot device]], the source of challenges for the protagonist to overcome to achieve the desired goal.
* Princess – the prize for completing all these challenges is the hand in marriage of the princess, and along with it, half the kingdom. She sets great store by the social class of royal birthright, so when she finds out that the man she has married is no more than a poor tailor, she is furious, and tries to have him killed. Her self-absorbed vindictiveness, and its easy defeat, is consistent with the stock character of the [[Shrew (stock character)|shrewish bride]].

==Motifs and themes==
In the [[Aarne–Thompson–Uther]] system of [[Classifying folktales|folktale classification]], the core of the story is [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] type 1640,&lt;ref name="Heiner"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bravetailor/other.html Tales Similar to the Brave Little Tailor]"&lt;/ref&gt; named The Brave Tailor for this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ATU System |work=AT Types of Folktales |first=Tormod |last=Kinnes |date=2009 |url= http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It also include episodes of type 1060, Squeezing Water from a Stone; type 1062, A Contest in Throwing Stones; type 1052, A Contest in Carrying a Tree; type 1051, Springing with a Bent Tree; and type 1115, Attempting to Kill the Hero in His Bed.&lt;ref name="Ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimmtales.html The Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The story features several more general [[Theme (literature)|themes]] common to numerous folktales and more formal literature:{{original research inline|certain=yes|date=September 2015|reason=These appear to be the opinion of a Wikipedia editor, not any sources.}}
* Class, or "birth" – the tailor overcomes the [[social class]] system and exceeds his birthright as a tailor, going from peasant to king.
* Clever upstart – using nothing but his ingenuity, the tailor uses the killing of seven flies in one blow to gradually increase his social standing.
* Danger – despite the great risk of bodily harm, the tailor continues on his quest to spread word of his conquest and claim his fortune. He proves himself fearless.
* Outwitting of opponents – the tailor repeatedly outwits the people, giants, and animals he comes into contact with. Using only his brains and a little skill, he manages to overcome many obstacles.

==Relation to other stories==
"The Brave Little Tailor" has close similarities to other folktales collected around Europe, including "[[The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll]]" (Norway) and "[[Stan Bolovan]]" (Romania). It also shares many elements with "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]" (Cornwall and England, with ties to "[[Bluebeard]]" folktales of Brittany, and earlier [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] stories of Wales), though the protagonist in that story uses his guile to actually kill giants.  Both the Scandinavian and British variants feature a recurring [[stock character]] fairy-tale hero, respectively: [[Jack (hero)|Jack]] (also associated with other giant-related stories, such as "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]"), and [[Askeladden]], also known as Boots.  It is also similar to the Greek myth of [[Hercules]] in which Hercules is promised the ability to become a god if he slays the monsters, much like the main character in "The Brave Little Tailor" is promised the ability to become king through marrying the king's daughter if he kills the beasts in the story.

The technique of tricking the later giants into fighting each other is identical to the technique used by [[Cadmus]], in [[Greek mythology]] and a related surviving Greek folktale, to deal with the warriors who sprang up where he sowed [[dragon]]'s teeth into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, "Foreword", p xxii, Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th-century [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', a similar strategy is also employed by the wizard [[Gandalf]] to keep three [[troll]]s fighting amongst themselves, until the rising sun turns them to stone.

==Adaptations==
* [[Mickey Mouse]] appeared in a 1938 [[Disney]] short cartoon, ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', based on this tale.
* [[Tibor Harsányi]] composed a [[Suite (music)|suite]], ''L'histoire du petit tailleur'', for narrator, seven instruments, and percussion in 1950.  One of the most famous recordings of this work was performed by the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]] conducted by [[Georges Prêtre]], with [[Peter Ustinov]] as the narrator reading in both English ([[Angel Records]], 1966) and French (''Pour les Enfants'', EMI Classics France, 2002).
* The story formed an episode of the second season of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', a 1987–1989 [[anime]] television series.
* The Valiant Little Tailor was featured in the first seasons of ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', a 1995–2000 [[HBO]] animated TV series, where it was set in the West African [[Sahel]]. The tailor was called Bongo and was voiced by [[David Alan Grier]] and also featured the voice talents of [[James Earl Jones]] as King Dakkar, [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]] as the Giant, [[Dawnn Lewis]] as Princess Songe, and [[Zakes Mokae]] as an exclusive character named Mr. Barbooska.
*''Le vaillant petit tailleur'' is a 2004 French-language novel by [[Éric Chevillard]] retelling the fairy tale in a [[Postmodern literature|postmodernist]] way.
*"Satmaar Palowan"("The Wrestler Who Kills Seven"), a short story by eminent Bengali writer  [[Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury]] was inspired by this tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omegalibrary.com/viewtopic.php?id=2700|title=সাতমার পালোয়ান : উপেন্দ্রকিশোর রায়চৌধুরী (ছোটোগল্প), SATMAR PALOAN (Page 1) — STORY (ছোটগল্প) — Banglalibrary|website=omegalibrary.com|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[:ru:Храбрый портняжка (мультфильм)|Soviet cartoon]] based on the fairy tale was produced in 1964, directed by the [[Brumberg sisters]].

[[File:The Choral Project at Skywalker.jpg|thumb|400px|Conductor Daniel Hughes and The Choral Project recording at [[Skywalker Sound]].]]
Based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], '''The Choral Project''' is a mixed-voice [[choir]] founded in 1996 by artistic director and conductor Daniel D. Hughes [http://danielhughesmusic.com].  The group's vision is ''"to heal our world through music and words,"'' while their mission is ''"to connect to one another through choral theater, education and musical excellence."''

The Choral Project's repertoire is broad and diverse, ranging from [[Bach]], [[Debussy]], and [[Brahms]] to modern composers like [[Kirke Mechem]], Rene Clausen, [[Michael Ostrzyga]], Stephen Jackson and [[Eric Whitacre]].  They have performed in Washington D.C.'s [[National Cathedral]], San Francisco's [[Mission Dolores]] Basilica, Mission Santa Clara de Asís, Santa Cruz' [[Mission Santa Cruz|Holy Cross Church]], and multiple venues in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Mexico]].  During their 2001 tour, The Choral Project appeared live on Mexican National Radio. In 2004, the ensemble competed in the Mixed Choir division of the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales, coming away with a second-place finish. In 2007, while competing against six choirs from around the world at the California International Choral Festival &amp; Competition in San Luis Obispo, CA, the group placed in all three categories - 1st place in the Choir's Choice category, 2nd place in the Required Music category and 3rd in the Folk Music category.

Every season, The Choral Project uses one concert to focus on an important social issue. For example, in February 2017 the choir performed [[Street Requiem]] with mezzo soprano [[Frederica von Stade]] to highlight the issue of homelessness. The [[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] wrote, "The piece, said the 53-voice Choral Project’s artistic director Daniel Hughes, addresses issues of what it’s like to live on the streets and assumes the voice of the homeless in confronting the audience, 'Why do you ignore me when you leave the concert hall?'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/arts-and-entertainment/20170215/choral-project-presents-meditation-on-homelessness|title=Choral Project presents meditation on homelessness|date=15 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, The Choral Project has released eight albums: ''The Cycle of Life'', ''Of Christmastide'', ''Americana'', ''Water &amp; Light'' (the group’s #1 best seller on the Clarion label), ''Winter'', ''One is the All'', ''Tell the World'', and most recently ''Yuletide'', a festive collection of holiday favorites.

The Choral Project also performs on the San José Chamber Orchestra recording of the dramatic oratorio ''[[Choose Life, Uvacharta Bachayim]]'', by composer [[Mona Lyn Reese]] and librettist Delores Dufner, OSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sjco.org/collaborations/|title=Collaborations – San Jose Chamber Orchestra|website=sjco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choral Project is also a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization involved in community outreach, including a choral mentorship program for local high school students, joint performances with visiting choirs and an annual Choral Composition Contest for high school students and undergraduates.

[[File:TheCuriousRoom.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition, published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]].]]

'''''The Curious Room''''' ({{ISBN|0-09-958621-5}}) is a book collecting various plays and scripts by English writer [[Angela Carter]]. Its full title is '''''The Curious Room: Plays, Film Scripts and an Opera'''''.

The book contains her original screenplays for the films ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[The Magic Toyshop]]'', both of which were based on her own original stories. It also contains a draft of a [[libretto]] for an opera based on ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], and five radio plays: "Vampirella", which she then reworked as "The Lady of the House of Love" in ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'' collection, "The Company of Wolves", "Puss in Boots" (both reworkings of Charles Perrault's fairy tales) and two "artificial biographies", one of Victorian painter, [[Richard Dadd]], who murdered his father, and the other about Edwardian novelist, [[Ronald Firbank]]. The collection also includes the unproduced screenplays ''Gun for the Devil'' (based upon an earlier short work of hers, collected in ''American Ghosts and Old World Wonders'') and  ''The Christchurch Murders'' (based on the [[Parker–Hulme murder case]] which also influenced the 1994 [[Peter Jackson]] film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''), as well a stage adaptation of [[Frank Wedekind]]'s Lulu plays.  Carter's television work also included a controversial documentary entitled ''[[The Holy Family Album]]'', which is not published here.

Edited and with production notes provided by Mark Bell, with an introduction by [[Susannah Clapp]], the book was published by [[Chatto and Windus]] in [[1996 in literature|1996]], four years [[List of works published posthumously|after Angela Carter's death]].

'''''The Punk Singer''''' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] about [[Feminism|feminist]] singer [[Kathleen Hanna]] who fronted the bands [[Bikini Kill]] and [[Le Tigre]], and who was a central figure in the [[riot grrrl]] movement. Directed by [[film director|filmmaker]] [[Sini Anderson]] and produced by Anderson and [[Tamra Davis]], the film's title is taken from the [[Julie Ruin]] song "The Punk Singer", from Hanna's 1998 solo effort.

==Synopsis==
Using a combination of interviews and archival footage including live band performances, the film traces the life and career of Hanna from her troubled upbringing and her start in [[spoken word]] performance poetry, through her riot grrrl [[zine]]s, her prominent punk and dance-punk bands, her coining of the phrase "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" for [[Kurt Cobain]], her solo career as [[Julie Ruin]], her feminist activism, her marriage to [[Beastie Boys]] member [[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]], and ending with Hanna's 2010 diagnosis of late-stage [[Lyme disease]] and the severe treatments she endures to combat it.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/12/entertainment/la-et-mn-sxsw-2013-kathleen-hanna-reemerges-in-the-punk-singer-20130312 |title=SXSW 2013: Kathleen Hanna reemerges in 'The Punk Singer' |date=March 12, 2013 |last=Olsen |first=Mark |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm Uhde''' (28 October 1874, [[Strzelce Krajeńskie|Friedeberg]], [[Province of Brandenburg]] (now Poland) – 17 August 1947, [[Paris]]) was a [[Germany|German]] art collector, dealer, author and critic, an early collector of modernist painting, and a significant figure in the career of [[Henri Rousseau]].

==Biography==
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1907, Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde..jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1907, ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde''. Robert Delaunay and Sonia Terk met through Wilhelm Uhde, with whom Sonia had been married as she said for "convenience"]]
Uhde studied law in Dresden but switched to art history, studying in [[Munich]] and [[Florence]] before moving to [[Paris]] in 1904. He purchased his first Picasso in 1905, and was one of the first collectors of the [[cubism|Cubist]] paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]. He met [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay|Sonia Terk]] and Henri Rousseau in 1907, and opened his art gallery in 1908, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) where he exhibited Georges Braque, [[Jean Metzinger]], Sonia Delaunay, [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and Pablo Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;MAM, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris 1937, L'Art Indépendant, ex. cat. {{ISBN|2-85346-044-4}}, Paris-Musées, 1987, P. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Uhde commissioned Picasso to paint his portrait (1910) and produced the first monograph on Rousseau in 1911.&lt;ref name=dah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/uhdew|title=Dictionary of Art Historians}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1910, Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde, oil on canvas, 81 x 60 cm, Joseph Pulitzer Collection.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1910, ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde'', oil on canvas, 81 x 60 cm, Joseph Pulitzer Collection]]
[[File:Helmut Kolle-Wilhelm Uhde-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Helmut Kolle]], ca.1930, ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde'']]
Uhde and Sonia Terk married in 1908 (London), reportedly a marriage of convenience which masked his homosexuality. They divorced 1910 and Terk married Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name=dah/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a result, Uhde's collection (including works by Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, [[Juan Gris]], Auguste Herbin, [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]], Pablo Picasso, [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]) was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll18/id/5199/rec/6 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde. Paris, 30 May 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gee, "Dealers, Critics and Collectors of Modern Painting; Aspects of the Parisian Art Market Between 1910 and 1930", Courtauld PhD Dissertation 1977, p25&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919-1920, Uhde worked with [[Helmut Kolle]] and lived with him in Chantilly, France. Uhde became active as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], but returned to France in 1924, moving back to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] in 1927. A Jew, he spent the [[World War II|Second World War]] in hiding in southern France, at one point helped by the art critic and [[French resistance|resistance]] leader [[Jean Cassou]].

==The Sacred Heart painters==
Uhde is also known as the principal organiser of the first [[Naive Art]] exhibition, which took place in Paris in 1928. The participants were [[Henri Rousseau]], [[André Bauchant]], [[Camille Bombois]], [[Séraphine Louis]] and [[Louis Vivin]], known collectively as the Sacred Heart painters. Séraphine Louis had been Uhde's housecleaner, whose work he had discovered and sponsored from 1912 to 1930.

==Legacy==
A significant part of Uhde's life story is told in the 2008 French film ''[[Séraphine (film)|Séraphine]]'' by director [[Martin Provost]], focusing on the encounter and subsequent role of [[Séraphine Louis]] in his life and he in hers. The film won seven [[César Award]]s, including [[César Award for Best Film|Best Film]].

'''Émile Henri Bernard''' (28 April 1868 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1941) was a French [[Post-Impressionist]] painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Eugène Boch]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugeneboch.com Eugène Boch a common friend of Vincent van Gogh and Émile Bernard&lt;/ref&gt; and at a later time, [[Paul Cézanne]]. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]], two late 19th-century [[art movements]]. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of [[modern art]] to which Bernard had contributed.

==Biography==
[[File:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Émile Bernard''&lt;br&gt;by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1886)&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{For|a timeline|Émile Bernard chronology}}
Émile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, Émile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where Émile attended the ''Collège Sainte-Barbe.''

===Education===

He began his studies at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|École des Arts Décoratifs]]. In 1884, joined the [[Atelier Cormon]] where he experimented with [[impressionism]] and [[pointillism]] and befriended fellow artists [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. After being suspended from the École des Beaux-Arts for "showing expressive tendencies in his paintings", he toured [[Brittany]] on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.

In August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in [[Pont-Aven]]. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that "my own talent was already fully developed." He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.

===1887–1888===

Bernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted ''La Grandmère'', a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended [[Académie Julian]], &lt;ref&gt;Russell, John. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D61E30F93AA25750C0A96F948260 "An Art School That Also Taught Life,"] ''New York Times.'' 19 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.

One year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had "a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively..." Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.

1888 was a seminal year in the history of [[Modern art]]. From 23 October until 23 December [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] worked together in [[Arles]]. Gauguin had brought his new style from [[Pont-Aven]] exemplified in ''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
He also brought along Bernard's ''Le Pardon de Pont-Aven'' which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/07/26/badorment26.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/07/26/ixartright.html see in:] (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style Émile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a [[watercolor]] copy of the ''Pardon'' (December 1888) which he sent to his [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|brother]], to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of Émile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy."

Bernard's style was effective and coherent (see:[http://www.ackland.org/tours/classes/bernard.html woman at haystacks],) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two "portraits" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's drawings from the August batch ("...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers" – Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard – Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the Allée des [[Alyscamps]] in Arles.

In 1891 he joined a group of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] before he died in 1941.

::"[...] this creative, [[avant-garde]] young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]
Bernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as [[cloisonnism]]. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of [[Paul Cézanne]], and he collaborated with [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].

Many say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this "closisonisme" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin "turned against Neo-Impressionism."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of Cézanne. But Bernard says "When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by "everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan." {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.
And the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Symbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.
Bernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it "It is the invisible express by the visible,"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], but simplifying the actual symbol.

His concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.

==Influence==
It was always Émile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/vangogh/slide_intro.html Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South] that put Émile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Aguéli]].

===Letters===
His correspondence with other artists is of great art historical interest. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard traded ideas and art. Many [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|letters sent from van Gogh]] and Gauguin to Bernard give historians a better idea of the artists lives and connection to their artwork.
