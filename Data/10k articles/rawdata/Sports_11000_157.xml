'''Alumni Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is home to the [[Guelph Gryphons]] varsity [[Canadian football|football]] team. It was built in 1970, and has a fixed [[seating capacity]] of approximately 8,500, including fixed seating and the grass hill on the east side of the stadium. On October 27, 2011, it was announced that the stadium would undergo an $18 million expansion and renovation that will bring fixed seating capacity up to 7,500. It was also announced{{when|date=September 2013}} that an eight-lane track would be installed{{when|date=September 2013}} as well as synthetic turf for the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gryphons.ca/sports/2011/10/27/GEN_1027111629.aspx?tab=thestadiumproject&amp;path=fac |title=About the Stadium Project |access-date=2012-02-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172910/http://gryphons.ca/sports/2011/10/27/GEN_1027111629.aspx?tab=thestadiumproject&amp;path=fac |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] announced they had reached a [[memorandum of understanding]] with the university to use Alumni Stadium as their temporary home in 2013 while [[Tim Hortons Field]] is constructed. The stadium underwent a temporary expansion to accommodate the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] team, with seating for approximately 13,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiger-Cats play host to Eskimos in new temporary home in Guelph|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/tiger-cats-play-host-to-eskimos-in-new-temporary-home-in-guelph-1.1318717|work=The Canadian Press|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=September 18, 2013|date=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger-Cats played 9 of 10 home games at Alumni Stadium during their [[2013 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|2013 season]], including the [[2013 CFL season|2013 East Final]] against the [[Montreal Alouettes]], which they won in overtime 19-16. The Tiger-Cats would eventually go on to be the runners-up of the [[101st Grey Cup]] at [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], thus ending their tenure at Alumni Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roughriders top Ticats to Win 101st Grey Cup at Home|url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=437442|work=TSN.ca Staff|publisher=TSN|accessdate=November 25, 2013|date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 8.5 million dollar, 14,000 square foot Football Pavilion addition to Alumni Stadium is planned for completion by December 2016.  The new facility will feature a state-of-the-art locker room, players' lounge with kitchen, therapy room with cold and hot tubs, equipment room, coaches offices, meeting rooms and a board room.

Canale Arena is home to the [[Buccaneer]] and Lady Buccaneer [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams.

The Buccaneer basketball team was the [[Gulf South Conference]] champion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= March 9, 2008 | url= http://www.gobucsgo.com/news/2008/3/9/030908aaa_71.aspx?path=mbball | title = Bucs Hold On For First GSC Championship, 93-89 | publisher = Christian Brothers University Athletics | last = Opperman | first = Eric | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The original structure was completed in 1950.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.cbu.edu/cbu/AboutCBU/OverviewHistory/chronology/index.htm | title = CBU Chronology | publisher = Christian Brothers University | accessdate = 2008-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616030514/http://www2.cbu.edu/cbu/AboutCBU/OverviewHistory/chronology/index.htm# | archive-date = 2008-06-16 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was the largest indoor [[arena]] in the city of Memphis.&lt;ref name="renovation"&gt;{{cite web | date= December 1, 2004 | url= http://www.cbu.edu/News/Releases/canale.html | title = Canale Family Foundation Provides Lead Gift: CBU to Dedicate Renovated Arena on December 10 | publisher = Christian Brothers University | last = Kerr | first = John | accessdate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renovation ===
The arena was fully renovated in 2004. Among renovations were the addition of new stadium seating, bleachers, a hospitality suite, a Hall of Fame conference room, restrooms, a lobby, and Canale Cafe. The arena has a stated capacity of 1,000.&lt;ref name="renovation"/&gt;

=== Namesake ===
The athletic facility was originally named De La Salle Gymnasium in honor of [[Jean-Baptiste de la Salle|St. John Baptist de la Salle]], the founder of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]].&lt;ref name="renovation"/&gt; The Lasallian Christian Brothers, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious institute]], founded Christian Brothers University in 1871.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;

When the facility was reopened and blessed on December 10, 2004, it was renamed in honor of John D. Canale, Jr. Memphis businessman John D. Canale, Jr. served on the university's board of trustees from 1970 to 1983 and received the university's prestigious Maurelian Medal in 1994 for his support of and service to the university. Canale's history of contribution to the university includes raising funds in 1949 to build De La Salle Gymnasium. Additionally, Canale donated the funding to build the John Canale Pool on campus in 1986. The pool was named in honor of Canale's father, John D. Canale, Sr., a lifelong supporter of the Christian Brothers and [[valedictorian]] of the Christian Brothers College class of 1891.&lt;ref name="renovation"/&gt;

'''''Concussion''''' is a 2015 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Sports film|sports drama]] film directed and written by [[Peter Landesman]], based on the exposé "Game Brain" by [[Jeanne Marie Laskas]], published in 2009 by ''[[GQ]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bennet Omalu, Concussions, and the NFL: How One Doctor Changed Football Forever|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nfl-players-brain-dementia-study-memory-concussions|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|last=Laskas|first=Jeanne Marie|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in 2002, the film stars [[Will Smith]] as [[Bennet Omalu|Dr. Bennet Omalu]], a forensic pathologist who fights against the [[National Football League]] trying to suppress his research on [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. It also stars [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]], and [[Albert Brooks]].

The film premiered at [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] on November 11, 2015 and was released  by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] nomination.

==Plot==

[[Steelers]] center [[Mike Webster]] is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, a fellow [[American Football|football]] player, [[Justin Strzelczyk]], comes to him, and confides that he is starting to lose his memory, that he is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes the worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing "is to finish the game," which is what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.

[[Bennet Omalu]], a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] with the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] [[coroner]]'s office, handles Webster's [[autopsy]]. He wonders how a man, otherwise healthy, and fairly young, could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain and discovers that he had severe brain damage. He ultimately determines that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he later calls [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Steven T. DeKosky]] and county coroner [[Cyril Wecht]], Omalu publishes a paper on his findings, which is initially dismissed by the [[National Football League|NFL]].

Over the next few years, Omalu discovers that three other former NFL players, Strzelczyk (died 2004), [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]] (died 2005), and [[Andre Waters]] (died 2006), had symptoms very similar to Webster's. He finally persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] to allow him to present his findings before a committee on player safety. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing Bailes, a former NFL employee, to give the presentation in his place. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma was due to past injuries, having nothing to do with football. As he leaves the meeting, former [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] executive [[Dave Duerson]] angrily confronts Omalu and tells him to "go back to [[Africa]]."

Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL. Before leaving he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a [[miscarriage]] after being stalked. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh. They move to [[Lodi, California]], where Omalu takes a job with the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] coroner's office.

Three years later, Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to growing cognitive problems. In his suicide note, Duerson admits that Omalu was right. Omalu is allowed to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, [[2011 NFL lockout|NFL players sue the league]] for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Omalu is offered a job as chief medical examiner for the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], but as explained in closing title cards, turns it down, remaining with Prema and their two children in California, where he became a U.S. citizen in February 2015.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Ridley Scott]]'s idea of an NFL concussion film was inspired by Dr. Bennett Omalu's study about former NFL stars [[Junior Seau]] and [[Dave Duerson]], both of whom committed suicide after suffering from [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). Scott was set to direct after his film ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'', while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer.&lt;ref name=Concussions&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Ridley Scott To Direct Film About Deadly Effects Of Concussions In Football Players|url=http://deadline.com/2013/11/ridley-scott-to-direct-film-about-deadly-effects-of-concussions-in-football-players-630082/|accessdate=October 12, 2014|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first ''Game Time Decision'' with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee [[wide receiver]] Matthew A.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 192 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Concussion'' lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional, sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/concussion_2015/ |title=Concussion (2015) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/concussion-2015 |title=Concussion Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/12/star-wars-force-awakens-christmas-weekend-box-office-record-joy-daddys-home-concussion-point-break-1201672899/ |title=‘Daddy’, ‘Joy’ &amp; ‘Hateful Eight’ Reap Fortune As ‘Star Wars’ Halo Effect Impacts B.O...

==Controversy==
Family members of [[Dave Duerson]], a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a "quack" in addition to telling him "to go back to Africa" and "get away from our game."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Dave Duerson’s Family Says ‘Concussion’ Film Smears Him|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/sports/football/concussion-movie-smears-dave-duerson-his-family-says.html|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date = December 16, 2015|access-date = December 17, 2015|first = Ken|last = Belson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player [[Andre Waters]] when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members called these scenes false. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was "emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
 
''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it,&lt;ref name="Engber Seau article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=The Concussion Panic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/05/junior_seau_s_suicide_are_concussions_responsible_.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|publisher=The Slate Group|date=May 9, 2012|access-date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. "[The film] feeds into a pervasive myth at the center of the national discussion over football and head injuries," he charges.&lt;ref name="Engber criticism"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=Concussion Lies|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2015/12/the_truth_about_will_smith_s_concussion_and_bennet_omalu.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|publisher=The Slate Group|accessdate=December 26, 2015|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he cites a 2012 [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=Sherry L.|last2=Hein|first2=Misty J.|last3=Lehman|first3=Everett|last4=Gersic|first4=Christine M.|title=Body Mass Index, Playing Position, Race, and the Cardiovascular Mortality of Retired Professional Football Players|journal=[[American Journal of Cardiology]]|date=March 15, 2012|volume=109|issue=6|pages=889–896|url=http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(11)03387-X/fulltext|accessdate=December 26, 2015|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.10.050}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer and generally healthier lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber concedes, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.&lt;ref name="Engber criticism" /&gt;

More recent research and thinking also looks at the steady accumulation of subconcussive blows, in addition to symptomatic concussions, as a major contribution factor in the development of CTE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/01/18/hits-not-concussions-cause-cte/ Hits, Not Concussions, Cause CTE], Boston University School of Public, Jan. 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.menshealth.com/health/a21346159/should-kids-play-football/ We Know Football Is Dangerous. So Why Are We Still Letting Our Sons Play It?], ''Men's Health'', Andrew Lawrence, July 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a 2018 study found that each year an athlete played tackle football before age 12 predicted earlier onset of CTE symptoms by an average of two-and-a half-years, but not symptom severity.  These CTE symptoms include cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems.&lt;ref name="Study finds youth football tied to earlier symptoms of CTE, ESPN, April 30, 2018"&gt;[http://www.espn.com/moresports/story/_/id/23367461/study-finds-youth-football-tied-earlier-cte "Study finds youth football tied to earlier symptoms of CTE,"] ESPN, April 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annals of Neurology, 30 April 2018"&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25245 Age of First Exposure to Tackle Football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy], ''Annals of Neurology'', Michael L.

'''Dehler Park''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Billings, Montana]]. It is primarily used for [[baseball]] and is the home of the [[Billings Mustangs]] in the [[Pioneer Baseball League|Pioneer League]]. It is also the home field of the [[Montana State University Billings]] Yellowjackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uken|first1=Cindy|title=8 years later, baseball fans still herald presence of $13.7 million Dehler Park|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/years-later-baseball-fans-still-herald-presence-of-million-dehler/article_ce4bff08-c2e0-571a-8924-b03b11dc42e5.html|website=BillingsGazette.com|publisher=The Billings Gazette|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark opened on June 29, 2008 and has a capacity of 3,071 people (6,000 including standing room only).  It replaced [[Cobb Field]] which was a fixture in Billings since the 1930s.  The groundbreaking ceremony took place March 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="Officials break ground"&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials Break Ground on New Billings Ballpark|url=http://billings.mustangs.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070322&amp;content_id=194759&amp;vkey=news_t513&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t513|publisher=Billings Mustangs|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firstpitchatdehler.gif|thumbnail|left|125px|First pitch, June 29, 2008]]The stadium was named by Billings businessman Jon Dehler, who purchased the naming rights in 2007 to honor his father, Billy Joe Dehler.&lt;ref name="ballpark"&gt;{{cite news |title=Patron of the Game|url=http://www.helenair.com/articles/2008/03/01/local/top/50lo_030108_baseball.txt|newspaper=[[Independent Record|Helena Independent Record]]|date=March 1, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park still has part of Cobb Field included, as a section down the right field line includes some of the same bench seating used at the old stadium. Outside of that and the over 2,500+ individual seats are two grass berm areas for picnic seating. Patrons can walk around the entire field thanks to an outfield terrace, which is also home to those who buy a standing room-only ticket. Theoretically the stadium could feasibly hold well over 6,000 people with a large standing room-only crowd.

The first event at the stadium was on June 29, 2008, an [[American Legion#1920s|American Legion baseball]] game between the Billings Scarlets and Bozeman Bucks. The Bucks led 10–3 when the game was suspended after seven innings due to malfunctions with the lights. It was completed at [[Pirtz Field]], the local Legion Ballpark, the following night with the Bucks winning 16–3.&lt;ref name="firstgame"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarlets Earn Split with Bozeman |url=http://billingsgazette.net/articles/2008/07/01/sports/local/62-prepscarlets.txt |newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]] |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[home run]], hit by Matt Comer of the Bucks, was retrieved by a man riding a bicycle outside the stadium. After some speculation as to what would become of the ball, the owner of the ball came forth and agreed to donate the ball to the Billings Parks and Recreation Department for a Dehler Park Hall of Fame display.&lt;ref name="firsthr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dehler Park's First Home Run Ball |first=Ed |last=Kemmick |url=http://billingsgazette.net/articles/2008/07/02/news/local/20-firstball.txt |newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]] |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30 the park hosted local [[Little League]] championship games before the [[Billings Mustangs]] and [[Great Falls Voyagers]] met in the first professional baseball game at the park on July 1.&lt;ref name="bpr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Play Ball!

Attendance for the game was 3,749.&lt;ref name="mustangs"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fans soak up Mustangs game|first=Zach|last=Benoit|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/fans-soak-up-mustangs-game/article_9ba1e339-3257-522f-8a0b-858c48224077.html|newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]]|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1º de Agosto vs TP Mazembe post-match incident==
Five people were reportedly killed after the 45.000 capacity crowd match on Saturday 15th September 2018, including two children who were trampled and/or suffocated to death while exiting the stadium. Before the match begun, supporters called a radio station urging the organization to open all gates after the match ended for fear of a tragedy and after going through similar ordeals in the past. The Angolan Ministry of Youth and Sports in a statement regreted the incident, expressed condolences to the relatives and vowed to launch an investigation. On their part, the club's management promised to assist the relatives in funeral expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/desporto/2018/8/38/Football-Sports-ministry-regrets-stadium-stampede,6b10dda3-93a7-4029-a245-977cfd549c21.html |title=Football: Sports ministry regrets stadium stampede |publisher=ANGOP Angolan News Agency|date=17 Sep 2018 |accessdate= 17 Sep 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/desporto/2018/8/38/Futebol-MINJUD-lamenta-tragedia-estadio-Novembro,4f821296-2cd6-41f1-9b9e-4dc4a9a184cd.html |title=Futebol: MINJUD lamenta tragédia no estádio 11 de Novembro |publisher=ANGOP Angolan News Agency|date=17 Sep 2018 |accessdate= 17 Sep 2018 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primeiroagosto.com/index.php/component/k2/item/4404-nota-de-condol%C3%AAncia |title=Nota de condolência |publisher=primeiroagosto.com|date=14 Sep 2018 |accessdate= 17 Sep 2018 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FC Civics Windhoek''' is a [[Football in Namibia|Namibian football]] club based in [[Windhoek]]. The '''CIVICS''' play in the highest division of Namibian football, the [[Namibia Premier League]]. The club has its home in [[Khomasdal]], in the north of the Namibian capital Windhoek.

From 2000 the club is also known as '''Buschschule Civics'''.

They play their home games at [[Sam Nujoma Stadium]] in [[Katutura]], Windhoek.

FC Civics were founded by a group of young students in 1983, who initially named the team after a local street&amp;nbsp;– ''Bethlehem Boys''. The club later became the ''Mighty Civilians'' before being recast again as ''Civics''. Even today, the bulk of the squad comes either from Khomasdal or the neighbouring township of [[Katutura]].

Over the past few years, residents of this underprivileged area have charted the rise of Civics from a useful street team to Namibia's top club. One of the key figures in that success story is Helmut Scharnowski, who hails from the northern German city of [[Flensburg]].

The stadium got its present image in 2001 when the stands where covered by a roof. The current capacity of the stadium is 3,782 covered seats. With the standing area included the stadium could hold up to 5,500 people for important club matches.

==Football==
The stadium is mainly used for football and is the home ground of football club [[NŠ Mura]]. Previously, the stadium was used by [[NK Mura]] and [[ND Mura 05]], the clubs that were dissolved in 2005 and 2013, respectively. So far, the stadium has hosted two matches of the [[Slovenia national football team]] and was part of two [[Slovenian Football Cup|Slovenian Cup]] finals. In 2011, the stadium was used by the [[Football Association of Slovenia]] as one of the main venues for hosting the youth tournaments for U17 and U19 national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nogomania.com/Slovenski-Nogomet/Novica/Zacetek-kvalifikacij-U19.aspx | title = Začetek kvalifikacij U19  | publisher = Nogomania | accessdate = 6 February 2011 | language = Slovenian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foley Field''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Athens, Georgia]], [[United States]]. It is the home field of the [[University of Georgia]] Bulldogs [[college baseball]] team.  The stadium holds 3,291 people.

Foley Field was built in 1966.  The stadium was renovated in 1990, the same year that the University of Georgia won the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.  Since that renovation, Georgia owns a 378–193–1 (.660) record there (through the 2006 season).

Foley Field hosted the [[1987 Southeastern Conference Baseball Tournament]], won by [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State]].

More recently, Foley Field has hosted four NCAA regional tournaments in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, and in 2018.  In all four years, the Bulldogs' baseball team advanced to the College World Series.  Super Regionals were also hosted in 2001 featuring Florida State University, in 2006 against the University of South Carolina, and in 2008 with North Carolina State University as the guest.  All three super regionals were won by Georgia, two games to one.  The Bulldogs own a record of 20–7 in NCAA post season games held at Foley Field.  They also set a 16–0 mark in elimination games with a 17–8 win on June 8, 2008 to earn a trip to [[Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium]].

Several attendance records have been set in recent years, including in both Super Regionals hosted by the stadium.  First, 7th-ranked Georgia defeated 10th-ranked [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State]] 8-7 in front of 4,290 spectators on June 2, 2001.

'''Freedom Hall''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on the grounds of the [[Kentucky Exposition Center]], which is owned by the [[Commonwealth#US states|Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]]. It is best known for its use as a [[basketball]] arena, serving as the home of the [[Louisville Cardinals|University of Louisville Cardinals]] [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|men's team]] from 1956 to 2010, the [[Kentucky Colonels]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] from 1970 until the [[ABA-NBA merger]] in June 1976, and the Louisville Cardinals women's team from its inception in 1975 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide.provations.com/louisville/womensbb2010#pg161 |title=Records: Home/Attendance |work=2010–11 Louisville Cardinals Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=University of Louisville Sports information |format=PDF |page=159 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}} The women's team used Freedom Hall as its primary home from its first season, 1975–76, through 1980–81. It then began using a series of smaller arenas, both on campus and off, for nearly two decades, though it used Freedom Hall at least once every season except in 1993–94. The team again made Freedom Hall its primary home starting in 1998–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom Hall's last regular tenant was the [[Kentucky Stickhorses]] of the [[North American Lacrosse League]], who used it from 2011 until the team folded in 2013.

The arena lost its status as Kentuckiana's main indoor sporting and concert venue when the downtown [[KFC Yum! Center]] opened in 2010.  It is still used regularly, however, hosting concerts, horse shows, conventions, and basketball games.

==History==
Freedom Hall was completed in 1956 in the newly opened [[Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center]] located {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Downtown Louisville]]. It received its name as the result of a statewide essay contest sponsored by the State Fair Board and the [[American Legion]]. Charlotte Owens, a senior at [[DuPont Manual High School]], submitted the winning entry over 6,500 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyexpo.org/history.html|title=Kentucky Exposition Center — Visitors|author=|date=|website=kyexpo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for the nation's premier equestrian competition, the [[Kentucky State Fair World's Championship Horse Show]], the floor length and permanent seating were designed specifically for the almost {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}}-long show ring (in comparison, a regulation hockey rink is {{convert|200|ft|m}} long, and a basketball court is only 94 feet). The [[North American International Livestock Exposition]] also is held there each November. [[Muhammad Ali]] fought his first professional fight at Freedom Hall when he won a six-round decision over [[Tunney Hunsaker]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Freedom Hall was also one of the major stops on the Motortown (later MOTOWN) traveling music revue during the early and mid-1960s.

[[Judgment Day (2000)]] was also held at the Freedom Hall.

==Tenant history==
The [[Kentucky Colonels]] fielded successful teams during their tenure at Freedom Hall, winning the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) Championship in the 1974-75 season and reaching the ABA Finals two other times. The 1970-71 team played in the ABA Championship Finals, losing to the [[Utah Stars]] in 7 games. The 1972-73 team advanced to the Finals again, losing to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 7 games. The Colonels were disbanded when the ABA merged with the [[National Basketball Association]] in 1976. Hall of Fame players [[Dan Issel]] and [[Artis Gilmore]] played for the Colonels during their successful run. Hall of Fame Coach [[Hubie Brown]] coached the Colonels Championship team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142515/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the facility was refurbished, including lowering the floor to allow maximum capacity to increase from 16,664 to 18,865 for basketball. It was the full-time home of Cardinal men's basketball from the 1957-58 season to 2010, with the team winning 82% of home games in 50+ seasons. U of L was ranked in the Top 5 in attendance for the past 25 years, with 16 of the last 19 years averaging more than 100% of capacity.

In addition to being the home of the Cardinals, Freedom Hall has hosted [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] games ten times, including six [[Final Four]]s between 1958 and 1969. The arena has also hosted 11 conference tournaments, nine [[Metro Conference]] Tournaments and two [[Conference USA]] tournaments—2001 and 2003. It has also hosted the [[Sweet Sixteen (KHSAA State Basketball Championship)|Kentucky Boys' High School State Basketball Tournament]] (also known as the Sweet 16) 23 times, including every year from 1965 to 1978. In 1984, the floor of the arena was lowered about {{convert|10|ft|m}} to increase the capacity of the arena from 16,613 to its current figure. In the 1996-97 season Freedom Hall averaged an attendance of 19,590 surpassing arena capacity. Freedom Hall hosts the Championship tractor pull every February during the National Farm Machinery Show.

In November 2008 the [[Louisville Fire]] of [[af2]] ceased operations. The Louisville Fire was an Arena Football team who played in Freedom Hall.

On the lower level is the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame where an engraved bronze plaque honors each inductee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyathletichalloffame.org/services.htm#Walls+Of+Fame|title=Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame|first=AllWebCo Design|last=http://allwebcodesign.com/|date=|website=www.kyathletichalloffame.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Louisville men's basketball team played their final game at FH in front of a record crowd of 20,138 on March 6, 2010 against Syracuse University, the #1 ranked team in the nation; Louisville won in an upset 78-68.

The arena began to gain new tenants in 2012 with the addition of the [[Kentucky Stickhorses]], and in 2013, with the addition of the Kentucky Xtream. However, the Kentucky Stickhorses folded in 2014 after the lack of wins and the lack of attendance. The Kentucky Xtream was suspended in the middle of the season, with other teams playing their remaining games as the team's fate is still in the air.

'''Golf instruction''' is the art of equipping and training golfers to play better golf through improved awareness of swing cause and effects as a result of the actions by their body, the club, and their effect on the golf ball. Most great golfers have a few common elements that make them great including: proper intentionality, swing repeatability to produce an action that fits the golfers intentionality, and a strong level of automaticity for long lasting enjoyment of the game [[golf]]. Golf instruction is unique as golf consists of five primary skills: shots from a tee (most notable: driving that uses a driver), full shots from the ground (mostly known as "iron shots", pitching (or 3/4  shots designed for distance control, chipping (short shots around the green the require less than a full swing), putting (1 club preferably "the putter") and course strategy or gamesmanship.

Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability, but also knowledge of the [[rules of golf|rules and etiquette of the game]]. Golf instruction offered on many platforms in the United States including: the PGA of America, GolfTEC, and independent golfers who "may" or "may not" have credentials that are recognized by credible teachers certified sources such as the PGA of America. Although there are many great golf instructors in the United States,  who are PGA Class A Professionals, not all great instructors carry this status nor find it a major determiner of golf instruction proficiency.

Golf Instruction can be wide ranging, but many great modern day instructors are able to diagnose and prescribe swing frustrations accurately and present a clear fix that encourages the golfer in the discovery of lasting repeatability from the specific ailment that "plagued" them from a sound repeatable swing to play a golf course successfully (varying terms of success as a golfer ) Many modern instructors include the following in their diagnosis
1. visual feedback through video and bio motion analysis 
2. personalized golf club fitting for individual body and swing types
3. on-course play under real conditions
4. mental performance development
5. golf specific body conditioning for optimal golf bio-mechanics

Beginning players can start lesson in several ways, but most do so in either a group or individual setting, covering the five primary skills of golf as noted above [[golf swing]]. Golf is an asymmetrical exercise that can break body balances, requiring also adequate exercises to keep the balance in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn Hyejung (November 11, 2012), ''World Class Fitness Trainers, [[John Sitaras]]'', [[Golf Digest]] (Korean edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Experienced recreational players often return for instruction, either to fix a specific problem they are encountering or to improve their game. Reconstruction of a golf swing to reach a high level of play often involves series of lessons over an extended period of time. Junior golfers often begin receiving instruction by age 10 or younger, and often retain private teachers even when coached on a high school golf team.

Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right over the years, including [[Harvey Penick]], [[Jack Grout]], [[Dick Harmon]], [[David Leadbetter (golf instructor)|David Leadbetter]], [[Butch Harmon]], [[Gary Wiren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianjourneys.org/blog/masters-golf-tournament-interview-with-dr-gary-wiren-180950558/|title=Masters Golf Tournament – Interview with Dr. Gary Wiren|first=Gary Wiren,Patrick|last=Wagner|publisher=Smithsonian Journeys}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hank Haney]], [[Chip Thomson]], [[Sean Foley (golf instructor)|Sean Foley]], Quentin Patterson and [[Mike Bennett and Andy Plummer]]. Some of the teachers maintain teaching facilities or schools where they or their disciples use their methods or systems. A few instructors focus solely on a particular aspect of the sport, such as [[Dave Pelz]] with the short game. Some famous golfers have been tightly bound with their instructor, such as [[Jack Nicklaus]] with Jack Grout, while in other cases golfers have made high-profile switches from one instructor to another, such as [[Tiger Woods]] moving from Butch Harmon to various other instructors.

Recreational golfers are constantly seeking tips on how to improve, and the major golf publications such as ''[[Golf Magazine]]'' and ''[[Golf Digest]]'' devote substantial portions of their pages to instructional material of various kinds, often written by top-level instructors.  Even television broadcasts of professional golf tournaments often contain short instructional segments, delivered by commentators who are also instructors such as [[Peter Kostis]].

Golf instruction may be augmented by training aids such as specially weighting or jointed clubs, putting cups for practice on the den room carpet, mini practice tees with feedback for use in garages, ''et cetera''. Some training aids are sold via television [[infomercials]] and the more peculiar varieties were satirized in the 1996 film ''[[Tin Cup]]''.

Golf instruction is no guarantee of success or improved play in the game. Bad mechanics can be deeply ingrained in a subject's swing, and psychological factors can also hinder progress. The 2009 [[Golf Channel]] program ''The Haney Project: Charles Barkley'' showcased some of these issues, as Hank Haney attempted to fix former [[NBA]] great [[Charles Barkley]]'s infamously bad swing.&lt;ref name="gd-haney"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.golfdigest.com/instruction/2009/03/charlesbarkley | title=The Haney Project: Can Hank Haney fix this swing? | author=Rudy, Matthew | publisher=''[[Golf Digest]]'' | date=March 2009 | accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hennon Stadium has been home to the Western Carolina University baseball program for 32 years.  The baseball facility was officially renamed Childress Field at Hennon Stadium in a dedication ceremony on April 23, 1994.

In 1978, the WCU baseball program moved approximately 200 yards to the east from Haywood Field. Bill Haywood, head baseball coach from 1969 through 1981, and Mr. E.J. Whitmire, a baseball supporter and benefactor from [[Franklin, North Carolina]] were the driving forces behind the building of the facility.  The initial cost of the facility in 1978 was $125,000.  It was named in honor of the late Ronnie G. Childress, who was a special friend of the baseball program.  The James B. Childress family established the Ronnie Childress Memorial Fund Scholarships in 1975 and scholarships have been awarded annually to select WCU baseball players since the fund's inception.

Hennon Stadium has been renovated several times since its construction and has become a showplace of [[Southern Conference]] baseball. Permanent bleacher seating, grandstand chair back seats, and a press box were installed prior to 1990 season. A new scoreboard, concession stands, rest rooms, and a new infield
were added prior to the 1991 season.

Childress Field was refurbished in 2003 with nearly $500,000 worth of improvements that included new drainage and irrigation, a [[Bermuda grass]] playing surface, a new warning track, and a new infield playing surface.  The baseball field and stadium received yet another renovation&lt;ref&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wcar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/CatsPause_StadiumRenovations.pdf grfx.cstv.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011(of approx. $600,000)which included dugout upgrades, the entire stadium painted, new lower-level seating as the stadium was moved 14 feet closer to home plate to accommodate two rows of new chair-back seats. A 36-inch red brick wall was built that stretches between the dugouts in front of the new Yankee Stadium-style slatted seats. A 48-inch brick wall stretchs from each dugout to the outfield fence down the left and right field lines. A batter’s eye has been attached to the centerfield fence and the “purple monster” in left field was repainted.

A new clubhouse on the first-base side and stadium seating design are currently in planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wcar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/WCUBASE09_MediaGuide.pdf 2009 Western Carolina Catamounts Baseball Media Guide] pp. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Conference Tournament==
Western Carolina hosted the 1984 and 1986 Southern Conference baseball tournaments at the facility.

'''Majestic Park''' (1908–18) was one of the first [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]] facilities, located at the corner of Belding Street and Carson Street in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. Majestic Park was the spring training site of the [[Boston Red Sox]] and their star pitcher [[Babe Ruth]] (1909–10, 1912–18), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1910–11), [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1910) and [[St. Louis Browns]] (1911). The location later became the site of Dean Field (1935–47) and Jaycee Park (1947–present). Dean Field served as home to the '''Rogers Hornsby Baseball College'''.

The [[Hot Springs Bathers]] minor league team and the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1948–51) minor league Spring Training were held at Jaycee Park. Jaycee Park hosted the 1952 [[Negro League World Series]] and a 1953 exhibition game featuring [[Jackie Robinson]].&lt;ref name="arkbaseball1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Archives |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Archives |website=Arkbaseball.com |date=1963-05-23 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site can claim games featuring both [[List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders|All-time Home Run record]] holders, [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Hank Aaron]] as among those who have played at the site. In 1914, [[Babe Ruth]] was just beginning his career (as a dominant left-handed pitcher) for the Red Sox, while a young Aaron played in the 1952 Negro League World Series.&lt;ref name="arkbaseball1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkansas.baseballyakker.com/?page_id=221 |title=Baseball In Arkansas Project » Majestic Park |website=Arkbaseball.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arkansasdiamonds.wordpress.com/arkansas-diamonds/miscellaneous-ballparks/majestic-park/ |title=Majestic Park &amp;#124; My Blog |website=Arkansasdiamonds.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the site has four historical plaques, as part of the '''Hot Springs Historic Baseball Trail.''' Majestic Field, [[Rogers Hornsby]], Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron each have historical plaques on the site.&lt;ref name="marketwired1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/historic-baseball-trail-documenting-hot-springs-as-birthplace-spring-baseball-will-open-1636073.htm |title=Historic Baseball Trail Documenting Hot Springs as Birthplace of Spring Baseball Will Open on March 29; 45 Percent of Hall of Fame, Other Legendary Players Included |website=Marketwired.com |date=2012-03-26 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and  Hank Aaron, others who performed at the site include [[Ty Cobb]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Gil Hodges]], [[Harry Hooper]], [[Cy Young]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], [[Herb Pennock]], [[Tris Speaker]], and [[Walter Johnson]].&lt;ref name="arkbaseball2"/&gt; [[The Sporting News]] (1998) ranking of the greatest players ever listed: Babe Ruth (1), Ty Cobb (3), Walter Johnson (4), Hank Aaron (5) and Rogers Hornsby (9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=100 Greatest Baseball Players by The Sporting News : A Legendary List by Baseball Almanac |website=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball in Hot Springs==
Often called the "birthplace" of Spring Training baseball, Hot Springs first welcomed Major League Baseball in 1886, when the [[Chicago White Stockings]] (now the [[Chicago Cubs]]), brought their coaches and players to the city in preparation for the upcoming season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotsprings.org/pages/history-buffs/ |title=arlington hotel, oaklawn, gangster museum, hot springs baseball trail, historical landmarks &amp;#124; Hot Springs, Arkansas |website=Hotsprings.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6221 |title=Major League Spring Training in Hot Springs |publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team President [[Albert Spalding]] (owner of Spalding Sporting Goods) and the team's player/manager [[Cap Anson]], thought the city was an ideal training site for the players. The first baseball location was '''Hot Springs Baseball Grounds'''. Many other Major League teams followed and began training in Hot Springs.  Needing venues for teams to use, [[Whittington Park (baseball)|Whittington Park]] was built in 1894, followed by Majestic Park (1908) and [[Fogel Field (Hot Springs)|Fogel Field]] (1912).&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas1"/&gt; 134 members of the Baseball Hall of Fame are documented to have trained or played, in Hot Springs.&lt;ref name="marketwired1"/&gt;

==History of Majestic Field Site==
In 1908, the [[Detroit Tigers]] created a practice baseball field at the site. In 1909, Majestic Park was built at the field by Boston Red Sox owner [[John I. Taylor]], who signed a five-year lease on the property as a Spring Training location. Trolleys were routed to turn around in front of the park. The Majestic name came from the '''Majestic Hotel''' in Hot Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archives.arkansasnews.com/search/level+2+trauma+center+for+arkansas/page/2179/blank/page/1469/void%280%29;/*1235661623495*/page/1854/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307132856/http://archives.arkansasnews.com/search/level+2+trauma+center+for+arkansas/page/2179/blank/page/1469/void%280%29;/*1235661623495*/page/1854/# |archive-date=2016-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Taylor would construct [[Fenway Park]] for the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray |first=James |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1993/03/22/128244/when-baseball-sprang-for-hot-springs-nearly-a-century-ago-the-springtime-mecca-for-many-major-league-players-was-a-spa-in-arkansas |title=When Baseball Sprang for Hot Springs |website=Si.com |date=1993-03-22 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chapters.sabr.org/boston/projects/research/59-the-land-of-hot-waters |title=The Land of Hot Waters |website=Chapters.sabr.org |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fenwaypark100.org/2012/03/27/all-those-springs-ago/ |title=All Those Springs Ago..... |website=Fenwaypark100.org |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Red Sox (1909-1910, 1912–18), Cincinnati Reds (1910-1911), Brooklyn Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (AL) (1911) held Spring Training Camp at the original Majestic Park.

The Boston Red Sox were a dominant team, winning four [[World Series]] Championships in their time at Majestic Park (1912, 1915, 1916 and 1918). It was in 1918 spring training that the Red Sox first began to use Babe Ruth in the field, instead of exclusively at pitcher, to take advantage of his hitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/ |title=Boston Red Sox Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 1918, the [[St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway]], owners of the Majestic Park property cancelled the Red Sox lease for 1919 to utilize the ballpark area for railroad needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fenwayparkdiaries.com/1918%20red%20sox/1918%20spring%20training.htm |title=1918 BOSTON RED SOX (SPRING TRAINING) |website=Fenwayparkdiaries.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, the original Majestic Park facility was demolished, leading to two other fields on the property that had ties to the Major Leagues: Dean Field and Jaycee Park.&lt;ref name="arkbaseball2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Majestic+Park |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Majestic Park |website=Arkbaseball.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relocated field was renamed "Dean Field" in 1938 after Hall of Famer [[Dizzy Dean]] and his brother "Daffy" [[Paul Dean (baseball)|Paul Dean]]. Jaycee Park was built on the adjacent south side of the lot in 1947 to replace [[Ban Johnson Park]], which was located across town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Jaycee+Park |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Jaycee Park |website=Arkbaseball.com |date=1963-05-23 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arkbaseball3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Dean+Field&amp;structure=Professional+Baseball |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Dean Field |website=Arkbaseball.com |date=1963-05-23 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dizzy Dean plaque HOF.jpg|thumb|left|Dizzy Dean plaque HOF. "Dean Field" was named for Dean and his brother Paul "Daffy" Dean]]

When Dean Field (1935-1947) and Jaycee Park (1947-Present) evolved, they hosted the '''Rogers Hornsby Baseball College''', the '''George Barr Umpire School''', the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1949–52) Minor League Spring Training and the [[Hot Springs Bathers]] as tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Dean+Field|title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia - Dean Field|website=Arkbaseball.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkansas.baseballyakker.com/?page_id=208|title=Log In ‹ Baseball In Arkansas Project — WordPress|website=Arkansas.baseballyakker.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor league Bathers (1947-1955) were a [[Cotton States League]] team that was an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox (1947-1951), [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1954) and the [[Kansas City Athletics]] (1955). [[Paul Dean (baseball)|Paul Dean]] Managed the 1954 team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?city=Hot+Springs&amp;state=AR&amp;country=US|title=Hot Springs, Arkansas Encyclopedia - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=a4497b7c|title=1954 Hot Springs Bathers Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball Schools===
The '''Roy Doan Baseball School''' operated from 1934–38, attracting hundreds of students and utilized Dean Field and other locations throughout Hot Springs.&lt;ref name="arkbaseball3"/&gt; In 1939, Hall of Fame player and manager Rogers Hornsby, a former instructor with Roy Doan, started his own '''Rogers Hornsby Baseball College.''' Hornsby's six-week event ran until 1952, annually attracting 100-200 prospective professionals and numerous major league scouts. Cy Young, Jimmie Foxx, Tris Speaker and [[Schoolboy Rowe]] were among the instructors. '''The George Barr Umpire School,''' the first ever training school for aspiring umpires, operated in Hot Springs through 1940, being held in conjunction with the baseball schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=George+Barr+Umpire+School |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; George Barr Umpire School |website=Arkbaseball.com |date=1963-05-23 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Ban+Johnson+Field |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Ban Johnson Field |website=Arkbaseball.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsbbt.toursphere.com/en/20-rogers-hornsby-76279.html |title=Hot Springs Baseball Tour |website=Hsbbt.toursphere.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Dean+Field |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Dean Field |website=Arkbaseball.com |date=1963-05-23 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Babe Ruth===
Babe Ruth played at Majestic Park for six seasons. In 1914, the lefty pitcher first faced Major League players as a young minor leaguer. Ruth would make the Red Sox' major league roster in 1915 and establish himself as a star pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adomites |first=Paul |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/babe-ruth6.htm |title=Babe Ruth's First Spring Training - Babe Ruth &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |website=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, during Spring Training, Ruth played first base as an emergency measure in a game against Brooklyn at Whittington Field (now [[Ban Johnson Park]]). The game helped change baseball history. Ruth hit two home runs that day and the second was a reported 573-foot home run that landed in the [[Arkansas Alligator Farm]] across the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/35475 |title=Home Run That Changed Baseball |website=Roadsideamerica.com |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/babe-ruth-hit-500-foot-homer-into-alligator-farm/c-268509166 |title=100 years ago, Babe Ruth became Babe Ruth with a 500-foot homer into an Alligator Farm |first=Matt |last=Monagan |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://billjenkinsonbaseball.webs.com/hotspringsbaseball.htm |title=The Official Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail |first=Bill |last=Jenkinson |date=2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Red Sox began to use Ruth as both a pitcher and a hitter. With Ruth regularly in the 1918 lineup, he led the American League with 11 home runs. He also pitched to a 13–7 record and the Red Sox won the [[1918 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ruthba01.shtml |title=Babe Ruth Statistics and History |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sold to the New York Yankees in 1920, Ruth went on to total 714 Home Runs, a record that stood until broken by [[Hank Aaron]].&lt;ref name="baseball-reference.com"/&gt;

===Jackie Robinson===
On October 22, 1953, Jackie Robinson played in an exhibition game at Jaycee Park. Having broken Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, Robinson and the some other Major League players (including his Dodgers teammate Gil Hodges) toured, calling themselves '''Jackie Robinson's All-Stars.''' Robinson's squad played the Negro American League All-Stars that day, losing 14-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkbaseball.com/tiki-index.php?page=Jackie+Robinson%E2%80%99s+All-Stars+Exhibitions |title=Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Jackie Robinson's All-Stars Exhibitions |website=Arkbaseball.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there is a plaque at the site as part of the "Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail"  honoring the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hotspringsbaseballtrail.com/see-the-trail/jackie-robinson/ |title=Jackie Robinson - Hot Springs Arkansas Historic Baseball Trail |website=Hotspringsbaseballtrail.com |date=1953-10-22 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hank Aaron: Negro League World Series===
[[File:Hank Aaron 1960.png|thumb|Hank Aaron, Milwaukee Braves, 1960]]
In 1952, as referenced in a plaque at the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hotspringsbaseballtrail.com/see-the-trail/hank-aaron/ |title=Hank Aaron - Hot Springs Arkansas Historic Baseball Trail |website=Hotspringsbaseballtrail.com |date=1952-10-01 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18-year old shortstop Hank Aaron played for the [[Negro League]] [[Indianapolis Clowns]] against the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] at Jaycee Park in the [[Negro League World Series]]. The World Series was eventually won by the Clowns, with Aaron hitting 5 Home runs and batting over .400. The 1952 World Series was also the last for the Negro Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hotspringsbaseballtrail.com/see-the-trail/ |title=See The Trail - Hot Springs Arkansas Historic Baseball Trail |website=Hotspringsbaseballtrail.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovered by the Clowns while playing for a semi-pro team (Mobile Black Bears) in a game against them, they signed Aaron in April, 1951. After his performance in the Negro League World Series, Aaron signed with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. Hank Aaron would eventually become baseball's all-time Home Run leader, with 755 career Home Runs, breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 on April 8, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/6/Aaron-Hank-Played-in-Negro-League-Major-League.html |title=Hank Aaron - Played In Negro League And Major League - Babe Ruth Accomplishments, Home, and Braves - JRank Articles |website=Sports.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coe.k-state.edu/annex/nlbemuseum/history/players/aaron.html |title=Negro Leagues Baseball eMuseum: Personal Profiles: Henry "Hank" Aaron |website=Coe.k-state.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy,Leslie A.

In 1953, the Hot Springs Boys and Girls Club built and opened a youth facility on the parcel at 109 West Belding Street, where it still remains today. The '''Jaycee Park Baseball Complex''' and the surrounding fields are utilized for youth baseball and softball. The complex now has eight fields, with Jaycee Park remaining as the largest, with the original 1st base side cement bleachers still intact.&lt;ref name="arkbaseball2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsbgc.org/ |title=Boys and Girls Club of Hot Springs |publisher=HSBGC |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arkansasdiamonds.wordpress.com/arkansas-diamonds/former-professional-ballparks/jaycee-park/ |title=Jaycee Park &amp;#124; My Blog |website=Arkansasdiamonds.wordpress.com |date=1947-05-01 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, as part of the '''Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail''', there are four plaques that have been erected at the site: Majestic Field, Hank Aaron, Jackie Robinson and Rogers Hornsby:

The Majestic plaque reads: 

{{Quote box|quote='''Majestic Field''' Built in 1909 as the Boston Red Sox training center, this field was also used by the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers. In March 1918, during batting practice, Babe Ruth hit many home runs over the distant center field fence, predicting his change from pitcher to slugging outfielder. Cy Young, Tris Speaker, Smoky Joe Wood and many others also trained here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hotspringsbaseballtrail.com/see-the-trail/majestic-field/ |title=Majestic Field - Hot Springs Arkansas Historic Baseball Trail |website=Hotspringsbaseballtrail.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30em|align=center}}

Hank Aaron's plaque reads: 

{{Quote box|quote=At this field on October 1, 1952, 18-year old Hank Aaron and the Indianapolis Clowns played in one of 12 games of the Negro League World Series against the Birmingham Black Barons.

The plaque for Jackie Robinson says the following:

The '''McCasland Field House''' is a multi-purpose [[List of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] on the [[University of Oklahoma]] main campus in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. Home of the [[college basketball|basketball]] [[Oklahoma Sooners|Sooners]] until 1975, the Field House currently hosts the men's [[wrestling]], women's [[volleyball]], and men's [[gymnastics]] teams. The Field House is named for T. Howard McCasland, a two-sport star who was the captain of the 1916 [[basketball]] team and an end for the [[American football|football]] team. 

The facility opened with a basketball game between the Sooners and the [[University of Kansas]] [[Kansas Jayhawks|Jayhawks]] on January 13, 1928, which the Sooners won 45-19.  When it opened, the facility held over 5,000 people.

It is rather unknown, these days on campus, that the Fieldhouse once witnessed concerts by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Elvis Presley]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

As the campus was constructed around the Field House, parking for fans disappeared&lt;ref&gt;Upchurch, Jay. [http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/winter2003/story.asp?ID=40 The House That Basketball Built] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107125901/http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/winter2003/story.asp?ID=40 |date=2004-01-07 }}. ''Sooner Magazine'', Winter 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and attendance at games dwindled as well. After the [[Lloyd Noble Center]] opened in 1975 and the basketball teams moved south to the new facility, the Field House seemed forgotten and neglected. 

Plans for refurbishment began in the 1990s along with other campus improvements,&lt;ref&gt;Burr, Carol. [http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/summer2002/thams.asp?ID=57 Under Construction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030000000/http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/summer2002/thams.asp?ID=57 |date=October 30, 2005 }}. ''Sooner Magazine'', Summer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and fundraising began in earnest in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, Carol. [http://www.oufoundation.org/PN/winter2004/ Dreams of Great Expectations Realized]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Priority Magazine'', Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the initial phase of a $6 million renovation project was completed, including the building's first-ever climate control system, refurbishment of the historic wood floor, new chair-back and retractable seats. The facility had to be completely rewired, not only to handle the new heating and air-conditioning systems (its first ever) and the new lighting and state-of-the-art sound and video systems, but to bring the building up to current [[National Electrical Code (US)|electrical code standards]]. 

The next phase of renovations to the Field House, scheduled to be completed by 2012, include locker room upgrades, additions of restrooms and concessions, and expansion of the wrestling practice facility from its current {{convert|4500|sqft|m2}} to more than {{convert|8000|sqft|m2}}. Finally, all of the building's windows, a distinguishing feature of the Field House, will be replaced, along with the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Upchurch, Jay. ''New Digs''.

'''Podmežakla Hall''' (''Dvorana Podmežakla'') is an [[indoor arena|indoor sporting arena]] located in [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice]], [[Slovenia]]. It is the home of the [[HDD Jesenice]] [[ice hockey]] team and its affiliate [[HD Hidria Jesenice]].&lt;ref name="eurohockey.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eurohockey.com/arena/1218-dvorana-podmeakla-jesenice.html |title=Dvorana Podmežakla Jesenice |work=EuroHockey.com |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the site of the [[Triglav Trophy]], an annual international figure skating competition held each spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slovenia.info/?drugi_sporti=2124&amp;lng=2 |title=Športni park Podmežakla |work=Slovenia.info |publisher=Slovenian Tourist Board |accessdate=2011-03-29 |language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Podmežakla'' (literally 'below Mežakla') is derived from its location on the southwest bank of the [[Sava Dolinka|Sava]] River, directly below the [[Mežakla]] Plateau.

==History==
The hall was opened in 1978 and was expanded between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref name="jesenice"/&gt; In March 2011, the hall was closed after inspectors determined that the hockey club was allowed to host spectators on the newly built eastern stand without an official state permit for it. The state inspectors also determined that [[Jesenice, Jesenice|Jesenice municipality]] neglected to obtain permit for the new parts built during the last major renovation in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042430780 |title=Dvorana Podmežakla zaprta zaradi nespametnega odpiranja vzhodne tribune |author=Knez, Primož |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |work=[[Dnevnik (Slovenia)|Dnevnik]] |language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was renovated in 2013 for the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2013]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dnevnik.si/sport/kosarka/v-zgornjesavski-dolini-obljubljajo-eurobasket-se-bo-zapisal-v-jesenisko-zgodovino |title=V Zgornjesavski dolini obljubljajo: Eurobasket se bo zapisal v jeseniško zgodovino | date = 14 June 2013 | work = Dnevnik | accessdate = 15 June 2013 | language = Slovenian}} }&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shane Warne: The Musical''' is a musical comedy by [[Eddie Perfect]] based on the life of Australian [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]]. [[The Daily Telegraph]] described the musical as "a warts-and-all account of the spin bowler's controversy-laden career and roller-coaster personal life set to soul, rock, opera, gospel music – and even a bit of Bollywood."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malkin|first=Bonnie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/3699759/Shane-Warne-backs-Musical-based-on-his-life.html|title=Shane Warne backs musical based on his life|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The musical consists of two acts: the first act covering Warne's aborted [[Australian rules football]] career, his marriage and his rise to success as a Test cricketer while the controversial issues that Warne was involved in; such as his drug offence, infidelity and the [[John the bookmaker controversy]] feature in the second act. The musical finishes with a chorus "Everyone's a little bit like Shane".&lt;ref name="IndependentReview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/warnes-life-flashes-before-his-eyes--to-music-1060773.html|title=Warne's life flashes before his eyes – to music|last=Boztas|first=Senay|date=10 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical contains a series of songs about various incidents in Warne's life both on and off the cricket field, including:
*"The Tale Of Warne";
*"Run";
*"Get Offa The Couch";
*"How do you spell success? [[Australian Institute of Sport|AIS]]";
*"We're Going There";
*"Piss It All Away";
*"Hollywood";
*"[[Ball of the Century|The Ball]]";
*"Payin' Attention Now";
*"Dancing with the Stars";
*"We Never Cross The Line";
*"The Away Game";
*"Is The Sun The Moon?";
*"I'm Coming Home";
*"Shine Like Shane";
*"What About That, Shane?";
*"The Ashes";
*"Bunny in the headlights" (about [[Daryll Cullinan]]); and
*"What an SMS I’m in".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5544840.ece|title=Singing with Shane Warne|last=Gruber|first=Fiona|date=19 January 2009|work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
After five years of solo cabaret shows, Perfect had wanted to write a full-scale musical.  Seeking a subject, Perfect reflected that: "with every headline I read about Warnie, came the realisation that here was a simple yet complicated, positive yet flawed, honest but naive, charming, philandering, freakishly talented and endlessly divisive man. And that, I thought, is a great character."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/comedy/features/4015/shane-warne-the-musical-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]] presented a work-in-progress showing on 17 June 2007 at the Dunstan Playhouse, [[Adelaide Festival Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/71254&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2008 [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] included a further showing at the [[Hi Fi Bar and Ballroom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/85842&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The full Australian production, directed by [[Neil Armfield]] with choreography by [[Gideon Obarzanek]] and with Perfect in the title role, opened at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]] on 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/as-musical-fodder-king-of-spin-faces-the-first-test/2008/10/18/1223750404904.html|title=As musical fodder, king of spin faces the first test|last=Bailey|first=John|date=19 October 2008|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It toured to the [[Regal Theatre]] in Perth from 18 March 2009 and the [[Enmore Theatre]] in Sydney from 15 May 2009.

A 2013 revision included a new beginning and ending, new scenes and a revised structure, four new songs and new characters including Liz Hurley.  It played short seasons in June for the Adelaide Cabaret Festival at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Adelaide|Her Majesty’s Theatre]], then at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]] in Melbourne.  This production, directed by Simon Phillips, had a cast that included Perfect, [[Lisa McCune]], [[Shane Jacobson]] and [[Christie Whelan|Christie Whelan-Browne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/musicals/warne-out-not-even-a-halfchance-20130613-2o6g0.html|title=Warne out? Not even a half-chance|last=Mathieson|first=Craig|date=14 June 2013|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cast album was recorded during the season at Hamer Hall and released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://castalbums.org/recordings/Shane-Warne-The-Musical-2013-Concert-Cast/28211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While initially suspicious of the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/shane-warne-the-musical-1048567.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Marks|first=Kathy|date=3 December 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warne later gave his approval after watching the show, saying "I think Eddie and his team have written the musical in a respectful and sympathetic way, and that they have captured my fun, larrikin side."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

The musical has been able to draw an audience that would not normally attend musicals with Perfect saying "You see young blokes making their way to their seats carrying armfuls of beers for their mates, just like they do at the cricket. It's like Reformation theatre when people were buying oranges to throw at the actors – why shouldn’t they have fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=289963|title=Warne musical draws the blokes|date=2 February 2009|work=[[Daily Dispatch]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the musical have been mainly positive.
*''[[Herald Sun]]'': "[The musical] is a wild, funny, outrageous, and by the end, surprisingly moving account of the champion spin bowler's life so far. [...] Among the fun, there's genuine respect for [Warne's] enormous talent but it doesn't gloss over his personal failings."&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |title=Wicked wicket ways of Shane Warne: The Musical |last=Vickery |first=Colin |date=5 December 2008 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207162927/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24753094-2902,00.html |archivedate=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Independent]]'' "The mid-field marriage of a likeable star, fake bowling, plenty of sporting puns, and a moderate raunch factor had the crowds chuckling and clapping along. [...] [The musical makes] his life an appealingly debauched song and dance, playing with musical styles from nicely-harmonized gospel to gangsta rap."&lt;ref name="IndependentReview" /&gt;
*''Australian Stage'': "The story is thin, the songs are wordy and the sound wasn’t great, so many of the lyrics were lost. [...] Without wanting to cut down a tall poppy, there are certainly holes in the script and score. But who cares!? The performances by the ensemble cast are brilliant, the packed audience loved it, the upfront ''this-is-what-I-am-and-who-gives-a-shit-what-you-think-about-me'' attitude (reflecting Shane's own character) is refreshing, the show will bring in thousands of audience-goers who love sport and Shane, but rarely go to the theatre (which is fantastic), so what more can a new Australian musical do?"&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/melbourne/shane-warne-the-musical-2131.html|title=Shane Warne: The Musical|last=Kooperman|first=Paul|date=13 December 2008|work=Australian Stage Online|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gideon Haigh]], ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Perfect's vision is an almost unimprovable mingling of satire and homage, cheek and deference, music and comedy."&lt;ref name="HaighGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/12/shane-warne-the-musical|title=Warne takes centre stage again as spinner proves Perfect vehicle for satire|last=Haigh|first=Gideon|date=12 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">A '''skwal''' is the main piece of equipment used for skwalling, a hybrid sport combining the carving of [[skiing]] and riding feel of [[snowboarding]]. It is similar to a [[snowboard]] or [[monoski]] in that both feet are attached to the same board. On a skwal the feet are one in front of the other, in line with the direction the skwal is pointing in. This differs from snowboards (in which the feet are side-on to the direction of the board) and monoskis (in which the feet point in the direction of the board, but are side-by-side). 

[[File:Skwal.jpg|thumb|skwalling]]
== History ==
The skwal was invented by two [[France|French]] ski-school instructors [[:fr:Thias_Balmain|Patrick "Thias" Balmain]] and Manuel Jammes, with the first prototype appearing in 1992. They envisaged it as a way to offer different sensations to what skiing and [[snowboarding]] could offer, at a time when 'carving' skis were only just starting to take off.  A French company called Lacroix took an interest, recruited [[:fr:Thias_Balmain|Patrick Balmain]], and started producing skwals. A few years later, [[:fr:Thias_Balmain|Patrick]] left Lacroix and started his own skwal-making company. There are now several other makers of skwals, though the sport has never gained the widespread popularity its creators predicted - possibly due to the perceived difficulty of the sport. The sport is nonetheless gathering a few more adepts every year.

'''''Strikeforce: Melendez vs. Healy''''' was a planned [[mixed martial arts]] event that was to be held by [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]]. The event would have taken place on September 29, 2012 at the [[Power Balance Pavilion]] in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name="strikeforce63"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strikeforce.com/event/SF4 |title=Strikeforce: Melendez vs. Healy |publisher=strikeforce.com|date=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/29874/gilbert-melendez-vs-pat-healy-headlines-strikeforces-september-event.mma |title=Gilbert Melendez vs. Pat Healy headlines Strikeforce's September event |publisher=mmajunkie.com |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On September 23, 2012, Strikeforce announced it was cancelling this event, as [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] opted to not air it following lightweight champion Gilbert Melendez suffering a knee injury in training, taking him out of a planned title defense against Pat Healy. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker stated, "Without a television partner, we simply could not move forward with this event. We wish Gilbert a speedy recovery and will work diligently and quickly to reschedule the fighters affected by this news on upcoming cards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strikeforce.com/news/SF4-cancel-news |title=Strikeforce Announces Cancellation of Saturday's Event in Sacramento |publisher=strikeforce.com|date=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melendez/Healy and Payan/Bravo bouts were both rescheduled for [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] on January 12, 2013, where Estevan Payan defeated Michael Bravo by second round TKO. However, Gilbert Melendez was replaced by [[Jorge Masvidal]], and later, Kurt Holobaugh in the planned bout with Pat Healy due to injuries.

The proposed bout between Nah-Shon Burrell &amp; Yuri Villefort was rescheduled for [[UFC 157]] on February 23, 2013 following both fighters' signings with the UFC after the closure of Strikeforce in January 2013. Burrell defeated Villefort via unanimous decision.

'''Turnverein Bittenfeld 1898 e. V.''' or '''TV Bittenfeld'''  is a [[handball]] club from [[Waiblingen]], town of [[Bittenfeld]], [[Germany]]. This club has been played in 2nd division of German Handball League,  [[Handball-Bundesliga]] since season 2006/07 until 2014/15. After successful 3rd place in overall ranking of season 2014/15, the team rose to the 1st division of German League and changed name to '''TVB 1898 Stuttgart'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://wg.tvb1898.de/index.php?id=162&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2750&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=163&amp;cHash=b8eca2742f&lt;/ref&gt; The team's home games take place in [[Scharrena Stuttgart]]. Due to restricted capacity of home arena, some of the games are held in [[Porsche-Arena]] in the nearby area.

==History==
The team has played five seasons in the 2nd South Ligue between 2006-2011. At the end of the  season 2010/2011 TV Bittenfeld finished as fourth. This allowed the team to play in the newly founded 2nd Handball National League (German: Bundesliga). Coach of the team was Jürgen Schweikardt, who was supported by his assistant coach Heiko Burmeister. The biggest success so far the club got in the season 2014/15, when TV Bittenfeld took the 3rd ranking position in the final standings, which entitled the transfer to the first (or main) German League. To performe in season 2015/16 team TV Bittenfeld has modified the name to TVB 1898 Stuttgart.&lt;ref&gt;http://wg.tvb1898.de/index.php?id=162&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2750&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=163&amp;cHash=b8eca2742f&lt;/ref&gt;

The second team of TV Bittenfeld played until the season 2010/2011 in so-called Land League.  The team won the first place there and now plays in the [[Baden-Württemberg|Württemberg]] League. The team is trained by Michael Rill and Peter Seiz.

'''''The Slugger's Wife''''' is a 1985 [[romantic comedy]] film about a baseball star who falls for a singer. Written by [[Neil Simon]], directed by [[Hal Ashby]] and produced by [[Ray Stark]], the film stars [[Michael O'Keefe]], [[Rebecca De Mornay]] and [[Randy Quaid]]. It was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] and released on March 29, 1985.

==Plot summary==
Darryl Palmer is a baseball player for the [[Atlanta Braves]]. He enjoys the fame and fringe benefits of bachelor life until he meets rock singer Debby Huston, falls in love and decides to settle down.

Debby isn't ready to put her professional hopes on hold. But from the moment Darryl meets her, his own career takes off. He begins a full assault on baseball's single-season home run record of 61 (at that time) and considers Debby a good-luck charm, wanting her to be there at his games.

Manager Burly DeVito appreciates that Darryl has found a settling influence in his life, but teammates Moose Granger and Manny Alvarado become increasingly aware of how obsessed Darryl is with Debby and how unhappy she has become. She feels smothered by her husband, who interferes with her career ambitions and goes into a jealous funk whenever she goes on the road.

The couple breaks up, to the detriment of Darryl's game and his pursuit of one of baseball's greatest feats. He begins to fail on a regular basis and the team's playoff chances could be in jeopardy. Burly and his players concoct a plan to have another woman, hidden by shadows, pretend to be Darryl's wife, telling him everything he wants to hear. It works temporarily, then backfires.

Debby comes back to try to work things out. Darryl does indeed hit his record-breaking home run, but it remains uncertain whether the couple's relationship can ever be what it once was.

'''''Who U Wit?''''' is a [[compilation album]] released from  American [[hip hop]] record label [[No Limit Records]]. It was released on May 25, 1999 and was produced by [[Beats By the Pound]], [[Master P]] and [[Meech Wells]]. This compilation charted much lower than No Limit's previous two compilations, 1998's ''[[Mean Green: Major Players Compilation|Mean Green]]'' and ''[[No Limit Soldiers Compilation: We Can't Be Stopped|We Can't Be Stopped]]'', only making it to #62 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #22 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]]. The album cover featured Master P as a member of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Charlotte Hornets]] during his ill-fated attempt to join the team for the 1998–99 season.
