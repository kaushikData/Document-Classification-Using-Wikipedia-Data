'''''A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant and Vulgar Words''''' is a [[dictionary]] of [[slang]] originally compiled by publisher and lexicographer [[John Camden Hotten]] in 1859.

The first edition was published in 1859, with the full title and subtitle: ''A dictionary of modern slang, cant, and vulgar words: used at the present day in the streets of London, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the houses of Parliament, the dens of St. Giles, and the palaces of St. James : preceded by a history of cant and vulgar language : with glossaries of two secret languages, spoken by the wandering tribes of London, the costermongers, and the patterers''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_dictionary_of_modern_slang_cant_and_vu.html?id=Kfo3AQAAIAAJ Full-text of 1860 edition] at Google Books (last visited Oct. 15, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been published as '''''The Slang Dictionary: Etymological, Historical, and Anecdotal'''''.

The dictionary included criminal slang, back slang, [[rhyming slang]], and other types of slang.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;Jonathon Green, in Toby Ash, [http://www.salon.com/2012/10/15/slang_the_universal_language "Slang: The Universal Language"] (Interview by Toby Ash with lexicographer Jonathan Green), ''Salon.com'', Oct. 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, Hotten, included histories of some slangs (back slang and rhyming slang), a detailed bibliography, and a noted definition:
: Slang represents that evanescent, vulgar language, ever changing with fashion and taste, … spoken by persons in every grade of life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest … Slang is indulged in from a desire to appear familiar with life, gaiety, town-humour and with the transient nick names and street jokes of the day … Slang is the language of street humour, of fast, high and low life … Slang is as old as speech and the congregating together of people in cities. It is the result of crowding, and excitement, and artificial life. It is often full of the most pungent satire, and is always to the point. Without point Slang has no raison d’etre.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jonathon Green, in Toby Ash, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotten's work was arguably the most important work on swears since Francis Grose's 1785 ''Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Thorne]] (2000) "Slang and the Dictionary".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accélérateur Grand Louvre d'analyse élémentaire (AGLAE)''' is a [[particle accelerator]] housed by the [[Center for Research and Restoration of Museums of France]] in the [[Louvre]] museum in [[Paris]], [[France]]. 
&lt;ref name="2015-05-14_Symetry"&gt;[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/may-2015/the-accelerator-in-the-louvre The accelerator in the Louvre -- The Accélérateur Grand Louvre d'analyse élémentaire solves ancient mysteries with powerful particle beams.], Glenn Roberts Jr. and Kelen Tuttle, Summetry Magazine, 14 May 2015, accessed 7 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
AGLAE is a [[Pelletron]] 2[[MeV]] [[electrostatic accelerator]] built by an American company, the [[National Electrostatics Corporation]], and has two sources: 
* a [[Duoplasmatron]]+ source that can produce hydrogen ions (protons), and
* an [[Alpha source]] that can produce Helium ions (two protons and two [[neutron]]s bound together into a particle identical to a [[helium]] nucleus). This produces protons with an energy up to 4 MeV and alphas up to 6 MeV.&lt;ref name="C2RMF"&gt;[http://c2rmf.fr/analyser/un-laboratoire-de-haute-technologie-pour-les-collections-des-musees/aglae AGLAE], Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musees de France (C2RMF), accessed 7 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AGLAE was installed starting in 1987 and inaugurated in 1989.&lt;ref name="C2RMF" /&gt; AGLAE is sited some 15m below the [[Louvre Pyramid|glass pyramid at the Louvre]].

==Use==
AGLAE generates [[proton]]s and [[Alpha particle]]s that are emitted outside the accelerator itself, enabling items of virtually any size or type to be examined. The particles, and their collision products, are detected to analyse the composition of the cultural items in the path of the particle beams. The techniques used at AGLAE include particle-induced [[X-ray]] and [[gamma-ray]] emission spectrometries.&lt;ref name="2015-05-14_Symetry" /&gt;

The data is used to determine the atomic constituents of the cultural items, including trace elements.&lt;ref name="2015-05-14_Symetry" /&gt;

===Detectors===
AGLAE implements derived methods of analysis with two ion beams:&lt;ref name="C2RMF" /&gt; 
* emission induced X-charged particles (PIXE)
* [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]] backscattering spectrometry (RBS)
* analysis by nuclear reactions (NRA), a variant is called GAUGE (gamma-induced charged particle emission)
* elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA)
* a spectrometer to record the ionoluminescence on the extracted beam line (IBIL)

===Upgrade===
AGLAE particle analysis techniques are limited in that they are not very effective for studying paintings because of a slight risk of damage. An upgrade (NEW AGLAE, using an ANR-10-EQPX-22&lt;ref name="C2RMF" /&gt;) in progress in 2015 aims to produce a lower-power beam that will allow more sensitive detectors to overcome this issue, and allow 24-hour operation of the facility.&lt;ref name="2015-05-14_Symetry" /&gt;

In [[Australian]] [[Aboriginal Mythology]], '''Ankotarinja''' is the first man, also called the Dreaming Man. His myth belonged to a small band of [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] men, known as the [[Ngala-Mbitjana]] people. They were heirs to Ankotarinja's exploits at the time of the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]], performing his ceremonies and initiating their young [[iliara]] (novice) into his totemic lodge. They kept alive the memory of his world-creating endeavors. Ankotarinja's birthplace is a creek-bed near [[Ankota]] (vicinity of [[Mount Solitaire]]).{{cn|date=June 2012}}

On 6 April 2012, the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] (French acronym: MNLA) unilaterally declared [[Azawad]] independent from the [[Republic of Mali]] in the wake of a [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|rebellion]] which was preceded by a string of other [[Tuareg rebellions (disambiguation)|Tuareg rebellions]]. It is called the '''Independent State of Azawad'''.

==History==

Following the return of several hundreds of soldiers after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] in 2011 and the formation of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tuareg-rebels-attack-6th-town-mali-182107726.html |title=Tuareg rebels attack 6th town in Mali |date=31 January 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Yahoo News |last=Vogl |first=Martin |accessdate=17 October 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTuLUMke?url=http://news.yahoo.com/tuareg-rebels-attack-6th-town-mali-182107726.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; an insurgency commenced on 17 January 2012 with an attack in the [[Kidal Region]], near the border with [[Algeria]]. Following the [[2012 Malian coup d'état|March coup d'état]], the rebels made further inroads to capture the three biggest cities of [[Kidal]], [[Gao]] and [[Timbuktu]] in three days, respectively. At this point, other factions joined the fighting, including the [[Islamist]] [[Ansar Dine]] and the [[Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa]]. Despite reports of Ansar Dine taking control of most of what was initially captured by or with the help of the MNLA, the group established their writ over large swathes of the territory.&lt;ref name="Aljaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/04/20124644412359539.html |title=Tuaregs claim 'independence' from Mali |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTuUrtbo?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/04/20124644412359539.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuareg peoples had also long complained of marginalisation within Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/06/mali-tuareg-rebels-declare-independence?newsfeed=true |title=Mali's Tuareg rebels declare independence |publisher=The Guardian |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTuc0TTk?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/06/mali-tuareg-rebels-declare-independence?newsfeed=true |archivedate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration of Independence==

The Secretary-General of the MNLA, [[Bilal ag Acherif]], signed the declaration in Gao, the site of the largest Malian military outpost in the north, on 6 April 2012.&lt;ref name="declare"/&gt; It was announced by Moussa ag Attaher on ''[[France 24]]''.&lt;ref name="Aljaz"/&gt;

The declaration was issued in [[French language|French]] on behalf of the "voice of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad" and in consultation with the Executive Committee, the Revolutionary Council, the Consultative Council, the State-Major of the Army of Liberation and the regional offices.&lt;ref name="Arabia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/06/205763.html |title=Tuareg rebels declare the independence of Azawad, north of Mali |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTuuxrYR?url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/06/205763.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cited as reasoning [[History of Mali|France's unilateral attachment of the region to Mali]] despite an appeal to French President [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/africa/6706498/Mali-rebels-declare-independence |title=Mali rebels declare independence – africa – world |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTv0A7sK?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/africa/6706498/Mali-rebels-declare-independence |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document concluded by adding that the new state declared by the MNLA would recognise international state borders,&lt;ref name="Aljaz"/&gt; despite having split the traditional [[Azawagh]] over several modern-day states; absolute accordance with the [[United Nations Charter]];&lt;ref name="Arabia"/&gt; and a commitment by the MNLA to establish the "conditions for a durable peace" and create state institutions in accordance with a [[Constitution of Azawad|democratic constitution]]. Before "irrevocably" acclaiming the Independent State of Azawad, the document called on the Executive Committee, who would run the country in the interim period, to invite the [[international community]] to immediately recognise the new state in the interests of "justice and peace".&lt;ref name="declare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnlamov.net/component/content/article/169-declaration-dindependance-de-lazawad.html |title=Déclaration D’Indépendance De L'Azawad |language=French |publisher=Mouvement National de libération de l'Azawad |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTul59wU?url=http://www.mnlamov.net/component/content/article/169-declaration-dindependance-de-lazawad.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===

The day before the declaration, the Foreign Ministry of [[Algeria]] said that an armed faction raided the Algerian consulate in the northeast kidnapping the consul and six staff members. Though Attaher called it "deplorable", he said the MNLA went along with the action in order not to result in deaths. The ''[[Agence France Press|AFP]]'' also quoted a Malian military source as saying that to the best of Malian Army's intelligence "the MNLA is in charge of nothing at the moment... it is Iyad &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Iyad ag Ghaly|Ag Ghaly]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; who is the strongest and he is with AQIM".&lt;ref name="Aljaz"/&gt; His [[Ansar Dine]] said that it was "against rebellions. We are against independence. We are against revolutions not in the name of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120406-world-rejects-tuareg-independence-declaration-north-mali-rebel-international-community-azawad |title=Global powers dismiss Tuaregs’ declared independence |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012 |agency=Agence France-Presse |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTv88t4H?url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120406-world-rejects-tuareg-independence-declaration-north-mali-rebel-international-community-azawad |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the MLNA's leadership were also said to have been surprised by the declaration. Europe-based Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed, one of the spokesmen of the MNLA and the head of external relations, said: "I think it's premature — premature to speak of this right now, without a consultation and an understanding with some of the actors that are very active on the local level, and with which we need to work, and we need to find common objectives, common strategies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Callimachi, Rukmini |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2111370,00.html#ixzz1riyrZa4x |title=Mali's Tuareg Rebels Declare Independence |work=Time |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTvEaFmf?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2111370,00.html#ixzz1riyrZa4x |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''States'''

*{{flag|Algeria}}: Prime Minister [[Ahmed Ouyahia]] said Azawad's northern neighbour country would never "accept questioning Mali's territorial integrity". However, he also rejected foreign intervention and called for a solution through dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/38627/World/International/Algeria-rules-out-Mali-split,-foreign-intervention.aspx |title=Algeria rules out Mali split, foreign intervention: Report |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=english.ahram.org.eg |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTvrYK7p?url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/38627/World/International/Algeria-rules-out-Mali-split,-foreign-intervention.aspx |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Canada}}: Chris Day, an aide to Foreign Minister [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], stated that Canada's position on Azawad's independence: "We’re absolutely not recognising this declaration. We are closely monitoring events on the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/apnewsbreak-malis-coup-leader-return-power-215323797.html |title=Mali's coup leader to return power |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Globe and Mail |author=Callimachi, Rukmini |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTw0et3P?url=http://news.yahoo.com/apnewsbreak-malis-coup-leader-return-power-215323797.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|France}}: Defence Minister [[Gérard Longuet]] reacted by saying: "A unilateral declaration of independence which is not recognised by African states would not have any meaning for us."&lt;ref name="Aljaz"/&gt; Foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said the declaration was "null and void". He affirmed France's commitment to the "territorial integrity of Mali".&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmnewsnigeria.com/2012/04/06/malian-group-eu-france-denounce-independence-proclamation/ |title=Malian Group, EU, France Denounce Independence Proclamation |publisher=P.M.

France, however, also indicated it would offer military assistance to the ECOWAS force aimed at stabilising Mali and containing the rebels.&lt;ref name="Reuters6_04"/&gt;
*{{flag|Russia}}: In a statement the same day as the declaration, the presidential special envoy to Africa [[Mikhail Margelov]] rejected the formation of the state. "There are virtually no chances, this is undoubted, for [the] legitimization of a Tuareg state." "[The Sahelian countries, the ECOWAS, and the AU] do not need it. We stand unequivocally for the territorial integrity and restoration of the constitutional order in Mali."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2012/04/06/191s691857.htm |title=Russia: No Chance to Recognize Azawad Independence |agency=Xinhua |publisher=CRI English |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTwCtigt?url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2012/04/06/191s691857.htm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|United States}}: Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] stated: "We reject the MNLA's statement of independence and reiterate our call for the territorial integrity of Mali."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The State Department also later expressed concern that the separation would "only exacerbate the grave problems challenging the Malian state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/27/world/africa/mali-rebel-groups/index.html |title=Mali rebel groups join forces, vowing an Islamic state |author=Katarina Höije |date=27 May 2012 |publisher=CNN |archivedate=17 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTwRWbSQ?url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/27/world/africa/mali-rebel-groups/index.html |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academia'''

Alessandra Giuffrida of the African Studies Department at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The MNLA] is taking advantage of a new situation:the lack of a constitutional government and power vacuum in Bamako after the coup. This is a new fact which has never occurred before in the history of the Tuareg in Mali. According to international law experts, this actually gives the Tuareg some ground to fight legally for the independence of their state. [The international reactions reflect that] there are economic interests in maintaining the status quo in the north of the country after the discovery of mineral resources.{{cite quote|date=February 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Cedid Atlas Title Page.jpg|thumb|right|Title Page of the ''Cedid Atlas'' (also known as ''Cedid Atlas Tercümesi'')]]

'''''Cedid Atlas''''' (or ''Atlas-ı Cedid'') is the first translation of the [[atlas]] in the [[Muslim world]], printed and published in 1803 in [[Constantinople]], then the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="hgk"&gt;[http://www.hgk.msb.gov.tr/ustbanner/turk/ilkatlas.htm First Printed Atlas in the Muslim World] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquemapsandprintsblog.com/antique-maps/ Antique Maps - Timeline of Cartography]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=510|title=The First World Atlas Printed by Muslims (April 1803 – March 1804)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title name of the atlas reads as  '''''Cedid Atlas Tercümesi'''''  (meaning, literally, ''"A Translation of a New Atlas"'') and in most libraries outside Turkey, it is recorded and referenced accordingly.

Although manuscripts and  hand-drawn maps were widely available throughout the [[Muslim world]], the massive printing of books started only in 1729 by [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]]  and the ''Cedid Atlas'' could only be published in 1803 by Müderris Abdurrahman Efendi  in a style based on European sources.&lt;ref name="hgk" /&gt;

The ''Cedid Atlas'' includes a monochrome celestial chart and 24 hand-coloured copper engraved maps &lt;ref name=Beydilli&gt;Beydilli(1995) {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; of various parts of the world; the celestial chart and maps measure at least (53&amp;nbsp;cm by 72&amp;nbsp;cm) and all the maps are actually adaptations &lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9811/atlas.html|title=Artifacts from the 'New Order' (November 1998) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of  [[William Faden]]'s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographicus.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CAD&amp;Product_Code=faden William Faden's Biography]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''General Atlas''. The maps are preceded by a (1+79) page-long treatise of geography, "Ucalet-ül Coğrafiye" by Mahmud Raif Efendi &lt;ref&gt;[http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/1151/13525.pdf Mahmud Raif Efendi As The Chief Secretary of Yusuf Agah Efendi, The First Permanent Ottoman-Turkish Ambassador to London (1793-1797)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarihbilinci.com/forum/devlet-adamlari-223/mahmud-raif-efendi-15164/ Mahmud Raif Efendi's Ucalet-ül Coğrafiye] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628010333/http://www.tarihbilinci.com/forum/devlet-adamlari-223/mahmud-raif-efendi-15164/# |date=2012-06-28 }} {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a title page. The "Ucalet-ül Coğrafiye" of Mahmud Raif Efendi was printed one year later, in 1804, and bound together with the atlas.&lt;ref name=TB&gt;[http://www.tarihbilinci.com/forum/devlet-adamlari-223/mahmud-raif-efendi-15164/ Ottoman Statesmen: Mahmud Raif Efendi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628010333/http://www.tarihbilinci.com/forum/devlet-adamlari-223/mahmud-raif-efendi-15164/# |date=2012-06-28 }} {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a point of view of art, the atlas is notable for the color of the maps as well as the beauty of the script on the maps.&lt;ref name="NJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/times/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-19/127148311969290.xml&amp;coll=5|title=In this map, it's still Constantinople|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Cedid Atlas'' was published in parallel with the developments of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Nizam-ı Cedid]], the "New-Order" or the "New System" ("Cedid" means "new" and "Nizam" means "system", "regime", or "order") and its title-name reflects this clearly. The atlas was new in terms of cartographical knowledge and well suited to the new system which tried to introduce new institutions into the [[Ottoman Empire]] while trying to replace existing ones with contemporary counterparts from the [[West]]. Introduced by the ruling [[padishah]] (the [[sultan]]) of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Selim III]], the "New-Order" included a series of reforms which mainly modernized and changed the structure of the then existing [[Ottoman army]] and  changed the administrative structure of the Empire. It was an effort to catch up with technical, military, economic, and administrative achievements of the [[West]] against which the [[Ottoman Empire]] was losing grounds since the 17th century. New military and engineering schools were established and governmental units related with the foreign relations and affairs were re-organized to align with the new system. For these schools, governmental units, and the wholly re-organized army reformed according to the European practice, a new understanding and applications of geography of the standards of the West  were necessary and the ''Cedid Atlas'' was translated and printed for this purpose.

Only 50 copies of this atlas (measuring 36&amp;nbsp;cm x 53&amp;nbsp;cm) were printed at the press. A copy was presented to [[Selim III]]; several copies were also presented to the high-ranking officials of the Empire, some were reserved for the library of Muhendishane (military engineering school of the time), and the remaining were reserved for sale. However, during the "Alemdar Vakası", an uprising of the [[janissaries]] in Constantinople during November 15–18, 1808,&lt;ref name=Kinross431-434&gt;Kinross(1977), pp 431-434.&lt;/ref&gt; a fire at the warehouse of the press destroyed an unknown (unaccounted) number of the copies reserved for sale.&lt;ref name="Uskudar"&gt;[http://www.uskudar.bel.tr/tr-TR/haberler/Sayfalar/Haber.aspx?hid=2355 Municipality of Usküdar-Istanbul] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130418145114/http://www.uskudar.bel.tr/tr-TR/haberler/Sayfalar/Haber.aspx?hid=2355 |date=2013-04-18 }} {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on several estimates and accounting for the single maps (torn-out from bound volumes of the atlas) sold or being sold worldwide, it is believed that a maximum of 20 complete examples could be present in libraries or in private collections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaen.com/antique-map-of.php?id=12429|title=RAIF EFENDI - Guyana, Surinam, Amapa.|author=Antique maps Paulus Swaen Auction Galleries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some sources suggest that there exist only 10 complete and intact copies in the world.&lt;ref name="LOC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uskudar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2010/05/_princeton_university_librarys.html Newly acquired: Cedid Atlas Tercümesi (Istanbul, 1803)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320090137/http://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2010/05/_princeton_university_librarys.html |date=March 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JCB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/I%20found%20it%20JCB/apr11.html|publisher=The John Carter Brown Library|title=The New Great Atlas: Istanbul, 1803-1804 |author=Allison Rich|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606011702/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/I%20found%20it%20JCB/apr11.html|archive-date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it's one of the rarest printed atlases of historical value.&lt;ref name="LOC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uskudar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JCB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3413648|title=[World map in Mercator's projection] [cartographic material] - National Library of Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
A few sources outside [[Turkey]] and the [[Muslim world]] also refer to this atlas as the '''''New Great Atlas'''''.&lt;ref name="JCB" /&gt; In Turkey, since the printing press of the book was located in the historical [[Üsküdar]] (Scutari) region (now a municipality) of [[Istanbul]], the atlas sometimes is referred to as the '''''Üsküdar Atlası'''''.&lt;ref name="Uskudar" /&gt;

The following libraries possess very limited portions of the atlas :

# [[National Library of Australia]] owns only two maps of the atlas with all the rest missing.

Occasionally, single maps of the Cedid Atlas are presented for sale by on-line book sellers or auctioneers.

==Paper used for the maps in the ''Cedid Atlas''==
The watermark of the papers on which the maps were printed were examined. While some [[Princeton University]] professors believe the papers are Russian-made, John Delaney, the historical maps [[curator]] for the [[Princeton University Library]], believes the paper is possibly from [[Venice]], Italy.&lt;ref name="NJ" /&gt;

[[File:Entrance to 'Tower of London'.jpg|thumb|[[Yeomen Warders|Yeoman Warder]] with escort, [[Tower of London]]]]
The '''Ceremony of the Keys''' is an ancient ritual, held every evening at the [[Tower of London]], when the main gates are locked for the night.&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22Ceremony+of+the+Keys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT4p3bzsbXAhWDC8AKHS8yA4o4HhDoAQhKMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ceremony%20of%20the%20Keys%22&amp;f=false |title=The London Encylopaedia |last=Weinreb |first=Ben |last2=Hibbert |first2=Christopher |last3=Keay |first3=Julia |last4=Keay |first4=John |publisher=MacMillan |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4050-4924-5 |edition=3rd |publication-place=London |pages=145 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be the oldest military ceremony in the world,&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ptNXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Ceremony+of+the+Keys%22&amp;dq=%22Ceremony+of+the+Keys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw0dmUzMbXAhWnL8AKHZ_mCxU4ChDoAQg4MAM |title=Customs and Traditions of England |last=Hogg |first=Garry |publisher=Arco Publishing Company |year=1971 |isbn=9780668024907 |pages=58 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the best-known ceremonial tradition of the Tower.&lt;ref name="Brewer"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of London Phrase and Fable |last=Willey |first=Russ |publisher=Chambers Harrap |year=2009 |isbn=978 0550 104 458 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The ceremony==
At exactly 9.53 pm, the Chief [[Yeomen Warders|Yeoman Warder]], dressed in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] watchcoat and bonnet, and carrying a candle lantern, leaves the Byward Tower and falls in with the Escort to the Keys, a military escort made up of armed members of the [[Queen's Guard|Tower of London Guard]].&lt;ref name="HouseholdDivision"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.householddivision.org.uk/guard-at-the-tower-ceremony |title=Guard at the Tower |website=The Household Division |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Warder passes his lantern to a soldier, and marches with his escort to the outer gate. The sentries on duty salute the Queen’s Keys as they pass.&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://changing-guard.com/ceremony-of-the-keys.html |title=Tower of London / Ceremony of the Keys |website=Changing-Guard.com |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warder first locks the outer gate and then the gates of the Middle and Byward Towers. The Warder and escort march down Water Lane, until they reach the Bloody Tower archway where a sentry challenges the party to identify themselves:&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;

:'''Sentry''': "Halt! Who comes there?"
:'''Chief Warder''': "The keys".
:'''Sentry''': "Whose keys?"
:'''Chief Warder''': "[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth's]] keys".
:'''Sentry''': "Pass Queen Elizabeth's Keys. All's well".&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The precise wording of the challenge/response differs very slightly between sources&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warder and escort march down to the foot of Broadwalk Steps where the main Tower Guard is drawn up to meet them. The party halts, and the officer in charge gives the command to [[Present arms (command)|present arms]]. The Chief Warder steps forward, doffs his bonnet, and proclaims:

:'''Chief Warder''': "God preserve Queen Elizabeth".
:'''Guard''': "Amen!"&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia" /&gt;

On the answering “Amen” the clock of the Waterloo Barracks strikes 10pm and the [[Last Post]] is sounded, marking the end of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia" /&gt;

The Guard is dismissed, and the Chief Warder takes the keys to the Queen's House for safekeeping overnight.&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;

==History==
The origins of the ceremony are unknown. It may have begun during the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia" /&gt; and it is often stated that a ceremony in some form has been held since the 14th century.&lt;ref name="HRP"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/explore/ceremony-of-the-keys/ |title=Ceremony of the Keys |website=Historic Royal Palaces |access-date=17 November 2017}} (''"700 year old ancient ceremony''")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://changing-guard.com/ceremony-of-the-keys.html | title=Tower of London / Ceremony of the Keys | website=Changing-Guard.com | accessdate=17 November 2017}} ("''for about 700 years''")&lt;/ref&gt; Written instructions that the keys should be placed in a safe place by a Tower officer, after securing the gates, date back to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia" /&gt; In its current form the ceremony is likely to date to the 19th century when the institution of the [[Yeomen Warders]] was reformed by the then Constable of the Tower, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref name="LondonEncylopaedia" /&gt;

The ceremony has never been cancelled, and has been delayed only on a single occasion due to enemy action during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Changing-Guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HouseholdDivision"/&gt; During an [[airstrike|air raid]] on London, a number of incendiary bombs fell on the old Victorian guardroom just as the Chief Warder and the escort were coming through the Bloody Tower archway. The Chief Warder and the escort were blown off their feet, but they recovered and carried on. The Tower holds a letter from the Officer of the Guard apologising to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] that the ceremony was late, along with a reply from the King which says that the officer is not to be punished as the delay was due to enemy action.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Access to the ceremony==
Between 40 and 50 visitors are allowed access to the ceremony each night, under escort.&lt;ref name="HouseholdDivision"/&gt; Tickets are free but must be obtained in advance from [[Historic Royal Palaces]], the organisation that looks after the Tower.&lt;ref name="HRP2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/explore/ceremony-of-the-keys |title=Ceremony of the Keys |website=Historic Royal Palaces |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is  usually sold out at least 12 months in advance.&lt;ref name="HRP2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7814">This article compares the [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) and [[virtual machine]]s (VMs) of the  programming language [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and operating system [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

While most Android applications are written in Java-like language, there are some differences between the Java API and the Android API, and Android does not run [[Java bytecode]] by a traditional [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM), but instead by a [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine in older versions of Android, and an [[Android Runtime]] (ART) in newer versions, that compile the same code that Dalvik runs to [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) executables containing [[machine code]].

Java bytecode in Java Archive ([[JAR (file format)|JAR]]) files is not executed by Android devices. Instead, Java classes are compiled into a proprietary bytecode format and run on [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] (or compiled version thereof with newer ART), a specialized virtual machine (VM) designed for Android. Unlike Java VMs, which are [[stack machine]]s (stack-based architecture), the Dalvik VM is a [[register machine]] (register-based architecture).

Dalvik has some traits that differentiate it from other standard VMs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/with_android_and_dalvik_at
| title=with Android and Dalvik at Google I/O
| last=Rose|first=John
| date=2008-05-31
| accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The VM was designed to use less space.
* The [[Class (file format)#The constant pool|constant pool]] has been modified to use only [[32-bit]] indexes to simplify the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].
* Standard Java bytecode executes 8-bit stack instructions.  Local variables must be copied to or from the operand stack by separate instructions.  Dalvik instead uses its own 16-bit instruction set that works directly on local variables.  The local variable is commonly picked by a 4-bit ''virtual register'' field.

Because the bytecode loaded by the Dalvik virtual machine is not Java bytecode and due to the way Dalvik loads classes, it is impossible to load library packages as [[JAR (file format)|jar files]]. A different procedure must be used to load Android libraries, in which the content of the underlying &lt;code&gt;dex&lt;/code&gt; file must be copied in the application private internal storage area before it is loaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==System properties==
As is the case for the [[Java SE]] class {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|System}}, the Android {{Javadoc:Android|java/lang|System}} class allows retrieving system properties. However, some mandatory properties defined with the Java virtual machine have no meaning or a different meaning on Android. For example:
* &lt;code&gt;java.version&lt;/code&gt; property returns 0 because it is not used on Android.
* &lt;code&gt;java.specification.version&lt;/code&gt; invariably returns 0.9 independently of the version of Android used.
* &lt;code&gt;java.class.version&lt;/code&gt; invariably returns 50 independently of the version of Android used.
* &lt;code&gt;user.dir&lt;/code&gt; has a different meaning on Android.
* &lt;code&gt;user.home&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; properties do not exist on Android.

==Class library==
&lt;!--[[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] does not align to [[Java SE]] nor [[Java ME]] [[Java Class Library|class library]] profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/11/android-java
| title= Google's Android SDK Bypasses Java ME in Favor of Java Lite and Apache Harmony
| publisher= infoq.com
| date= 2007-11-12
| quote=''Instead of providing a full version of the Java SE or Java ME Google has diverged on two fronts. First, a limited subset of the core Java packages is provided. (...) By going this route Android is following in the footsteps of another Google project GWT which uses Java as its development language but does not support the full JDK''
| accessdate= 2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://droidtutorials.blogspot.com/2010/02/alternative-to-point2d.html
| title= Alternative to Point2D
| publisher= Droid Tutorials
| date= 2010-02-12
| quote=''Given that AWT is not supported in Android API, the Point2D class, which is useful for writing 2D graphics, is missing either''
| accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Java ME]] classes, [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] are not supported). Instead it uses its own library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html
| title=Package Index
| publisher=[[Google]]
| accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on a subset of the [[Apache Harmony]] Java implementation.
--&gt;
Current versions of Android use the latest Java language and its libraries (but not full [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) frameworks), not the [[Apache Harmony]] Java implementation, that older versions used. [[Java 8]] source code that works in latest version of Android, can be made to work in older versions of Android.

===java.lang package===
By default, the default output stream {{Javadoc:Android|member=out|java/lang|System|out}} and {{Javadoc:Android|member=err|java/lang|System|err}} do not output anything,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html
| title=Android Debug Bridge
| quote=''By default, the Android system sends stdout and stderr (System.out and System.err) output to /dev/null.''
| publisher=[[Google]]
| accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developers are encouraged to use the {{Javadoc:Android|android/util|Log}} class, which logs Strings on the LogCat tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/debugging-log.html
| title=Reading and Writing Logs
| publisher=[[Google]]
| accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has changed at least from [[Android Honeycomb|HoneyComb]], and they now output to the log console also.

===Graphics and widget library===
Android does not use the [[Abstract Window Toolkit]] nor the [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] library. [[User interface]]s are built using View objects.  Android uses a framework similar to Swing, based on {{Javadoc:Android|android/view|View}}s rather than {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing|JComponent}}s. However, Android widgets are not [[JavaBean]]s: the Android application {{Javadoc:Android|android/content|Context}} must be provided to the widget at creation.

====Look and feel====
Android widget library does not support a [[pluggable look and feel]] architecture. The look and feel of Android widgets must be embedded in the widgets. However, a limited ability exists to set styles and themes for an application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html#ApplyAStyle
| title=Applying Styles and Themes
| publisher=[[Google]]
| accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Layout manager====
Contrary to Swing where [[layout manager]]s can be applied to any [[Container (abstract data type)|container widget]], Android layout behavior is encoded in the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout-objects.html
| title=Common Layout Objects
| publisher=[[Google]]
| accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===java.beans package===
Android includes only a small subset of the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package ({{Javadoc:Android|java/beans|PropertyChangeEvent}} and related classes).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68882">This is a '''comparison of voice over IP''' ('''VoIP''') '''software''' used to conduct [[telephone]]-like voice conversations across [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based networks. For residential markets, [[voice over IP]] phone service is often cheaper than traditional [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) service and can remove geographic restrictions to telephone numbers, e.g., have a PSTN phone number in a New York area code ring in Tokyo.

For businesses, VoIP obviates separate voice and data pipelines, channelling both types of traffic through the IP network while giving the telephony user a range of advanced abilities.

[[Softphone]]s are client devices for making and receiving voice and video calls over the [[IP network]] with the standard functions of most ''original'' telephones and usually allow integration with [[VoIP phone]]s and [[USB phone]]s instead of using a computer's microphone and speakers (or headset). Most softphone clients run on the open [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) supporting various codecs. [[Skype]] runs on a closed [[proprietary networking protocol]] but additional [[business telephone system]] (PBX) software can allow a SIP based telephone system to connect to the Skype network.&lt;ref name="skypesip"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skype Connect...|url=http://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-connect/|website=skype.com|publisher=Microsoft Corporation Inc.|accessdate=15 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111022420/http://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-connect/|archivedate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Online chat]]'' programs now also incorporate voice and video communications.

Other VoIP software applications include conferencing servers, intercom systems, virtual [[Foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange service]]s (FXOs) and adapted telephony software which concurrently support VoIP and [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) like [[Interactive Voice Response]] (IVR) systems, dial in dictation, on hold and call recording servers.

Some entries below are [[Web-based VoIP]]; most are standalone applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51787">The following tables compare [[reference management software]]. Readers using the table to choose reference management software should note the product's "latest stable release date". An older release date suggests that the product is not currently supported and users may encounter technical issues and receive little to no technical support.

== General ==
&lt;!--Entries should have a stand-alone Wikipedia article based on multiple independent reliable sources.--&gt;
In the "notes" section, there is a difference between:
* ''web-based'', referring to applications that may be installed on a web server (usually requiring [[MySQL]] or another database and [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], or some other language for web applications)
* a ''centrally-hosted website''

== Export file formats ==
This table lists the machine-readable file formats that can be exported from reference managers. These are typically used to share data with other reference managers or with other people who use a reference manager. To exchange data from one program to another, the first program must be able to export to a format that the second program may import. Import file formats are in a table below this one.

== Import file formats ==
This table lists the [[file format]]s which may be manually imported into the reference managers without needing to connect to one particular database. Many of these database companies use the same name for their file format as they do for their database (including Copac, CSA, ISI, Medline, Ovid, PubMed, and SciFinder). For the ability to retrieve citations from the particular databases (rather than the file format), please refer to the database connectivity table that is below this table.

== Reference list file formats ==

Zotero and Endnote are incompatible with LaTeX. Among other things, both programs do not provide for robust citation keys. Zotero also does not offer automatic generation and updating of bibliography files in select directories.

! [[HTML]]
! [[LaTeX]]&lt;ref&gt;This refers to the direct output of raw LaTeX (often in a format similar to the BibTeX-generated .bbl files).  Many programs can export BibTeX (see above table), which can then be processed into LaTeX.{{cite web|url=http://www.citavi.com/sub/manual5/en/index.html?creating_a_publication_with_tex.html|title=Creating a Publication with TeX|publisher=Swiss Academic Software|date=2015-10-27|accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word processor integration ==
Some reference management software include support for automatic embedding and (re)formatting of references in word processing programs. This table lists this type of support for [[Microsoft Word]], Pages, [[Apache OpenOffice]] / [[LibreOffice]] Writer, the [[LaTeX]] editors [[Kile]] and [[LyX]], and Google Docs. Other programs are able to scan [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] or other textual formats for inserted placeholders which are subsequently formatted. Most reference management programs support copy/paste or drag-and-drop of references into any editor, but this is not meant here.

== Database connectivity ==
This table lists the [[academic databases and search engines]] which reference managers can import from. In some cases, a search and retrieval can be conducted directly in the reference manager. In others, a [[bookmarklet]] or [[Firefox extension]] will allow a site to be [[Screen scraping|scraped]].

Some reference managers provide network functionality. (N/A means the product has no networking, while "no" indicates it does (but lacks an implemented feature).)

== Terminology ==
In the table above, the following terminology is intended to be used to describe some important features:

*'''Audio Support''': the remote control software transfers audio signals across the network and plays the audio through the speakers attached to the local computer. For example, music playback software normally sends audio signals to the locally attached speakers, via some sound controller hardware. If the remote control software package supports audio transfer, the playback software can run on the remote computer, while the music can be heard from the local computer, as though the software were running locally.
*'''[[Cobrowsing|Co-Browsing]]''': the navigation of the Web by several people accessing the same web pages at the same time. When session leader clicks on a link, all other users are transferred to the new page. Co-browsers should support multiple frames and support embedded multimedia (e.g., if a page contains a video player, the session leader may commence synchronized playback for all users. Passing URLs via other tools such as a chat or phone and entering them into browser by each user is not considered co-browsing.
&lt;!-- *'''Built-in Encryption''': the software has at least one method of [[encryption|encrypting]] the data between the local and remote computers, and the encryption mechanism is built into the remote control software.--&gt;
*'''File Transfer''': the software allows the user to transfer files between the local and remote computers, from within the client program's user interface.
*'''[[Unified Communications]]''' (UC) is a [[marketing]] [[buzzword]] describing the integration of real-time, enterprise, communication services such as [[instant messaging]] (chat), [[presence information]], voice (including [[IP telephony]]), mobility features (including extension mobility and single number reach), audio, web &amp; [[video conferencing]], [[fixed-mobile convergence]] (FMC), [[desktop sharing]], data sharing (including web connected electronic [[interactive whiteboard]]s), [[call control]] and [[computer speech recognition|speech recognition]] with non-real-time communication services such as [[unified messaging]] (integrated [[voicemail]], [[e-mail]], [[SMS]] and [[fax]]). UC is not necessarily a single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified user-interface and user-experience across multiple devices and media-types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid186_gci1322973,00.html| title= What UC is and isn't | first= Blair | last= Pleasant | publisher= SearchUnifiedCommunications.com | date=2008-07-28 | accessdate=2013-07-26| quote = UC is not a single product but rather a solution made up of a variety of communication tools and components. [...] UC is a comprehensive solution that ties several components together with user experience.

'''Document Number Nine''' (or '''Document No. 9'''), more properly the '''Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere'''&lt;ref name=cf/&gt; (also translated as the '''Briefing on the Current Situation in the Ideological Realm'''&lt;ref name=econ1/&gt;), is a [[Internal media of the People's Republic of China|confidential internal document]] widely circulated within the [[Communist Party of China]] in 2013 by the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hndj.gov.cn/html/jgdj/gzkx/2013/5168269.html 省储备局认真学习贯彻落实《关于当前意识形态领域情况的通报》] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615122048/http://www.hndj.gov.cn/html/jgdj/gzkx/2013/5168269.html |date=15 June 2013 }}，湖南机关党建, 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtibet.cn/zhuanti/2013-05/09/cms340592article.shtml 西藏广电局召开传达学习有关文件精神会议] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615105337/http://www.vtibet.cn/zhuanti/2013-05/09/cms340592article.shtml |date=15 June 2013 }}，中国西藏之声网, 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The document was first ciculated in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2012/0703/c83855-18430666.html 任洁，当前我国意识形态建设面临的六大挑战，党建2012–第7期]&lt;/ref&gt; The document warns of seven dangerous Western values, allegedly including media freedom and judicial independence. Teaching on any of the seven topics is forbidden.&lt;ref name=SCMP82913&gt;{{cite news|title=Seven subjects off limits for teaching, Chinese universities told: Civil rights, press freedom and party's mistakes among subjects banned from teaching in order described by an academic as back-pedalling|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1234453/seven-subjects-limits-teaching-chinese-universities-told|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=29 August 2013|author=Raymond Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an emphasis on controlling and preventing communication using the internet of ideas subversive to one party rule. The document was issued in the context of planned economic reforms and increased calls for political reform.&lt;ref name = "NYT51313" &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/world/asia/chinese-leaders-warn-of-dangerous-western-values.html "China Warns Officials Against ‘Dangerous’ Western Values"] article by Chris Buckley in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 13 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a critique of the "liberal ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mixed messages|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21580195-xi-jinping-signals-left-while-turning-right-or-it-other-way-round-mixed-messages|newspaper=The Economist|date= 29 June 2013|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was not made available to public by the Chinese government, but in July 2013 was allegedly leaked by Chinese dissident journalist [[Gao Yu (journalist)|Gao Yu]], who was in turn sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment for "leaking state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese journalist Gao Yu faces seven years in prison for 'leaking state secrets'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-journalist-gao-yu-prison-sentence-leaking-state-secrets/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Buckley|title=Chinese Journalist Sentenced to 7 Years on Charges of Leaking State Secrets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/asia/china-journalist-gao-yu-gets-7-year-sentence.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 April 2015|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether this document is official Chinese policy or just a faction within the government.&lt;ref name=cw7/&gt; However, ''The New York Times'' suggests that it "bears the unmistakable imprimatur of [[Xi Jinping]]".
&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html?mcubz=1 | title=China Takes Aim at Western Ideas |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is thought that Document No. 9 was issued by the Central Committee General Office, and would have required the approval of Mr. Xi and other top leaders.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;
A harsh crackdown against human rights lawyers, media outlets, academics, and other such independent thinkers has followed the document's publication.&lt;ref name=cw7/&gt;

==Name==
The document has been described as a [[communiqué]]&lt;ref name=cf&gt;{{cite web|title=Document 9: A ChinaFile Translation|url=http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation|website=ChinaFile|date=8 November 2013|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Flyer (pamphlet)|circular]].&lt;ref name=econ1&gt;{{cite news|title=Tilting backwards|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/06/political-rebalancing|newspaper=The Economist|date=24 June 2013|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the document (''Document Number Nine''), as it came to be commonly referred in Western English-language press,&lt;ref name=econ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Buckley|title=China Takes Aim at Western Ideas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/world/asia/chinas-new-leadership-takes-hard-line-in-secret-memo.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 August 2013|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the fact that it was the ninth such document issued that year in China.&lt;ref name=cf/&gt;

==Contents==
The document is highly critical of what can be broadly described as "[[Western philosophy|Western values]]" (the document itself uses terms such as "Western values", "Western principles", "Western standards", "Western ideas", and more precisely, "Western constitutional democracy" and "Western-style theories of governance", as well as making references to "Western anti-China forces").&lt;ref name=cf/&gt; The document is critical of "extremely malicious" ideals spreading in the [[Chinese society]], such as ideas of (Western) [[constitutional democracy]], [[civil society]], [[universal values]] ([[freedom]], democracy, and human rights), [[neo-liberalism]], and [[freedom of the press]] (described as the "Western news values").&lt;ref name=cf/&gt;&lt;ref name=econ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The document warns that such subjects undermine the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s control over the Chinese society.&lt;ref name=econ1/&gt; The document also promotes ways of dealing with these problems, which include "Unwavering adherence to the principle of the Party's control of media."

===The Seven Noteworthy Problems===
The document specifically addresses the following issues that were seen as problems.&lt;ref name=cw7&gt;{{cite web | title=Document 9 |url= http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are the terms used in the document itself:
# Promoting Western Constitutional Democracy: An attempt to undermine the current leadership and the "socialism with Chinese characteristics" system of governance.  (Including ''the separation of powers, the multi-party system, general elections, and independent judiciaries''.)
# Promoting “universal values” in an attempt to weaken the theoretical foundations of the Party’s leadership.  (That ''“the West’s values are the prevailing norm for all human civilization”, that “only when China accepts Western values will it have a future”''.)
# Promoting civil society in an attempt to dismantle the ruling party’s social foundation.  (i.e. that ''individual rights are paramount and ought to be immune to obstruction by the state''.)
# Promoting Neoliberalism, attempting to change China’s Basic Economic System. (i.e. ''unrestrained economic liberalization, complete privatization, and total marketization''.)
# Promoting the West’s idea of journalism, challenging China’s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to Party discipline.
# Promoting historical nihilism, trying to undermine the history of the CCP and of New China.  (For example ''to deny the scientific and guiding value of Mao Zedong thought''.)
# Questioning Reform and Opening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.  (For example, saying ''“We have deviated from our Socialist orientation.”'')

==Leak==
The contents of the memo became known when accounts of presenting it to cadre in the [[Liaoyuan]] municipal government were published in the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzyfz.com/cms/shishiyaowen/jishiyaowen/xinwenkuaixun/html/715/2013-05-13/content-748603.html 市委组织部迅速贯彻落实《关于当前意识形态领域情况的通报》及《吉林：创新领航催振兴》通讯精神]，''Liaoyuan Daily'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.cnwest.com/xyrb/html/2013-05/21/content_4786102.htm 市委召开常委（扩大）会议 专题学习当前意识形态领域情况通报]，''Xianyang Daily'', 21 May 2013，See also：[http://www.xianyang.gov.cn/dwgk/2013/0521/76801.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 cadre at the [[Chongqing]] Party Committee for Urban and Rural Construction studied the material,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.gov.cn/xygl/djgz/djzx/2013-05-09-2909359.html 高举旗帜坚定信心 坚决同党中央保持高度一致]，重庆市城乡建设委员会, 9 May 2013，See also：[http://news.stnn.cc/china/201305/t20130513_1891025.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as did cadre in [[Anyang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150723062123/http://news.takungpao.com/mainland/focus/2013-05/1605728.html 安阳政协学习《当前意识形态领域情况的通报》的通知], ''Ta Kung Pao'', 13 May 2013. archived from [http://News.Takungpao.Com/mainland/focus/2013-05/1605728.Html the original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723062123/http://news.takungpao.com/mainland/focus/2013-05/1605728.Html |date=23 July 2015 }} on 23 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were no explicit mentions of the seven Western values above.

In April 2015, the ''Wall Street Journal's'' Josh Chin&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-sentences-71-year-old-journalist-to-jail-1429254633&lt;/ref&gt;  reported a 71-year-old Chinese journalist was convicted for releasing Document 9.  Journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to seven years in prison by Beijing's Third Intermediate People’s Court after being found guilty in a closed trial of leaking state secrets to foreign media. Ms Gao was accused by the court of leaking an internal Communist Party directive to an overseas Chinese news site in 2013, according to her lawyer, Mo Shaoping. Known as Document No. 9.  Historically, it is rare for Chinese authorities to detain or jail elderly critics, who were traditionally given quiet warnings when they crossed political red lines. The article suggests that the charge is a pretext for aggressive action against political dissent and cites other examples of elderly publishers and journalists being prosecuted.

==Analysis==
According to news analysis by a reporter at ''[[The New York Times]]'', the emphasis on political discipline is intended to forestall leftist, or Maoist, opposition to needed economic reforms avoiding the split which resulted in the Soviet Union during Gorbachev's reform efforts when media freedom resulted in publishing of a great deal of critical historical material and alienation of the mass of party workers.&lt;ref name = "NYT51313" /&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World''''' is a three-volume [[encyclopedia]] detailing the [[vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of the world, by cultural region.  Published in 1997, it was edited by [[Paul Oliver]] of the [[Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development]] and [[Oxford Brookes University]].

The work was initially published by the [[Cambridge University Press]] in three volumes, totalling 2,500 pages.  According to its website, "The first of the three volumes focuses on the [[architectural theory|theories]], [[principles of architecture|principles]] and [[architectural philosophy|philosophy]] that underpin traditional architecture. Volumes 2 and 3 consider these principles within specific cultural and societal contexts."

As of 2012 his encyclopedia is out of print and generally unavailable. Copies available on the internet range from $2,500 to over $5,000 (U.S.D)

The encyclopedia includes a [[glossary]], [[lexicon]] and [[bibliography]] and most styles described are also illustrated.

The companion volume ''[[Atlas of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' is published by Routledge. [http://www.routledge.com/9780415411516] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070223164530/http://www.brookes.ac.uk/schools/be/oisd/act/ivau/index.html]

[[File:Entrance to the Earth Galleries of the Natural History Museum (London, 2002-06-07).jpg|thumb|right|The atrium of the Geological Museum]]

The '''Geological Museum''' (originally '''The Museum of Practical Geology''', started in 1835)&lt;ref&gt;F. H. W. Sheppard (ed.), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40572#s5 Jermyn Street], ''[[Survey of London]]: volumes 29 and 30: St James Westminster, Part 1'' (1960), pp. 271-284.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the oldest single science museums in the world and now part of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London. It transferred from [[Jermyn Street]] to [[Exhibition Road]], [[South Kensington]] in 1935 in a building designed by Sir [[Richard Allison (architect)|Richard Allison]] and John Hatton Markham&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202009 John Hatton Markham – ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects'']&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Office of Works]].&lt;ref&gt;F. H. W. Sheppard (ed.), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47534 Geological Museum], ''[[Survey of London]]: volume 38: South Kensington Museums Area'' (1975), pp. 257-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Museum of Practical Geology was established in 1837 at a building in Craig's Court, Whitehall, at the suggestion of [[Henry de la Beche]], first Director General of the [[British Geological Survey|Geological Survey]]. The museum's library was founded by de la Beche in 1843, mainly by donation from his own library.

===Jermyn Street===
Larger premises soon became necessary, and a design for a new building was commissioned from [[James Pennethorne]]. This, built on a long narrow site with frontages in [[Piccadilly]] and [[Jermyn Street]], housed, as well as galleries, a library, lecture theatre, and offices and laboratories for the Survey. It was constructed between 1845 and 1849, and was opened by Prince Albert in May 1851.&lt;ref name=jermyn &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40572 |title=Jermyn Street |author=F. H. W. Sheppard (general editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1960 |work=Survey of London: volumes 29 and 30: St James Westminster, Part 1 |accessdate=25 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The purpose of the museum, as summarised in the ''Descriptive Guide'', published in 1867, was:&lt;blockquote&gt;to exhibit the rocks minerals, and organic remains, illustrating the maps and sections of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom: also to exemplify the applications of the Mineral productions of these Islands to the uses  of purposes of use and ornament&lt;ref  name=desc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The collections were accordingly arranged in two main  sections covering natural materials found in the United Kingdom, and industrial products made from them. There were three secondary sections, covering mechanical appliances used to process raw materials, specimens of historical products, and foreign materials imported in their raw state.&lt;ref  name=desc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Robert |last2=Rudler|first2=F. W. |title= A Descriptive Guide to the Museum of Practical Geology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DAs5AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|accessdate= |edition=Third |year=1867 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1933, the Geological Museum, still at its old location, was the focus of worldwide attention when it served as the venue of the [[London Economic Conference]], bringing together the representatives of 66 nations in a failed effort to end the then-prevalent global [[Recession|depression]]. 

====Exhibition Road====
When the museum was reopened in 1935 following the move to Exhibition Road in [[South Kensington]], it became well known for the many [[dioramas]] (three-dimensional paintings) used to interpret geology and one or two mining techniques. These have largely been dismantled since the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] took over the Museum in 1986.

In 1965, the museum was merged with the [[British Geological Survey]] and Overseas Geological Surveys, under the name "Institute of Geological Sciences". In 1971 the Museum employed the late designer [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]] to design and produce ''The Story of the Earth'', which was acknowledged as a significant breakthrough in science museum design and critically acclaimed and imitated worldwide. It was opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and became well known for the huge reproduction of a rock face, cast from site in [[Scotland]], and for its [[planetarium]], active volcano model and earthquake machine.

Between 1971 and 1974 the museum formed its own design team which, working closely with the scientists and technicians, produced a series of temporary and permanent exhibitions starting with the re-presentation of the gem collection and then, with a design team led by Giles Velarde (Head of Exhibition Design from 1974–1988), produced ''Early Days of Geology in Britain'', ''Black Gold'', ''Britain Before Man'', ''Journey to the Planets'', ''British Fossils'', ''Pebbles'', ''Treasures of the Earth'' and finally ''British Offshore Oil and Gas'', which opened in 1988.

''Treasures of the Earth'' was the first major museum gallery in the world to integrate computers presenting images and text adjacent to artefacts as part of the information process within the exhibition. The central feature film, ''Liquid Assets'', in the ''Oil and Gas'' exhibition was shot and viewed vertically from a circular gallery and won a major award from the [[IVCA]] in 1989.

"The Power Within" exhibition on [[seismology]] includes a reconstruction of the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|1995 Kobe earthquake]].

==Transfer to the Natural History Museum==
Following the relocation of the British Geological Survey's academic activities to [[Keyworth]], the museum was transferred from the custody of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] to the newly independent [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. Although an administrative merger with the Natural History Museum had been effected by 1988 (from which time the former Geological Museum was promoted as ''The Earth Galleries''), it was not until 1998 that the previously difficult to find corridor between the two museum buildings was replaced by a new link gallery.  The former Geological Museum galleries are now known as the ''Red Zone'' in the Natural History Museum's plans and internal directional signage.

===Visions of Earth===
[[File:globespin.jpg|thumb|right|The spinning globe in 1996]]

Surveys had shown that relatively few visitors navigated the Geological Museum's monumental staircase to the top floors. A major re-ordering of the galleries means that visitors are now encouraged to start their visit at the top of the building by ascending an escalator as part of the visit itinerary. 

The former Central Hall of the museum, renamed as Visions of Earth, was transformed in 1996 to a design by Neal Potter. This included the installation of a large escalator (rising eleven metres at a 30° slope) that ascends continuously over two storeys and passes through a model globe. The previously open-sided balconies of the atrium space are now solid walls lined with slabs of recycled slate. These are sand-blasted to show the major stars in the night sky and the planets in the [[solar system]]. When first opened, the globe rotated around the escalator, with dramatic sound effects based on [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Third Stone from the Sun]]", attempting to give an impression of the flux in the core of the Earth.

[[File:Natural History Museum, London, England - Earth Galleries - central atrium - Neal Potter.jpg|thumb|The globe no longer spins]]

The [[Museums Association]]'s journal ''Museum Practice'' reported in 2007 that "the contrast between galleries just before and just after Potter’s arrival (at the Natural History Museum) is like switching over from a television programme made for schools to a big-screen epic, choreographed by [[Busby Berkeley]]."

The museum hires out the hall as a venue for occasional events including dinners and receptions for up to 500 guests.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/business-centre/exclusive-events/evening-events/earth-hall/index.html/ Earth Hall Natural History Museum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hermitage Volunteer Service''' of the State [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] is an organisation of volunteers that unites foreign and Russian students with the goal of providing assistance to this world-renowned museum. The program aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities and functions as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, making the knowledge of the museum’s experts accessible to the general community. Volunteers also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests in connection with the museum.

==Mission==
The mission statement of the Hermitage Volunteer Service is "Fostering a sense of responsibility for the preservation of cultural heritage." The principal mission of the Volunteer Service is to acquaint young people with international [[culture]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]] through access to the Hermitage's extensive international collections. The volunteer program aims to help younger generations understand the value of [[tradition]] and to instill in them a feeling of responsibility for its preservation. The Volunteer Service involves young students in various cultural projects, many of which are directly linked to various museum activities.

==History==
Shortly before the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, Mikhail Kozhukhovskij approached the Hermitage Administration and proposed to create a volunteer service to help the organisation of the tricentennial activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://encblago.lfond.spb.ru/showObject.do?object=2814521805&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he began to search for individuals with experience in the creation of [[educational program]]s who were interested in being part of such a project. Due to his efforts, the Hermitage was able to choose from among a group of 150 individuals prepared to help. On 23 May, 2003 a group of volunteers wearing red uniforms entered the Hermitage for the first time and began to assist in any way they could.&lt;ref&gt;The State Hermitage Museum Report for 2003, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; Kozhukovskij was assigned to head this new Volunteer Service. While still in its infancy, the program created many projects in collaboration with various departments of the Hermitage, which allowed volunteers to become an integral part of the museum's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minatom.ru/news/18854_26.07.2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002225544/http://www.minatom.ru/news/18854_26.07.2010 |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The team==
The program is continually renewed through a constant flow of new volunteers of diverse background; students and workers, Russians and foreigners, young and old work together for the general improvement of the Hermitage. Currently volunteers involved with the program come from all over the world including [[Russia]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], [[Brazil]], [[Korea]], [[Ireland]], and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benevole.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; Each volunteer devotes time to the program according to their individual schedules and skills. They include [[linguistics|linguists]], [[art history|art historians]], [[journalism|journalists]], teachers, computer scientists, and individuals from other professions not necessarily linked to the cultural sphere. For instance, the volunteer service includes a bus driver, an [[arachnology|arachnologist]], and a dancer. After Hermitage volunteers leave the Service, many keep in touch with the program and its other members. In this way, the volunteer program has established an extensive international network of contacts.

== Awards ==
On  November 23, 2013, the government of Saint Petersburg’s Council for Youth Politics organised a celebration in honour of the State Hermitage Museum’s volunteer program in the atrium of the museum. The celebration’s main goal was to promote the museum’s young volunteer movement and raise awareness for the volunteer’s activities and projects among the citizens, authorities and companies.
Among the 150 organisations participating in the competition, the best were awarded honorary diplomas and prizes. As a competitor in the competition for “Most Effective Volunteer Program”, the State Hermitage won the award in the category “Execution of Municipal Events”. 
An honorary diploma and the bronze statue of the “Little Prince” were awarded to the volunteer program’s coordinator Mikhail Kozhukhovskij.

==Activities==
Below are some examples of the activities in which members of the program may participate:
* Reception and security: Welcoming and assisting Hermitage visitors, checking tickets and providing information
* Helping with scientific projects: Typing of museum inventories, [[conservation-restoration]], archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s, classification and management of stored artifacts
* Preparing museum publications and correspondence
* Developing new communication technology and creating designs for multi-media projects
* Helping to organize seminars and international conferences
* Translation work
* Teaching foreign languages and creating conversation groups
* Helping to move artifacts and exhibitions

==Projects==

===WHY (World Heritage &amp; Youth)===
World Heritage &amp; Youth (WHY) is the flagship project of the Volunteer Service. Its main goal is to bring into focus the importance of tradition. This project involves volunteers in various programs and conferences concerning cultural preservation. One example of the sort of issues tackled by the WHY project is the debate regarding the construction of the [[Okhta Center]], one of the most criticized building projects proposed in contemporary Saint Petersburg. Many volunteers have reacted negatively to its potential construction. Stressing the importance of preserving the historic center of Saint Petersburg, the program is actively involved in the discussion surrounding this controversial project.

The Summer University of the State Hermitage Museum is the direct result of the WHY project. Since 2009, the Volunteer Service has organized the Summer University each July in collaboration with the Russian company [[Rosatom]].&lt;ref&gt;The State Hermitage Annual Report, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Students, often from remote areas of Russia, are invited to participate in a series of events and activities designed to educate them about cultural tradition. For many of them, the Summer University is the first opportunity to discover and to explore the notion of cultural heritage. The Volunteer Service organizes various activities in conjunction with this programme.

===Project Ropsha===
Project Ropsha was the first project created by the Volunteer Service. The city of [[Ropsha]], located southwest of [[Saint Petersburg]], is the site of a palace included in [[UNESCO]]’s [[World Heritage List]]. Hermitage volunteers took part in a campaign to stop the destruction of this monument. They started by gathering information about the location, and then created a unique archive. The project involved the creation of the Christmas Tree Museum at the site of the palace, which helps the children of the city to understand this almost universal holiday tradition.

===Games, quests, and contests===
Every year the Volunteer Service organizes games conquests and activities for school-aged children and students. For example, in one fun and interesting game, students can get acquainted with the pages of world history and culture. It is a fascinating journey through the halls of the museum in search of unusual treasures and exhibits. The aim is to present world history on a level easily understood by children. Each game focuses on a particular aspect of history, cultural heritage, or tradition. In February 2009 the Service created a game called ''The Day of the [[Scythians]]'' which helped children not only discover the ancient Scythians, but also the nomads of the rich [[Pazyryk culture]].

The Service also organizes educational contests developed through collaboration with schools as part of their academic programs. Various Hermitage departments are also involved in this kind of activity. When visiting the thematic excursions and engaging in some investigations, students can discover a wonderful world of history and culture.

Games and quests organized by the Volunteer Service of the Hermitage:
* ''Gods. Stars. Planets'' Quest, April 12, 2017.
* ''Discover your Europe in the Hermitage'' Kinoquest, September 24 - end of 2016.

=== Computer Graphics and Animation Contests ===
Since 2005 the Volunteer Service of the State Hermitage has been hosting contests for students in the field of information technology. Every year the Volunteer Service develops and organizes contests with the NMO "School Center." The theme of the contest depends on the Hermitage Museum exhibitions and events. The contest includes special educational programs for participants aged 6 to 17 years, a staff of volunteers and informatics teachers, and an official awards ceremony. The types of competition entries include animations, multimedia performances, and computer arts. The winning entries are displayed on monitors in the halls of the Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10003">'''[[Transylvania]]''' has had different [[toponym|names]] applied to it in several traditions.

==Transylvania==
The first reference to the region was as the [[Medieval Latin]] expression ''terra ultra silvam'' "land beyond the forest" in a document dating to 1075. The expression ''Partes Transsylvanæ'' "area beyond the forest" appears in the 12th century in ''Legenda Sancti Gerhardi'' and subsequently as ''Transsilvania'' in medieval documents of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kingdom]].

==Ardeal/Erdély==
The names of ''Ardeal'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and ''Erdély'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are believed to be connected. However, the original source and meaning are disputed and claimed by both Romanians and Hungarians. 

The first Hungarian form recorded was ''Erdeuelu'' (12th century, in the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''), while the first Romanian form recorded was in 1432 as ''Ardeliu''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Mallow, ''Transylvania'', 2nd edn. (Bradt Travel Guides, 2013), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupprecht Rohr, ''Kleines rumänisches etymologisches Wörterbuch: 1. Band: A-B'', s.v. “Ardeal” (Frankfurt am Main: Haag + Herchen, 1999), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial ''a''/''e'' difference between the names can be found in other Hungarian and Romanian words, such as Hung. ''egres'' ‘[[gooseberry]]’ → Rom. ''agriș'', ''agreș'', as well as in placenames, e.g., ''Egyed'', ''Erdőd'', ''Erdőfalva'', ''Esküllő'' → ''Adjud'', ''Ardud'', ''Ardeova'', and ''Așchileu''.

===Hungarian view===
The consensus of Hungarian linguists and Hungarian historians on the etymology of both ''Erdély'' and ''Transylvania'' is as follows:
* The modern Hungarian form ''Erdély'' was derived from ''Erdő-elü'', literally ‘beyond the forest’. ''Erdő'' means ‘woods, forest’, and the archaic ''elü'' suffix meant ‘beyond’ (modern reflexes: dialectal ''elvé'' ‘beyond’, dialectal ''el'', ''elv'' ‘the place beyond’) and was applied to a certain type of border region (''gyepű'') and the associated social and economical organisation; for example, ''Gyepűelve'' (near [[Uzhhorod|Ungvár]]), and archaic ''Havaselve'' ‘[[Wallachia]]’, lit. "beyond the snowy mountains" (modern ''Havasalföld''), refers to a region lying beyond the [[Carpathian mountains]] if viewed from Hungary, and was under strong Hungarian political influence during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="benko1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benkő Loránd |author2=Kiss Lajos |author3= Papp László |year=1984 |title=A magyar nyelv történeti-etimológiai szótára |location=Budapest |publisher= Akadémiai Kiadó |isbn=963-05-3810-5 |language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; If viewed from Hungary, ''Erdő-elü'' probably refers to the fact that the Transylvanian plateau is separated in the northwest from the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] and [[Crișana]] plains by the well-forested [[Apuseni Mountains|Apuseni mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Armin Hetzer, “Alloglotte Sprechergruppen in den romanischen Sprachräumen: Südostromania”, ''Romanische Sprachgeschichte'', vol. 23, part 2 (Berlin-NY: Walter de Gruyter, 2006), 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, from the point of view east of the Carpathians, the name could suggest that the Hungarian name was created in [[Etelköz]]/Atelkuzu (Hungarian homeland in southern Ukraine), prior to settling on the Hungarian plain.
* The Medieval Latin form ''Ultrasylvania'' (1077), later ''Transylvania'' (from an other point of view after the foundation of Hungary in 895), was a direct translation from the Hungarian form (rather than the Hungarian being derived from the Latin).&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;Engel, Pál (2001). ''Realm of St. Stephen: History of Medieval Hungary, 895–1526 (International Library of Historical Studies)'', London: [[I.B. Tauris]]. {{ISBN|1-86064-061-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is also supported by the [[Romania]]n historian [[Ioan-Aurel Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pop|first=Ion-Aurel|trans-title=The Medieval History of Transylvania: from the Romanian Ethnogenesis until Michael the Brave|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/30886268/Istoria-Transilvaniei-Medievale|title=Istoria Transilvaniei Medievale: De la Etnogeneza Romanilor pana la Mihai Viteazul|accessdate=2013-10-03 |year=1997|language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Romanian view===
Several Romanian perspectives have suggested alternative etymologies:
* A letter from around 960 from the [[Khazar]] king [[Joseph (Khazar)|Joseph]] to [[Chasdai ibn Shaprut]], the Rabbi of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]],  mentions the ''Ardil country'' (''Eretz Ardil''), rich in gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. F. |last=Otrokocsi |title=Origines Hungaricae|volume=I |page= 27 |year=1693 |language=la |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y48AAAAAcAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Halevi |authorlink=Judah Halevi |title=Sefer ha-Kuzari |location=Vilna |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martian"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ion|last= Marțian|title=Ardealul nu derivă din ungurește |location=Bistrița |year=1925 |language=ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in Hebrew, Ardeal is written identically: ארדיל. This theory therefore suggests that ''Ardi(a)l'' was the primary form of the name and thus "Ardeal" is an original Romanian toponym.{{Synthesis-inline|date=November 2008}}

==Siebenbürgen==
The oldest occurrences of this form are from the 13th century:
* In the year 1241: in ''Annales Sancti Trudperti'' and in the Annals of Zwifalt: "''Tartari terras Pannonie, '''Septum urbium''', Moraviae vestaverunt''”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores |volume=X |location=Hannover |year=1852 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores |volume=XVII |year=1861 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the year 1242: in the notes of the friar Erfurt: „''Eodem anno Tartari in Ungaria, terra scilicet '''Septem castrorum''', civitatem dictam Hermanii villam in Aprili expugnantes, usque ad centum ibi peremerunt...''”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores | volume=XVI |year= 1859 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the year 1285: "''...Eodem anno Tarthari terram Ungarie que dicitur '''Septemcastris''', intraverunt et multos christianos captivaverunt et occiderunt''” and "''...quid audientes '''Septemcastrenses'''''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores |chapter=Annales Polonorum |volume= XIX |page=684}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the year 1296: a reference to a particular "''maister Dietrich von Siebenbuergen''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urkundebuch zur Geschichte der Deutschen in Siebenbürgen |volume=I |issue=nr. 201 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the year 1300: Ottacher of [[Styria]] mentions "''Sybenburger''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Apud J. |last=Wolff |chapter=Die Landesnamen Siebenbürgens'|title=Programm des vierklassigen evangelischen Gymnasiums in Mühlbach |language=de  |location=Hermannstadt |year=1886 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist a number of theories on the etymology of ''Siebenbürgen'', the [[German language|German]] name for Transylvania.

The most widely accepted theory is that ''Siebenbürgen'' refers to the seven principal fortified towns of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. The name first appeared in a document from 1296. An alternate Medieval Latin version, ''Septem Castra'' ("Seven fortresses") was also used in documents. The towns alluded to are: Bistritz ([[Bistrița]], Beszterce), Hermannstadt ([[Sibiu]], Nagyszeben), Klausenburg ([[Cluj-Napoca]], Kolozsvár), Kronstadt ([[Brașov]], Brassó), Mediasch ([[Mediaș]], Medgyes), Mühlbach ([[Sebeș]], Szászsebes), and Schässburg ([[Sighișoara]], Segesvár). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Other theories include:
* ''Siebenbürgen'' means "Seven Castles" but does not refer to the towns of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. Transylvania and the [[Mureș River|Mureș]] valley seem to have been the first portion of land within the Carpathians where Magyars gained a foothold. According to legend, each of the seven Magyar chieftains erected an earthen 'castle' in this region.&lt;ref name="kontler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kontler|first=László|year=1999 |title=A History of Hungary: Millennium in Central Europe |location=Budapest |publisher=Atlantisz |isbn=963-9165-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Siebenbürgen'' means explicitly "Seven Towns" or "Seven Castles". However, this etymology seems to originate in the dialectical tradition of the first, mainly Low German, Flemish and Dutch settlers, in whose homelands there are hilly regions called "Zevenbergen" (a town in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands) and "Sevenbergen" (east of the town of Hameln on the river Weser, Germany).&lt;ref name="popa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Popa |first=Klaus |year=1996 |url=http://www.zinnenwarte.de/Transsylvania/Out.htm |title=An Outline of Transilvanian-Saxon History |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saxon settlement in Transylvania began in Sibiu. An early German name for the town was ''Cibinburg'' (akin to the ''Cibiniensis'' Latin name of the area). The alternate name ''Cibinburg'' was corrupted into ''Siebenbürgen'', and became the name for the whole region.&lt;ref name="engel" /&gt;

The [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names of the region (''Sedmigradsko'' or ''Sedmogradsko'' (''Седмиградско'' or ''Седмоградско'') in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], ''Sedmogradska'' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], ''Sedmograjska'' in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], ''Sedmihradsko'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], ''Sedmohradsko'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], ''Siedmiogród'' in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Semihorod'' (''Семигород'') in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), as well as its [[Walloon language|Walloon]] name (''Zivenbork''), are translations of the German one.

In Ukrainian, the name Zalissia ({{lang-uk|Залісся}}), meaning "beyond the forest" is also used.

'''''Homo Necans: the Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth''''' ({{lang-de|Homo Necans: Interpretationen Altgriechischer Opferriten und Mythen}}) is a 1972 book on [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]] by [[Walter Burkert]]. It won the Weaver Award for Scholarly Literature, awarded by the Ingersoll Foundation, in 1992.

==Summary==
Burkert's core thesis is that when [[paleolithic]] man became a [[hunter]], in spite of the generally [[omnivore|omnivorous]] orientation of the [[great apes]], lack of a [[predator]] instinct was made up for by turning patterns of intra-species [[aggression]] against the prey: ''Homo necans'' means "man the killer". Thus, the animal hunted by ancient man automatically acquired aspects of an equal, as if it were of one of the hunter's relations. In a first attempt at applying [[ethology]] to [[religious history]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert  1983: "Introduction" p. xiii; Burkert in his introduction to the English edition remarked upon the emergence of [[sociobiology]].&lt;/ref&gt; Burkert confronts the power and effect of tradition in uncovering traces of ancient hunting rituals so motivated in historical [[animal sacrifice]] and [[human sacrifice]] (by his thesis unified as deriving from the same fundamental principle) in specific historical Greek [[ritual]]s with relevance to human [[religion|religious behaviour]] in general. Burkert acknowledges that a decisive impulse for the thesis derived from [[Konrad Lorenz]]' ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).

The thesis is an extension of the [[hunting hypothesis]], which states that hunting as a means of obtaining food was a dominant influence on human evolution and cultural development (as opposed to gathering vegetation or scavenging). The guilt incurred in the violence of the hunt was reflected in sacred crimes, which through rituals of cleansing and expiation served to unify communities. Burkert supports his thesis by integrating a multitude of examples that elaborate primitive ritual as it is reflected in [[Greek mythology]]. He examines various [[Cult (religion)|cult-complexes]] in detail, confronting "sacrificial ritual with its tension between encountering death and affirming life, its external form consisting of preparations, a frightening central moment, and restitution",&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1983:83.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirming in detail the initial hypothesis.

==Influence and reception==
''Homo Necans'' was conceived in the 1960s; it controversially introduced [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], along the lines of [[Jane Ellen Harrison]]'s ''Themis'', to a German audience, and employed a form of [[structuralism]] in interpreting complexes of ritual and festival, to apply some findings of [[ethology]] for the first time to mythology. [[René Girard]]'s ''[[Violence and the Sacred]]'' appeared the same year. The book that was controversial at its first appearance was less revolutionary when it finally appeared in English, Burkert noted, in an introduction to the English translation (1983). Historian [[Peter Gay]] praised ''Homo Necans'' as a suggestive discussion of the impulse to revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gay, Peter |title=The Bourgeois Experience Victoria to Freud. The Cultivation of Hatred |publisher=FontanaPress |location=London |year=1995 |page=616 |isbn=0-00-638089-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Parker (historian)|Robert Parker]], in reviewing ''Homo Necans'' for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', observed of Burkert that "boldness of theory and consummate learning are united in him as in few others". [[M.L. West]], in ''[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]'', remarked that the book was "an exceptional intellectual experience".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15681">'''Intercultural learning''is an area of research, study and application of knowledge about different cultures, their differences and similarities. On the one hand, it includes a theoretical and academic approach (see e.g. "[[Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS)]]" by [[Milton Bennett]], Dimensions of Culture by [[Geert Hofstede]]). On the other hand, it comprises practical applications such as learning to negotiate with people from different cultures, living with people from different cultures, living in a different culture and the prospect of peace between different cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, intercultural learning is a topic which receives much interest. This is mainly due to the rise of [[cultural studies]] and [[globalization]]. Culture has become an instrument for social interpretation and communicative action. Intercultural learning is primarily important in the context of the foreign language classroom.

Basic training modules include:
#Information about the country, introduction to culture and history
#The [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[Value (ethics)|value]]s of the society
#The role and the characteristics of [[communication]]
#Social contacts: Friends and acquaintances
#Women – life and role
#[[Leisure]] activities and customs
#Eating and drinking
#The relations at work and management
#Doing business in the country
#Education
#Studies and professional training
#Norms, laws, and [[taboo]]s
#Action plan for the first two months in the country

== Definition ==
The main goal of intercultural learning is seen as the development of [[intercultural competence]], which is the ability to act and relate appropriately and effectively in various cultural contexts:&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal. London: GloBus Research, p. 41 (also see: http://icca.globusresearch.com); Spitzberg, B. H. (2000). A Model of Intercultural Communication Competence. In L. A. Samovar, &amp; R. E. Porter, Intercultural Communication - A Reader (pp. 375-87). Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Appropriateness'''. Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
* '''Effectiveness'''. Values goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.
Intercultural competence is generally thought to require three components on the learner's side: a certain skillset, culturally sensitive knowledge, and a motivated mindset. In greater detail, the skills, values, and attitudes that constitute intercultural competence include
# intercultural attitudes (like openness, curiosity, readiness)
# general knowledge (of the theoretical aspects of how social groups/products/practices work and interact)
# skills of interpreting and relating (a document of another culture to one's own culture)
# skills of discovery and interaction (like the ability to discover information about another culture and the ability to communicate in real-time interaction)
# critical cultural awareness (that there are different cultures next to one's own)
The teacher's task is to induce the learning of all in these aspects in the learner. Being successful, intercultural learning results in culturally competent learners.

== Theories on approaching culture ==
In the context of intercultural learning, it is important to be aware of different subcategories of [[culture]], such as "little c" and "big C" culture. While the latter one is also called "objective culture" or "formal culture" referring to institutions, big figures in history, literature, etc., the first one, the "subjective culture", is concerned with the less tangible aspects of a culture, like everyday patterns. In intercultural learning, a mixture of these two is to be employed, but it is especially the apprehension of subjective culture that triggers the development of [[intercultural competence]].&lt;br /&gt;
Also, it is important to differentiate between "culture-specific" and "culture-general" approaches when intercultural learning is concerned:
*"culture-specific" approaches mainly aim at the achievement of competence in a particular target culture (C2) and are closely connected to specific language learning ([[second language|L2]]). Competence in both C2 and L2 is usually thought to generate culturally appropriate behavior in a particular cultural context.
*"culture-general" approaches, on the other hand, are not targeted on a particular culture. Instead, they are concerned with "universal categories" which function as general characteristics of cultures in general. These categories can be used to make cross-cultural comparisons, for example. Thus, "culture-general" approaches provide a [[Cognition|cognitive]] framework for cultural analysis.
Intercultural learning requires the teacher to employ a mix of "culture-specific" and "culture-general" approaches in order to address  the larger issues of ethnocentrism, cultural self-awareness, etc. because intercultural competence cannot be achieved by the single acquisition of knowledge about a specific culture or the pure ability to behave properly in that culture.

The MUSIC Intercultural Model was designed by Jon Jeeves in 1996 to help businesses become more aware and effective when dealing with people from different cultures. The name for the model is an acronym and is based on five cultural dimensions, which through research and practical experience of international projects, have shown to represent the major value differences with conflict potential in global business.

The model compliments research from Hall, Trompenaars and Hofstede in addition to the validation and refinement carried out by Jon Jeeves and his ongoing work with international teams.

The five categories are:

# Matrix of Relationships
# Uncertainty Tolerance
# Sequencing of Time
# I and We
# Communication Context&lt;ref&gt;http://musicinterculturalmodel.wikispaces.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts in the classroom ==
Contexts that are seen as appropriate for intercultural learning in the classroom are those which promote the acquisition of intercultural competence consisting of the components mentioned above. Examples:
*communication between members of different cultures via e-mail: not yet a standard in everyday schooling, but it serves many useful purposes for intercultural learning
*authentic print text: [[fictional]] texts are the ideal medium for intercultural learning since it is the substrate of a specific culture and its history, while it simultaneously contains culture-general aspects; it stimulates personal identification and it offers numerous options for creative activities; also it may induce discussions of aspects of subjective, as well as objective, culture - useful examples: [[Malorie Blackman|Malorie Blackman's]] [[Noughts and Crosses series]], Qaisra Shahraz' "A Pair of Jeans"; [[non-fictional]] texts are definitely useful in this context as well.
*film: authentic film especially improves the language proficiency (and thus intercultural sensitivity), because it means direct and authentic contact with the L2; it also guarantees access to  the evaluation of audiovisual media and maybe even [[new media]]- useful examples: [[Bend It Like Beckham]], [[Save the Last Dance]], [[My Beautiful Laundrette]]

=== Cultural differences in learning ===
Of particular importance to intercultural learning is understanding cultural differences in learning processes. Intercultural learning programs could benefit greatly from the analysis of cultural trends in these processes. By doing so, educators can see how [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people of America]] are affected by classroom norms. In indigenous American ways of learning, children are included in the community and have lots of experience collaborating with each other and adults in productive ways.

*For example, members of indigenous American and indigenous-heritage American communities prefer to learn in collaborative groups as opposed to individually. Teachers in Zuni schools arrange the students' desks in a circle and address the group from the center, spinning around slowly to address all members equally.&lt;ref name="Yamauchi, L. 1995"&gt;Yamauchi, L., A. &amp; Tharp, R., G. (1995). Culturally Compatible Conversations in Native American Classrooms. ''Linguistics and Education'' 7, 349-367.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zuni are a Native-American tribe from the present day Arizona, New Mexico border. Arrangement of student desks in this manner is compatible with the larger cultural trend of preference for collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="Yamauchi, L. 1995"/&gt; In addition, research has shown that communication styles among indigenous and indigenous-heritage groups differ from that of European-American "formal" instruction. For example, slower talking pace, distributed gaze among group members, more frequent teacher interruption, and longer wait time between teacher question and student response are some qualities of indigenous American learning practices. More specifically, all of these behaviors can be observed in Navajo students.&lt;ref&gt;Tharp, R., G. (2008). A Perspective on Unifying Culture and Psychology: Some Philosophical and Scientific Issues. ''Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology'' 27(2), 2007 &amp; 28(1), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be a link between the collaborative preference seen in these specific groups, and the conversational styles they prefer to engage in.
*Formal and informal learning are different among westernized cultures and indigenous cultures. Both formal and informal learning have two components one looking at it from situations/practices and the second one from the learning process. Indigenous ways of learning has often been marginalized or discriminated against in formal schooling because it does not follow society ways of learning.&lt;ref name="Göran2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göran|first=Folkestad|title=Formal and informal learning situations or practices vs formal and informal ways of learning|journal=British Journal of Music Education|year=2006|volume=23|pages=135–145|doi=10.1017/s0265051706006887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to understand the learning process through informal learning and making the connection of how it happens in today's society through formal learning can benefit and help us learn much more. It is overly simplified when saying that formal learning happens in institutions and that informal learning happens only outside of institutions.

Analysis of cultural differences in learning can provide new and useful insight that can be applied to intercultural learning practice. In other words, learning trends in students' cultural backgrounds can be used by teachers to create more well informed pedagogy. For example, if indigenous American or indigenous-heritage American students were in an intercultural learning program, teachers could communicate knowledge by creating a more collaborative setting, and by adjusting pace of speech to be consistent with the students'.

=== Activities ===
As with most activities employed in the classroom, activities for intercultural learning are supposed to keep the [[affective]] domain of learning in mind, that is, they are to keep the students motivated and enable them to somehow identify with topic that is dealt with. For intercultural learning this is especially true because this field is likely to turn into a delicate matter.
*An example of an activity which focuses on the stereotypes and prejudices that people are likely to have is called "Who should be hired?". This exercise animates students to choose from a huge number of people (from different cultures, of different sexes, and different ages, etc.) the person they would hire from an employer's point of view.
*Most suggested exercises that are believed to support intercultural learning, and in this especially to promote empathy, are of a [[role-play]] nature. They especially support students in making the shift in perspective: their own culture becomes a strange one and is looked at from the outside, while the target culture becomes familiar.
*Events that relate to family and community, such as working together help Native-American students in some classroom aspects. Many are used to collaboration, so they work in groups and interact with their peers. However, they still pay attention when working individually. Because Native American students are used to collaboration they are able to participate in group activities that don't create a distinction between individual performer and audience. On the other hand, they had less willingness to perform or participate verbally when they had to talk alone (as an individual rather than group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florio-Ruane|first=Susan|title=Knowledge base for the beginning teacher |year=1989|publisher=Oxford: Pergamon|pages=163–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also observed that the Native American students didn't want to talk when the teacher was addressing the whole class, which shows their preference of working in groups.

== Future prospects ==
The concept of intercultural learning aiming at the development of intercultural competence also requires a new understanding of the teacher him/herself. S/He is no longer a mere communicator of knowledge, but a mediator and moderator, and has to be educated accordingly. In times of globalization and hope for peace, this issue needs to be researched further and remain of huge interest.

'''''Letters from the Lost: A Memoir of Discovery''''' is a non-fiction memoir, written by Canadian writer '''Helen Waldstein Wilkes''', first published in December 2009 by [[Athabasca University Press]]. In the book, the author chronicles her discoveries after reading a box of letters she had never before seen. Her Jewish parents had fled [[Czechoslovakia]] in April 1939&lt;ref name="lflau"&gt;Ottosen, Erin, June 15, 2011, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.open-au.com/inside.php?attr=121&amp;type=aupress ''Letters from the Lost'' wins "Alberta Readers’ Choice Award"]&lt;/span&gt;, Open AU, Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; to seek [[Sanctuary|haven]] in Canada. Once in place, they corresponded with family and friends, encouraging them to escape the mounting peril that [[Hitler]] had envisioned as the [[Final Solution]]. Wilkes would learn that shortly after her parents migration, the ability to flee had been curtailed; and that each letter, compounded the historical anguish the writers were forced to endure.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Megan Moore, &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=6851 ''Letters from the Lost'']&lt;/span&gt;, Quill &amp; Quire, Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every word of the Serbian Orthodox ceremonies are of Greek origin: parastos (парастос).

'''Country calling codes''' or '''country dial in codes''' are telephone dialing prefixes for the member countries or regions of the  [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU). They are defined by the [[ITU-T]] in standards [[E.123]] and [[E.164]]. The prefixes enable [[international direct dialing]] (IDD), and are also referred to as ''international subscriber dialing'' (ISD) codes.

[[File:CallingCodesWorld-Labeled.svg|thumb|500px|Worldwide distribution of country calling codes colored by first digit]]
Country codes are a component of the international [[telephone numbering plan]], and are necessary only when dialing a [[telephone number]] to establish a call to another country. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local [[List of international call prefixes|international call prefix]] must first be dialed. For example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the [[North American Numbering Plan]] is 011, while it is 00 in most European, Asian and African countries. On [[GSM]] (cellular) networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.

==Tree list==
Country calling codes are [[prefix code]]s and can be organized as a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. In each row of the table, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.

==Alphabetical listing by country or region==
&lt;!--
Please try to keep the country/territory names consistent with the CLDR project.
Please see the section Consistency with Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)
on the talk page.
If you add/edit entries in this table, be sure to use the {{ntsh}} template in the Code column,
with the code padded on the right with 0s to 5 digits. This is necessary for sorting to work correctly.

Abkhazia was assigned +7&amp;nbsp;840 for landline and +7&amp;nbsp;940 for mobile operators on 28 September 2009. Abkhazia will also continue using +995&amp;nbsp;44. Other digits are reserved for Russia. Currently, there are no internationally accessible numbers starting with 0, 1, 2 or 5 – these are access codes and similar arrangements.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''maxim''' is a concise expression of a fundamental [[morality|moral]] rule or principle, whether considered as [[wikt:objectivity|objective]] or [[subjectivity|subjective]] contingent on one's [[philosophy]]. A maxim is often [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and motivates specific actions. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' defines it as:
{{quote|Generally any simple and memorable rule or guide for living; for example, 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] speaks of 'a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart ([[Locksley Hall]]), and maxims have generally been associated with a 'folksy' or 'copy-book' approach to [[moral]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Maxim (Oxford University Press 2008) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deontological ethics==

In [[deontological ethics]], mainly in [[Kantian ethics]], maxims are understood as [[subjectivity|subjective]] principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1)&amp;nbsp;the action, or type of action; (2)&amp;nbsp;the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3)&amp;nbsp;the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the [[categorical imperative]] provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.

The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|date=1993|pages=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.&lt;ref name="Gregor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|translator=Mary Gregor |title=Critique of Practical Reason|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=25/5:27|isbn=0-521-59051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, an action is said to have "moral worth" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his [[duty]] purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason.  Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely "from duty", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.

==Personal knowledge==
[[Michael Polanyi]] in his account of [[tacit knowledge]] stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Claxton, ''Live and learn (1992) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum of St. Maximilian Kolbe ''"There was a Man"''''' (Polish: ''Muzeum św. Maksymiliana "Był człowiek"'') - is a museum, located in Niepokalanów monastery in Poland. Dedicated to the life and work of Father [[Maximilian Kolbe]], evangelization activity of Niepokalanów, and the Franciscan missions throughout the world.

== Founding of the museum ==
The museum is located in one of the old buildings in [[Niepokalanów]], where there used to be a laundry and a carpenter's workshop. The [[exhibition]], which takes three rooms, was created by the employees of the Museum of the town of [[Pabianice]]. Now it's opened to visitors every day from 8.00 to 18.00.

6 August 1998 two compartments of the museum were opened to the public and blessed by card. [[Józef Glemp]], who expressed his hope that the new exhibition will be ''a good catechesis'', showing the visitors ''a shortest path to God''. A month later, 20 September 1998, the museum was extended and a third compartment (missionary) was open by Franciscan bishop Jan Wilk, working in Brazil mission.

== Exhibitions ==
In the first compartment a visitor in welcomed by the statue of St. Maximilian, made of bronze by the Italian sculptor Roberto Joppolo of [[Viterbo]]. The statue was blessed by Pope [[John Paul II]] in October 1982 during the ceremony of canonization of St. Maximilian Kolbe.

In the second part a visitor can see pre-war photographs and exhibits with explanations concerning the life and activity of the founder of [[Niepokalanów]] - St. Maximilian - since his childhood, through youth, studies, Japan mission until building a large publishing monastery, called Niepokalanów. The third room presents collection from the Franciscan missions in the world, offered mostly by the missionaries working in Japan, Brazil, Zambia, Peru, Kenya or Tanzania.

There are some peculiar pieces in this collection:&lt;br&gt;
- a portrait of St. Maximilian made from post stamps;&lt;br&gt;
- dried piranhas and skin of exotic snake;&lt;br /&gt;
- an image of the Mother of God woven from cereal grains.

'''''Old Moore's Almanac''''' is an [[almanac]] which has been published for nearly two and a half centuries. Its founder, '''Theophilus Moore''', ran a classical academy at [[Milltown, Dublin|Milltown]] which was then a village near [[Dublin]] (since that time, it has been incorporated into the city). A teacher of Irish, English, Greek and Latin, he became known as a clever mathematician and a veritable wizard of astrology, gaining the nickname 'The Irish Merlin'. He published his ''Old Moore's Almanac'' for the first time in 1764, and received such support that the other Irish almanacs gradually dwindled away. Theophilus Moore is now buried in the Drumcondra Churchyard, in Dublin, but the tradition of ''Old Moore's Almanac'' continues unbroken to this day.

The ''Old Moore's Almanac'' is not to be confused with ''[[Old Moore's Almanack]]'' (with a "k"), an English publication.

The ''Old Moore's Almanac'' is published annually in November. The current owners of the ''Old Moore's Almanac,'' the Lithographic Group, possess back issues dating from 1914 onwards. Issues before this time are held in the National Library of Ireland. The magazine was traditionally a resource for the merchants and business people of the late 1760s, and later, an entertainment-style publication for the agricultural community in rural Ireland. Farmers and fishing folk of the day found the tables of moon and tide times, and transport information, among other useful information very handy on a daily basis. 

Now that such information is available on the internet, the magazine was re-launched in 2010, offering a more diverse product to capture new audiences. The magazine is now full colour and now has editorial features. Topics include the revival of lost Irish traditions, technology, urban farming, country sporting pursuits, unusual breeds of animals, recipes, hints and tips, the paranormal, traditional medicine, horoscopes, and an analysis of antique issues of the Almanac (pre-1950). The circulation of the hard copy is around 47,000, with most sales achieved in [[Athlone]], [[Dublin]], [[Galway]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. The predictions are the most popular section of the ''Almanac''. The in-house psychic remains anonymous, often quoting that he "likes to stay under the radar" and away from public life.

The magazine has increased its circulation year-on-year since 2010, which is unusual as printed magazines across the board have seen their circulations fall as more people turn to online reading material.

'''Beginnings'''

In 1764, an almanac called ''The Irish Merlin'' burst onto the scene. It was published by Theophilus Moore, known henceforth to generations of Irish people as “Old Moore.” But when it was first published, this almanac did not bear the compiler's name, but it was indeed the first ''Old Moore's Almanac''. There was a good reason why Theophilus did not put his name to the ''Irish Merlin''. At the time, the Catholic faith was actively being quashed, and Theophilus, a convinced Catholic, wanted to publish anonymously so he could be free to be completely Catholic in the ''Irish Merlin'', without attracting undue attention from authorities to his entrepreneurial efforts.

John McCall (editor of ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' from 1874 to 1902) in his manuscript ''History of Irish Almanacks'' confirmed that ''The Irish Merlin'' was published by Theophilus Moore. He says it was known as one of 'Stewart's Merlins' because it was printed by A. Stewart, a well-known printer and editor of the time. 

According to McCall, Moore did indeed commence his almanac in 1764. ''“At the same time he removed to Dublin where he opened an academy in Charlemont St. and annually supplied the almanack. He was related to Thomas Moore, the poet, who attended his school for a considerable time before he entered college. Theophilus frequented the house of Thomas Moore's father in Aungier St.; they were kinsmen in name and race and consequently allied to each other by ties of close intimacy for many years. Moore's almanack had not the registry of his name till after the period of 1782 when Catholic disabilities were partially removed, when his name appeared in his almanacks. He died at the close of the eighteenth century."'' 

Another account of his early life seems to match the one above. The alternative account gives his birth as 1730 in Offaly, the territory of the O'Moores. It has been asserted that he was a descendant of Rory Oge O'Moore, the ruins of whose castle may still be seen on the rock of Dunamase, three miles east of Port Laoise. The future astrologer spent his youth on the plains of Offaly. He had a great thirst for learning and acquired a deep knowledge in English, Irish, Latin and Greek. He also studied mathematics and astrology. When aged about 30 he went to Dublin, where for a time he led a precarious existence. Ultimately he settled on the Palmerston estate in Old Rathmines, between Milltown and "The Bloody Fields." Here he opened an Academy and taught mathematics and classics as well as astronomy and astrology. He is said to have taught the young members of the Palmerston household, but his fidelity to the Catholic faith and refusal to conform to the Established Church lost him their patronage. Before entering Trinity College, Thomas Moore, the poet, attended the academy of Theophilus as a pupil, and it is said that master and pupil, namesakes and kinsmen, remained always firm friends. 

These two separate accounts do match up. Both agree that Theophilus Moore commenced his almanack shortly after coming to Dublin (the almanack would later be spelled almanac). In its early issues the ''Merlin'' did not bear the compiler's name, but merely his nom-de-plume: "Philomath." (Philomath means “tutor.”)

After the ''Merlin'' had been published for about thirty years, "Philomath" became very well known for his prognostications. But many people wanted in on Theophilus’ growing fortune, and claimed to be "Philomath," so in 1793, Theophilus Moore came out from the shelter of his ''nom-de-plume'', and claimed his success. From that point onwards, the almanac appeared bearing his name. The title was now ''The Irish Merlin, or Moore's Almanack, 1793, by Theophilus Moore, Philomath.'' Soon after, it simply became known as ''Moore's Almanack.''

From 1793 until his death, the almanac appeared with the compiler's name. It grew in popularity and fame. It was in the first decade of the nineteenth century that the famed astrologer died, or as the media reported, that he “was gathered to his fathers.” He was then nearly 80 years old.

The woodcut picture of Theophilus Moore used in the book for centuries was carved towards the end of his life, and it shows him bent over, with a walking stick. It seems to be an accurate portrait of Theophilus. Before photos were widely available, people described people's looks with “pen pictures.” A pen picture by the Revd. Patrick O'Byrne, of Ralston Street, described him well. ''"In his early manhood his figure was tall, slight, elastic and graceful; towards the end of his life it naturally was inclined to be stooped. His face was long, narrow and handsome, and his fine head was covered to the last with long masses of soft and wavy hair. His eagle eyes were set deep beneath shaggy beetling eyebrows. His nose was long and aquiline; and the furrowed lines on his high and intellectual forehead proclaimed to the world the deep and anxious thought that ever occupied his great and active mind."'' 

The editorship of the almanac is not clear for a considerable time after the death of Theophilus. However, the magazine continued to be published every year under the name ''Moore's Almanack''. And more copycat magazines appeared (“spurious editions” as they were called). The many copycat editions raised the irk of the real Old Moore's Almanac. In fact they editors of the time often wrote to newspapers complaining about it. 

He is an article from the Weekly Telegraph in 1852, in the literature section:

'''''Moore's Almanack'' for the year of Our Lord 1853''' 

''We are calling attention to this work, the genuine Old Moore’s Irish Almanack, we feel bound especially to notice because we are aware that the attempt is made to the great injury of the author, and to the great injury of the Irish trade, as well as great injury to the honest fame and fair reputation of the country to call upon the public to either spurious imitations of the real work or to import amongst the people a contraband article called “Moore's Almanack” which is we believe written and printed in England. The attempt should be made by Englishman to despoil us of our Moore's Almanac cannot be a matter of surprise when we know that our neighbours on the other side of the channel have long been endeavouring to despoil us of our Wellington by constantly speaking and writing of the Duke as an Englishman, never as an Irishman. We now conceive it to be the duty of the Irish press to earnestly resist the one dishonest attempt as the other.''

''We will not let the English have our Theophilus Moore no more than our Arthur Wellesley and we insist on proving that none but the real genuine Theophilus Moore, Philomath, abiding at Skerries could write such prophecies as to be found in The Almanac embellished with his portrait; as in the same manner it has been proved that none but the Irishman Wellington could have fought in the Battle of Waterloo and won it.  The Verity of the Irish prophet is proved by his words as the valour of the Irish general was demonstrated by his deeds.''

''Theophilus Moore, Philomath, the author of The Almanack before us, may be regarded as the only genuine living representative of the extraordinary class of beings who lived ages ago and combined together the power of foretelling future events with the gift of poesy and to whom the name “Vates” was applied in differently. In ancient times the “Vates” was the oracle of his neighbourhood and many such were to be found. But at present we believe there is but one “Vates” in all of Europe and that is our Theophilus Moore and most happy are we to perceive that our Theophilus Moore eschews all sorts of magic fortune telling and conjuring tricks of every kind and description whatsoever. Mr Theophilus Moore abjures alike heresy and idolatry. He is a genuine prophet, a poet and we feel confident, judging from his prophesies, that he is not only a pious Christian, but also a true-hearted Irishman.''

''In order that the public may judge for themselves, and that the public may better distinguish between the real Theophilus Moore and the fictitious Theophilus Moore whoever they are concocted in England or Ireland, we shall place a few extracts from his prophecies before them.''

In 1874, the editorship was given to John McCall. It was thought that just before this sometime, the word “''Old''” was added to the title, in honour of how long Theophilus actually lived, which was a remarkable achievement of the time. 

McCall was editor from 1874 to 1902, when he died at the age of 81 years. McCall held this position for more than a quarter of a century; he actually edited it until a month before his death. McCall was quite well known at this time in Ireland for many accomplishments in publishing. And he was also known during his editorship to have advanced the almanac to a very considerable extent. McCall was known as “a man of wonderful knowledge and natural ability.” 

During John McCall's editorship he gathered around him a number of vivid personalities, who all contributed to the almanac. They linked together into a clan, and John McCall was regarded as Chieftain. They considered themselves as the successors of the Irish Bards, and wrote of themselves as "The Bards of Di." This title is thought to be derived from the Goddess of the Moon, Diana; the connection of the bards with astrology makes the reference easily understood. 

Often in the pages of the ''Moore’s Almanack'' we see references to "Lady Di" and the contributors are also spoken of as "Diarians" – this latter term is, of course, derived from the word "diary," and may be the explanation of the title of the followers of Di. But whatever be the reason of their title, the bards were very proud of it, and had developed close bonds of fellowship and friendship. 

The later issues of ''Old Moore’s Almanack'' have many elegies penned for departed bards of this clan. On the death of John McCall, the bards became very vocal, and many elegies appeared for many years in praise of his work and in his memory. 

After McCall, the relatively famous Patrick Keary edited the ''Moore’s Almanack'' under the pen name “Kevin Kay” for two years. He was succeeded by Michael Fanning, and then by Seamus Bolger. 

In 1940 the circulation was 200,000 copies, and even more than that were sold ''“in every part of the globe whither Irishmen have gone.The popularity of Old Moore's Almanack was well grounded, upon its usefulness and its interest. As regards the former, it supplied, in cheap and handy form, much information of everyday service to the farmer and rural worker, as well as to many town-dwellers.”''

Even beggars were said to have bought the ''Old Moore’s Almanack'', they gained the best begging takings at the fairs and marts that were listed faithfully in each edition. 

Historian B. P. Bowen said in 1940, ''“It is not surprising that such a publication should have found favour among the people of the country, when newspapers were scarce, before modern progress had so changed means of communication. It has been said, with much truth, that the books in the average country cabin during the nineteenth century consisted of a prayer book, a chap-book [''a small paperback booklet, typically containing poems or fiction''] and an Old Moore's Almanack. This last provided much material of a puzzling nature to while away long winter evenings, and encouraged those of an ingenious turn to try their skill in solving the problems proposed. As prizes were given for solutions to the puzzles, and for new puzzles for next year, the connection between issues was maintained. Let it not be thought that the poems have been mere drivel—far from it; many show distinct merit, and sometimes herald the rise of a new poet. John Keegan Casey ("Leo" of the Nation) appeared in the pages of Old Moore as a youthful and aspiring poet. So did Charles Kickham, under the nom-de-plume of "Cavellus." The late P. J. McCall made many contributions to Old Moore's Almanack in his early days. The pages of Old Moore were always open to the budding rhymester, and the better his work the more likely he was to have it published.”'' 

The huge success of the ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' meant that more copycat versions sprang to life, all wanting a piece of the pie. In 1851 the enterprising John Francis Nugent, of 35 Cook Street, Dublin, started his own almanac, in opposition to ''Old Moore's Almanac''. It was called ''Nugent’s Old Moore’s Almanac.'' The original ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' was, at this point, fed up to the gills of other publishers stealing their thunder, and also their name. 

Nugent acted as manager and editor of this rip-off version of the ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' until his death in 1866, and after that it was taken over by his assistant. But then something strange happened. In 1886, McCall, long-time editor of the genuine ''Old Moore’s Almanac'', became editor of ''Nugent's Moore's Almanac'' simultaneously. He carried on like this for 12 years. It would seem to be a conflict of interest: Nugent's Almanac was very similar to ''Old Moore’s Almanac''; there were the usual prophecies and weather forecasts. In the end, Nugent's almanac was taken over by Nugent’s widow but in 1898 she re-married and allowed it to lapse. 

There were other copycats. An edition in 1900 of ''Old Moore'' by W. A. Quirke of 25, Wicklow Street, was the subject of a legal action by the proprietor of the genuine ''Old Moore's Almanac'' at the time, P.C.D. Warren. Not only was this new copycat edition stealing its thunder, it wasn’t even producing original copy; it was stealing the exact copy from ''Old Moore’s Almanac'', and printing it under its own name. 

Warren obtained an injunction against Quirke restraining him from publishing any almanac containing a list of fairs taken from the plaintiff's publication. This stopped the sale of Quirke's almanac and he was debarred from selling any copies of the issue in question. 

The ''Genuine Old Moore’s Almanac'' then tried to copyright the name “Moore’s Almanack.” The court refused to grant exclusive use of the words "Old Moore" or “Moore’s Almanack” to the plaintiff. This was due to the fact that many copycat almanacs were already published in England called “Old Moore's” and it would be too difficult to police. The ship had sailed. It is assumed that ''Old Moore's Almanack'' became ''Old Moore's Almanac'', to distinguish it from all of the other non-genuine competitors. The almanac without the “k” was forevermore the genuine one. 

The perceived accuracy of the predictions gave ''Old Moore's Almanac'' its staying power. Theophilus Moore himself was said to have had a great skill in prophecy, and subsequent editors made sure that whoever did the predictions was good at it.

The editor and the prophet have not always been the same person, as is the case in the 2018 edition. Michael Fanning, a native of Brackenstown, Co. Dublin, was a regular contributor to almanacs, and did some of the predictions for ''Old Moore's Almanac''; Bernard O'Neill, of Blackwatertown on the Moy near Armagh, was the prophet for some time previous to 1914-15. 

There are famous examples of predictions coming true in the past which made readers talk endlessly. In 1903 it was foretold that "a crown would fall from a kingly head" – the chance was, no doubt, rather a wide one, but when, in June, 1903, the King and Queen of Sebia were assassinated, who could doubt the vision of the prophet? In that year also, Old Moore declared that "the Eternal City would have cause to go into mourning," and the death of Pope Leo XIII in July, 1903 was the apparent fulfilment of that prophecy. 

The ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' once foretold that the Derby would be run in a snowstorm; as this race takes place in June, the likelihood seemed remote, but it happened, and the ''Almanac'' received much kudos. After Old Moore's successful prediction of the victory of a horse called Blenheim in the Derby, many half-crowns were sent direct to the editor to be staked on the winner of the next big race. But he had to decline the responsibility and return the money. 

Old Moore was so popular at one time that the travelling pedlar or the man walking the roads had often cause to bless the ''Almanac''. It was seen as having the powers of "open sesame" to many a country cabin and often ensured a meal or a night's lodging for the wayfarer. One pedlar has said that he always set out with a bundle of the recently issued ''Almanacs'' under his arm, knowing that for many a day he could obtain his bed and board from those he visited, thanks to the welcome given to ''Old Moore'' in the countryside. 

In 2018, the editor and the prophet are once again two different people. 

'''Historical Copies'''

Historical copies of the ''Almanac'' are in the National Library of Ireland in Dublin. The books cannot be borrowed, but they can be perused in the reading rooms. 

-The title started its life as ''The Irish Merlin'' in 1764 

-The title was changed to ''Moore's Almanack'' around 1782 

-By 1853 it was called ''Old Moore’s Almanack'' 

-After around 1900 it was called ''Old Moore’s Almanac''

Occasionally, old copies of the Almanac are offered for sale on eBay or other auction sites. Recently, an ''Irish Merlin'' from 1765 was sold on eBay. You can also find copies in the Marsh Library in Dublin, and in Trinity's Old Library, which also holds the Book of Kells. 

Historian B. P. Bowen B.L., B.Sc. He wrote an article about the ''Old Moore’s Almanac'' in 1940 for the ''Dublin Historical Record'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (Sep., - Nov., 1940), pp. 26-37. The ''Dublin Historical Record'' is a history journal established in 1938, published biannually by the Old Dublin Society, which still exists today. (olddublinsociety.ie) 

==Predictions==
The almanac includes [[prediction]]s for Ireland and the world. The weather predictions always receive a lot of attention in Ireland, where the weather is a highly prized conversation subject. For example, the 2018 predictions include:

-This is the year of the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies will change the world in a short span of time. Trade sanctions will be ignored as people move around them with e-money. Governments will scramble to try to regulate and tax it. Entrepreneurial spirit will use the cryptocurrencies to create and build whole new disruptive businesses. Western free-economy countries will thrive using it. 

-This year, there will be a lot of well-known people who will die suddenly/unexpectedly. 2018 will be the year of the shock-death of famous people. 

-In Ireland, there will be more discussions about getting religion out of school. Irish Millennials to move abroad in increasing numbers.

[[Image:Pleissner Gallery, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Pleissner Gallery&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Pleissner Gallery''' is an exhibit building located at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==History==
In 1986 the Museum erected Pleissner Gallery to house the estate of Ogden Minton [[Pleissner]] (1905-1983), which he bequeathed to the Museum. Pleissner was a close friend of the Webb family who earned national recognition during his lifetime for his realist watercolor and oil landscapes and sporting scenes. The main gallery functions as a rotating exhibition space dedicated to displaying works from Pleissner’s diverse portfolio while the adjoining room houses a recreation of Pleissner’s [[Manchester, Vermont]] studio complete with canvases, brushes, and personal memorabilia.

The Gallery features 40 of the Museum's 600 Pleissner works in a rotating exhibition. The gallery shows watercolors and oil paintings from all periods of Pleissner's career, including early renderings, Western landscapes, works from war-torn France and England, and sporting scenes.

==Information on Ogden Pleissner==
Pleissner received his formal training at the [[Art Students League]] in [[New York City]]. During the 1930s he spent summers in Wyoming, building a reputation as an accomplished painter of Western landscapes. Pleissner served as a war artist for the U.S. Air Force and Life Magazine during World War II, completing many watercolors in war torn France and England. In later years he painted in Europe, Nova Scotia, New York City (where he maintained a winter studio), and Vermont. Pleissner was the recipient of many honors and awards, including a gold medal from the American Watercolor Society. (''see [[Ogden Pleissner]] for more'')

The '''RTÉ Archives and Libraries''' are a collection of [[photographs]], sounds recordings, video footage and written records (of articles such as scripts) in various formats across a wide range of topics pertaining to Irish life and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/arc/arc_holdings.html|title=RTÉ Libraries and Archives|publisher=Libraries and Archives|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is derived from the material used by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] in their activities as [[public broadcaster|national broadcaster]] for Ireland.

As RTÉ is part funded by a [[licence fee]] from Irish householders with televisions, it has a significant responsibility to maintain and update this collection and make it available to the general public.

==Logo==

The RTÉ Archives logo incorporates RTÉ current corporate logo with a take on the 1967 corporate logo for the word archive. There are two versions of the logo, generally the first letter of the word Archive is used (as see in description box) but also where the full word is used.

The '''''Royal Frankish Annals''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Annales regni Francorum''; also ''Annales Laurissenses maiores'' and [[German language|German]]: ''Reichsannalen'') are [[Latin]] [[annals]] composed in [[Carolingian Dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Francia]], recording year-by-year the state of the monarchy from 741 (the death of [[Mayor of the Palace]] [[Charles Martel]]) to 829 (the beginning of the crisis of [[Louis the Pious]]). Their authorship is unknown, though [[Wilhelm von Giesebrecht]] suggested that [[Arno of Salzburg]] was the author of an early section of the ''Annaes Laurissenses majores'' surviving in the copy at [[Lorsch Abbey]]. The Annals are believed to have been composed in successive sections by different authors, and then compiled.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The depth of knowledge regarding court affairs suggests that the annals were written by persons close to the king, and their initial reluctance to comment on Frankish defeats betrays an official design for use as Carolingian propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Though the information contained within is heavily influenced by authorial intent in favor of the Franks, the annals remain a crucial source on the political and military history of the reign of [[Charlemagne]].

Copies of the annals can be categorized into five classes, based on additions and revisions to the text.&lt;ref&gt;Kurze “Praefatio” ''Annales Regni Francorum'' p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicles were continued and incorporated in the [[West Frankish]] ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' and in the [[East Frankish]] ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' and ''[[Annales Xantenses]].''

==Content==
[[File:Pepin le Bref.jpg|thumb|The coronation in 752 of [[Pepin the Short|Pépin the Short]] by [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]], Archbishop of Mainz.]]
The annals give a brief individual description of events for each year (a few omitted), with a focus on the actions of the Carolingian monarchy, beginning with the account of [[Pepin the Short|Pepin the Short’s]] ascension through the dethronement of the [[Merovingian]] king [[Childeric III]]. The annalists pay particular attention to the military campaigns of the Carolingian kings, justifying their actions in terms of a grand narrative of Carolingian peacekeeping and conquest in the name of expanding the [[Christian]] faith. The overthrow of the Merovingians is also portrayed in such a way as to legitimize the transfer of royal power between dynasties, emphasizing Carolingian adherence to Frankish traditions and the approval of [[Pope Zacharias]] in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick “The Illusion of Royal Power” ''English Historical Review'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three kings—Pepin, [[Charlemagne]], and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]]—Charlemagne’s military chronicles are the most detailed, covering his victories against the [[Saxons]], [[Bretons]], and other peoples. The account of Charlemagne’s campaign against the Saxons is also notable as one of the few extant references to the [[Irminsul]], an important if enigmatic part of the [[Germanic paganism]] practiced by the Saxons at the time. Its destruction is a major point in the annals, written to continue a jingoistic theme of Frankish triumphs against the “un-Frankish” and unchristian barbarian. The unrevised text neglects to mention defeats suffered by Charlemagne, such as the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] in 778 (later dramatized in the ''[[Song of Roland]]'') and the [[Battle of Süntel]] in 782.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Battle of Süntel is portrayed in the annals as a victory, as opposed to a crushing Frankish defeat at the hands of the Saxons. The 792 conspiracy of [[Pepin the Hunchback]] against Charlemagne is also omitted, along with any reference to potential misconduct on Charlemagne’s part. The revised text, however, incorporates these events while maintaining a positive tone towards the emperor, presented as a peerless leader in battle.

[[File:Louis the Pious.jpg|thumb|Louis the Pious giving penance at [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] in 822.]]
Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, is rarely shown engaging in battle by the annalists, but rather directs others to do so, or negotiates for peace. The contrast between Louis and his father and grandfather is clear. While the past kings were unshakeable figures, depicted as the better of their foes even in defeat by the revised edition, the annalists’ Louis is a smaller man who invests the power of the military in others, not unlike the annals’ earlier depiction of the Merovingian kings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Miracles aid Charlemagne and his men, and the grace of God leads him to victory; mostly ill portents surround Louis, such as an omen in the stars supposedly foretelling his army’s defeat at the hands of [[Aisso|Count Aizo]], and the sudden collapse of a wooden arcade atop him in 817.

Such references to striking natural phenomena, strange happenings, and miracles become increasingly common in the annal entries for the 9th century. In addition to astronomical oddities, such as [[eclipses]], the supernatural begins to enter the account, set against almost ritualistic yearly notices of the regular passages of [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. Nearly two-dozen villages are reported to have been destroyed by heavenly fire in 823, while at the same time an unnamed girl is said to have begun a three-year [[fasting|fast]].

Scholz regards this preoccupation as a reflection of a belief in a divine will and control of history.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the worse omens also parallel growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately after the end of the annals spilled into [[civil war]] between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of [[Hilduin of St. Denis|Hilduin’s]] translation of the relics of [[St. Sebastian]] to the [[Abbey of St. Medard, Soissons|Abbey of St. Medard]], and [[Einhard|Einhard’s]] transport of the relics of [[Saints Marcellinus and Peter|SS. Marcellinus and Peter]] into Francia.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed account of Einhard’s procurement of the relics exists in his ''Translation and Miracles of Marcellinus and Peter''.
Additionally, the annals provide the only attestation to the existence of Charlemagne’s personal elephant [[Abul-Abbas]], aside from a mention by Einhard drawn from the annals. The gift of the elephant to Charlemagne, amongst other treasures, by [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] is evidence of the attempts to form an [[Abbasid-Carolingian alliance]] at the time, which the annals document loosely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The annals survive in multiple versions, widely distributed across the Frankish empire, though none of these are original copies.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick “The Illusion of Royal Power” ''English Historical Review'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Each version is marked with distinguishing features, and based on these features, Friedrich Kurze formulated five classes for the categorization of these texts.&lt;ref&gt;Kurze “Praefatio” ''Annales Regni Francorum'' p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; This system still remains in use. The five classes of texts are lettered A through D, with an additional E class for the revised text. They are as follow:

===Class A===
Class A texts end at the year 788, and are reflected in one of the earliest modern printings of the annals, that of [[Henricus Canisius|Heinrich Canisius’s]] ''Francicorum Annalium fragmentum''. Canisius also includes the years up to 793 in his printing, however, and [[Rosamond McKitterick]] speculates that the manuscript originally ran to that date.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''Charlemagne'' p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are now lost.

===Class B===
Class B texts go to, at the latest, 813. Kurze notes that one of these was used by [[Regino of Prüm]] in his ''Chronicon''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurze “Praefatio” ''Annales Regni Francorum'' p. ix
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class C===
Class C texts are complete through 829. These contain various additions not found in the previous two classes, and Kurze divides them based on what other texts are found in their codices, such as the ''[[Liber historiae Francorum]]''.

===Class D===
Class D texts are derived from a complete copy, though McKitterick points out that the derivatives are often not complete themselves.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''Charlemagne'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; These also contain insertions not found in the other classes, including mention of Pepin the Hunchback. The revised texts are based on a Class D manuscript.

===Class E===
Class E comprises the revised editions of the annals, and are by far the most numerous. These are often found paired with Einhard’s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', and it is partially from this that they are sometimes believed to have been written by him as well, and thus called the ''Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi'' (English: ''Annals which are said to be of Einhard'').&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The revised editions correct the Latin of the originals and elaborate on many of the earlier entries, which were written by a terse hand in their unedited states. The major edits go up to 801, with minor stylistic changes through 812.

==Authorship==
[[File:Zerstörung der Irminsaule durch Karl den Großen by Heinrich Leutemann.jpg|thumb|"The destruction of Irminsul by Charlemagne" (1882) by [[Heinrich Leutemann]].]]

Though the number of sections into which the annals should be divided is debated, they undoubtably were written in at least four stages, corresponding roughly to the entries for 741-795, 796-807, 808-819, and 820-829.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''Charlemagne'' p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an unknown editor produced the revised text at some point during the third stage. The identities of any of the authors save that of the fourth section are unknown, but production by a group of [[clerics]] associated with the Carolingian court is likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Section (741-795)===
Between the years 741 and 768, the annals overlap with the continuations of the ''[[Chronicle of Fredegar]]''. On account of this, scholars such as Scholz have suggested that the annals are based on the continuation of ''Fredegar'' up to 768, and then on minor annals up to some point between 787 and 793.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; McKitterick, however, contends that the continuation of ''Fredegar'' and the minor annals are more likely based upon the ''Annales regni Francorum'', which is the most ordered and precise of them.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''History and Memory'' p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Neither argument considers these entries to be contemporaneous with the events described. The manner of reporting for these years is typically terse, though they include the convention of mentioning Easter and Christmas, which continues throughout the annals.

The author of this section is unknown. Scholz posits the work of multiple authors in the royal chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The year 795 is not definitive as the date of authorial change, but it is the latest of those suggested.

===The Second Section (796-807)===
Unlike the first section, these entries were written contemporaneously and with greater depth. Considering this and the fact that the subject matter remains fixed on the actions of Charlemagne, composition by members of the royal chapel again seems likely, as few other groups would have had access to the same information. However, the identities of these authors remains unknown.

===The Third Section (808-819)===
This section, as well as the fourth, are also both contemporaneous accounts. Scholz notes an increased eloquence in the language employed from here on.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the editor of the revised edition also began his work on the earlier entries, bringing the Latin up to a similar level as the new entries and adding lengthy passages where detail was lacking, again in the style of the later years. For this reason, the editor is believed to have belonged to or been affiliated with this third group of authors.

===The Fourth Section (809-829)===
This section ends abruptly after the events of 829, and for this reason has been associated with Hilduin of St. Denis.&lt;ref&gt;Monod “Hilduin” ''Melanges'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The case for his authorship is founded on Hilduin’s involvement in the first civil war between Louis and his sons in 830.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''Charlemagne'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, he left the emperor’s service to join the sons’ uprising and was subsequently banished, which would account for the termination of the annals. His increasing distaste for Louis would also correspond with the veiled negativity towards the emperor which surfaces in the later entries of the annal, in the form of faint praise and the recording of omens and disasters. Additionally, the entry for 826 mentions Hilduin’s translation of relics, and is followed in 827 by Einhard’s translation. The inclusion of these somewhat obscure events, both of which Hilduin was involved with, would be explained by his authorship of the section.

===The Revised Text===
[[File:Einhard.jpg|thumb|An illustration of Einhard, to whom the revised text is often ascribed.]]
The revised text is believed to have been edited after Charlemagne’s death in 814 but prior to Einhard’s ''Vita Karoli Magni'', which references the revisions, written in 833 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick ''History and Memory'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the years 741 through 812, variously adding detail and modifying style.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold von Ranke]] put forth Einhard as the editor, an association which has carried with the revised annals in references to the ''Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi''.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, while no other names have been suggested for the editor, the case for Einhard cannot be argued definitively either.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz “Introduction” ''Carolingian Chronicles'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Three major annals take up the work of the Annales regni Francorum after 829: the ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'', the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'', and the ''[[Annales Xantenses]]''. The ''Annales Bertiniani'' concern the [[West Frankish Kingdom]] from 830 to 882, serving as a direct unofficial continuation. The ''Annales Fuldenses'' use the ''Annales regni Francorum'' as a basis up to the year 829, and then continue on their own until 901, documenting the [[East Frankish Kingdom]]. The ''Annales Xantenses'' run from 832 to 873 and are largely independent from the other two continuations.

[[File:Star of India Gem.JPG|thumb|Star of India]]
The '''Star of India''' is a 563.35-[[Carat (unit)|carat]] (112.67 g) star [[sapphire]], one of the largest such gems in the world.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;{{efn|[[The Star of Adam]] is believed to be the largest star sapphire at 1,404.49 carats.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;}} It is almost flawless and is unusual in that it has stars on both sides of the stone.  The greyish blue gem was mined in [[Sri Lanka]]&lt;ref name=Preston /&gt; and is housed in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]].

The milky quality of the stone is caused by the traces of the mineral [[rutile]], which is also responsible for the star effect, known as [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]]. The tiny fibers of the mineral, aligned in a three-fold pattern within the gem, reflect incoming light into the star pattern.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;

== History ==
Mineralogist and [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] gem expert [[George Frederick Kunz|George Kunz]] (1856–1932) was commissioned by wealthy financier [[J.P. Morgan]] (1837–1913) to acquire an impressive gem collection for an exhibit at the [[Paris Exposition of 1900]]; the Star of India was among the stones Kunz procured.&lt;ref name=Wallace2000 /&gt;  After the Exposition, Morgan donated the Star of India along with the rest of the collection to the American Museum of Natural History.  Apart from its Sri Lankan origin, the gem's history prior to its acquisition for this collection is unknown.&lt;ref name=Preston /&gt;  Kunz wrote in 1913 that the Star of India "has a more or less indefinite historic record of some three centuries".&lt;ref name=Kunz1913 /&gt;

On October 29, 1964, the famous golf-ball-sized stone was stolen, along with several other gems of note, including the Midnight Star, the [[DeLong Star Ruby]], and the [[Eagle Diamond]].&lt;ref name=Preston /&gt;  The thieves unlocked a bathroom window during museum open hours, climbed in that night, and found that the sapphire was the only gem in the collection protected by an alarm—and the battery for that was dead.&lt;ref name=Sofianides /&gt;  The stones stolen were valued at more than $400,000.  Within two days the culprits were arrested: [[Jack Roland Murphy|Jack Murphy]] (also known as "Murph the Surf"), Allen Kuhn and Roger Clark; however, the gems had already been handed off.&lt;ref name=Preston /&gt;  In January 1965, in a bid for leniency, Kuhn led authorities to a bus locker in Miami where the uninsured Star of India and some of the other stolen stones were recovered.&lt;ref name=Sosin /&gt;

[[Image:Blacksmith Shop, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;The Blacksmith Shop&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''The Blacksmith Shop''' is an exhibit building and a live-demonstration site at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. The Blacksmith Shop, a one-room brick structure built about 1800, and its later frame addition, originally stood near the railroad tracks in the village of [[Shelburne, Vermont]].&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While little is known of its early occupancy, records show that John Dubuc had established a blacksmith shop there by 1869. Following Dubuc, a succession of craftspeople occupied the building until it was abandoned in 1935. &lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shelburne Museum]] acquired the Blacksmith Shop in 1955 and moved it to its present location on the Museum grounds. In preparation for the move the building was fitted with a footing of reinforced concrete, braced internally, and jacked up before being rolled onto the bed of a twenty-four-ton trailer, which transported it twenty-four hundred feet down Route 7. The Blacksmith Shop opened in 1956 as the Museum’s first working exhibit having been re-outfitted with blacksmith and wheelwright tools acquired from a variety of local sources. &lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

==Background Information==
Communities of the 18th and 19th centuries depended heavily on village blacksmiths as their primary source for tools, utensils, agricultural implements, architectural hardware, vehicle parts, and many other items. Many blacksmiths also served as farriers, not only manufacturing shoes for horses and oxen, but outfitting the animals as well. &lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;

In larger communities blacksmiths often worked in conjunction with wheelwrights to manufacture and repair vehicle wheels. Although combination blacksmith-wheelwright shops persisted into the 20th century, their focus gradually changed from the manufacture of one-of-a-kind items to the repair of factory-produced goods. Eventually the availability of mass-produced parts as well as the advent of the automobile age rendered both blacksmiths and wheelwrights obsolete. &lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Shelburne Museum’s Blacksmith Shop represents the trade as it was practiced at the turn of the 20th century. &lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt; Both the efficient, electric blower, which replaced the wood and leather bellows still resting by the forge, and the electric trip-hammer enabled smiths, who at that time often found themselves working alone as the apprentice system broke down, to handle larger work without assistance. &lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

'''The British Theatre Guide''' is a UK-centred website of [[theatre]] reviews, news reports, interviews and obituaries. It also reviews [[opera]] and [[dance]], as well as books, audio recordings and [[DVD]]s.

It has an online archive with articles from 1997.&lt;ref name=intute&gt;[http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact6970 British theatre guide], Intute. Retrieved 2014-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The British Theatre Guide site was a re-establishment of an earlier website about British theatre.&lt;ref name=intute/&gt; It was launched on 18 November 2001 by former drama teacher, [[Peter Lathan]], who also writes plays and runs a small-scale professional theatre company and has been active in the field of on-line theatre databases since 1996. The editorship was taken over at the beginning of 2012 by [[David Chadderton]], who previously had been in charge of the BTG's coverage since 2003 and is also a member of the [[Manchester Theatre Awards]] panel.

As of 2012, the British Theatre Guide has a UK-based team of 60 established theatre reviewers, plus overseas contributors, including correspondents from [[New York City]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[London]] editor is [[Philip Fisher (theatre critic)|Philip Fisher]] who runs a small team of critics in the Greater London Area, including three members of [[The Critics' Circle]].

By February 2012 The British Theatre Guide archive, with over 7,000 reviews plus news, interviews and other features and information, was receiving more than 140,000 page views each week. In addition its free weekly newsletter is emailed to around 3,000 subscribers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/britishtheatre_newsletter/ Yahoo Groups British Theatre Guide newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intute]], a university-based service which finds, evaluates and catalogues internet resources for education and research, said:

"The site includes articles on all aspects of British theatre, indexed both by date and by subject. Subjects include, theatre history, Shakespeare, and actors and acting. There are also British theatre reviews from the UK and New York, book reviews, a news section, and a discussion forum. Other resources on this extensive site include a British Theatre Directors' Index, a British Actors' Index, a Directory of Theatres in Britain arranged town by town, a glossary of theatre terms, an amateur theatre index, playwrights' FAQs, and the text of some interviews of relevance to British theatre."&lt;ref name=intute /&gt;

'''The Fabulous Freebirds''' were a [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] that attained fame in the 1980s, performing into the 1990s.  The team usually consisted of three wrestlers, although in different situations and points in its history, just two performed under the Freebirds name.

==History==
The Fabulous Freebirds started performing together in 1979 when [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South Wrestling]] promoter [[Bill Watts]] put together the duo of [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael "P.S." Hayes]] and [[Terry Gordy|Terry "Bam Bam" Gordy]]. Though originally meant to be a tag team, he soon added [[Buddy Roberts|Buddy "Jack" Roberts]] into the mix, and they became a "three man gang" type of tag-team—an unusual concept at the time. They invented a concept that is now called The Freebird Rule in their honor, in which any two of three members can defend the team's championships. They usually worked as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s but also had several [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] runs as well.
After wrestling for Watts in Mid South, they worked for [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) where they feuded with [[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Bill Dundee]] .
The group next wrestled in the Dallas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) territory, where they had a legendary feud with the [[Von Erich family|Von Erichs]] ([[David Von Erich|David]], [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]], [[Kerry Von Erich|Kerry]], [[Chris Von Erich|Chris]] and [[Mike Von Erich|Mike]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Daniel|author2=Susan Cohen |title=Wrestling Superstars II|isbn=0-671-63224-8|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feud was ignited by an infamous incident in which Terry Gordy slammed Kerry Von Erich's head in a steel cage door inciting a riot and igniting the legendary wrestling feud. During this feud, they started using the [[Confederate battle flag]] as a group symbol as the Von Erichs would wave the [[flag of Texas]] so they chose to use the [[flag of the State of Georgia|flag of Georgia]], which at the time contained the Confederate battle flag, to counter it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wrestlingnewssource.com/news/41873/Michael-Hayes-Explains-Why-The-Fabulous-Freebirds-Used/|title=Michael Hayes Explains Why The Fabulous Freebirds Used  The Confederate Flags|date=2016-03-09|work=WrestlingNewsSource|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also performed in the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]-affiliated [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), and the Oklahoma-based [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF). While in the AWA they feuded primarily with [[The Road Warriors]], costing them the World Tag Team Titles in a match against long time Freebird ally [[Jimmy Garvin]] and his partner [[Steve Regal]].

They had a very brief run in the [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1984, where they were a part of the [[1980s wrestling boom#Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] period. In the WWF, they wrestled under the guidance of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s manager David Wolff,&lt;ref name=ws2pg89&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Daniel|author2=Susan Cohen |title=Wrestling Superstars II|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon left the promotion after an altercation with [[André the Giant]], who was upset when the Freebirds arrived late to a show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1930105-remembering-andre-the-giants-larger-than-life-career-and-complexities#articles/1930105-remembering-andre-the-giants-larger-than-life-career-and-complexities Andre the Giant – Bleacher Report.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group then moved on to their AWA run, returned to World Class, and then started a stint in the UWF where Gordy became the promotion's champion, Roberts held its TV title, and Hayes usually acted as their manager or served as a heel commentator on television broadcasts. After JCP purchased UWF in 1987, Hayes wrestled in World Class and several independent promotions, sometimes with Gordy, who began spending most of his time in [[Japan]], and Roberts began to wind down his career.

Hayes and Garvin were paired as the Freebirds in WCW in 1989, enjoying several reigns as World and United States tag-team champions, and were joined by Gordy for a while as well. They later employed the services of masked third partner [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]] (under the name Badstreet) and manager [[William Boulware, Jr.|Little Richard Marley]]. The Freebirds were last together when Hayes, Gordy, and Garvin worked for the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF) in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;New Wave Wrestling, February 1995 issue, number 15, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; ending the group after 15 years.

Gordy died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], caused by a [[thrombus|blood clot]] on July 16, 2001, at age 40 while Roberts died on November 29, 2012, at the age of 67, of [[pneumonia]] and on November 1, 2012, Armstrong died of a suspected [[heart attack]] making Hayes and Garvin the only living members of the Freebirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/264841/Kevin-Von-Erich-Comments-on-Buddy-Roberts/-Passing.htm Kevin von Erich comments on Buddy Roberts' passing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10028579.shtml Jim Ross comments on Roberts' death]&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes (who retired from in-ring competition shortly after the Freebirds disbanded) is currently the head of the road agents/producers within WWE, while Garvin retired from wrestling shortly after disbanding and has become an [[Airline Transport Pilot License|Airline Transport Pilot]].

On April 2, 2016, The Fabulous Freebirds (excluding Brad Armstrong) were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]].

==Entrance music==
The Freebirds concept was heavily derived from the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song "[[Free Bird]]" and the image of "[[Southern United States|Southern]] pride" evoked by the band. For most of the team's early existence, the song was used as their entrance music, in both television and live appearances. On occasion, they would also enter the ring to [[Willie Nelson]]'s rendition of "[[Georgia on My Mind]]". The Freebirds are sometimes credited as the first wrestlers to use entrance music for their ring introductions, although [[Gorgeous George]]'s use of "[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance]]" predates the Freebirds.

During the mid 1980s, a number of [[North America|North American]] wrestling promotions who licensed copyrighted music faced difficulties in continuing those licenses.  Other promotions which did not license music were under scrutiny for the practice. Promotions began looking for solutions.  The WWF, which hired [[Jimmy Hart]] and [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] in 1985, used their talents to write and produce music under which the copyrights could be controlled by the company. Around this same time, Hayes recorded the song "Badstreet USA" and released a music video, which included the other Freebird members. This song would largely be used as the entrance music for the Freebirds from that point forward, though they would use the other songs on occasion.

==Freebird Rule==
During the Freebirds' career in the NWA, they won several of its regional tag team championships. While holding the title, promoters added a sub-gimmick to the team – "The Freebird Rule" – which allowed any two of the three members of the team to defend the title on any given night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Greg|title="Crush" Brian Adams dead at 44|work=SLAM! Sports|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/08/13/4414835.html|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule has been re-used by a number of other companies when a three (or more) man team captures a tag team championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/superstars/fabulous-freebirds Fabulous Freebirds – WWE.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include:

In some cases, the Freebird rule has been applied to singles titles, most notably when [[Chyna]] and [[Chris Jericho]] co-held the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] in 2000.&lt;ref name= "Freebird Rule" /&gt; Other such cases included when [[3 Count]] won the [[WCW Hardcore Championship]] in 2000,&lt;ref name= "Freebird Rule" /&gt; and when [[Matt Bentley]] and [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Frankie Kazarian]] co-held the [[TNA X Division Championship]] in 2004. In 2010, after [[Layla El|Layla]] won the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship]], [[LayCool|Team LayCool]] (Layla and [[Michelle McCool]]) co-held the title. This was a slight variation to the Freebird rule, as while both women defended the title, only Layla was recognized as the official champion. Later that year, the same rule was instituted when Michelle McCool won the [[WWE Divas Championship]]; both members of Team LayCool defended the title, but only McCool was recognized as official champion.&lt;ref name= "Freebird Rule" /&gt; A similar situation happened in [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) in 2017, where [[Bullet Club]] invoked "Bullet Club Rules", which allowed [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]], [[Kenny Omega]] and [[Marty Scurll]] to defend the [[ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pwinsider.com/article/112883/bullet-club-vs-the-kingdom-1012-roh-global-wars-in-buffalo-ny-report.html?p=1 | title = Bullet Club vs. The Kingdom: 10/12 ROH Global Wars in Buffalo, NY report | last=Barnett | first=Josh | date=October 12, 2017 | accessdate=October 13, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the title's original winners, [[Hangman Page|Adam Page]], [[The Young Bucks|Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson]], were recognized as official champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/main-event-signed-roh-elite-ft-lauderdale|title=Main Event Signed for ROH Elite in Ft.

==Offshoots==

===Blackbirds===
The '''Blackbirds''' were formed in 1988 in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] by [[Iceman Parsons]]. He had just teamed with [[Terry Gordy]] and [[Buddy Roberts]] as the "Blackbirds" in their feud with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]. He teamed up with Perry "Action" Jackson and Harold T. Harris to form the Blackbirds. They also wrestled as the Blackbirds in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] in 1992.

===Extreme Freebirds===
The '''Extreme Freebirds''' were formed in [[NWA Wildside]] and the NAWA by the son of Terry Gordy, [[Ray Gordy]]. He teamed up with Tank and Iceberg in 2004 to form this group.

==Other appearances==
The original three Freebirds briefly appear in a match against [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]], [[Sam Fatu|The Tonga Kid]], and [[Jim Brunzell]] during the opening sequence of the [[1986 in film|1986]] fantasy film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Difino|first=Lennie|title=Catching up with Buddy Roberts|work=WWE.com|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/roberts|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs at a show in [[Madison Square Garden]] (although the scene was actually filmed at the [[Brendan Byrne Arena]] across the river).

==Members and incarnations==
*'''Main Members'''
**[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] was the leader of the group. Nicknamed "P.S." (Purely Sexy), he was known to get the crowd going with his antics.
**[[Terry Gordy]] was the powerhouse of the group. Nicknamed "Bam Bam", he loved to fight and beat his opponents down.
**[[Buddy Roberts]], nicknamed "Jack" for his love of [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey, was the speed of the group, who would often frustrate other wrestlers into chasing him, until Hayes and/or Gordy surprised them with a move. Buddy was also acknowledged as the best ring technician of the group.
**[[Jimmy Garvin]]'s association with the Freebirds began in 1983, as he had often teamed with Hayes, Gordy, and Roberts in WCCW and AWA. In 1988, he teamed with '''Steven Dane''' while Hayes was injured as a watered-down version of the Freebirds, and with Hayes during a reignited WCW run between June 1989 and July 1992. He was always considered ''the fourth Freebird'' by Hayes, Gordy and Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;Inside Wrestling, March 1988 issue, article: "Terry Gordy &amp; Buddy Roberts declare: Michael Hayes and Jim Garvin ''are not'' The Freebirds!", p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Wrestler, October 1989 issue, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; although no one really believed it until 1989, when Hayes and Garvin (nicknamed "Jam") teamed up for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] tournament.
*'''Associated members'''
**'''During the Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy feud against Michael Hayes:'''
***[[King Parsons|Iceman Parsons]] &amp;ndash; in late 1987, he joined Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts after Michael Hayes left the Fabulous Freebirds to help them get revenge on him. Parsons was known as the "Blackbird" during this feud.
***[[Angel of Death (wrestler)|The Angel of Death]] teamed with Terry Gordy, Buddy Roberts and Iceman "King" Parsons in the late-1987–1988 version of the Freebirds. He had previously feuded with Gordy, Roberts and Michael Hayes in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|UWF]] prior to joining the group.
**'''During the Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin tag team era:'''
***[[Steve Cox (wrestler)|Steve Cox]] teamed with Hayes as The Freebirds in WCCW, CWA, and AWA. When Hayes was injured, he would team with Garvin.
***[[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Badstreet]] &amp;ndash; Brad Armstrong under a mask in WCW, and the group's light-heavyweight/cruiserweight. Originally appeared as "Fantasia", but WCW changed the name to Badstreet to avoid a legal confrontation with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]].
***[[Oliver Humperdink|Big Daddy Dink]] &amp;ndash; the Freebird alias of manager Sir Oliver Humperdink; in keeping with the Freebirds' "frustrated rock &amp; roll band" gimmick, he was referred to as their "tour manager"/"road boss" in WCW (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/05/12/4175841.html|title=Sir Oliver Humperdink recalls career of yesteryear|author=Matt Mackinder|publisher=SLAM!

***[[William Boulware, Jr.|Little Richard Marley]] &amp;ndash; WCW jobber Rocky King, who as "Little Richard Marley" served as a ringside pest to Freebird opponents in late 1990.
**'''Later:'''
***[[Ray Gordy]] formed a one-night Freebirds reunion with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]], in tribute to his father, Terry Gordy.

The cookbook is the largest&lt;ref name=publisher&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandhouse.com/books/The-Ultimate-Beer-Lover-s-Cookbook-More-Than-400-Recipes-That-All-Use-Beer.html |title=Cumberland House Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most comprehensive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tailgatingideas.com/ultimate-beer-lovers-cookbook/ |title=Tailgating Ideas |date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[beer]] [[cookbook]] ever published, and was called the "definitive beer recipe sourcebook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6565395.html |title=Web Exclusive Reviews: Week of 6/2/2008 |date=2008-06-02 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=2008-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713090414/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6565395.html |archivedate=July 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook'' recipes range from scrambled eggs made with [[beer]] at breakfast and a cheese steak sandwich with onion rings or a beer burger and [[Chocolate]] Beershake for lunch, to a surf 'n' turf beer-infused combo of [[lobster]] and [[steak]] for dinner and a midnight snack of chocolate-dipped strawberries.

''The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook'' also has a collection of recipes for [[mixed drinks]], chuggers, shots, chasers, party punches, [[milkshakes]], and flaming drinks — all made with beer. 

With an introduction chronicling beer's history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Memphis Playbook |work=[[The Commercial Appeal]] |date=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cookbook also includes beer quotes by the world's most illustrious beer fans.&lt;ref name=publisher/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Gourmand World Cookbook Awards]] named ''The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook'' The Best Beer Book in the United States and The Best Beer Book in the World.  That same year, ''The Beer Lover's Cookbook'' was released as a smaller paperback adaptation of the original, with just over 300 food and drink recipes.&lt;ref name="officialwebsite"/&gt;

In August 2014, John released a sequel titled ''The Ultimate Beer Lover’s Happy Hour: Over 325 Recipes for Your Favorite Bar Snacks &amp; Beer Cocktails''. It features bar bites – from Sizzling Sriracha Peanuts to Taproom Tacos to Blitzed Bean Soup – and beer cocktails, chuggers, shots, shooters, chasers, punches, floats, and shakes, with nearly 1,000 related pairing suggestions using today’s most popular craft and seasonal beer styles. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

John's other cookbooks include ''The Cheesy Vegan'', ''Grilling Vegan Style'', and ''The Tipsy Vegan''.&lt;ref name="officialwebsite"&gt;[http://johnschlimm.com John Schlimm official website]; accessed November 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oracle VM VirtualBox''' (formerly '''Sun VirtualBox''', '''Sun xVM VirtualBox''' and '''Innotek VirtualBox''') is a free and open-source [[Hypervisor#Classification|hosted]] [[hypervisor]] for [[x86 virtualization|x86]] computers currently being developed by [[Oracle Corporation]]. Developed initially by Innotek [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], it was acquired by [[Sun Microsystems]] in 2008 which was in turn acquired by Oracle in 2010.

VirtualBox may be installed on a number of host operating systems, including: [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[OpenSolaris]]. There are also ports to [[FreeBSD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox |title=VirtualBox – FreeBSD Wiki |publisher=Wiki.freebsd.org |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Genode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/14.02 |title=Release notes for the Genode OS Framework 14.02 |publisher=Genode Labs &lt;!-- http://genode.org/ --&gt; |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It supports the creation and management of guest [[virtual machine]]s running versions and derivations of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BSD]], [[OS/2]], Solaris, [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], [[OSx86]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes |title=Guest_OSes |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limited virtualization of {{nowrap|macOS}} guests on Apple hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-install-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-in-virtualbox-on-windows-7|title=How to Install Mac OS X Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on Windows 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5530521/virtualbox-32-beta-virtualizes-mac-os-x-on-macs|title=VirtualBox 3.2 Beta Virtualizes Mac OS X (On Macs)|date=May 4, 2010|last=Purdy|first=Kevin|publisher=Lifehacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some guest operating systems, a "Guest Additions" package of device drivers and system applications is available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#additions-windows|title=Chapter 4: Guest Additions|publisher=VirtualBox}}

==History==
[[File:VirtualBox logo 64px.png|thumb|64px|Logo of VirtualBox OSE, 2007–2010]]
VirtualBox was initially offered by Innotek GmbH from [[Weinstadt]], [[Germany]], under a [[proprietary software]] license, making one version of the product available at no cost for personal or evaluation use, subject to the VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL |title=VirtualBox_PUEL – VirtualBox |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, based on counsel by [[Open Source Business Alliance|LiSoG]], Innotek GmbH released VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) as [[free and open-source software]], subject to the requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), version 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/GPL |title=GPL |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innotek GmbH also contributed to the development of [[OS/2]] and [[Linux]] support in virtualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.virtualpc/msg/1dbfbc16da8ac9af|title=Additions Version History |newsgroup=microsoft.public.virtualpc|last=Ong|first=Ronny|date=|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OS/2 ports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_July_1/ai_88090458 |title=Connectix Announces First Virtual Computing Solution for OS/2 Users; Virtual PC Lets Enterprises Run OS/2 and Windows Concurrently on a Single PC &amp;#124; Business Wire &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= 2002-07-01|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of products from [[Connectix]] which were later acquired by [[Microsoft]]. Specifically, Innotek developed the "additions" code in both [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] and [[Microsoft Virtual Server]], which enables various host-guest OS interactions like shared [[Clipboard (computing)|clipboards]] or dynamic viewport resizing.

[[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Innotek in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==
The core package is, since version 4 in December 2010, [[free software]] under [[GNU General Public License version 2]] (GPLv2). The separate "VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox extension pack" providing support for [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 2.0 and 3.0 devices, [[Remote Desktop Protocol]] (RDP), disk encryption, [[NVM Express|NVMe]] and [[Preboot Execution Environment]] (PXE) boot is under a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] license, called ''Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL)'', which permits use of the software for personal use, educational use, or evaluation, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL |title=VirtualBox_PUEL |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle defines personal use as the installation of the software on a single host computer for non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="LicensingFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ|title=Licensing: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=VirtualBox|accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to version 4, there were two different packages of the VirtualBox software. The full package was offered free under the PUEL, with licenses for other commercial deployment purchasable from Oracle. A second package called the ''VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE)'' was released under GPLv2. This removed the same proprietary components not available under GPLv2.&lt;ref name="LicensingFAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Editions |title=Editions |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building the [[BIOS]] for VirtualBox {{cns|date=July 2016|since version 4.2}} requires the use of the [[Open Watcom]] compiler,&lt;ref name="debian-stable_copyright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/contrib/v/virtualbox/stable_copyright |title=Copyright file of Virtualbox |date=2016-01-26 |accessdate=2016-07-24 |publisher=Debian }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which the [[Sybase Open Watcom Public License]] is approved as "Open Source" by the [[Open Source Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://opensource.org/licenses/category | title = Open Source Licenses by Category | at = Non-reusable licenses | publisher = [[Open Source Initiative]] | location = [[Palo Alto, California]] | accessdate = 2016-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not as "free" by the [[Free Software Foundation]] or under the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].&lt;ref name="debian-stable_copyright"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Watcom | title = Various Licenses and Comments about Them | at = Nonfree Software Licenses | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]] | location = [[Boston, Massachusetts]] | accessdate = 2016-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although VirtualBox has experimental support for Mac OS X guests, the [[end user license agreement]] of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} does not permit the operating system to run on non-Apple hardware, and this is enforced within the operating system by calls to the Apple [[System Management Controller]] (SMC) in all Apple machines, which verifies the authenticity of the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twit.tv/floss130|title=Interview with Andy Hall, Product Manager for Oracle VM VirtualBox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emulated environment==
[[File:Ubuntu1310 LiveCD with VirtualBox on Ubuntu1310.ogv|thumb|Running [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Live CD]] under VirtualBox on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] ]]
Users of VirtualBox can load multiple guest OSs under a single host operating-system (host OS). Each guest can be started, paused and stopped independently within its own [[virtual machine]] (VM). The user can independently configure each VM and run it under a choice of [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] or [[x86 virtualization#Hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assisted virtualization]] if the underlying host hardware supports this. The host OS and guest OSs and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility. Guest VMs can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_internal |title=Internal Networking |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software-based virtualization===
In the absence of hardware-assisted virtualization, VirtualBox adopts a standard [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] approach. This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel [[ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture.

* The system reconfigures the guest OS code, which would normally run in ring 0, to execute in ring 1 on the host hardware. Because this code contains many privileged instructions which cannot run natively in ring 1, VirtualBox employs a Code Scanning and Analysis Manager (CSAM) to scan the ring 0 code recursively before its first execution to identify problematic instructions and then calls the Patch Manager (PATM) to perform ''in-situ'' patching. This replaces the instruction with a jump to a VM-safe equivalent compiled code fragment in hypervisor memory.
* The guest user-mode code, running in ring 3, generally runs directly on the host hardware in ring 3.

In both cases, VirtualBox uses CSAM and PATM to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs. VirtualBox also contains a [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]], based on [[QEMU]] to recompile any [[real mode]] or [[protected mode]] code entirely (e.g. BIOS code, a DOS guest, or any operating system startup).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#idp13728752 |title=VirtualBox Manual, Section 10.4 Details about software virtualization |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these techniques, VirtualBox can achieve a performance comparable to that of [[VMware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dr. Diedrich |first=Oliver |url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/83678 |title=heise open – 15.01.07 – VirtualBox |publisher=Heise.de |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlow|first=Jason|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|title=Virtualization Smackdown 2: Oracle VM VirtualBox 3.2 vs. VMware Workstation 7.1|publisher=ZDNET|date=2010-05-21|accessdate=2010-05-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524082735/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|archivedate=2010-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware-assisted virtualization===
VirtualBox supports both [[Intel]]'s [[Intel VT-x|VT-x]] and [[AMD]]'s [[AMD-V]] hardware-virtualization. Making use of these facilities, VirtualBox can run each guest VM in its own separate address-space; the guest OS ring 0 code runs on the host at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode rather than in ring&amp;nbsp;1.

VirtualBox supports some guests (including 64-bit guests, SMP guests and certain proprietary OSs) only on hosts with [[hardware-assisted virtualization]].

===Device virtualization===
{{anchor|VirtualBox Disk Image}}
The system emulates hard disks in one of three disk image formats:
# '''VDI''': This format is the VirtualBox-specific ''VirtualBox Disk Image'' and stores data in files bearing a ".vdi" [[filename extension]].
# '''[[VMDK]]''': This [[open format]] is used by [[VMware]] products such as [[VMware Workstation]] and [[VMware Player]]. It stores data in one or more files bearing ".vmdk" filename extensions. A single virtual hard disk may span several files.
# '''[[VHD (file format)|VHD]]''': This format is used by [[Windows Virtual PC]] and [[Hyper-V]], and is the native virtual disk format of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, starting with [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. Data in this format are stored in a single file bearing the ".vhd" filename extension.

A VirtualBox virtual machine can, therefore, use disks previously created in VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC, as well as its own native format. VirtualBox can also connect to [[iSCSI]] targets and to raw partitions on the host, using either as virtual hard disks. VirtualBox emulates [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] (PIIX4 and ICH6 controllers), [[SCSI]], [[SATA]] (ICH8M controller) and [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controllers to which hard drives can be attached.

VirtualBox has supported [[Open Virtualization Format]] (OVF) since version 2.2.0 (April 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | title = VirtualBox changelog | accessdate = 2010-02-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100205014430/http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | archivedate = 2010-02-05 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[ISO image]]s and host-connected physical devices can be mounted as CD/DVD drives. For example, the DVD image of a Linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by VirtualBox.

By default VirtualBox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics-card that is [[VESA]] compatible. The Guest Additions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, or OS/2 guests include a special video-driver that increases video performance and includes additional features, such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the VM window&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#id448025 |title=Chapter 4. Guest Additions |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or desktop composition via virtualized [[Windows Display Driver Model|WDDM]] drivers .

For an [[Ethernet]] network adapter, VirtualBox virtualizes these [[Network card|Network Interface Cards]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#nichardware |title=Chapter 6. Virtual networking |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* AMD PCnet PCI II (Am79C970A)
* AMD PCnet-Fast III (Am79C973)
* Intel Pro/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)
* Intel Pro/1000 MT Server (82545EM)
* Intel Pro/1000 T Server (82543GC)
* Paravirtualized network adapter (virtio-net)

The emulated network cards allow most guest OSs to run without the need to find and install drivers for networking hardware as they are shipped as part of the guest OS. A special paravirtualized network adapter is also available, which improves network performance by eliminating the need to match a specific hardware interface, but requires special driver support in the guest. (Many distributions of [[Linux]] ship with this driver included.) By default, VirtualBox uses [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] through which Internet software for end-users such as [[Firefox]] or [[Secure Shell|ssh]] can operate. [[Bridging (networking)|Bridged networking]] via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured. Up to 36 network adapters can be attached simultaneously, but only four are configurable through the graphical interface.

For a sound card, VirtualBox virtualizes Intel HD Audio, Intel ICH AC'97 and [[SoundBlaster 16]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-audio |title=Chapter 3. Configuring Virtual Machines |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A USB 1.1 controller is emulated so that any USB devices attached to the host can be seen in the guest. The proprietary extension pack adds a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 controllers and, if VirtualBox acts as an RDP server, it can also use USB devices on the remote RDP client as if they were connected to the host, although only if the client supports this VirtualBox-specific extension (Oracle provides clients for Solaris, Linux and [[Sun Ray]] thin clients that can do this, and have promised support for other platforms in future versions).&lt;ref&gt;

===VirtualBox Extension Pack===
Some features require the installation of the [[Proprietary software|closed-source]] "VirtualBox Extension Pack":&lt;ref name="VBdownloads"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads|title=Downloads – Oracle VM VirtualBox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support for a virtual [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 2.0/3.0 controller (EHCI/xHCI)
* VirtualBox [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]]: support for the proprietary remote connection protocol developed by Microsoft and [[Citrix Systems]].
* [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]] boot for Intel cards
* VM disk image encryption

While Guest Additions are installed within each suitable guest virtual machine, the Extension Pack is installed on the host running VirtualBox.

==Host OS support==
Since version 5 (July 2015), VirtualBox has stated that they are dropping support for Windows XP host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#hostossupport|title=Chapter 1. First steps}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus leaving its users with Windows XP hosts vulnerable to flaws of earlier releases. VirtualBox can also be run under GNU/Linux, macOS, Sun Solaris and [[FreeBSD]].

'''William Anthony Nericcio''', aka Memo, is a [[Chicano]] [[literary theorist]], [[cultural critic]], [[American Literature]] scholar, and [[Professor]] of [[English studies|English]] and [[Comparative Literature]] at [[San Diego State University]]. Currently Director of the [http://malas.sdsu.edu Master of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences] program, he is the author of the award-winning ''[https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/nertex Tex&amp;#91;t&amp;#93;-Mex: Seductive Hallucinations of the "Mexican" in America],'' ''The Hurt Business: Oliver Mayer's Early Works Plus'', and ''Homer From Salinas: John Steinbeck's Enduring Voice for the Californias''. Nericcio is also a [[graphic designer]], creating book covers, film posters, and websites, most notably for [[SDSU Press]] and Hyperbole Books, where he oversees the production of cultural studies tomes. His Text-Mex Gallery blog investigates the pathological interrogation of Mexican, Latina/o, Chicana/o, "Hispanic," Mexican-American, and Latin American [[stereotypes]], political, and cultural issues.  He is also the curator of the text-image exhibition entitled “MEXtasy,” which has been displayed at numerous institutions, including University of Michigan and South Texas College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=19283625c72fd210VgnVCM100000c2b1d38dRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9669a97738d4a210VgnVCM10000055b1d38dRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detail&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.southtexascollege.edu/?p=2959&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently working on his follow-up book to ''Tex[t]-Mex, Eyegiene: Permutations of Subjectivity in the Televisual Age of Sex and Race''.

== Life and education ==

William Anthony Nericcio was born in [[Laredo, Texas]], but with ancestry that hails from [[General Téran]] and [[Monterrey, Mexico]], [[Partanna]], [[Sicily]], and [[England]], and considers himself post-Movimiento Chicano. Nericcio received his BA in English from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984, then went on to complete his doctoral degree in Comparative Literature from [[Cornell University]] in 1989, with a dissertation entitled ''The Politics of Solitude: Alienation in the Literatures of the Americas''.&lt;ref&gt;https://sdsu.academia.edu/williamnericcio&lt;/ref&gt; Nericcio's dissertation director was Enrico Mario Santí—other members of his committee included [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] and Kathleen Newman.  While at Cornell, Nericcio served as a graduate research and teaching assistant to [[Carlos Fuentes]] at the A.D. White House Society for the Humanities.

==Academic career==
After completing his doctoral degree in Comparative Literature at Cornell University, Nericcio accepted the position of Assistant Professor at [[University of Connecticut]], before joining the Department of English and Comparative Literature at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU). There, he served two years as the Chair of the Department of English and Comparative Literature from August 2007 through October 2009, where he worked successfully to diversify the professoriate and the curriculum. He is now Director of the Master of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malas.sdsu.edu/index_home.html Department Page for Master of Arts in Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences (MALAS), San Diego State University]&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves on the faculties of the [[Chicana/o Studies]] Department, the Master of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences (MALAS), and the Center for [[Latin American Studies]].

His scholarship focuses on Chicano literature and film, Mexican-American [[cultural studies]], [[continental philosophy]], [[psychoanalysis]], and global [[popular culture]]. Two of his books--''The Hurt Business: Oliver Mayer's Early Works Plus'', and ''Homer From Salinas: John Steinbeck's Enduring Voice for the Californias''—were both published by SDSU Press's [[Hyperbole Books]] imprint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hype.sdsu.edu/mayer/ Hyperbole Books Page for ''The Hurt Business'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdsupress.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-available-from-sdsu-press-homer.html Hyperbole Books Press Release for ''Homer From Salinas]''&lt;/ref&gt;

His most well-known book ''Tex[t]-Mex: Seductive Hallucinations of the "Mexican" in America'' (University of Texas 2006), deals with popular representation of Mexican and Mexican-American identity. It was named ‘Outstanding Academic Title’ 2007 by the [[American Library Association]] in the category of [[Film Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/content/text-mex-seductive-hallucinations-mexican-america-2 ALA Page for Outstanding Academic Title: ''Tex[t]-Mex''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic Design and MEXtasy Art Director/Designer==
In addition to this academic career, Nericcio is also a [[graphic designer]]. His work includes book covers, film posters, and websites, most notably for [[SDSU Press]] and Hyperbole Books, where he oversees the production of cultural studies tomes. His Text-Mex Galleryblog investigates the pathological interrogation of Mexican, Latina/o, Chicana/o, "Hispanic," Mexican-American, and Latin American [[stereotypes]], political, and cultural issues.  In late 2010, Nericcio began a text-image exhibition entitled “MEXtasy,” which has been displayed at numerous institutions.
