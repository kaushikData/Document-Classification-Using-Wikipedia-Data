In 2011, the [[European Commission]]’s [[European_Anti-fraud_Office|Anti-fraud Office]] (OLAF) opened a formal investigation for corruption against four [[Member of the European Parliament|Members]] of [[European Parliament]] (MEPs)—[[Romanians|Romanian]] [[Adrian Severin]], [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Ernst Strasser]], [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[Pablo Zalba Bidegain]] (who was cleared of wrongdoing as he had not accepted payment),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Service Europe: Fighting fraud in Europe - through OLAF|url=http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/556/fighting-fraud-in-europe-through-olaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slovenians|Slovenian]] [[Zoran Thaler]]—after an article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' claimed that they had tried to influence EU legislation in exchange for money.&lt;ref name=spoof&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalistic spoof traps MEPs in bribery affair|url=http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/journalistic-spoof-traps-meps-br-news-503281|newspaper=EurActiv|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times ''journalists went undercover and approached 60 MEPs, posing as [[lobbyists]] and requesting votes to table or support certain amendments in exchange for money.

Claiming innocence, Adrian Severin has refused to step down and continues to work as an MEP, even after he was expelled by the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D) group]] of the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref name=expelled&gt;{{cite news|title=Romanian MEP expelled over bribery scandal|url=http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/romanian-mep-expelled-bribery-sc-news-503406|newspaper=EurActiv|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was indicted by [[Romania]]'s [[National Anticorruption Directorate|anti-corruption agency]] in September 2013 and in February 2016, he was convicted to three and half years in prison  in court, although the judgement was appealed.&lt;ref name=Romania-Insider&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Romanian MEP Adrian Severin sentenced to jail for corruption|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/former-romanian-mep-adrian-severin-sentenced-to-jail-for-corruption/165654/|newspaper=[[Romania-Insider]]|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2016, a final sentence was handed down and his sentence was increased to 4 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/justitie/2016/11/16/alerta-adrian-severin-condamnat-definitiv-la-4-ani-inchisoare-cu-executare-16-35-35|title=Adrian Severin, condamnat definitiv la 4 ani închisoare cu executare|newspaper=Agerpres|date=16 November 2016|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still has the support of the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], his political party in Romania.

==Early life==
Abu Salem was born in 1970 (according to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]]; although the Mumbai police says, 1962; some reports suggests 1968) in a lower-middle-class family in [[Sarai Mir]] village of [[Azamgarh district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He was a third among four brothers Though some reports maintain that he was the eldest of four brothers. His father was a lawyer by profession who was killed in a road accident. He started a small mechanic shop in his home town to support his family. He studied in a primary school called Azamgarh and left the village after completing his inter college. He moved to [[Delhi]], where he worked as a taxi driver. In 1985, he came to [[Mumbai]] to earn his livelihood. He worked as a bread delivery boy between [[Bandra]] and [[Andheri]]; later worked at a garment shop in Andheri West in 1986. Later, he became a real estate broker who operated from Arasa Market in Andheri West in 1987. In 1988, he assaulted a colleague over a monetary issue, resulting in the first case against him was registered at Andheri police station. In the meantime, he married Samira Jumani, a girl from Jogeshwari, from whom he divorced later. He has two sons from her. He loved film and reportedly named  his sons after Bollywood actors. His elder brother Abu Hatim, also known as "Chunchun Miyan", owns a shop in his native village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/beyond-abu/352496/0|title=BEYOND ABU|work=indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in organized crime==
In the eighties, Abu Salem came to Mumbai from his hometown Azamgarh in UP. He started working for his cousin Akthar who had a cheap electronics shop near Andheri railway station. Akhtar also worked for a Sayyed Topi, a Dawood Ibrahim gang leader in the Andheri area.
Later Abu Salem started a travel agency at Santa Cruz with J K Ibrahim who worked for the Dawood gang.&lt;ref name="archive.deccanherald.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/nov122005/national21263520051111.asp|title=Life and crimes of Abu Salem&amp;nbsp;– Deccan Herald&amp;nbsp;– Internet Edition|work=deccanherald.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709010232/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/nov122005/national21263520051111.asp|archivedate=9 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 to 1993, Salem worked as a driver for the D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim gang) and he delivered weapons, illegal cash and goods to different gang members in Mumbai.
His proficiency at delivering goods at the right time and place earned him the nickname '''Abu Samaan'''. In 1992, he supplied weapons to film actor [[Sanjay Dutt]]. He played an active role in [[1993 Bombay bombings|March 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts]] which killed over 250 people, left 700 injured and damaged property worth Rs 270&amp;nbsp;million. In 1993, he left the country and moved to [[Dubai]] when the police started rounding up suspects in serial blasts case. He had a business establishment there called Kings of Car Trading.

In the mid-nineties, many sharp shooters from D-company were killed either by the Chhota Rajan gang or in police encounters.
Salem successfully introduced a new strategy of hiring unemployed Muslim youths from his hometown Azamgarh to come to Mumbai, carry off the shooting and return to Azamgarh the next day. Those youths were paid a paltry sum compared to sharp shooters and the Mumbai police also could not track them as the youths had no criminal record with the Mumbai police.
Soon Abu Salem got the support of Anees Ibrahim (Dawood's brother) and he rose to prominence within the gang.
Because of his smooth talking skills, Salem was given the responsibility to manage the Bollywood deals and film financing for Dawood.
He organised stage shows where he invited actors. He was involved in extorting from the Hindi film industry, channelling illicit money into film production, forcibly getting the dates of stars, and usurping overseas rights. Salem first worked under [[Chhota Shakeel]] but later split and took to threatening film personalities for [[extortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=91939 |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110023854/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=91939 |archive-date=10 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1997, reportedly went to Pakistan to make arrangements for the marriage of Dawood's brother Humayun. Salem is believed to be the mastermind behind the murder of music baron [[Gulshan Kumar]] on 12 August 1997 without Dawood's consent.
His gang members also attempted to shoot at Bollywood film directors, [[Rajiv Rai]] and [[Rakesh Roshan]] when they refused to succumb to his extortion demands.
Salem fled Dubai, fearing Dawood's wrath.&lt;ref name="archive.deccanherald.com"/&gt; He finally parted ways with Dawood after being sidelined in 1998. His friction with Shakeel and Dawood's favouring of Shakeel is believed to be the reason behind Salem's split from the D-Company.&lt;ref name="Salem splits from the D-Company. D-Company Owner Papu chishmish"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1292864,prtpage-1.cms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208131853/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1292864%2Cprtpage-1.cms |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 February 2017 |title=Salem splits from the D-Company |work=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he planned kidnapping of Milton Plastics owner for ransom of Rs 30&amp;nbsp;million. In January 2001, his men shot Ajit Diwani, personal secretary to film actress [[Manisha Koirala]]. In October 2001, Four members of his gang shot down in Bandra before they could target film personalities [[Aamir Khan]], [[Ashutosh Gowarikar]] and Jhamu Sughand. In July 2002, Two shooters of Salem gang opened fire on film director [[Lawrence D'souza]] who survived. He also attempted to kill cine figures [[Rajiv Rai]], [[Rakesh Roshan]] and [[Manmohan Shetty]].

On 20 September 2002, he was arrested along with [[Monica Bedi]] by [[Interpol]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. His [[satellite phone]] was tracked using [[GPS]] technology. Monica Bedi was a film actress who reportedly had relationship with him. In February 2004, a [[Portugal]] court cleared his extradition to India to face trial in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case. In November 2005, Portuguese authorities handed him over to India on the assurance by the Government of India that the death penalty would not be handed out. When Salem was in [[Lisbon]] fighting India's extradition attempt, the only proof that he was indeed Salem was provided by the fingerprint and photographs taken after his arrest in 1991. Monica Bedi was also extradited to India and later convicted of passport forgery in 2006 and served her imprisonment but she was not involved in any of the business which belongs to abu salem.

In March 2006, a special [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] court filed eight charges against him and his alleged associate Riaz Siddiqui for his role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. He stands accused of ferrying and distributing weapons.

A lower court in Portugal cancelled his extradition to India for violation of deportation rules by Indian authorities by instituting fresh cases against him that attracted the death penalty. In July 2012, the Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice
questioned the legal right of Indian authorities to challenge the cancellation of extradition order.

On 27 June 2013, Salem was shot by Devendra Jagtap, an accused person in the Shahid Azmi murder case inside Taloja Central Jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, the police said. Salem sustained injury to his hand as Jagtap fired one round.

{{Buddhism}}
The '''Buddhist view of marriage''' considers marriage a secular affair&lt;ref name="ceremony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/funeral.htm |title=Personal Ceremonies: Marriage / Funeral Rites |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it is not considered a [[sacrament]].&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/budethics.htm |title=A Basic Buddhism Guide: Buddhist Ethics |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments.&lt;ref name="ethics"/&gt;

While the ceremony itself is civil, many Buddhists obtain the blessing from monks at the local temple after the marriage is completed.&lt;ref name="ceremony"/&gt;

==History==

[[Gautama Buddha]] never spoke against marriage&lt;ref name="marry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammananda/marriage.html#ch4 |title=A Happy Married Life: A Buddhist Perspective |publisher=Accesstoinsight.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead pointed out some of the difficulties of marriage.&lt;ref name="marry"/&gt; He is quoted in the Parabhava [[Sutra|Sutta]] as saying

{{quote|Not to be contented with one's own wife, and to be seen with harlots and the wives of others -- this is a cause of one's downfall.

Being past one's youth, to take a young wife and to be unable to sleep for jealousy of her -- this is a cause of one's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhasutra.com/files/parabhava_sutta.htm |title=Parabhava Sutta |publisher=Buddhasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Views==

The Pali Canon - the scriptures of the modern Theravada School - acknowledges homosexuality at some length in the Vinaya, or monastic code, which bars both male and female monastics ("Bhikkhus") from both heterosexual and homosexual activities. Although this clear and quite detailed acknowledgement of homosexuality exists in the monastic discipline (Vinaya), there is not one instance in which homosexuality is condemned or spoken of as evil or unskillful (Pali, "akusala") in the voluminous recension of discourses and teachings given by the Buddha and his disciples (the Suttas). All schools, including the Dalai Lama's Tibetan Buddhism, consider compassion, love and kindness at the centre of Buddhist practice and therefore love of all kind is seen as accepted. 

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has spoken of the merits of (heterosexual) marriage:

{{quote|Too many people in the West have given up on marriage. They don't understand that it is about developing a mutual admiration of someone, a deep respect and trust and awareness of another human's needs...The new easy-come, easy-go relationships give us more freedom -- but less contentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandro.net/lama_HHDalai_Lama.htm |title=HH Dalai Lama |publisher=Khandro.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While [[Buddhism]] neither encourages nor discourages marriage, it does offer some guidelines for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purifymind.com/ViewMarriage.htm |title=Buddhist view on marriage |publisher=Purifymind.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonbuddhistvihara.org/qa/qa_practices.htm#qa_practices7 |title=Buddhist practices |publisher=Londonbuddhistvihara.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Buddhist practice varies considerably among its various schools, marriage is one of the few concepts specifically mentioned in the context of [[Śīla]] (Buddhist behavior [[discipline]]).

The fundamental code of [[Buddhist ethics]], the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]] (or five precepts), contains an admonishment of [[sexual misconduct]], though what constitutes such [[misconduct]] from a Buddhist perspective varies widely depending on the local culture. 

The Digha Nikaya 31 ([[Sigalovada Sutta]]) describes the respect that one is expected to give to one's spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |title=Sigalovada Sutta |publisher=Accesstoinsight.org |date=2012-03-24 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==
Since marriage is secular,&lt;ref name="ceremony"/&gt; Buddhism has no restrictions on divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divorce|url=http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=111|publisher=Guide to Buddhism A to Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K. Sri Dhammananda|Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda]] has said "if a husband and wife really cannot live together, instead of leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy, anger and hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A Happy Married Life A Buddhist Perspective|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammananda/marriage.html|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Army Medical Corps Branch Plaque.gif|thumb|The [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|US Army Medical Corps]] Branch Plaque. The adoption, in 1902, of the caduceus for US Army medical officer uniforms popularized the erroneous use of the symbol throughout the medical field in the United States.]]

The [[caduceus]] (☤) is the traditional symbol of [[Hermes]] and features two snakes winding around an often winged staff. It is often mistakenly used as a symbol of medicine instead of the [[Rod of Asclepius]], especially in the United States.  The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, negotiation, [[alchemy]], wisdom, and controversially, thievery, lying, and the passage into the underworld.

The modern use of the '''caduceus as a symbol of medicine''' became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.&lt;ref name=friedlander&gt;{{cite book|first=Walter J|last=Friedlander|title=The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1992|isbn=0-313-28023-1|oclc=24246627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tyson&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stuart L.|last=Tyson|title=The Caduceus|journal=The Scientific Monthly|volume=34|issue=6|date=June 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=engle&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bernice|last=Engle|title=The Use of Mercury's Caduceus as a Medical Emblem|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=25|issue=3|date=December 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=245|year=1981|page=1730|title=Knots|first=M T|last=Cooper|doi=10.1001/jama.1981.03310420020013|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Robert A|author2=Whitham, Emma M|title=The symbol of modern medicine: why one snake is more than two|date=15 April 2003|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/138/8/673|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|accessdate=2007-06-15|pmid=12693891|volume=138|issue=8|pages=673–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-8-200304150-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cref|note a}}

==Early use in a possible medical context==
{{See also|Rod of Asclepius}}

Before the ancient Romans and Greeks (about 2612 [[Before Common Era|BCE]]), older representations from Syria and India of sticks and animals looking like serpents or worms are interpreted as a direct representation of traditional treatment of ''[[Dracunculiasis]]'', the [[Guinea worm]] disease.&lt;ref name=Despommier&gt;[[Dickson Despommier]], ''People, Parasites, and Plowshares: Learning from Our Body's Most Terrifying Invaders'', [[Columbia University Press]], 2016 (first edition in 2013), pages 147-163 (chapter 7 on ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]''), {{ISBN|9780231161954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is ample historical evidence of the use of the caduceus, or herald's staff, to represent [[Hermes]] or [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (and by extension commerce and negotiation), early evidence of any symbolic association between the caduceus and medicine or medical practice is scarce and ambiguous. It is likely linked to the alchemical "Universal Solvent", [[Azoth]], the symbol of which was the caduceus.

The [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] Museum in London holds a 3rd-century [[oculist]]'s seal with caduceus symbols both top and bottom. The seal was apparently used to mark preparations of eye medicine.&lt;ref name=cma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=Gerald D|title=The earliest medical use of the caduceus|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=107|date=1972-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed likely that rather than being evidence of a medical association ''per se'', this is rather an allusion to the words of the Greek poet [[Homer]] who described the caduceus as "possessing the ability to charm the eyes of men", which of course relates to the business of an oculist.&lt;ref name=cma/&gt;

Walter Friedlander proposed that early association of the caduceus with medicine might have derived from the association of Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Great Hermes") with early chemistry and medicine as aspects of alchemy as an esoteric practice. He notes however, that "although these various factors may link Hermes/Mercury, along with his caduceus, with alchemical medicine, they may just as well link all the other non-medical aspects of alchemy with Hermes/Mercury and the caduceus."&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt;

Beginning with the 16th century there is limited evidence of the use of the caduceus in what is arguably a medical context. However, this evidence is also ambiguous. In some cases it is clear that the caduceus symbolized wisdom, without any specific medical connotations.&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt;

[[File:Johann Froben's printer's symbol.jpeg|thumb|The printer's device of [[Johann Froben]].]]

The caduceus appears in a general medical context in the [[printer's device]] used by the Swiss medical printer [[Johann Frobenius]] (1460–1527), who depicted the staff entwined with serpents and surmounted by a dove, with a biblical epigraph in Greek, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16, here in the [[KJV]] translation),&lt;ref name=engle/&gt; in keeping with the connotations of the caduceus as a symbol of messengers and publishers based on the association of Hermes or Mercury with eloquence and negotiation. Friedlander observed that Frobenius could hardly be considered a medical printer, as had previously been asserted, noting that in a review of 257 of the works bearing this printer's device only one was related to medicine. Similar use of the caduceus in printers' marks continues to the present day, with companies including [[F. A. Davis Company]] still using the symbol as an element of their insignia.

There are a few other examples of use in this period. It may have been used as a symbol by Sir William Butts, physician to Henry VIII.&lt;ref name=engle/&gt;  Similarly, physician [[John Caius]], founder of [[Caius College, Cambridge]], and at the time President of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], during official visits to his eponymous college, had carried before him  a silver caduceus on a cushion, and later presented this artefact to the college, where it remains in the College's possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gonville &amp; Caius College|title=John Caius|url=http://babylon.acad.cai.cam.ac.uk/college/past/ingram/historyjcaius.php|accessdate=2010-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031456/http://babylon.acad.cai.cam.ac.uk/college/past/ingram/historyjcaius.php#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use was adduced by the medical historian (and primary apologist for the use of the caduceus in a medical context) Fielding Garrison to support his argument that the caduceus was used as a symbol of medicine as far back as the 16th Century. However, as Walter Friedlander noted, "what Caius used was a non-specific herald's wand, rather than the caduceus of Hermes." In support of this assertion he quotes Caius's own words on why he chose a herald's wand as a symbol, making it clear that he chose it as a symbol of prudence.&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt; This same passage was also earlier referenced by Engle in refuting Garrison's claim.  Engle and Friedlander are not the only ones to have noted that the use of the Caduceus by Caius had nothing to do with supposed medical symbolism; as indicated in a publication produced by the Royal College of Physicians itself: "[...] by introducing the caduceus into the ceremony of the College of Physicians, Caius unintentionally added to the confusion between the two emblems for later times, when few people understand the visual signs with which he was so familiar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Davenport, Geoffery|editor2=McDonald, Ian|editor3=Moss-Gibbons, Caroline|title=The Royal College of Physicians and its Collections: An Illustrated History|publisher=The Royal College of Physicians|year=2001|page=112|isbn=0-907383-83-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the idea that the caduceus had a long-standing association with medicine, Garrison also mentioned the fact that the English medical printer [[John Churchill (publisher)|Churchill]] used the symbol as a printer's device, beginning some time around 1844. Friedlander has examined this subject in detail, and shows that Churchill was well aware that the rod of Asclepius was the accepted symbol of medicine. He is, it seems, inclined to think that the adoption of the caduceus in this context probably had something to do with the relation between publishing and the role of Mercury as a messenger and scribe. He notes, however

{{quote|That John Churchill adopted the caduceus as his printer's device independent of any idea that it symbolized medicine does not mean that, once having adopted it, it did not play some role in the caduceus coming to be accepted as a symbol of medicine, at least in the United States. During the remaining part of the nineteenth century several United States publishers appear to have copied or modified Churchill's caduceus and placed this mark on their medical books. Other contemporary British publishers did not use a caduceus and the caduceus had never been as widely connected to medicine in Great Britain or in Europe as it has been in the United States.|Walter J Friedlander, ''The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine''&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt;}}

In any case, in Great Britain, as late as 1854, the distinction between the rod of Asclepius and the caduceus as symbols of two very different professions was apparently still quite clear. In his article ''On Tradesmen's Signs of London'' A.H. Burkitt notes that among the very old symbols still used in London at that time, which were based on associations between pagan gods and professions, "we find Mercury, or his ''caduceus'', appropriate in trade, as indicating expedition. ''Esculapius'', his ''Serpent and staff'', or his ''cock'', for professors of the healing art"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.H.|last=Burkitt|title=On Tradesmen's Signs of London|journal=Journal of the British Archaeological Association, London|volume=9|year=1854|pages=40–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption by the US military==
Widespread confusion regarding the supposed medical significance apparently arose as a result of events in the United States that occurred in the second half of the 19th Century.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt; As pointed out by Garrison, the caduceus had appeared on the [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s of Army hospital stewards as early as 1856&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Lt.Col. Fielding H.|last=Garrison|title=The use of the caduceus in the insignia of the Army medical officer|journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library notAssociation|issue=9|date=1919–20|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (William K. Emerson indicates the insignia was adopted earlier, in 1851). It has been asserted that this was a result of ignorance or misinterpretation regarding the pre-existing designation of the [[rod of Asclepius]] by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] for this purpose.&lt;ref name=cma/&gt; It is worth noting that hospital stewards were not physicians; they played a supporting role preparing drugs for surgeons, supervising nurses and cooks,  maintaining accounting and medical records, and in emergencies sometimes performed minor surgery or provided prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;George Winston Smith, ''Medicines For The Union Army: The United States Army Laboratories During The Civil War'', Haworth Press, 2001, p14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 1871, the Surgeon General designated the caduceus as the seal of the Marine Hospital Service (destined to become the U.S. Public Health Service in 1912).  Gershen states that the change was for aesthetic reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Barton J. Gershen, ''Word Rounds: A history of words, both medical and nonmedical, and their relationship to one another'', Flower Valley Press, 2001, p45&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Friedlander states the caduceus was adopted by the Marine Hospital Service "because of its relationship with merchant seamen and the maritime industry".&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt;

The caduceus was formally adopted by the [[AMEDD|Medical Department]] of the [[United States Army]] in 1902 and was added to the uniforms of Army medical officers. According to Friedlander, this was brought about by one Captain Frederick P. Reynolds, although Bernice Engle states "the use of the caduceus in our army I believe to be due chiefly to the late Colonel Hoff, who has emphasized the suitability of the caduceus as an emblem of neutrality.&lt;ref name=engle/&gt;  Reynolds had the idea rejected several times by the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General]], but persuaded the new incumbent — Brig. Gen. [[William H. Forwood]] — to adopt it. This resulted in considerable controversy.

''[[The Army and Navy Register]]'' of 28 June 1902 discusses the argument, which reflects the fact that a number of medical officers were unhappy with the choice. The article editor claims that the symbol was not chosen for its medical connotations and proposes the following symbolic interpretation: "the rod represents power, the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply diligence and activity, qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our Medical officers."&lt;ref name=emerson&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=William K|title=Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1996|pages=181–182|isbn=0-585-19489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor also points out that the majority of Medical Corps personnel are not even doctors. According to this line of reasoning, the caduceus was never intended to be a symbol of medicine. The inconsistency was noticed several years later by the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office|librarian to the Surgeon General]], but for reasons which are not entirely clear, the symbol was not changed.&lt;ref name="AIM"/&gt;

Considerable light is shed on this confusion by an anonymous letter republished by Emerson, a historian of United States Army insignia and uniforms. He indicates that the April 1924 issue of ''The Military Surgeon'' printed a review of an earlier article that appeared in the ''Presse Medicale'' in which the author stated "There is nothing in history to justify the use of the caduceus as the emblem of the physician [...] it is most unfortunate that the 'confusion' exists." In an anonymous rebuttal contained in a letter to the editor published three months later in ''The Military Surgeon'' it was claimed that the late Col. John R. van Hoff was a member of the board that selected the emblem ("if he was not the one who was chiefly instrumental in its adoption"). In the letter to the editor reproduced by Emerson, the anonymous author claims

{{cquote|Hoff was far too scholarly and intelligent a man to commit the blunder of 'confusing' the caduceus with the serpent staff of Aesculapius. The sign of Mercury was deliberately adopted, as I have heard him state, because it was the emblem of the merchant and hence the emblem of the noncombatant. In junctures when it was necessary for a vessel to proclaim its nature, it was customary for a merchant vessel to indicate its noncombatant status by flying a flag which bore the emblem of Mercury, the God of the Merchant. The caduceus, in our use of it, is not distinctively the emblem of the physician, but the emblem of the whole Medical Department. The enlisted men of the medical department outnumber the physicians of that department. Besides the ambulance wagons, many vehicles are employed in field service in war which are not distinctively medical, but which are used for medical purposes. Both the enlisted men and the vehicles of the department (not to mention many other objects), should bear some sign of neutralization for protection. It seemed to Colonel Hoff and to the board that the Geneva cross, which in addition to its use as an emblem of neutrality is also the emblem of the Swiss Republic, there might well be substituted an emblem which is not the emblem of a foreign country, and the caduceus was selected, as the emblem which for many ages has served to indicate the noncombatant.|4=William K Emerson|5=Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms&lt;ref name=emerson/&gt;}}

According to this view the caduceus was not intended to be a medical symbol (and, though explained differently, this reflects the view advanced by the editor commenting in ''The Army and Navy Register'' of 28 June 1902 discussed above). Nevertheless, after World War I the caduceus was employed as an emblem by both the  Army Medical Department and the [[Hospital Corpsman|Navy Hospital Corps]]. Even the [[American Medical Association]] used the symbol for a time, but in 1912, after considerable discussion, the caduceus was abandoned by the AMA and the [[rod of Asclepius]] was adopted instead.&lt;ref name=engle/&gt;

This shift back to use of the rod of Asclepius to symbolize medicine can also be seen in the United States military. The Army Medical Corps, having popularised the caduceus, whilst retaining the caduceus for its own plaque and insignia, is now part of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]], which has since adopted the Rod of Asclepius as its main symbol. Furthermore, when the U.S. Air Force designed new medical insignia, it also adopted the rod of Asclepius. (The Royal Air Force (UK) medical services have, however, used the caduceus as uniform collar insignia since the foundation of the RAF in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rafa.org.uk/caduceus/]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Contemporary views==
[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|The emergency services' [[Star of Life]] features a [[rod of Asclepius]].]]

Despite widespread acceptance of the caduceus as a medical symbol in the [[United States]], it has been observed that the [[rod of Asclepius]] has "the more ancient and authentic claim to be the emblem of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated Companion To Medicine|year=2001|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to defend its use in a medical context date from the last quarter of the 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th, and have been characterized as "based on flimsy and pseudo-historical research".&lt;ref name=cma/&gt;

In a survey of 242 logos used by organizations related to health or medicine, Friedlander found that professional associations were more likely to display the rod of Asclepius (62%), while organizations with a commercial focus were more likely to use the caduceus (76%). Hospitals were an exception (37% used a staff of Asclepius whereas 63% used a caduceus). Friedlander felt it likely that this might reflect the fact that "professional medical organizations have more often sought a real understanding of the meaning of the two symbols whereas commercial organizations have been less interested in the historical basis of their logo or insignia and more concerned with how well a certain symbol will be recognized by the iconographically unsophisticated audience they are trying to attract to their wares."&lt;ref name=friedlander/&gt;

The use of the caduceus in a medical context has long been frowned upon by many professionals, academics and others who are familiar with the historical significance of both symbols. This has occasioned impassioned remarks by those frustrated with the continuing confusion.

{{cquote|It is hard to trust a profession that cannot even get its symbols straight. Most physicians in the United States think that the symbol of their profession is something called the caduceus. But this is actually not true. [...] Historians have discovered that someone in the U.S. Army Medical Corps mistook the caduceus for the [[Rod of Asclepius|Aesculapion]] and introduced the Medical Corps' symbol at the beginning of the twentieth century. Soon thereafter, everyone in the United States was emulating the mistake.|4=Daniel P. Sulmasy|5=''A Balm for Gilead: Meditations On Spirituality and the Healing Arts''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sulmasy|first=Daniel p|publisher=Georgetown University Press|title=A Balm for Gilead: Meditations On Spirituality and the Healing Arts|year=2006|page=55|isbn=1-58901-122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been observed that the caduceus is particularly inappropriate for use as a medical symbol due to its long associations with the Greek god [[Hermes]], who was patron of commerce and traders as well as thieves, liars, and gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman O.|last=Brown|title=Hermes the Thief: The Evolution of a Myth|publisher=Madison: University of Wisconsin Press|year=1947|isbn=0-940262-26-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|As god of the high-road and the market-place Hermes was perhaps above all else the patron of commerce and the fat purse: as a corollary, he was the special protector of the traveling salesman. As spokesman for the gods, he not only brought peace on earth (occasionally even the peace of death), but his silver-tongued eloquence could always make the worse appear the better cause. From this latter point of view, would not his symbol be suitable for certain Congressmen, all medical quacks, book agents and purveyors of vacuum cleaners, rather than for the straight-thinking, straight-speaking therapeutist? As conductor of the dead to their subterranean abode, his emblem would seem more appropriate on a hearse than on a physician's car.|4=Stuart L. Tyson|5="The Caduceus", in ''The Scientific Monthly''&lt;ref name=tyson/&gt;}}

On the other hand, it has also been remarked – not without considerable irony – that commercial aims in medicine, especially in the United States of America, make the caduceus ''an appropriate symbol'', at least for some physicians.

{{cquote|Well, so much for the caduceus. Somebody obviously got the wrong symbol for modern medicine–or did they? The caduceus seems to be an appropriate symbol for modern commercial medicine. Of particular relevance are the functions of escorting souls of the dead, wisdom, fertility, commerce, luck, eloquence, cheating and thieving. These have become symbolic of how medicine evolved in the late Twentieth Century.|4=Luke Van Orden|5=''Where Have All the Healers Gone?: A Doctor's Recovery Journey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Orden|first=Luke|title=Where Have All the Healers Gone?: A Doctor's Recovery Journey|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0-595-24455-6|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Caduceus and Rod of Asclepius as used in medical signage.jpg|thumb|The Caduceus and the Rod of Asclepius as used by neighboring offices (Ridgewood, NY)]]

Others are unapologetic about the association of medicine with commerce, recognizing the importance of "advertising essential for competitive marketing", and suggesting that it is up to individual physicians to choose between the two symbols, based on their own views about what associations are appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morford|first1=Mark P.O|last2=Lenardon|first2=Robert J|title=Classical Mythology|year=2007|isbn=0-19-514725-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, conspiracy theorist [[David Icke]] suggested that the [[American Medical Association]] deliberately adopted the symbol due to their underlying profit motives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Icke|title=Secret Symbols Reveal Dark Agenda of Western Medicine|url=http://www.davidicke.com/articles/symbolism-mainmenu-44/24430-the-caduceus-decoded-secret-symbols-reveal-dark-agenda-of-western-medicine|access-date=2013-07-22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130722233127/http://www.davidicke.com/articles/symbolism-mainmenu-44/24430-the-caduceus-decoded-secret-symbols-reveal-dark-agenda-of-western-medicine#|archive-date=2013-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the AMA has used the Rod of Asclepius for over a century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=American Medical News|title=The symbol for a new AMA: Medicine for the 21st Century|date=2005-06-20|url=http://www.amednews.com/article/20050620/opinion/306209958/4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its current logo since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=medGadget|title=Exclusive: AMA Goes for New Logo|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2005/06/exclusive_ama_g.html|last=Ostrovsky|first=Gene|date=2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, there are calls to clarify the symbol and to move to a uniform use of the rod of Asclepius. For example, the director of communications of the [[Minnesota Medical Association]] is quoted as saying, "If it's got wings on it, it's not really the symbol of medicine; some may find it hard to believe, but it's true. It's something like using the logo for the [[National Rifle Association]] when referring to the [[Audubon Society]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert B.|last=Taylor|title=White Coat Tales: Medicine's Heroes, Heritage and Misadventures|publisher=Springer|year=2008|pages=207–208|isbn=0-387-73079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Andrew Weil]], a proponent of alternative medicine, has suggested that the caduceus is appropriate as a medical symbol "because it embodies an esoteric truth that must be grasped to gain practical control over the shifting forces that determine health and illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weil|first=Andrew|title=Health and Healing: The Philosophy of Integrative Medicine|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2004|pages=45–46|isbn=0-618-47908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of '''Cape Verdeans in Italy''' dates back to the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Andall"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
There are various conflicting data about the size of the Cape Verdean population. The 2001 Italian census found 3,263 residents of Italy born in Cape Verde, 628 of whom held Italian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OECD|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Caboverde Informatics Project of the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] estimated that by 1995 their population already had reached 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/CaboVerde/wwpopest.html|title=Cape Verdean Diaspora Population Estimates|publisher=Caboverde Informatics Project, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth|accessdate=2009-08-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829094133/http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/CaboVerde/wwpopest.html|archivedate=2009-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study asserted that Italy had 4,004 Cape Verdean legal residents in 2002.&lt;ref name="Andall_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cape Verdean embassy in Italy listed 9,978 of their nationals in Italy as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramos|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Italy's first Cape Verdean migrants arrived in 1957.&lt;ref name="Ramos"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramos|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early migration was almost exclusively female. The migrants consisted of young women recruited for live-in [[domestic worker|domestic work]] in Italy by [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]] living in [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde]]. Roughly 3,500 had come to Italy in this manner by the end of 1972.&lt;ref name="Andall" /&gt; The migrants settled primarily in [[Rome]] and [[Naples]], with much smaller concentrations in [[Palermo]] and [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="Andall_a" /&gt;

==Employment==
Domestic work remains an important source of employment for Cape Verdean women, though most have shifted to hourly work and living away from their workplace.&lt;ref name="Andall_b"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors have limited the shift away from domestic work into other lines of employment such as heavy industry: only a limited number of Cape Verdean men have migrated to Italy, and the Cape Verdeans are concentrated in the less-industrialised southern parts of Italy. They face increasing employment competition from Eastern European migrants.&lt;ref name="Andall_d"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a weak trend towards entrepreneurship and self-employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramos|2008|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Migrants generally had a low level of education upon their arrival.&lt;ref name="Andall_c"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy was common.&lt;ref name="Andall_e"&gt;{{harvnb|Andall|2008|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many migrants took advantage of the education offered by the Portuguese School in Rome, which was officially recognised by the [[Ministry of Education (Portugal)|Portuguese Ministry of Education]], and then afterwards entered into [[List of universities in Italy|Italian universities]].&lt;ref name="Ramos" /&gt;

==Social integration==
In general, Cape Verdeans have not faced as severe a level of discrimination as other migrant groups like Moroccans.&lt;ref name="Andall_b" /&gt; Officials generally view them as well-integrated and unproblematic. Their early presence in Italy was characterised by social and political invisibility, but by the 1980s and 1990s, as Italians began to understand that their country had become an importer rather than an exporter of migrant labour as it had traditionally been, more public attention was focused on the Cape Verdean presence.&lt;ref name="Andall_c" /&gt;

One study found that roughly half of Cape Verdeans were married to Italians.&lt;ref name="Andall_d" /&gt; It is common for children to be sent back to Cape Verde for their early education and then return to Italy when they are older.&lt;ref name="Andall_e" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">'''Child Marriage in Democratic Republic of the Congo'''. In 2017 in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], 37% of girls are married off before the age of 18. 10% are married before they turn 15.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/|title=Child marriage around the world: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO|work=[[Girls Not Brides]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic Republic of the Congo is the 19th highest nation in the world for child marriage.

In many communities in DRC, it is tradition that allows young girls to get married,&lt;ref name="reliefweb.int"/&gt; and not religion as many think. However, displacement, poverty and family pressure are factors which increase this phenomena.&lt;ref name="reliefweb.int"&gt;{{cite|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/child-marriage-limiting-development-youth|title=Child marriage around the world: NIGERIA|author=Odette Asha|date=August 12, 2015|work=[[Norwegian Refugee Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military conflict has increased the incidence of child marriage by creating a climate where sexual violence is widespread and there is limited rule of law and impunity for perpetrators. In the DRC, an estimated 200,000 girls and women have experienced sexual violence due to war.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"/&gt;

Descriptive and multivariate analyses performed show that country's young women who faced first sexual intercourse before 16 yo are 73.5 times more at risk of early marriage more than those who initiated it at the age 18–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09718923.2017.1322393?journalCode=rjss20|author1=Jacques Elengemoke Mpilambo|author2=Sathiya Susuman Appunni|author3= Ogujiuba Kanayo|author4=Nancy Stiegler|title=Determinants of Early Marriage among Young Women in Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=Journal of Social Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chiwen''''' ({{zh|c=螭吻|p=''chīwěn''|w=''ch'ih-wen''|l=hornless-dragon mouth}}, '''Chi Wen''') is a [[Chinese dragon]], and one of the [[9 sons of the dragon]] in [[Chinese mythology]]. He is depicted in [[imperial roof decoration]]s and other ornamental motifs in traditional [[Chinese architecture]] and [[Chinese art|art]].

This [[Chinese dragon]] name ''chiwen'' 螭吻 [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''chi'' [[Wikt:螭|螭]] "[[Chi (mythology)|hornless dragon]]; young dragon" and ''wen'' [[Wikt:吻|吻]] "(animal's) mouth; lips; kiss". ''Chishou'' 螭首 and ''Chitou'' 螭頭 (both literally meaning "hornless-dragon head") are related architectural ornaments or waterspouts, comparable with Western [[gargoyle]]s. Chiwen and Chishou are not the character in chinese mythology.

''Chiwen'' 螭吻 is alternatively written ''chiwen'' 鴟吻 ("owl mouth"), using the homophonous [[Chinese character]] ''chi'' [[Wikt:鴟|鴟]] "owl; sparrowhawk; bird of prey". The ''chiwei'' 鴟尾 ("owl tail") and ''chimeng'' 鴟甍 ("owl roof-ridge") are additional birdlike roof decorations.

The ''chiwen'' is listed second or third among the ''Long sheng jiuzi'' 龍生九子 ("dragon gives birth to nine young"), [[Nine sons of the dragon|Nine Dragons]] ({{zh|c=九龙|p=jiǔlóng}}), which are traditional mythology creatures and become traditional Chinese fengshui architectural decorations. Each one of those creatures have a protective function. The Nine dragon are also used in many place names, such as [[Kowloon]] ("nine dragons" in Cantonese), in [[Hong Kong]], but also numerous lakes, rivers or hamlets in [[mainland China]].

According to the [[Ming Dynasty]] ''Wuzazu'' 五雜俎 (tr. Visser 1913:101), "The ''ch'i-wen'', which like swallowing, are placed on both ends of the ridgepoles of roofs (to swallow all evil influences)."

Welch describes ''chiwen'' as "the dragon who likes 'to swallow things'".
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the fish-like, hornless dragon with a very truncated body and large, wide mouth usually found along roof ridges (as if swallowing the roof beams). His presence on roofs is also said to guard against fires. A paragraph in the Tang dynasty book ''Su Shi Yan Yi'' (苏氏演义) by Su E (苏鹗) says that a mythical sea creature called the ''chi wen'' {{sic}} was put on the roofs of buildings during the Han dynasty to protect the structures from fire hazards. This dragon is still found on the roofs of traditional Chinese homes today, protecting the inhabitants from fires. (2008:122-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In [[Fengshui]] theory, a ''chiwen'' or ''chiwei'' supposedly protects against not only fire, but also flood and typhoon.

The [[Japanese language]] borrowed these names for architectural roof decorations as [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]. ''[[Shibi (roof tile)|Shibi]]'' 鴟尾 "ornamental roof-ridge tile" is more commonly used than ''chifun'' 螭吻 or ''shifun'' 鴟吻. In [[Japanese mythology]], the ''[[Shachihoko]]'' 鯱 "a mythical fish with a carp's arched tail, tiger's head, and dragon's scales" roof decoration is believed to cause rain and protect against fire. This [[Wikt: 鯱|鯱]] is a [[kokuji]] "Chinese character invented in Japan" that can also be read ''shachi'' for "[[orca]]".

==Philosophy and aims==
Among the Comunes' objectives are to provide legal protection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P2P Foundation on the Comunes Association|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Comunes_Association|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to member projects, together with technical infrastructure. It claims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Commons|url=http://comunes.org/about-the-commons/|publisher=Comunes Association|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be inspired by [[Software in the Public Interest]] organization, which provides similar protection to free software projects. Comunes member projects must focus on encouraging the protection or expansion of the [[Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comunes Legal Statutes|url=http://comunes.org/statutes/|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comunes Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comunes Manifesto|url=http://comunes.org/about/|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a view on the [[social movements]] as nodes in a [[social network]], analysing which problems this ecosystem has&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenges to connecting nodes in the ecosystem of social movements|url=http://www.commonsknowledgealliance.org/content/challenges-connecting-nodes-ecosystem-social-movements|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and proposing Comunes web tools for diminishing them.

The term '''''Disneyfication''''' (also '''''Disneyisation''''') describes the transformation of a society to resemble the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] based on rapid Western-style globalization processes and consumerist lifestyles. The term Disneyisation appears in ''Christian Contradictions and the World Revolution'' (1991), by Andre Kehoe: "This bogus culture imposed hour after hour on the people by the media is a serious interference with [[free thinking]] and therefore [[free action]]. It is part of what Peter K. Fallon of New York University, in an admirable phrase, calls the Disneyisation of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kehoe | first = Andre | title = Christian Contradictions and the World Revolution: Letters to My Son | location = Dublin | publisher = Glendale Publishing | year = 1991 | p = 373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in ''The Cultures of Cities'' (1996), by Sharon Zukin, and was popularized in ''The Disneyization of Society'' (2004), by [[Alan Bryman]]. The Disneyfication of urban space is explored in ''Tearing Down the Streets: Adventures in Urban Anarchy'', by Jeff Ferrell.

The terms Disneyfication and Disneyisation are derogatory, implying the social and cultural homogenization consequent to [[Consumption (economics)|consumerism]], [[merchandising]], and [[emotional labor]]; and broadly describe the processes of stripping a real place or event of its original character, and represent it in a sanitized format. References to anything negative are removed, and the facts are [[Dumbing down|dumbed down]] with the intent of rendering the subject more pleasant and easily grasped. In the case of places, that means replacing the real with an idealized, tourist-friendly veneer reminiscent of the "[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]" attractions at Disney theme parks; the aspects of Disneyization include:

* [[theme (narrative)|theming]] – infusing a place or object with a particular idea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* hybrid consumption – a collection of multiple consumption opportunities in a particular location.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[merchandise|merchandising]] – promoting goods or services with objects bearing promotional images or logos.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[emotional labor|performative labor]] – making employees not only providers of services, but also entertainers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] (who writes about the nature of [[reality]] and the [[hyperreality]]) has called [[Disneyland]] the most real place in the [[United States|U.S.]], because it is not pretending to be anything more than it actually is, a [[theme park]].  In his [[essay]] ''Simulations'', he writes:

{{quote|Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of [[Los Angeles]] and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyper-real and of simulation.}}

He also criticized the hidden corporate nature of the company in his book ''America'':

{{quote|The whole Walt Disney philosophy eats out of your hand with these pretty little sentimental creatures in grey fur coats. For my own part, I believe that behind these smiling eyes there lurks a cold, ferocious beast fearfully stalking us.}}

'''Eastphalian''', or '''Eastfalian''' ({{Lang-de|Ostfälisch}}), is a [[West Low German]] (Low Saxon) dialect spoken in southeastern parts of [[Lower Saxony]] and western parts of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in [[Germany]].

==Geographical extent==
The language area between the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] rivers stretches from the [[Lüneburg Heath]] in the north to the [[Harz]] mountain range and [[Weser Uplands]] in the south. It comprises [[Hanover Region]], [[Brunswick Land|Brunswick]] and [[Calenberg Land]] as well as the [[Magdeburg Börde]], including the cities of [[Hanover]], [[Braunschweig]], [[Hildesheim]], [[Göttingen]] and [[Magdeburg]]. It roughly corresponds with the historic region of [[Eastphalia]].

==Classification==
Eastphalian as a separate dialect was determined by 19th century [[linguistics]], tracing it back to [[Old Saxon]] variants spoken in eastern parts of the medieval [[stem duchy]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. In everyday life, very few speakers are aware of talking Eastphalian as distinct to [[Northern Low Saxon]]. Towards the Elbe region in the southeast, the language area is increasingly influenced by the [[High German consonant shift]].

==Subdivisions==
* Elbe Eastphalian (around [[Oschersleben]] and [[Haldensleben]] in the Magdeburg Börde between [[Helmstedt]] and Magdeburg)
* Göttingisch-Grubenhagensch (around Göttingen, [[Northeim]] and [[Osterode am Harz]]
* Heide Eastphalian (around [[Celle]], with Northern Low Saxon elements)
* Central Eastphalian is the Eastphalian subdialect spoken in a large area surrounding Braunschweig and Hanover.

The '''Elgon languages''' are languages of the [[Southern Nilotic languages|Southern Nilotic]] [[Kalenjin languages|Kalenjin]] family spoken in the [[Mount Elgon]] area in western [[Kenya]] and eastern [[Uganda]]. According to the [[Ethnologue]], there are two main Elgon languages: [[Kupsabiny language|Kupsabiny]] (spoken by about 120,000 people) and [[Sabaot language|Sabaot]] (spoken by about 134,000 people). Sabaot is a common name assumed by various related peoples, including the Kony, Pok, and Bong'om (after whom the [[West]]ern [[Kenya]]n town of [[Bungoma]] is named), whose respective languages are considered separate languages by Rottland (1982).

The [[Terik people]], living east of Lake Victoria wedged in between the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] and [[Luhya people|Luyia]], spoke or speak a dialect closely related to Pok and Bong'om. According to their own oral history they are "people of Mount Elgon"; this is confirmed by Bong'om traditions that "the people who later called themselves Terik were still Bong'om when they left Elgon and moved away in a southern direction" (Roeder 1986:142). Recently many of them have assimilated to neighbouring Nandi, leading to a decline in the use of the [[Terik language]] in favor of Nandi. Although they live in two countries, both groups speak the same language but with slightly different pronunciations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4385">The '''Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra''' (ESAC), in English the '''Agrarian School of Coimbra''', is a state-run [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] [[higher education]] school of [[agriculture]], based in [[Coimbra]], [[Portugal]]. The oldest of the [[Coimbra Polytechnical Institute]]'s (IPC) autonomous institutions, it has also IPC's largest campus.

==History==
The ESAC has a long history in [[vocational education]] and provision of services to the community started in the nineteenth century as the National School of Agriculture (1899), renamed the Regents School of Agriculture (1950), and finally in the 1970s, the Higher Agrarian School of Coimbra (Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra), a state-run [[higher education]] school of agriculture. It was incorporated into the [[Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra]] in the 1980s but preserved wide technical, pedagogical and financial autonomy. It conferred the ''bacharelato'' degree and the ''Diploma de Estudos Especializados'' (DESE) diploma. In the late 1990s, after the upgrading of the Portuguese polytechnical institutions to [[bachelor's degree]]-conferring institutions (the Portuguese ''licenciatura''), the differences between this polytechnical school and the university institutions were drastically reduced, an achievement that would fully materialize after the [[Bologna Process]] in 2006/2007. Currently, the ESAC awards a 3-year 1st cycle [[bachelor's degree]] (''licenciatura''); and a 2-year 2nd cycle [[masters' degree]] in several fields including [[biotechnology]], [[food engineering]], [[organic farming]], and [[forest engineering]]. In addition, ESAC has developed and expanded its own research units and programs.

==The campus==
The ESAC is located in the urban area of the city of [[Coimbra]], on a campus with strong rural characteristics, with a significant area of farmland, pasture, forest and infrastructure support for a total of 140 ha. It has a vast architectural heritage, architecture typical of the traditional rural location, including a listed building. The natural heritage of ESAC is also known for its quality and diversity: the region's largest [[camphor tree]], a forest of [[oak]]s, and woody teixos, a tash, a [[Sequoioideae|Sequoia]] and species protected by the Habitats Directive. There is also a great faunal diversity including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, which have been identified as species of community interest.

This set of semi-natural areas, infrastructure and equipment can be used in training activities, [[environmental education]] and recreation service to the community as the main activities of ESAC focus in teaching, research and services in the areas of [[agriculture]], [[biotechnology]], [[forestry]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], agro-industries and eco-[[agritourism]].

==Research and services to the community==
The Centro de Estudos de Recursos Naturais, Ambiente e Sociedade (CERNAS) is ESAC's [[research and development]] centre. CERNAS develops scientific and technological knowledge in the areas of [[natural resources]], [[food science]], environment and [[sustainable development]], based on multidisciplinary, cross sectoral and horizontal development, promoting research, dissemination of knowledge, training, scientific qualification and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esac.pt/cernas CERNAS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports and student life==
The Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra has a notable [[rugby union in Portugal|rugby union]] department, usually known as [[Agrária]]. The rugby team has played in the main Portuguese leagues. The students' union is the Associação de Estudantes da Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra (AE ESAC) which was founded in 1982 by students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeesac.com/ Associação de Estudantes da Escola Superior Agraria de Coimbra]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franco-Provençal''' (also '''Francoprovençal''' or '''Arpitan''') is a dialect group within [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] spoken in east-central [[France]], western [[Switzerland]], northwestern [[Italy]], and in enclaves in the [[Province of Foggia]] in [[Apulia]], Italy. 

Franco-Provençal has several distinct [[dialect]]s and is separate from but closely related to neighboring Romance dialects (the [[langues d'oïl]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Rhaeto-Romance]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Piedmontese]]).&lt;ref&gt;
For details on the question of linguistic classification see [[Gallo-Romance]],  [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]], [[Questione Ladina]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Franco-Provençal'' (Franco-Provençal: {{lang|frp|francoprovençâl}}; {{lang-fr|francoprovençal}}; {{lang-it|francoprovenzale}}) dates to the 19th century. Traditionally, the dialect group is also referred to as ''[[patois]]''
(''{{lang|frp|patouès}}''), and since the late 20th century as '''Arpitan''' (Franco-Provençal: ''{{lang|frp|arpetan}}''; {{lang-it| arpitano}}), and its [[linguistic areal|areal]] as ''[[Arpitania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A derivation from ''arpa'' "[[alpine pasture]]", see 
Alain Pichard, [http://blog.regionleman.com/public/Arpitanie/Histoire_Arpitanie_24heures.pdf Nos ancêtres les Arpitans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171257/http://blog.regionleman.com/public/Arpitanie/Histoire_Arpitanie_24heures.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, 24 Heures, Lausanne, 2 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Formerly spoken throughout the territory of [[Savoy]],  Franco-Provençal speakers are now found spoken of in  the [[Aosta Valley]], an [[autonomous administrative division]] of Italy. 
The language is also spoken in alpine valleys in the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]], two isolated towns ([[Faeto]] and [[Celle di San Vito]]) in the [[Province of Foggia]], and rural areas of the Swiss ''[[Romandie]]''. 
It is one of the three [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language families]] of France and is officially recognized as a [[languages of France|regional language of France]], but its use is marginal. Organizations are attempting to preserve it through cultural events, education, scholarly research, and publishing.

Aside from regional French dialects (the ''[[Langues d'oïl]]''), it is the most closely related language to [[French language|French]]. The number of speakers of Franco-Provençal has been declining significantly. According to [[UNESCO]] (1995), Franco-Provençal is a "potentially endangered language" in Italy and an "[[endangered language]]" in Switzerland and France.

== History ==
Franco-Provençal emerged as a [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] variety of [[Latin]]. The linguistic [[region]] comprises east-central France, western portions of Switzerland, and the [[Aosta Valley]] of Italy with the adjacent alpine valleys of the [[Piedmont]]. This area covers territories once occupied by pre-Roman [[Celts]], including the [[Allobroges]], [[Sequani]], [[Helvetii]], [[Ceutrones]], and [[Salassi]]. By the 5th century, the region was controlled by the [[Burgundians]]. [[Federico Krutwig]] has also detected a [[Basque language|Basque]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] in the [[toponyms]] of the easternmost [[Valdôtain dialect|Valdôtain]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Krutwig, F. (1973). Les noms pré-indoeuropéens en Val-d'Aoste. ''Le Flambeau, no. 4, 1973.'', in: Henriet, Joseph (1997). La Lingua Arpitana. ''Quaderni Padani, Vol. III, no. 11, May–June 1997''. pp. 25–30. [http://www.laliberacompagnia.org/pubblicazioni/qp_pdf/qp_11.pdf ''.pdf''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506090010/http://www.laliberacompagnia.org/pubblicazioni/qp_pdf/qp_11.pdf |date=6 May 2006 }} (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco-Provençal is first attested in manuscripts from the 12th century, possibly diverging from the [[langues d'oïl]] as early as the 8th–9th centuries (Bec, 1971). However, Franco-Provençal is consistently typified by a strict, myopic comparison to French, and so is characterized as "conservative". Thus, commentators, like Désormaux, consider "medieval" the terms for many nouns and verbs, including ''pâta'' "rag", ''bayâ'' "to give", ''moussâ'' "to lie down", all of which are conservative only relative to French. As an example, Désormaux, writing on this point in the foreword of his [[Savoyard dialect]] dictionary, states:
{{quote|text=The antiquated character of the Savoyard patois is striking. One can note it not only in phonetics and morphology, but also in the vocabulary, where one finds numerous words and directions that clearly disappeared from French.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin &amp; Désormaux, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Franco-Provençal failed to garner the cultural prestige of its three more widely spoken neighbors:  French, Occitan, and Italian. Communities where speakers lived were generally mountainous and isolated from one another. The internal boundaries of the entire speech area were divided by wars and religious conflicts. France, Switzerland, the [[Franche-Comté]] (protected by [[Habsburg Spain]]), and the duchy, later kingdom, ruled by the [[House of Savoy]] politically divided the region. The strongest possibility for any dialect of Franco-Provençal to establish itself as a major language died when an [[edict]], dated 6 January 1539, was confirmed in the parliament of the [[Duchy of Savoy]] on 4 March 1540 (duchy was partially occupied by France since 1538). The edict explicitly replaced Latin (and by implication, any other language) with French as the language of law and the courts (Grillet, 1807, p.&amp;nbsp;65).

The name ''Franco-Provençal'' (''franco-provenzale'') is due to [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]]  (1878), chosen because the dialect group was seen as intermediate between [[French language|French]] and [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].

Franco-Provençal dialects were widely spoken in their speech areas until the 20th century. As French political power expanded and the "single-national-language" doctrine was spread through French-only education, Franco-Provençal speakers abandoned their language, which had numerous spoken variations and no standard [[orthography]], in favor of culturally prestigious French.

== Present status ==
The [[Aosta Valley]] is nowadays the only region of the Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language ([[Valdôtain dialect]]) in this region since 1948. An amendment to the constitution of Italy&lt;ref&gt;Italian constitutional law: ''Legge costituzionale 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, "Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta"'' ([http://www.parlamentiregionali.it/dbdata/documenti/%5B4721daf9e8d13%5Dvda2001.pdf Parlamento Italiano, ''Legge 1948, n. 4''])&lt;/ref&gt; changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree&lt;ref&gt;Italian presidential decree: ''Decreto presidenziale della Repubblica del 20 novembre 1991, "Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche", Articolo 2''&lt;/ref&gt; and a federal law.&lt;ref&gt;Italian federal law: ''Legge 15 dicembre 1999, n. 482, "Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche storiche", pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 297 del 20 dicembre 1999, Articolo 2'', ([http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/99482l.htm Parlamento Italiano, ''Legge 482''])&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a regional law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglio.regione.vda.it/banche_dati/leggi_regolamenti/dettaglio_f.asp?pk_lr=3141&amp;versione=V|title=Conseil de la Vallée - Loi régionale 1er août 2005, n. 18 - Texte en vigueur|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).

Paradoxically, the same federal laws do not grant the language the same protection in the [[Province of Turin]] because Franco-Provençal speakers make up less than 15% of the population. Lack of jobs has caused migration out of the Piedmont's alpine valleys, abetting the language's decline.

Switzerland does not recognize Franco-Provençal (Romand) as one of its [[Languages of Switzerland#Languages|official languages]] (''Romand'' should not be confused with ''[[Romansh language|Romansh]]''). Speakers live in western [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] where [[Swiss French]] predominates and converse in dialects mainly as a second language. Currently, its use in agrarian daily life is rapidly disappearing. However, in a few isolated places the decline is considerably less steep. This is most notably the case for [[Evolène]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolena-nostra.ch/patois/grammaire.htm |title=Eat Healthy, Eat Well |publisher= |accessdate=30 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305120439/http://www.evolena-nostra.ch/patois/grammaire.htm |archivedate=5 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco-Provençal has had a precipitous decline in France. The official language of the French Republic is French (article 2 of the [[Constitution of France]]). The French government officially recognizes Franco-Provençal as one of the "[[languages of France]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/|title=Langue française et langues de France|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is constitutionally barred from ratifying the 1992 [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (ECRML) that would guarantee it certain rights. Thus, Franco-Provençal has almost no political support. It also carries a generally low social status. This situation affects most regional languages that comprise the linguistic wealth of France. Speakers of regional languages are aging and mostly rural.

== Classification ==
Franco-Provençal's name would suggest it is a bridge dialect between French and the [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]], but this is misleading. More precisely, Franco-Provençal is a separate Gallo-Romance language that transitions into the [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]] [[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Morvandiau]] and [[Frainc-Comtou dialect|Franc-Comtois]] to the northwest, into [[Romansh language|Romansh]] to the east, into the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]] language [[Piedmontese language|Piemontese]] to the southeast, and finally into the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]] dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] to the southwest.

The [[Philology|philological]] classification for Franco-Provençal published by the [[Linguasphere Observatory]] (Dalby, 1999/2000, p.&amp;nbsp;402) follows:
: Indo-European ''phylosector'' → Romanic ''phylozone'' → Italiano+Româneasca (Romance) ''set'' → Italiano+Româneasca ''chain'' → Romance-West ''net'' → Lyonnais+Valdôtain (Franco-Provençal) ''reference name''. The Linguasphere Observatory language code for Franco-Provençal is '''51-AAA-j'''

A philological classification for Franco-Provençal published by [[Stanford University]] (Ruhlen, 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;325–326) is as follows:
:Indo-Hittite → Indo-European → Italic → Latino-Faliscan → Romance → Continental → Western → Gallo-Iberian-Romance → Gallo-Romance → North → Franco-Provençal.

== Origin of the name ==
Franco-Provençal is an extremely fragmented language, with scores of highly peculiar local variations that never merged over time. The range of dialect diversity is far greater than that found in the Langue d'Oïl and Occitan regions. Comprehension of one dialect by speakers of another is often difficult. Nowhere is it spoken in a "pure form" and there is no a "standard reference language" that the modern generic label used to identify the language may indicate. This explains why speakers use local terms to name it, such as Bressan, Forèzien, or Valdôtain, or simply ''patouès'' ("patois"). Only in recent years have speakers not specialists in linguistics become conscious of the language's collective identity.

[[File:Ascoli.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]]]]
The language region was first recognized in the 19th century during advances in research into the nature and structure of human speech. [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] (1829–1907), a pioneering [[linguistics|linguist]], analyzed the unique [[phonetic]] and structural characteristics of numerous spoken [[dialect]]s. In an article written about 1873 and published later, he offered a solution to existing disagreements about dialect frontiers and proposed a new linguistic region. He placed it between the ''[[langues d'oïl]]'' group of languages (''Franco'') and the [[Occitan language|''langues d'oc'']] group (''Provençal'') and gave Franco-Provençal its name.

Ascoli (1878, p.&amp;nbsp;61) described the language in these terms in his defining essay on the subject:
{{quote|text=« ''Chiamo'' franco-provenzale ''un tipo idiomatico, il quale insieme riunisce, con alcuni caratteri specifici, più altri caratteri, che parte son comuni al francese, parte lo sono al provenzale, e non proviene già da una confluenza di elementi diversi, ma bensì attesta sua propria indipendenza istorica, non guari dissimili da quella per cui fra di loro si distinguono gli altri principali tipi neo-latini.'' »}}
{{quote|text="I call ''Franco-Provençal'' a type of language that brings together, along with some characteristics which are its own, characteristics partly in common with French, and partly in common with Provençal, and are not caused by a late confluence of diverse elements, but on the contrary, attests to its own historical independence, little different from those by which the principal neo-Latin [Romance] languages distinguish themselves from one another."}}

[[File:Parla-Gaga.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Title page of a Franco-Provençal dictionary from Saint-Étienne, France (1896): "The Key to the Gaga Dialect".]]
Although the name '''Franco-Provençal''' appears misleading, it continues to be used in most scholarly journals for the sake of continuity. Suppression of the hyphen between the two parts of the language name in French (''francoprovençal'') was generally adopted following a conference at the [[University of Neuchâtel]] in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Marzys, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; however, most English journals continue to use the traditional spelling.

The name '''Romand''' has been in use regionally in Switzerland at least since 1494, when notaries in [[Fribourg]] were directed to write their minutes in both [[German language|German]] and ''Rommant''. It continues to appear in the names of many Swiss cultural organizations today. The term "Romand" is also used by some professional linguists who feel that the compound word "Franco-Provençal" is "inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;Dalby, 1999/2000, p.&amp;nbsp;402&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal in the 1960s to call the language '''Burgundian''' (French: ''"burgondien"'') did not take hold, mainly because of the potential for confusion with an [[Oïl language|Oïl dialect]] known as [[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Burgundian]], which is spoken in a neighbouring area, known internationally as [[Burgundy]] ({{lang-fr|Bourgogne}}). Other areas also had historical or political claims to such names, especially  (Meune, 2007).

Some contemporary speakers and writers prefer the name '''Arpitan''' because it underscores the independence of the language and does not imply a union to any other established linguistic group. "Arpitan" is derived from an indigenous word meaning "alpine" ("mountain highlands").&lt;ref&gt;Bessat &amp; Germi, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized in the 1980s by Mouvement [[Harpitanya]], a political organization in the [[Aosta Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arpitania.forumactif.com/CAFE-ARPITAN-c1/L-euroregion-Arpitanie-f1/La-nation-Arpitane-J-Harriet-1974-t581.htm J. Harriet (1974), "L'ethnie valdôtaine n'a jamais existe... elle n'est que partie de l'ethnie harpitane" in ''La nation Arpitane''], image of original article posted at Arpitania.eu, 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the term lost its particular political context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.regionleman.com/public/Arpitanie/Histoire_Arpitanie_24heures.pdf Nos ancêtres les Arpitans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171257/http://blog.regionleman.com/public/Arpitanie/Histoire_Arpitanie_24heures.pdf |date=15 July 2011 }}, 24 Heures, Lausanne, 2 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Aliance Culturèla Arpitana'' (Arpitan Cultural Alliance) is currently advancing the cause for the name "Arpitan" through the Internet, publishing efforts and other activities. The organization was founded in 2004 by Stéphanie Lathion and Alban Lavy in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, and is now based in Fribourg.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Rime, "L'afére Pecârd, c'est Tintin en patois vaudois," ''Quotidien'' (Lausanne), ''"24 heures"'', 19 March 2007; p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[SIL International|SIL]] adopted the name "Arpitan" as the primary name of the language in [[ISO 639-3]], with "Francoprovençal" as an additional name form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=frp Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: frp]. Accessed 11 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is called '''''patouès''''' (patois) or '''''nosta moda''''' ("our way [of speaking]") by native speakers. Some Savoyard speakers call their language '''''sarde'''''. This is a colloquial term used because their ancestors were subjects of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] ruled by the [[House of Savoy]] until [[Savoie]] and [[Haute-Savoie]] were annexed by France in 1860. The language is called '''''gaga''''' in the [[Forez]] region of France and appears in the titles of dictionaries and other regional publications. ''Gaga'' (and the adjective ''gagasse'') comes from a local name for the residents of [[Saint-Étienne]], popularized by Auguste Callet's story "''La légende des Gagats''" published in 1866.

== Geographic distribution ==
[[File:Francoprovencal-Geo-Map-1.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Language area map with standard place names and modern political divisions.]]
The historical linguistic domain of the Franco-Provençal language includes the following areas (also see: Jochnowitz, 1973):

=== Italy ===
* [[Aosta Valley]] (place name in [[Valdôtain dialect|Valdôtain patois]]: ''Val d'Outa''; in Italian: ''Valle d'Aosta''; in French: ''Vallée d'Aoste''), with the exception of the [[Walser]] valley in [[Gressoney-Saint-Jean]], [[Gressoney-La-Trinité]] and [[Issime]] ([[Lys (torrente)|Lys valley]]).

: Note: The southernmost valleys of Piedmont speak [[Occitan]].

* two enclaves in the [[Province of Foggia]], [[Apulia]] region in the southern [[Apennine Mountains]]: the villages of [[Faeto]] and [[Celle di San Vito]] ([[:it:Minoranza francoprovenzale in Puglia|it]]).&lt;ref&gt;there are various hypotheses about their origins, possibly dating from 1200-1400, e.g. remnants of troops of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles d'Anjou]], according to Michele Melillo, "Intorno alle probabili sedi originarie delle colonie francoprovenzali di Celle e Faeto", ''Revue de Linguistique Romaine'', XXIII, (1959), pp. 1-34, or [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] refugees according to Pierre Gilles, ''Histoire ecclesiastique des églises reformées recueillies en quelques Valées de Piedmont, autrefois appelées Vaudoises'', Paris, 1643, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
* the major part of [[Rhône-Alpes]] and [[Franche-Comté]] regions, which includes the following [[département in France|départements]]: [[Jura (département)|Jura]] (southern two-thirds), [[Doubs]] (southern third), [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Savoie]], [[Isère]] (except the southern edge), [[Rhône (département)|Rhône]], [[Drôme]] (extreme north), [[Ardèche]] (extreme north), [[Loire]], [[Ain]], and [[Saône-et-Loire]] (southern edge).

=== Switzerland ===
* most of [[Romandie]] (Suisse-Romande) area including the following [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]: [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] (Genève/Genf), [[Vaud]], the lower part of [[Valais]] (Wallis), [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] (Freiburg), and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]]. Note: [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], and the northern valleys of the non-German-speaking parts of [[Canton of Berne|Berne]] linguistically belong to the ''Langue d'Oïl''.

== Number of speakers ==
[[File:Fete internationale de l'arpitan francoprovencal saint-etienne.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Conference hall at the 37th ''Fête internationale de l'arpitan'', Saint-Etienne (France), 2016.]]
The Franco-Provençal dialect with the greatest population of active daily speakers is [[Valdôtain]]. Approximately 68,000 people speak the language in the [[Aosta Valley]] region of Italy according to reports conducted after the 2003 census.&lt;ref name="fondchanoux.org"&gt;[http://www.fondchanoux.org/ Sondage linguistique de la Fondation] [[Émile Chanoux]]&lt;/ref&gt; The alpine valleys of the adjacent province of Turin have an estimated 22,000 speakers. The [[Faetar]] and [[Cigliàje]] dialect is spoken by just 1,400 speakers who live in an isolated pocket of the province of Foggia in the southern Italian Apulia region (figures for Italy: EUROPA, 2005). Beginning in 1951, heavy emigration from the town of Celle Di San Vito established the Cigliàje variety of this dialect in [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], Canada, where, at its peak, it was used daily by several hundred people.  As of 2012 this community has dwindled to fewer than 50 daily speakers across three generations.

Contrary to official information reported by the European Commission, a poll by the Fondation Émile Chanoux in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondchanoux.org/site/pages/sondage.asp Fondation Émile Chanoux: Sondage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607163340/http://www.fondchanoux.org/site/pages/sondage.asp |date=7 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that only 15% of all Aosta Valley residents claimed Franco-Provençal as their mother tongue, a substantial reduction to the figures reported on the Italian census 20 years earlier that was used in the commission report, though 55.77% said they know Franco-provençal and 50.53% said they know French, Franco-provençal and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Assessorat de l'éducation et la culture - Département de la surintendance des écoles, ''Profil de la politique linguistique éducative'', Le Château éd., 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This opened a discussion about the concept of mother tongue when concerning a dialect, therefore confirming the fact that the Aosta Valley is the only area where franco-provençal is actively spoken nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandro Barbero]] in ''Une Vallée d'Aoste bilingue dans une Europe plurilingue'', Aoste (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; A report published by [[Université Laval|Laval University]] in [[Quebec City]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/europe/italieaoste.htm TLFQ: Vallée d'Aoste]&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzed this data, reports that it is "probable" that the language will be "on the road to extinction" in this region in ten years. The most recent edition of [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=frp ethnologue.com] (Lewis, 2009) reports that there are 70,000 Franco-Provençal speakers in Italy. However, these figures are derived from the 1971 census.

In rural areas of the cantons of Valais and Fribourg in Switzerland, various dialects are spoken as a second language by about 7,000 residents (figures for Switzerland: Lewis, 2009). In the other cantons of Romandie where Franco-Provençal dialects used to be spoken, they are now all but extinct.

Until the mid-19th century, Franco-Provençal dialects were the most widely spoken language in their domain in France. Today, regional vernaculars are limited to a small number of speakers in secluded towns. A 2002 report by the INED (''Institut national d'études démographiques'') states that the language loss by generation: "the proportion of fathers who did not usually speak to their 5-year-old children in the language that their own father usually spoke in to them at the same age" was 90%. This was a greater loss than any other language in France, a loss called "critical." The report estimated that fewer than 15,000 speakers in France were handing down some knowledge of Franco-Provençal to their children (figures for France: Héran, Filhon, &amp; Deprez, 2002; figure 1, 1-C, p.&amp;nbsp;2).

== Linguistic structure ==
Note: The overview in this section follows Martin (2005), with all Franco-Provençal examples written in accordance with ''Orthographe de référence B'' (see "Orthography" section, below).

=== Typology and syntax ===
* Franco-Provençal is a [[synthetic language]], as are Occitan and Italian. Most verbs have different endings for person, number, and tenses, making the use of the pronoun optional; thus, two grammatical functions are bound together. However, the second person singular verb form regularly requires an appropriate pronoun for distinction.
* The standard word order for Franco-Provençal is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) form in a declarative [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], for example: ''Vos côsâds anglès.'' ("You speak English."), except when the object is a pronoun, in which case the word order is [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV). [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO) form is standard word order for an interrogative sentence, for example: ''Côsâds-vos anglès ?'' ("Do you speak English?")

=== Morphology ===
Franco-Provençal has [[grammar]] similar to that of other Romance languages.

* [[article (grammar)|Articles]] have three forms: definite, indefinite, and partitive. Plural definite articles [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in gender with the noun to which they refer, unlike French. Partitive articles are used with [[mass noun]]s.

|-
|| '''Singular''' || ''lo'' || ''la'' || ''on'' || ''na''
|-
|| '''Plural''' || ''los'' || ''les'' || ''des / de'' || ''des / de''
|}

: Articles precede women's [[given name]]s during [[conversation]]: ''la Foëse'' (Françoise/Frances), ''la Mya'' (Marie), ''la Jeânna'' (Jeanne/Jane), ''la Peronne'' (Pierrette), ''la Mauriza'' (Mauricette/Maurisa), ''la Daude'' (Claude/Claudia), ''la Génie'' (Eugénie/Eugenia); however, articles never precede men's names: ''Fanfoué'' (François), ''Dian'' (Jean/John), ''Guste'' (Auguste), ''Zèbe'' (Eusèbe/Eusebius), ''Ouiss'' (Louis), ''Mile'' (Émile).

* [[Noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] by number and gender. Inflection by [[grammatical number]] (singular and plural) is clearly distinguished in feminine nouns, but not masculine nouns, where pronunciation is generally identical for those words ending with a vowel.
: To assist comprehension of written words, modern orthographers of the language have added an "'''s'''" to most plural nouns that is not reflected in speech. For example:
:: ''codo'' (masculine singular): {{IPA|[ˈkodo]}} {{IPA|[ˈkodu]}} {{IPA|[ˈkodə]}},
:: ''codos'' (masculine plural): {{IPA|[ˈkodo]}} {{IPA|[ˈkodu]}} {{IPA|[ˈkodə]}} (note: In Italy, ''codo'' is occasionally used for both singular and plural).
:: ''pôrta'' (feminine singular): {{IPA|[ˈpɔrtɑ]}} {{IPA|[ˈpurtɑ]}},
:: ''pôrtas'' (feminine plural): {{IPA|[ˈpɔrte]}} {{IPA|[ˈpurte]}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔrtɛ]}} {{IPA|[ˈpurtɛ]}} {{IPA|[ˈpɔrtɑ]}} {{IPA|[ˈpurtɑ]}} (note: In Italy, ''pôrte'' is occasionally seen).

:In general, inflection by [[grammatical gender]] (masculine and feminine) is the same as for French nouns, however, there are many exceptions. A few examples follow:

|}

* [[Pronoun|Subject pronouns]] agree in person, number, gender, and case. Although the subject pronoun is usually retained in speech, Franco-Provençal – unlike French or English – is a partially [[pro-drop language]] ([[null subject language]]), especially in first-person singular. Masculine and feminine third-person singular pronouns are notable for the extremely wide variation in pronunciation from region to region. Impersonal subjects, such as weather and time, take the neuter pronoun "'''o'''" (and/or "'''el'''", a regional variant used before a word beginning with a vowel), which is analogous to "it" in English.
* [[Object (grammar)|Direct and indirect object pronouns]] also agree in person, number, gender, and case. However, unlike subject pronouns, third person singular and plural have neuter forms, in addition to masculine and feminine forms.
* [[Possessive pronoun]]s and [[possessive adjective]]s agree in person, number, gender, and case (masculine singular and plural forms are noteworthy because of their extremely wide variation in pronunciation from area to area).
* [[Relative pronoun]]s have one invariable form.
* [[Adjective]]s agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify.
* [[Adverb]]s are invariable; that is, they are not inflected, unlike nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
* [[Verb]]s form three grammatical conjugation classes, each of which are further split into two subclasses. Each [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] is different, formed by isolating the [[verb]] stem and adding an ending determined by mood, tense, voice, and number. Verbs are inflected in four [[mood (linguistics)|moods]]: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[Conditional mood|conditional]]; and two impersonal moods: [[infinitive]] and [[participle]], which includes verbal adjectives.

::Verbs in Group 1a end in '''-ar''' (''côsar'', "to speak"; ''chantar'', "to sing"); Group 1b end in '''-ier''' (''mengier'', "to eat"); Groups 2a &amp; 2b end in '''-ir''' (''finir'', "to finish"; ''venir'', "to come"), Group 3a end in '''-êr''' (''dêvêr'', "to owe"), and Group 3b end in '''-re''' (''vendre'', "to sell").
::Auxiliary verbs are: ''avêr'' (to have) and ''étre'' (to be).

=== Phonology ===
* The placement of stressed [[syllable]]s in the spoken language is a primary characteristic of Franco-Provençal that distinguishes it from French and Occitan. Franco-Provençal words take stress on the last syllable, as in French, or on the penultimate syllable, unlike French.
* Franco-Provençal also preserves final vowel sounds, in particular "'''a'''" in feminine forms and "'''o'''" in masculine forms (where it is pronounced "'''ou'''" in some regions.) The word ''portar'' is pronounced {{IPA|[pɔrˈtɑ]}} or {{IPA|[pɔrˈto]}}, with accent on the final "'''a'''" or "'''o'''", but ''rousa'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈruːzɑ]}}, with accent on the "'''ou'''".
* [[Vowel]]s followed by [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]] "'''m'''" and "'''n'''" are normally nasalized in a similar manner to those in French, for example, '''chantar''' and '''vin''' in Franco-Provençal, and "chanter" and "vin" in French. However, in the largest part of the Franco-Provençal domain, [[nasal vowel|nasalized vowels]] retain a timbre that more closely approaches the un-nasalized vowel sound than in French, for example, '''pan''' {{IPA|[pɑ̃]}} and '''vent''' {{IPA|[vɛ̃]}} in Franco-Provençal, compared to "pain" {{IPA|[pɛ̃]}} and "vent" {{IPA|[vɑ̃]}} in French.

=== Orthography ===
Franco-Provençal does not have a standard [[orthography]]. Most proposals use the [[Latin script]] and four [[diacritic]]s: the [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[circumflex]], and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis (trema)]], while the [[cedilla]] and the [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] {{angle bracket|[[œ]]}} found in French are omitted.

* Aimé Chenal and [[Raymond Vautherin]] wrote the first comprehensive grammar and dictionary for any variety of Franco-Provençal. Their landmark effort greatly expands upon the work by [[Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne]] begun in the 19th century on the [[Valdôtain dialect|Valdôtain]] (Valdotèn) dialect of the [[Aosta Valley]]. It was published in twelve volumes from 1967 to 1982.
* The [[Bureau régional pour l'ethnologie et la linguistique]] (BREL) in [[Aosta]] and the [[Centre d'études franco-provençales]] « [[René Willien]] » (CEFP) in [[Saint-Nicolas, Aosta Valley|Saint-Nicolas]], Italy, have created a similar orthography that is actively promoted by their organizations. It is also based on work by [[Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne]], with several modifications.
* An orthographic method called ''La Graphie de Conflans'' has achieved fairly wide acceptance among speakers residing in Bresse and Savoy. Since it was first proposed by the Groupe de Conflans of Albertville, France in 1983, it has appeared in many published works. This method perhaps most closely follows the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], omitting extraneous letters found in other historical and contemporary proposals. It features the use of a [[Combining low line|combining low line (underscore)]] as a diacritic to indicate a stressed vowel in the [[penult]] when it occurs, for example: ''t&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;ma'', ''déss&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;ta''.
* A recent standard entitled ''Orthographe de référence B'' (ORB) was proposed by linguist Dominique Stich with his dictionary published by Editions Le Carré in 2003. (This is an emendation of his previous work published by Editions l'Harmattan in 1998.) His standard strays from close representation of Franco-Provençal phonology in favor of following French orthographic conventions, with silent letters and clear vestiges of Latin roots. However, it attempts to unify several written forms and is easiest for French speakers to read. — Note: Stich's dictionary for ORB is noteworthy because it includes [[neologism]]s by Xavier Gouvert for things found in modern life, such as: ''encafâblo'' for "cell phone" (from ''encafar'', "to put into a pocket"), ''pignochière'' for "fast-food" (from ''pignochiér'', "to nibble"), ''panètes'' for "corn flakes" (from ''panet'', "maize, corn"), and ''mâchelyon'' for "chewing gum".

The table below compares a few words in each writing system, with French and English for reference. (Sources: Esprit Valdôtain (download 7 March 2007), C.C.S. Conflans (1995), and Stich (2003).

=== Numerals ===
Franco-Provençal uses a [[decimal]] counting system. The numbers "1", "2", and "4" have masculine and feminine forms (Duplay, 1896; Viret, 2006).

0) ''zérô''; 1) ''yon'' &lt;small&gt;(masc.)&lt;/small&gt;, ''yona / yena'' &lt;small&gt;(fem.)&lt;/small&gt;; 2) ''dos'' &lt;small&gt;(masc.)&lt;/small&gt;, ''does / doves / davè'' &lt;small&gt;(fem.)&lt;/small&gt;; 3) ''três''; 4) ''quatro'' &lt;small&gt;(masc.)&lt;/small&gt;, ''quat / quatrè'' &lt;small&gt;(fem.)&lt;/small&gt;; 5) ''cinq''; 6) ''siéx''; 7) ''sèpt''; 8) ''huét''; 9) ''nô''; 10) ''diéx''; 11) ''onze'''; 12) ''doze''; 13) ''trèze''; 14) ''quatôrze''; 15) ''quinze''; 16) ''sèze''; 17) ''dix-sèpt''; 18) ''dix-huét''; 19) ''dix-nou''; 20) ''vengt''; 21) ''vengt-yon'' / ''vengt-et-yona''; 22) ''vengt-dos'' … 30) ''trenta''; 40) ''quaranta''; 50) ''cinquanta''; 60) ''souessanta''; 70) ''sèptanta''; 80) ''huétanta''; 90) ''nonanta''; 100) ''cent''; 1000) ''mila''; 1,000,000) ''on milyon / on milyona''.

Many western dialects use a [[vigesimal]] (base-20) form for "80", that is, ''quatro-vingt'' {{IPA|/katroˈvɛ̃/}}, possibly due to the influence of French.

== Word comparisons ==
The chart below compares words in Franco-Provençal to those in selected Romance languages, with English for reference.

Between vowels, the Latinate "'''p'''" became "'''v'''", "'''c'''" and "'''g'''" became "'''y'''", and "'''t'''" and "'''d'''" disappeared. Franco-Provençal also softened the hard [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatized]] "'''c'''" and "'''g'''" before "'''a'''". This led Franco-Provençal to evolve down a different path from Occitan and Gallo-Iberian languages, closer to the evolutionary direction taken by French.

Classification of Franco-Provençal [[dialect]] divisions is challenging. Each canton and valley uses its own vernacular without standardization. Difficult intelligibility among dialects was noted as early as 1807 by Grillet.

The dialects are divided into eight distinct categories or groups. Six ''dialect groups'' comprising 41 ''dialect idioms'' for the Franco-Provençal language have been identified and documented by [[Linguasphere Observatory|Linguasphere Observatory (Observatoire Linguistique)]] (Dalby, 1999/2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;402–403). Only two dialect groups – Lyonnaise and Dauphinois-N. – were recorded as having fewer than 1,000 speakers each. Linguasphere has not listed any dialect idiom as "extinct", however, many are highly endangered. A seventh isolated dialect group, consisting of [[Faetar]] (also known as "Cigliàje" or "Cellese"), has been analyzed by Nagy (2000). The Piedmont dialects need further study.

== Toponyms ==
Other than in [[family name]]s, the Franco-Provençal legacy survives primarily in [[placename]]s. Many are immediately recognizable, ending in -az, -o(t)z, -uz, -ax, -ex, -ux, -ou(l)x, -aulx, and -ieu(x). These suffixes are vestiges of an old medieval orthographic practice indicating the stressed syllable of a word. In polysyllables, 'z' indicates a [[paroxytone]] (stress on penultimate syllable) and 'x' indicates an [[oxytone]] (stress on last syllable). So, Chanaz {{IPA-fr|/ˈʃɑ.nɑ/|}} (''&lt;u&gt;sha&lt;/u&gt;na'') but Chênex {{IPA-fr|/ʃɛˈne/|}} (''shè&lt;u&gt;né&lt;/u&gt;''). The following is a list of all such toponyms:

== Literature ==
[[File:Noues-III.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Text of a carol about the appearance of a comet in 1682 by Jean Chapelon.]]
A long tradition of Franco-Provençal literature exists, although no prevailing written form of the language has materialized. An early 12th century fragment containing 105 verses from a poem about [[Alexander the Great]] may be the earliest known work in the language. ''[[Girart de Roussillon]]'', an epic with 10,002 lines from the mid-12th century,{{Contradict-inline|article=Girart de Roussillon#Romance|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- Apparently, there are two different extant medieval works on the same subject matter: a ''chanson de geste'' from the 12th century and a romance from the 14th, which is asserted to be in a dialect midway between French and Old Occitan, which would mean that the 14th-century romance is referred to here, not the chanson de geste. Or, possibly, there is no contradiction in the first place: The chanson de geste is in Early Franco-Provençal, and the romance is in a mixed French/Occitan dialect. --&gt; has been asserted to be Franco-Provençal. It certainly contains prominent Franco-Provençal features, although the editor of an authoritative edition of this work claims that the language is a mixture of French and Occitan forms.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A significant document from the same period containing a list of vassals in the County of Forez also is not without literary value.

Among the first historical writings in Franco-Provençal are legal texts by [[civil law notary|civil law notaries]] that appeared in the 13th century as Latin was being abandoned for official administration. These include a translation of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' (known as the ''[[Justinian Code]]'') in the vernacular spoken in Grenoble. Religious works also were translated and conceived in Franco-Provençal dialects at some monasteries in the region. ''[[Bartholomew|The Legend of Saint Bartholomew]]'' is one such work that survives in Lyonnais patois from the 13th century.

[[Marguerite d'Oingt]] (ca. 1240–1310), [[prioress]] of a [[Carthusian]] nunnery near [[Mionnay]] (France), composed two remarkable sacred texts in her native Lyonnais dialect, in addition to her writings in Latin. The first, entitled ''Speculum ''("The Mirror"), describes three [[miracle|miraculous]] [[vision (religion)|visions]] and their meanings. The other work, ''Li Via seiti Biatrix, virgina de Ornaciu'' ("The Life of the Blessed Virgin [[Beatrix d'Ornacieux]]"), is a long biography of a [[nun]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] consecrated to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] whose faith lead to a devout cult. This text contributed to the [[beatification]] of the nun more than 500 years later by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], See: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02375a.htm Beatrix: VI. Blessed Beatrix of Ornacieux]&lt;/ref&gt; A line from the work in her dialect follows:&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Renate (1997).

Religious conflicts in [[Geneva]] between [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Reformers and staunch [[Catholics]], supported by the Duchy of Savoy, brought forth many texts in Franco-Provençal during the early 17th century. One of the best known is ''Cé qu'è lainô'' ("The One Above"), which was composed by an unknown writer in 1603. The long narrative poem describes [[l'Escalade]], a raid by the Savoyard army that generated patriotic sentiments. It became the unofficial national anthem of the [[Canton of Geneva|Republic of Geneva]]. The first three verses follow below (in [[Geneva|Genevois]] dialect)&lt;ref&gt;[http://hypo.ge-dip.etat-ge.ch/www/athena/helvetia/cqlaino.html ''Cé qu'è lainô''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223012326/http://hypo.ge-dip.etat-ge.ch/www/athena/helvetia/cqlaino.html |date=23 December 2007 }}, Complete text of 68 verses in Franco-Provençal and French.&lt;/ref&gt; with a translation:

Several writers created [[satire|satirical]], [[morality|moralistic]], [[poem|poetic]], [[comedy|comic]], and [[theater|theatrical]] texts during the era that followed, which indicates the vitality of the language at that time. These include: [[Bernardin Uchard]] (1575–1624), [[author]] and [[playwright]] from [[Bresse]]; [[Henri Perrin]], comic playwright from Lyon; [[Jean Millet]] (1600?–1675), author of [[pastoral]]s, poems, and comedies from Grenoble; [[Jacques Brossard de Montaney]] (1638–1702), writer of comedies and [[Carol (music)|carols]] from Bresse; [[Jean Chapelon]] (1647–1694), priest and composer of more than 1,500 carols, songs, epistles, and essays from [[Saint-Étienne]]; and [[François Blanc dit la Goutte]] (1690–1742), writer of [[prose]] poems, including ''Grenoblo maléirou'' about the great flood of 1733 in Grenoble. 19th century authors include [[Guillaume Roquille]] (1804–1860), working-class poet from Rive-de-Gier near Saint-Chamond, [[Joseph Béard dit l'Éclair]] (1805–1872), physician, poet, and songwriter from Rumilly, and [[Louis Bornet]] (1818–1880) of Gruyères. [[Clair Tisseur]] (1827–1896), architect of [[Église du Bon-Pasteur|Bon-Pasteur Church]] in Lyon, published many writings under the pen name "Nizier du Puitspelu". These include a popular dictionary and humorous works in Lyonnaise dialect that have reprinted for more than 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Tout sur la langue des gones", ''Lyon Capitale'', N° 399, 30 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amelie Gex 2.jpg|thumb|110px|left|[[Amélie Gex]]]]
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne]] originating from [[Saint-Nicolas, Aosta Valley]]]]
[[Amélie Gex]] (1835–1883) wrote in her native ''patois'' as well as [[French language|French]]. She was a passionate advocate for her language. Her literary efforts encompassed lyrical themes, work, love, tragic loss, nature, the passing of time, religion, and politics, and are considered by many to be the most significant contributions to the literature. Among her works are: ''Reclans de Savoué'' ("Echos from Savoy", 1879), ''Lo cent ditons de Pierre d'Emo'' ("One Hundred Sayings by Pierre du Bon-Sens", 1879), ''Poesies'' ("Poems", 1880), ''Vieilles gens et vieilles choses: Histoires de ma rue et de mon village'' ("Old people and old things: Stories from my street and from my village", 1889), ''Fables'' (1898), and ''Contio de la Bova'' ("Tales from the Cowshed").

The writings of the ''abbé'' [[Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne]] (1826–1910) are credited with reestablishing the cultural identity of the Aosta Valley. His early poetry includes: ''L'infan prodeggo'' (1855), ''Marenda a Tsesalet'' (1856) and ''La bataille di vatse a Vertosan'' (1858); among his scholarly works are: ''Petite grammaire du dialecte valdotain'' (1893), ''Dictionnaire du dialecte valdôtain'' (1908) and ''Le patois valdotain: son origine litéraire et sa graphie'' (1909). The [http://www.regione.vda.it/cultura/eventi/concours_cerlogne/default_i.asp Concours Cerlogne] – an annual event named in his honor – has focused thousands of Italian students on preserving the region's language, literature, and heritage since 1963.

At the end of the 19th century, regional dialects of Franco-Provençal were disappearing due to the expansion of the French language into all walks of life and the emigration of rural people to urban centers. Cultural and regional savant societies began to collect oral [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[proverb]]s, and [[legend]]s from native speakers in an effort that continues to today. Numerous works have been published.

[[Prosper Convert]] (1852–1934), the bard of Bresse; [[Louis Mercier]] (1870–1951), [[folk music|folk singer]] and author of more than twelve volumes of prose from Coutouvre near [[Roanne]]; [[Just Songeon]] (1880–1940), author, poet, and activist from La Combe, Sillingy near [[Annecy]]; [[Eugénie Martinet]] (1896–1983), poet from [[Aosta]]; and [[Joseph Yerly]] (1896–1961) of [[Gruyères]] whose complete works were published in ''Kan la têra tsantè'' ("When the earth sang"), are well known for their use of patois in the 20th century.
Louis des Ambrois de Nevache, from Upper Susa Valley, transcribed popular songs and wrote some original poetry in local
patois.
There are compositions in the current language on the album Enfestar, an artistic project from Piedmont &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soundcloud: Enfestar|title=Album Enfestar, Blu l'azard|url=https://soundcloud.com/blu-lazard/sets/enfestar-blu-lazard|website=Soundcloud|accessdate=17 November 2015|ref=https://soundcloud.com/blu-lazard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

("The cheese that killed!"), from the ''Fanfoué des Pnottas'' series by Félix Meynet, appeared in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Meynet, Félix (Illustrations) &amp; Roman, Pascal (Text).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">[[File:Angola Ethnic map 1970.svg|thumb|Ethnic groups of Angola 1970 (The areas where "Ganguela" groups are dominant are marked green)]]
'''Ganguela''' (pronunciation: gang'ela) or '''Nganguela''' is the name of a small ethnic group living in [[Angola]], but since colonial times the term has been applied to a number of peoples East of the [[Bié Plateau]]. In addition to the Nganguela proper, this ethnographic category includes the Lwena (Luena), the Luvale, the Mbunda, the Lwimbi, the Camachi and others.&lt;ref&gt;José Redinha, ''Etnias e culturas de Angola'', Luanda: Instituto de Investigação Científica de Angola, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these peoples live on subsistence agriculture, the rearing of small animals, and from gathering wild fruit, honey and other foods. Each group has its own language, although these are related among themselves. Each group also has its own [[social identity]]; there exists no overarching social identity encompassing them all, so that one cannot speak of these groups as one people divided into subgroups.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The peoples called "Ganguela" have been known to the Portuguese since the 17th century, when they became involved in the commercial activities developed by the colonial bridgeheads of [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]] which existed at that time. On the one hand, many of the slaves bought by the Portuguese from African middlemen came from these people.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Miller: ''Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1839'', Madison: Wisconsin University Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the 19th and early 20th century the "Ganguela" peoples furnished wax, honey, ivory and others good for the caravan trade organised by the Ovimbundu for the Portuguese in Benguela.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Pössinger, ''A transformação da sociedade umbundu desde o colapso do comércio das caravanas'', ''Revista Internacional de Estudos Africanos'' (Lisbon), 4/5, 1986, pp. 75-158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the caravan trade, the "Ganguela" were for long — in fact until the very end of the colonial period — of little interest for the Portuguese. This is why they were relatively late subjected to a colonial occupation to which — with the exception of the Mbunda — they offered near to no serious resistance.&lt;ref&gt;René Pélissier: ''Les Guerres grises: Résistance et revoltes en Angola (1845-1941)'', Montamets/Orgeval: Éditions Pélissier, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the few decades under colonial rule, their way of life changed less than in most other regions of Angola. As a rule, they were neither the object of systematic missionary work, nor subject to heavy tax levy or the recruitment as paid labour. The only important economic activity developed by the Portuguese in their area was the production of timber, for factories in Angola or in Portugal.

During the anti-colonial war, 1961–1974, and especially during the [[Civil War In Angola|Civil War in Angola]], some of these groups were affected to a greater or lesser degree, although their active involvement was rather limited.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Davidson: ''In the Eye of the Storm: Angola’s People'', New York: Doubleday, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;;&lt;ref&gt; Samuel Chiwale, ''Cruzei-me com a história'', Lisbon: Sextante, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Inge Brinkman, ''A War for People: Civilians, Mobility and Legitimacy in South-East Angola during the MPLA's War for Independence'', Cologne: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, many took refuge in neighbouring Zambia and (to a lesser degree) Namibia. In particular, almost half of the Mbunda settled in Western Zambia, but this people maintains an overall cohesion through their traditional authorities both in Angola and Zambia.

'''Guardians of Liberty''' is a three volume set of books published in 1943 by [[Bishop]] [[Alma Bridwell White]], author of over 35 books and founder of the [[Pillar of Fire Church]]. Guardians of Liberty is primarily devoted to summarizing White’s vehement [[anti-Catholicism]] under the guise of patriotism. White also defends her historical support of and association with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while significantly but not completely distancing herself from the Klan. Each of the three volumes corresponds to one of the three books White published in the 1920s promoting the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and her political views which in addition to [[anti-Catholicism]] also included [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[anti-Semitism]] and [[white supremacy]]. In ''Guardians of Liberty'', White removed most, but not all of the direct references to the Klan that had existed in her three 1920s books, both in the text and in the illustrations. In Volumes I and II, she removed most of the nativist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology that had appeared in her predecessor books. However, in ''Guardians'' Volume III, she did retain edited versions of chapters promoting nativism, anti-Semitism and white supremecy. 86% of the Liberal party joined the movement in 1943.

Like their predecessor books, each of the volumes is primarily a compendium of essays and sermons written by White and of illustrations by Reverend [[Branford Clarke]]. Most of the text and illustrations had originally been published in the pro-[[Ku Klux Klan]] political periodical ''[[The Good Citizen]]'', one of the numerous periodicals published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] at their communal headquarters in [[Zarephath, New Jersey]]. The Pillar of Fire ceased publication of ''[[The Good Citizen]]'' in 1933. ''Guardians'' was published when White was 81 years old, three years before her death, and one year before the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] declared bankruptcy.

==Volume I==
Volume one of ''Guardians of Liberty'' was an edited reprint of White’s 1925 book ''[[The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy]].'' Of the 13 chapters in ''Guardians'' Vol. I, 7 are edited chapters from ''KKK in Prophecy'', and one chapter is from ''[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]]'' (1928).&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Susie Cunningham Stanley]]  |coauthors= |title=Feminist Pillar of Fire: The Life of Alma White |year=1993 |publisher=[[The Pilgrim Press]] |quote=Seven chapters from The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy and one from Heroes of the Fiery Cross are reprinted in volume 1 of Guardians of Liberty. ... Volume 2 of Guardians of Liberty consists of fifteen chapters, thirteen from Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty and one from The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy. ...| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88paAAAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=0-8298-0950-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional chapter, ''Rome’s Political Defeat'' defends the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] and its members' role in two violent incidents that occurred near [[Zarephath, New Jersey]], the church's headquarters.

It is devoted nearly entirely to promoting White's deeply held fears and hatred of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and of Roman Catholic individuals. Most of the material promoting anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy that had originally been published in ''KKK in Prophecy'' was omitted in ''Guardians'' Vol. I, although some more-subtle reference were still included. Furthermore, most but not all of the references to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were either removed or substituted with the following euphemisms: Patriots, Patriots in White Robes, Our Patriots, Our American Patriots, 100-Per Cent Americans, A Great Patriotic Organization, Invisible Empire, Freedom, Liberty, The Star of Hope, and Our Guardians of Liberty. Two illustrations with Klan images were retained and included in ''Guardians'' Vol. 1.

==Volume II==
Volume two of Guardians of Liberty contains fifteen chapters, thirteen are from [[Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty]] and one from [[The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy]].&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt;

'''Guiyang Miao''', also known as '''Guiyang Hmong''', is a [[Miao languages|Miao language]] of China. It is named after [[Guiyang]] County, Guizhou, though not all varieties are spoken there. The endonym is ''Hmong'', a name it shares with the [[Hmong language]].

==Classification==
Guiyang was given as a subgroup of [[Western Hmongic]] in Wang (1985).&lt;ref&gt;王辅世主编，《苗语简志》，民族出版社，1985年。&lt;/ref&gt; Matisoff (2001) separated the three varieties as distinct Miao languages, not forming a group. Wang (1994) adds another two minor, previously unclassified varieties.&lt;ref&gt;李云兵，《苗语方言划分遗留问题研究》，中央民族大学出版社，2000年。&lt;/ref&gt;

*Northern
*Southern
*Southwestern
*Northwestern (''Qianxi'' 黔西)
*Mid-Southern (''Ziyun'' 紫云)
[[Mo Piu language|Mo Piu]] may also be a variety of Guiyang Miao.

Representative dialects of Guiyang Miao include:&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, David (2004). “The Development of Tone Sandhi in Western Hmongic: A New Hypothesis”. Unpublished, UC Berkeley. http://www.pitt.edu/~drm31/development_whmongic_tone_sandhi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' reported that dozens of women accused American film producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] of [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] and [[sexual abuse]] over a period of at least 30 years. More than &lt;!-- Do not insert higher numbers without citing a reliable source backing it up --&gt;80 women in the [[film industry]] have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied "any non-consensual sex". Shortly after the local news stations reported Weinstein's allegations, he was dismissed from [[The Weinstein Company]], expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and other professional associations, and disappeared from public view.

Criminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York, charged with rape and other offenses, and released on bail.&lt;ref name="BBC News 25 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvey Weinstein charged with rape|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44257202|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Times'' and the ''New Yorker'' jointly won the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for their reporting on Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the [[hashtag]] [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]]. The scandal's impact on powerful men in various industries came to be called the "[[Weinstein effect]]". &lt;!-- References for the assertions in the lead are found in the article body, below. --&gt;

==Background==
Harvey Weinstein and his brother, [[Bob Weinstein]], formed the film production company [[Miramax]] and led the company from 1979 to 2005.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2003/04/max-weinstein-200304 |title=All Thanks to Max |last=Weinstein |first=Bob |date=April 2003 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=October 12, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205093233/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2003/04/max-weinstein-200304 |archivedate=December 5, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the Weinsteins founded [[The Weinstein Company]] (TWC) and departed from Miramax that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/10/12/weinstein-company-can-kiss-its-oscar-prospects-goodbye/ |title=The Weinstein Company Can Kiss Its Oscar Prospects Goodbye |last=Cain |first=Rob |work=[[Forbes]] |date=October 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 12, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012210845/https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/10/12/weinstein-company-can-kiss-its-oscar-prospects-goodbye/ |archivedate=October 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2005/03/weinsteins-leaving-miramax-will-form-new-company-brothers-taking-dimension-label-leaving-all-fil-78326/ |title=Weinstein's Leaving Miramax, Will Form New Company; Brothers Taking Dimension Label, Leaving All Film Libraries at Disney |last=Hernandez |first=Eugene |date=March 30, 2005 |publisher=IndieWire |accessdate=October 12, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013120422/http://www.indiewire.com/2005/03/weinsteins-leaving-miramax-will-form-new-company-brothers-taking-dimension-label-leaving-all-fil-78326/ |archivedate=October 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors of Harvey Weinstein's "[[casting couch]]" practices circulated in [[Hollywood]] for years, and entertainment figures at times alluded to them.&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Britzky|first1=Haley|title=The hints of Weinstein's behavior that went ignored|url=https://www.axios.com/the-previous-hints-of-harvey-weinsteins-behavior-2495642089.html|accessdate=October 14, 2017|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|date=October 14, 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044150/https://www.axios.com/the-previous-hints-of-harvey-weinsteins-behavior-2495642089.html|archivedate=October 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1998, [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] said on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that Weinstein "will coerce you to do a thing or two".&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"/&gt; In 2005, [[Courtney Love]] advised young actresses in an interview, "If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], don't go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/15/courtney-love-warned-actresses-harvey-weinstein-2005/ |title=Courtney Love warned actresses about Harvey Weinstein in 2005 |date=October 15, 2017 |accessdate=October 15, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015062849/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/15/courtney-love-warned-actresses-harvey-weinstein-2005/ |archivedate=October 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an article titled "Harvey's Girls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Enlow |first1=Courtney |title=Harvey's Girls |url=http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/harveys-girls-the-wouldbe-ingenues-where-are-they-now-and-what-happened-then.php |accessdate=October 14, 2017 |publisher=Pajiba |date=December 21, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904185344/http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/harveys-girls-the-wouldbe-ingenues-where-are-they-now-and-what-happened-then.php |archivedate=September 4, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Pajiba'' alluded to Weinstein's "casting couch" reputation: "Every few years, Harvey picks a new girl as his pet".&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"/&gt; In 2012, a character on the TV series ''[[30 Rock]]'' said: "I'm not afraid of anyone in show business, I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions, out of five."&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"/&gt; While announcing the 2013 nominees for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Award]], [[Seth MacFarlane]] joked: "Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein."&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"/&gt; After the allegations were published, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] said that he had known about Weinstein harassing actresses for decades, and had confronted him about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kantor|first1=Jodi|title=Tarantino on Weinstein: 'I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html|accessdate=November 4, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102013159/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html|archivedate=November 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivana Lowell wrote in her book ''Why Not Say What Happened?'', published in 2010, about misbehavior by Weinstein when she worked for the books division of Miramax. The incidents described were in her office when she was alone with Harvey Weinstein, and in her home when a female friend of hers was present. She wrote that she "knew about Harvey's reputation as a womanizer; tales of his trying to seduce every young actress in town were infamous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowell|first1=Ivana|title=Why Not Say What Happened?: A Memoir|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747595069|pages=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists wrote or attempted to write about Weinstein's alleged behavior. [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] found that no one allegedly assaulted by Weinstein would speak on the record; [[Ken Auletta]] and his editors decided that he could not mention an assault allegation without cooperation from the victim.&lt;ref name="nyt20171205"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Twohey|first1=Megan|last2=Kantor|first2=Jodi|last3=Dominus|first3=Susan|last4=Rutenberg|first4=Jim|last5=Eder|first5=Steve|title=Weinstein's Complicity Machine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/us/harvey-weinstein-complicity.html|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=The New York Times|date=5 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206003245/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/us/harvey-weinstein-complicity.html|archivedate=December 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jordan Sargent wrote in his [[Gawker]] article "Tell Us What You Know About Harvey Weinstein's 'Open Secret'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sargent |first1=Jordan |title=Tell Us What You Know About Harvey Weinstein's "Open Secret" |url=http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092 |accessdate=October 14, 2017 |publisher=Gawker |date=February 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016224720/http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092 |archivedate=October 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "rumors of the powerful producer leveraging his industry power for sexual satisfaction—consensual or otherwise—have tended to remain unaired, confined to hushed conversation and seedier gossip-blog comment threads."&lt;ref name="Axios October 14, 2017"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' later wrote that Weinstein had built a "wall of invulnerability", in part through his support of leading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians. He boasted of being friends with [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Barack Obama]]. The Clintons continued longstanding close relationships with him despite alleged warnings about Weinstein to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign from [[Lena Dunham]] and [[Tina Brown]].&lt;ref name="nyt20171205"/&gt;

In 2015 ''The New York Times'' reported that Weinstein was questioned by police "after a 22-year-old woman accused him of touching her inappropriately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santora |first1=Marc |last2=Baker |first2=Al |title=Harvey Weinstein, Producer, Questioned by New York Police After Groping Accusation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-producer-questioned-by-new-york-police-after-groping-accusation.html |accessdate=October 14, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 30, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014233641/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-producer-questioned-by-new-york-police-after-groping-accusation.html |archivedate=October 14, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman, Italian model [[Ambra Gutierrez]], cooperated with the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) to obtain an audio recording where Weinstein admitted to having inappropriately touched her.&lt;ref name="DAVance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gersen|first1=Jeannie Suk|title=Why Didn't the Manhattan D.A.

In July 2018, after many allegations and criminal charges of sexual misconduct, Greek journalist [[Taki Theodoracopulos]] reported in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that his friend Weinstein told him in an interview that "yes, I did offer them [girls] acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Theodoracopulos |first1=Taki |title=Harvey Weinstein: 'I offered acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so does everyone – they still do' |url=https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/07/harvey-weinstein-i-offered-acting-jobs-in-exchange-for-sex-but-so-does-everyone-they-still-do/ |accessdate=July 14, 2018 |work=Spectator USA |date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein's lawyer later said that he had been present and that Weinstein had not said that, and Theodoracopulos stated that he  "may have misrepresented" Weinstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Benjamin |title=Harvey Weinstein lawyer denies report producer 'offered acting jobs for sex' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/13/harvey-weinstein-lawyer-denies-report-that-producer-offered-acting-jobs-for-sex |accessdate=July 14, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 13, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 reporting==
Substantial allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein were first reported by ''The New York Times'' journalists [[Jodi Kantor]] and [[Megan Twohey]] on October 5, 2017.

Five days later, on October 10, [[NBC News]] correspondent [[Ronan Farrow]] reported in ''The New Yorker'' further allegations that Weinstein had [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] or harassed 13 women, and [[rape]]d three.&lt;ref name="Farrow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Farrow |first=Ronan |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories |title=From Aggressive Overtures to Sexual Assault: Harvey Weinstein's Accusers Tell Their Stories |work=The New Yorker |date=October 10, 2017 |accessdate=October 10, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010151730/https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories |archivedate=October 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow said he had wanted to break the story months earlier with NBC but implied the network was under pressure not to publish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moraes|first1=Lisa de|title=Ronan Farrow To Rachel Maddow: Ask NBC Why My Harvey Weinstein Report Did Not Break On Its Air|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-rachel-maddow-new-yorker-nbc-news-1202186126|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=October 18, 2017|date=October 11, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020215113/http://deadline.com/2017/10/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-rachel-maddow-new-yorker-nbc-news-1202186126/|archivedate=October 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which NBC denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Koblin |first1=John |title=How Did NBC Miss Out on a Harvey Weinstein Exposé? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/media/nbc-news-harvey-weinstein.html |accessdate=October 12, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=October 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012021005/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/business/media/nbc-news-harvey-weinstein.html |archivedate=October 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Farrow, 16 former or current executives and assistants connected with Weinstein said that they had witnessed or had been informed of Weinstein's non-consensual sexual advances to women. Four actresses relayed their suspicion that, after rejecting Weinstein's advances and complaining about him, he had them removed from projects or persuaded others to remove them. A number of Farrow's sources said Weinstein had referred to his success in planting stories in the media about individuals who had crossed him.

In response to the report in ''The New Yorker'', a spokesperson for Weinstein stated:&lt;ref name="Farrow"/&gt;

{{quote|Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.}}

In March 2018, Weinstein's lawyer and spokesperson [[Benjamin Brafman]] said in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' of London, "The casting couch in Hollywood was not invented by Harvey Weinstein."..."If a woman decides that she needs to have sex with a Hollywood producer to advance her career and actually does it and finds the whole thing offensive, that's not rape."

They triggered a public discussion about, as the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) put it, "willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="The Guardian October 14, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lartey|first1=Jamiles|last2=Helmore|first2=Edward|last3=Batty|first3=David|title=Stars welcome Academy move to expel Weinstein over sexual assault claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/14/harvey-weinstein-oscars-academy-holds-emergency-meeting|accessdate=October 14, 2017|work=The Guardian|date=October 14, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014085543/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/14/harvey-weinstein-oscars-academy-holds-emergency-meeting|archivedate=October 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2017, The Weinstein Company's (TWC) board of directors dismissed Weinstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41546694 |title=Harvey Weinstein sacked after sexual harassment claims |publisher=BBC News Online |date=October 9, 2017 |accessdate=October 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009001510/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41546694 |archivedate=October 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he resigned from the company's board nine days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patten|first1=Dominic|title=Harvey Weinstein Resigns From TWC Board As Termination Ratified In Meeting|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-board-meeting-weinstein-company-termination-future-1202189421/|accessdate=October 17, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 17, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017215046/http://deadline.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-board-meeting-weinstein-company-termination-future-1202189421/|archivedate=October 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
{{main|Weinstein effect}}

===In the United States===
The October 2017 allegations against Weinstein precipitated an immediate "national reckoning" against sexual harassment and assault in the United States,{{r|Rutenberg: Reckoning}} known as the "Weinstein effect". Compounded by other sexual harassment cases earlier in the year, the Weinstein reports and the subsequent "[[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo]]" hashtag campaign, which encouraged individuals to share their suppressed stories of sexual misconduct, created a cavalcade of allegations across multiple industries that brought about the swift ouster of many men in positions of power both in the United States and, as it spread, around the world.{{r|Cook/Simons|USA Today 2017-10-25}} In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the ousters of actors and directors alike. Most prominently, actor [[Kevin Spacey]], comedian [[Louis C.K.]], and filmmaker [[Brett Ratner]] had projects canceled following at least six allegations apiece.{{r|AP: Impact Nov 10}} Over 200 women accused filmmaker [[James Toback]] of sexual harassment.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25}} In journalism, allegations led to the ousters of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts. In other industries, the [[celebrity chef]] [[John Besh]] and other executives in finance and public relations were removed.{{r|USA Today 2017-10-25|AP: Impact Nov 10}} As of November 25, 2017, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] was investigating 28 sex crime cases involving media figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haring|first1=Bruce|title=LAPD Has 28 Open Sex Crimes Investigations Of Hollywood And Media|url=http://deadline.com/2017/11/lapd-has-28-open-sex-crimes-investigations-on-hollywood-and-media-1202214547/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=November 26, 2017|date=November 25, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125223148/http://deadline.com/2017/11/lapd-has-28-open-sex-crimes-investigations-on-hollywood-and-media-1202214547/|archivedate=November 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' and ''The New Yorker'' jointly won the 2018 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] "for their coverage of the sexual abuse of women in Hollywood and other industries around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laforme|first1=Ren|title=Here are the winners of the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/here-are-winners-2018-pulitzer-prizes|accessdate=April 16, 2018|work=Poynter|date=April 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, allegations against multiple British politicians created [[Westminster sexual harassment scandal|a public scandal]] and led to the suspension and resignations of three officials. In France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willsher|first1=Kim|title=Allegations of sexual violence soar in France after Weinstein scandal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/france-sees-sharp-rise-in-reports-of-sexual-misconduct|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political organizations close to the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], in particular the [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France]] (UNEF), were accused of systemic sexual harassment.

'''Hasan Izz-Al-Din''' ({{lang-ar|حسن عز الدين}}) (born about 1963) is a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] national wanted by the [[United States]] government.

Hasan Izz-Al-Din is an alleged  member of [[Hezbollah]]. He is currently wanted by the United States government for his  alleged involvement in the June 14, 1985 [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of [[TWA Flight 847]]. This attack resulted in the death of [[United States Navy]] diver [[Robert Stethem]]. On October 10, 2001, Izz-Al-Din, along with two other alleged participants in the hijacking, was placed on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|Most Wanted Terrorists]], which was released to the public by President [[George W. Bush]]. A reward of 5 million dollars is currently being offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction. It is believed he is residing in Lebanon.

The '''Hmu language''' (''hveb Hmub''), also known as '''Qiandong Miao''' (黔东 '''Eastern Guizhou Miao'''), '''Central Miao''', '''East Hmongic''', or (somewhat ambiguously) '''Black Miao''', is a [[dialect cluster]] of [[Hmongic languages]] of China. The best studied dialect is that of Yǎnghāo (养蒿) village, [[Taijiang County]], [[Guizhou]] Province, China.

Qanu 咯努, a Hmu variety, had 11,450 speakers as of 2000, and is spoken just south of [[Kaili City|Kaili]] City, Guizhou.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/Q/Qanu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Qanu are ethnoculturally distinct from the other Hmu.

==Subdivisions and distribution==

===Wang (1985)===
Wang Fushi (1985)&lt;ref&gt;王辅世主编，《苗语简志》，民族出版社，1985年。&lt;/ref&gt; groups the Qiandong Miao languages as follows.

*'''Northern''': 1,000,000 speakers in Kaili, Majiang, Nandan, Leishan, Taijiang, Huangping, Jianhe, Zhenyuan, Sansui, Shibing, Sandu, Fuquan, Pingba, Zhenning, Xingren, Zhenfeng, Anlong, Wangmo, etc.
*'''Eastern''': 250,000 speakers in Jinping, Liping, Jianhe, Jingzhou, Tongdao, Huitong, etc.
*'''Southern''': 350,0000 speakers in Rongjiang, Congjiang, Nandan, Sandu, Rongshui, Sanjiang, etc. Includes [[Ná-Meo language|Na Meo]] of northern  Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Hsiu2015"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew (2015).

===Others===
'''[[Sanqiao language|Sanqiao]] 三锹''' (三橇) is a [[mixed language|mixed]] [[Kam language|Kam]]–Hmu language spoken in [[Liping County]] and [[Jinping County, Guizhou|Jinping County]], [[Guizhou]], China by about 6,000 people.&lt;ref name="Yu2017"&gt;Yu Dazhong [余达忠]. 2017. "Ethnic Interactions and the Formation of the Sanqiu People in the Borderland of Modern Hunan，Guizhou and Guangxi Provinces [近代湘黔桂边区的族群互动和“三锹人”的形成]". In ''Journal of Guizhou Education University'' [贵州师范学院学报], Vol. 33, No. 1 (Jan 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Hmu has been recognized as a branch of [[Hmongic languages|Hmongic]] since the 1950s. Wang (1985) recognized three varieties. Matisoff (2001) treated these as distinct languages, which is reflected in ''Ethnologue''. Lee (2000) added a fourth variety, Western Hmu (10,000 speakers), among the [[Yao people|Yao]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and Matisoff (2006) lists seven (Daigong, Kaili [N], Lushan, Taijiang [N], Zhenfeng [N], Phö, Rongjiang [S]).

==Writing==
Northern Qiandong Miao, also known as Central Miao and as Eastern Guizhou Hmu (黔东方言 ''Qián-Dōng fāngyán''), was chosen as the standard for Hmu-language textbooks in China, based on the pronunciation of Yǎnghāo (养蒿) village.&lt;ref&gt;石德富 Shi Defu; 苗语基础教程(黔东方言) Miao-yu jichu jiaocheng (Qian-Dong fangyan) 中央民族大学出版社 Central Minorities Publishing House (2006-08出版)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}

==Phonology==
The phonemic inventory and alphabetic transcription are as follows.

{{IPA|[ʔ]}} is not distinct from a zero initial (that is, if we accept {{IPA|/ʔ/}} as a consonant, there are no vowel-initial words in Hmu), and only occurs with tones 1, 3, 5, 7.

The aspirated nasals and fricatives do not exist in Southern or Eastern Hmu; cognates words use their unaspirated homologues. Further, in Eastern Hmu, ''di, ti'' merge into ''j, q''; ''c'' merges into ''x''; ''r'' (Northern {{IPA|/z/}}) merges into ''ni''; and ''v'' is pronounced {{IPA|[w]}}. In Southern Hmu, words cognate with ''hni'' (and some with ''ni'') are pronounced {{IPA|[nʲʑ]}}; those with ''r'' are {{IPA|[nz]}}; and some words exchange ''s'' and ''x''.

All dialects have eight tones. There is no [[tone sandhi|sandhi]]. In the chart below, Northern Hmu is represented by Yanghao village ([[Kaili City]]), Eastern Hmu by 偶里 village ([[Jinping County, Guizhou|Jinping County]]), and Southern Hmu by 振民 ([[Rongshui Miao Autonomous County|Rongshui County]]).

The lowest tones—Northern tones 4 and 6, Eastern tones 3 and 8, and Southern tone 6—are said to make the preceding consonant murmured ([[breathy voice]]d), presumably meaning that these are murmured tones as in other Hmongic languages. They are marked with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|◌̤}}}} in the chart.

'''I. Y. Yunioshi''' is a fictional character in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1961 American romantic comedy ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', which was adapted for the screen by [[George Axelrod]] based on [[Truman Capote]]'s 1958 novella of the [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|same title]]. The character in the film is significantly different from the character as presented in Capote's original novella,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafu.com/2013/03/meet-mr-yaegashi-the-new-yunioshi/|title=Meet Mr. Yaegashi — the New Yunioshi|website=www.rafu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/theater-review-breakfast-at-tiffanys-429993|title=Breakfast at Tiffany's: Theater Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the film version of Mr. Yunioshi, as portrayed by [[Mickey Rooney]], has been the subject of extensive critical commentary and review since its theatrical release.

==Critical response==
===Upon release===
In the early 1960s and before, racially charged humor was acceptable in American culture, although this general attitude began to change later in that decade, and more so afterwards. In 1961, ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the film said that "Mickey Rooney's bucktoothed, myopic Japanese is broadly exotic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weiler |first=A.H. |title=The Screen: Breakfast at Tiffany's: Audrey Hepburn Stars in Music Hall Comedy |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 6, 1961 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A05EED9173AE13ABC4E53DFB667838A679EDE |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers of the day did note an issue over the characterization. James Powers' review in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated, "Mickey Rooney gives his customary all to the part of a Japanese photographer, but the role is a caricature and will be offensive to many."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961-movie-737095 ''The Hollywood Reporter'': "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by James Powers, October 5, 1961.]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Larry Tubelle wrote simply, "Mickey Rooney’s participation as a much-harassed upstairs Japanese photographer adds an unnecessarily incongruous note to the proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1961/film/news/film-review-breakfast-at-tiffanys-1201341653/ Film review: Breakfast at Tiffany's, by Larry Tubelle, October 6, 1961.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1990===
In 1990, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described Rooney's portrayal as "an irascible bucktoothed nerd and an offensive ethnic caricature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Koch |first=John |title=Quick Cuts and Stereotypes |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=[[Boston]] |date=April 1, 1990 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61610125.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+01%2C+1990&amp;author=John+Koch%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=QUICK+CUTS+AND+STEREOTYPES&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate = September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' wrote that the role "would have been an offensive stereotype even played by an Asian; the casting of Mickey Rooney added insult to injury".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Breaking Barriers |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=September 7, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal was referenced in the 1993 film ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]'' as an example of Hollywood's racist attitudes about Asians that the Chinese [[Bruce Lee]]'s success as a movie star would challenge. Specifically, when Lee and his girlfriend [[Linda Emery]] watch ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' in the theater, where despite laughing at the character, Linda suggests they leave midway through the picture after she notices that Bruce is upset at Rooney's stereotypical depiction of a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ito |first=Robert B. |title=A Certain Slant: A Brief History of Hollywood Yellowface |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/18/18_yellow.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090714062249/http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/18/18_yellow.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2009 |date=March 1997 |publisher=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]] |work=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=December 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free outdoor screening in [[Sacramento, California]], scheduled for August 23, 2008, was replaced with the [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' after protests about the Yunioshi character. The protest was led by Christina Fa of the Asian American Media Watch.&lt;ref name="scripps08"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110909/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/35779 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |url=http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/35779 |title= Mickey Rooney upset about claims his 'Tiffany's' role is racist |last=Magagnini| first=Stephen |date=September 28, 2008|work= [[Sacramento Bee]] | publisher=[[Scripps Howard News Service]] |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/08/27/breakfast-is-out-to-lunch/ |title='Breakfast' is Out to Lunch |publisher=AsianWeek |date=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A screening was shown August 11, 2011 at [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]]'s "Movies with a View" series in New York. Due to protests from a multi-ethnic group organized by an online petition at Change.org, the screening also included a short statement by the organizers which acknowledged and validated community concerns about Yunioshi and a brief documentary about  Rooney's character and the portrayal of Asian Americans in other films that was edited from a DVD extra for the anniversary DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=breakfast at tiffany's screening will include manaa documentary on mr. yunioshi|url=http://blog.angryasianman.com/2011/08/breakfast-at-tiffanys-screening-will.html|work=Angry Asian Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned editorial in the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' by columnist Jeff Yang offered an alternative view regarding the protests: "Far from boycotting the movie or even begrudgingly accepting it, I think it should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to fully understand who we are as a culture, how far we've come and how far we still need to go."&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

==Response to criticism==
In a 2008 interview about the film, Rooney said he was shocked to hear that his role as Yunioshi had been branded racist by several Asian-American activists. Rooney said he was heartbroken about the criticism: "[[Blake Edwards]]...wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director. They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it....Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it—not one complaint. Every place I've gone in the world people say, 'God, you were so funny.' Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, 'Mickey, you were out of this world.'" Rooney also said that if he had known people would be so offended, "I wouldn't have done it. Those that didn't like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and let's have peace."&lt;ref name="scripps08" /&gt;

The 2009 DVD re-release of the film included what was described as "a brief and necessary featurette on the character of Mr. Yunioshi, offering an Asian perspective on '[[Yellowface|yellow face]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Update majorly needed by an EXPERT.|date=November 2015}}
The causes and degree of '''Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures''' has been a subject of debate over many decades. Although the [[Olmec]]s are considered to be perhaps the earliest [[Mesoamerica]]n [[civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Diehl, ''The Olmecs: America's First Civilization'' or Lovgren: “the Olmec are generally regarded as the first advanced civilization in Mesoamerica”.&lt;/ref&gt; there are questions concerning how and how much the Olmecs influenced [[culture]]s outside the [[Olmec heartland]]. This debate is succinctly, if simplistically, framed by the title of a 2005 ''New York Times'' article: “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olmec heartland==
Nearly all researchers agree on a number of specific issues concerning the Olmec and the Olmec Heartland:

*The forebears of the Olmecs were [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to the [[Olmec heartland]],&lt;ref&gt;
Although nearly all researchers believe that the forebears of the Olmecs were indigenous to the [[Olmec heartland]], noted researchers such as Guadalupe Martinez Donjuan and [[Miguel Covarrubias]] believe that the Olmecs emigrated from the modern-day [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Guerrero]] to settle the Olmec heartland. (see Martinez Donjuan (2000))&lt;/ref&gt; and developed their civilization independent of other civilizations.{{cn|date=November 2015}}
* The Olmec civilization arose in the Olmec heartland with the flowering of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] in the centuries before 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]].

==Beyond the heartland==
[[File:Tlapacoya Bowl.PNG|frame|Clay Bowl, pigmented, 1200–900 BCE, from the [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya archaeological site]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Despite being found several hundred kilometers/miles from the Olmec heartland, this bowl shows Olmec influences, particularly in the downturned mouth and almond eye of the so-called Banded-eye God.]]
While some of the hallmarks of Olmec culture, such as [[Olmec colossal_heads|colossal heads]] or other sculptures, earthen platforms, and [[monolith]]ic "[[altars]]", are to be found only within the heartland, many Olmec-style artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments, and motifs can be found in the archaeological records of sites hundreds of kilometers/miles distant.  The most prominent of these sites are:

*[[Tlatilco]] and [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], major centers of the [[Tlatilco culture]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]], where artifacts include hollow [[Olmec figurine#Baby-face motif|baby-face motif]] figurines and Olmec designs on ceramics.
*[[Chalcatzingo]], in the Valley of [[Morelos]], which features Olmec-style reliefs on monuments and exposed rock.
*[[Teopantecuanitlan]], in [[Guerrero]], which also features Olmec-style reliefs as well as city plans with distinctive Olmec features.
*[[San José Mogote]], in [[Oaxaca]], which features Olmec-style pottery.  San Jose Mogote is, like the larger Olmec site of [[La Venta]], oriented 8° west of north.

Other sites showing Olmec influence include [[Takalik Abaj]] and [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]] in Guatemala, [[Las Bocas]] in [[Puebla]], and [[Zazacatla]].&lt;ref&gt;While not associated with an archaeological site, the [[Juxtlahuaca]] and [[Oxtotitlan]] cave paintings are considered Olmec-inspired.&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases, the archaeological record shows Olmec-influenced objects existing alongside objects in the local tradition.  Often, for example at Las Bocas, Olmec inconography will even appear on objects created in the local tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Olmec influences in these sites all post-date San Lorenzo and the cultural pathways almost exclusively{{clarify|date=November 2015}} flow from the Olmec heartland to these distant sites, and not in the other direction{{cn|e.g. ceramice are found millennia earlier at Zohapilco (far from Olmec Homeland), and it's still debated that writing, one of the most important creations, may originate from Zapotecs and Olmecs adopted it, Mogote's usage of irrigation=1500BC or earlier, and Olmecs CERTAINLY adopted it; this Zapoteca irrigation is before the Olmecs even EXISTED...see the San Jose Mogote article, are but 3 examples: non-Olmec contemporaries were advanced (in arguably the 3 most important aspects of civilization: agriculture, writing, AND ceramics), and some tech's which 1 particular culture likely had before Olmeca even EXISTED were later adopted throughout Mesoamerica.|date=November 2015}} (from, say, Chalcatzingo to [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan]]). This apparent one-way flow has led most researchers to declare Olmecs to be the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica.  

To quote perhaps the most prominent of Mesoamerican archaeologists, [[Michael D. Coe]], "There is now little doubt that all later civilizations in Mesoamerica, whether Mexican or Maya, ultimately rest on an Olmec base."&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, Coe's student archaeologist Richard Diehl adds "While not every archaeologist agrees with Coe, ... mounting evidence ... has convinced everyone but the most die-hard opponents".&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Formative Era sites.svg|thumb|left|350px|The major Formative Period sites in present-day Mexico which show Olmec influences in the archaeological record.]]

===Mother culture===
The concept of the Olmecs as a mother culture was first formally raised by [[Alfonso Caso]] at a 1942 conference on the "Olmec problem" in [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] where he argued that the Olmec were the "''cultura madre''" of Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;"Esta gran cultura, que encontramos en niveles antiguos, es sin duda madre de otras culturas, como la maya, la teotihuacana, la zapoteca, la de El Tajín, y otras” ("This great culture, which we encounter in ancient levels, is without a doubt mother of other cultures, like the Maya, the Teotihuacana, the Zapotec, that of El Tajin, and others".) Caso (1942), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of the "mother culture" do not argue that the Olmec were the ''only'' contributors, but that the Olmecs first developed many of the features adopted by later Mesoamerican civilizations.

They argue that it was in San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland that the hallmarks of the Olmec culture were first established, hallmarks that include the patio/plaza concept, monumental sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;"Few scholars question the hypothesis that the Mesoamerican monolithic sculptural tradition originated in the Olmec heartland". Reilly, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Olmec iconography, archetypical [[Olmec figurine]]s, and other portable art.

===Sister culture===
The "sister culture" proponents, on the other hand, state that Mesoamerican cultures evolved more or less simultaneously. Major proponents of this theory include [[Joyce Marcus]] and [[Kent V. Flannery]], who argue that the Olmec were merely the first among equals, rather than the wellspring of cultural change.

:"It is the adaptive autonomy and frequent competitive interaction of such chiefdoms that speed up evolution and eventually make useful technologies and sociopolitical strategies available to all regions.".&lt;ref&gt;Flannery and Marcus (2000), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent paper, they imply, for example, that Olmec iconography may have originated in the early [[Tlatilco culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, et al. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

This viewpoint is echoed by a minority of other researchers including art historian [[Caterina Magni]] who nonetheless agrees that the Olmecs bequeathed a rich heritage to later cultures.&lt;ref&gt;". . . léguer un riche héritage aux cultures postérieures.", Magni (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Magni does not agree that what is presently labelled as Olmec culture was first and foremost the product of the heartland.  
:"Contrary to [this] generally accepted idea, the brilliant [Olmec] culture did not originate in the Gulf coast of Veracruz and Tabasco. In truth, the varied and voluminous archaeological data shows a much more complex reality; [instead] Olmec religious and political centers emerged simultaneously throughout a vast part of Mesoamerica: from Mexico to Costa Rica."&lt;ref&gt;"Contrairement à une idée reçue, cette culture brillante n'est pas originaire de la côte du golfe du Mexique (États actuels du Veracruz et du Tabasco). En vérité, les données archéologiques, nombreuses et variées, montrent une réalité beaucoup plus complexe. ..on peut donc affirmer que les centres religieux et politiques olmèques émergent de manière synchrone sur une vaste partie de la Méso-Amérique : du Mexique jusqu'au Costa Rica, en passant par le Belize, le Guatemala, le Salvador, le Honduras et le Nicaragua." Magni (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Magni attributes these concepts to noted archaeologist [[Christine Niederberger Betton|Christine Niederberger]].&lt;ref&gt;Magni, (2004). See also Niederberger (1987), pp 745-750 as well as Niederberger (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec-style pottery analysis===
[[File:Etlatongo Orange-on-white Pottery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orange-on-white pottery from [[Etlatongo]], identified through [[neutron activation analysis]] as being made from clay from the Olmec site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]]© Jeffrey Blomster]]
In an effort to address questions concerning the geographic origins of Olmec artifacts — with implications concerning the geographic origins of Olmec culture — in March 2005 a team of archaeologists used instrumental [[neutron activation analysis]] (INAA) to compare over 1,000 Mesoamerican Olmec-style ceramic artifacts with 275 samples of clay so as to "fingerprint" the origin of that pottery. They found that "the Olmec packaged and exported their beliefs throughout the region in the form of specialized ceramic designs and forms, which quickly became hallmarks of elite status in various regions of ancient Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;Devitt.  For original study, see Blomster.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005 the results of another study were published. This study used [[petrography]] to analyze 20 pottery shards, and found that five of the samples from San Lorenzo were "unambiguously" from Oaxaca. Based on this evidence, the authors concluded that the "exchanges of vessels between highland and lowland chiefly centers were reciprocal, or two way" which "contradicts recent claims that the Gulf Coast was the sole source of pottery" in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Stoltman et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the INAA study were later defended in March 2006 in two articles in ''[[Latin American Antiquity]]'', in particular contrasting the sample size of the INAA study (roughly 1000) with the sample size of the petrography analysis (20).&lt;ref&gt;Neff et al. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===An emerging middle ground===
In the early 21st century it seems that a middle ground between the mother and sister culture positions may be emerging.&lt;ref name="joyce92"&gt;Joyce 2010 p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Pool (2007) thus concludes that while San Lorenzo emerged early as the largest the most developed polity of Mesoamerica and the earliest evidence of several of the defining traits of Mesoamerican culture is found there, the Olmecs emerge looking less like a mother culture than as a promiscuous father culture spawning offspring generously with many different mothercultures all over mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Pool 2007 300-301&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation emphasises the viewpoint that influence from the Olmec heartland merged with many local traditions creating local expressions with both Olmec and non-Olmec roots. it follows from this approach that the type and degree of Olmec influence varies greatly from location to location within Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="joyce92" /&gt;

==Flow of influence==
If Olmec influences flowed out of the heartland in what is generally seen as a less than bilateral transfer, then how did this happen? How were the hallmarks of Olmec culture transmitted to sites hundreds of kilometers/miles distant from the heartland? Many theories have been advanced including:

:* Olmec military domination,
:* Olmec [[colonization]] of other regions,
:* Olmec [[artisan]]s travelling to other centers,
:* [[Missionary]] activity,
:* Conscious imitation of Olmec artistical styles by developing towns,
:* Long-range trade by Olmec [[merchant]]s.

There is little or no evidence to support Olmec military domination. Very little Olmec or other Early Formative era art shows war or sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 20.  Notable exceptions include are [[Chalcatzingo]]'s Monument 2, the side panel of [[La Venta]]'s Altar 4, and the largest painting at Juxtlahuaca, all of which show some type of human-on-human dominance.  Painting 1. Pool finds that "the archaeological evidence for warfare among the Olmecs is notable for its scarcity . . .", p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; No [[stele|stelae]] have been found extolling rulers' victories, unlike the later Maya or the contemporaneous [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] or [[Hittites|Hittite]] cultures.

Olmec colonization, that is the founding of new settlements by Olmec emigrants outside of the Olmec heartland, is unlikely. The archaeological records of Olmec-influenced sites show that each had pre-Olmec occupations as well as a significant number of indigenous artifacts created in a local tradition. The Tlatilco site as well as [[Xochipala#Olmec?|Xochipala figurines]] are two examples famous for a large number of figurines, which are unlike any found at La Venta or San Lorenzo.

Although [[portable art]], such as [[pottery]], [[Celt (tool)|celts]], or other items could have been transported the long distances between towns, the monumental art at Chalcatzingo or Teopantecuanitlan would need to be created locally. Therefore, it is very likely that sculptors and artists familiar with or experienced in heartland architecture were commissioned to create similar ceremonial sites far from the heartland.&lt;ref&gt;See Townsend, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; But while this can explain ''how'' monumental Olmec-style art was created at Chalcatzingo, it does not explain ''why''.

===Long-distance trade===
Similarly long-distance trade can explain the Olmec-style artifacts found in Teopantecuanitlan, as well the [[jade]] and [[obsidian]] artifacts found in the Olmec heartland, which is far from any [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] or [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|obsidian source]]. But trade by itself fails to explain the widespread adoption of Olmec-influenced artifacts and styles throughout Mesoamerica or Olmec iconography found on locally produced wares &amp;mdash; while trade can explain the movement of objects, it does not explain the movement of ideas or styles. Therefore, according to archaeologist Jeffrey Blomster, "we have to move beyond a purely economic model . . . The fact that trade involves ceramic vessels which display iconography, representing an underlying ideology and religion synthesized by the Gulf Coast Olmec, suggests that something much deeper is at stake than simply maintaining exchange relationships."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rose.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Juxtlahuaca Painting 1.svg|300px|right|thumb|The Olmec-influenced Painting 1 from the Juxtlahuaca cave, roughly 500 km (300 mi) west of the Olmec heartland.]]

===Iconography in service to ideology===
To explain the adoption of Olmec iconography and concepts throughout Mesoamerica, archaeologist F. Kent Reilly proposes a "Middle Form rulers. That is, the styles and the iconography, as well as the artifacts, were used by the rising elites in the Formative chiefdoms to authenticate or to increase their power and prestige.

This is echoed, among others, by archaeologist Giselle Canto Aguilera. Working at the [[Zazacatla]] site in Morelos, she found that the inhabitants of Zazacatla adopted Olmec styles when they changed from a simple, egalitarian society to a more complex, hierarchical one: "When their society became stratified, the new rulers needed emblems ... to justify their rule over people who used to be their equals."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Olmec-influenced objects are found throughout Mesoamerica. The consensus among most, but by no means all, archaeologists and researchers is that [[Olmec_influences_on_Mesoamerican_cultures#An_emerging_middle_ground|Olmecs weren't purely a mother nor a sister to other Mesoamerican cultures]], but the hallmarks of the Olmec iconography were developed within the Olmec heartland and that this iconography became, in the words of Michael Coe, an "all-pervading art style" throughout Mesoamerica (though Coe himself admits on the same page that there is "nothing [in the [[Xochipala#Olmec?|Xochipala figurines]] ] which would lead into the Olmec pattern"), promoting a "powerful, unitary religion" and an “official ideology”,&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; an ideology that was adopted by distant indigenous chieftains and other elites eager to validate and bolster their claims to privilege.

===Account of Elizabeth Bentley===
On July 31, 1948, [[Elizabeth Bentley]] testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee ([[HUAC]]):  

&lt;blockquote&gt;MISS BENTLEY: I had one other group that I handled, and I had every reason to believe there were other groups also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  MR. STRIPLING: What was the other group that you handled?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  MISS BENTLEY: We called it the Perlo group. It was actually an ex-Communist Party unit that I believe had been set up in Washington in the early thirties, and I gather, from what the members of the group told me, that they had been in a minor way collecting information for some years but not in an organized fashion.&lt;ref name=Archives&gt;

Much useful additional information on the activities of the Perlo group was given by the [[Venona project]]. The first Venona transcript referencing the Perlo group gives the names of all the members in clear text, as code names had not yet been assigned.

Bentley advised that [[Jacob Golos]] informed her he had made contact with a group in Washington, D.C. through Earl Browder. After the death of Golos in 1943, two meetings were arranged with this group in 1944. The first meeting was arranged by Browder and was held in early 1944. The meetings were held in the apartment of [[John Abt]] in New York City and Bentley was introduced to four individuals identified as Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Harry Magdoff and Edward Fitzgerald.

===Account of Whittaker Chambers===
On August 3, 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]] testified before HUAC: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;MR. CHAMBERS: The apparatus was organized with a leading group of seven men, each of whom was a leader of the cell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. STRIPLING: Could you name the seven individuals ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. CHAMBERS: The head of the group as I have said was at first [[Nathan Witt]]. Other members of the group were [[Lee Pressman]], [[Alger Hiss]], [[Donald Hiss]], [[Victor Perlo]], [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; [...] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. STRIPLING: When Miss Bentley testified before the committee last Saturday, Mr. Chambers, she mentioned the name of Victor Perlo as being the head of an espionage group. You have named Victor Perlo as a member of the apparatus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. CHAMBERS: Yes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MR. STRIPLING: At that time do you know whether or not Victor Perlo was employed in the Government? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. CHAMBERS: I believe at that time Victor Perlo was employed by the [[Brookings Institution]]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. MUNDT: I think we read his employment record into the record of the hearing while Miss Bentley was testifying, did we not? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. STRIPLING: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I have his employment history here. It is already in the record. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; MR. MUNDT: He was employed with the Government several times? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MR. STRIPLING: That is true, and was with the Brookings Institution,also.&lt;ref name=Archives /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his memoir (1952), Chambers recalled: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crisis, he ([[J. Peters]]) said, had developed in the ([[Harold Ware]]) Group (following Ware's accidental death). Victor Perlo believed that he should succeed Ware as Group leader. He was being stubborn and surly about it. All the other members of the leadership believed that Nathan Witt was Ware's natural heir. A deadlock had resulted, for, though the rest might easily have outvoted Perlo, they did not wish to risk trouble in the Group by alienating him. Peters was also for Witt. So was I. But Peters did not wish to use his authority to act against any member of the Group in favor of another member. Peters asked me if I would come in and, since my personal authority was high with the Group, give my reasons why I was for Witt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I went in. I said that we must first of all treat the problem that had arisen as Communists, without personalities, and bearing in mind the peculiar nature of underground work and its unusual requirements, especially in the personal character of leadership. I asked Perlo's pardon for observing that he was a tense and nervous man, and that his very belief in his own qualifications for leadership, while perhaps quite justified, would actually be a handicap so long as it was not shared by the rest of the Group. Of course, we Communists did not believe in any mystical rightness of majorities over minorities, but we did believe in practical solutions to practical problems. Witt was acknowledged to be quiet, firm and solid. He had the confidence of all the members of the Group except Perlo.   Therefore, I was for Witt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Perlo, of course, was unconvinced, but he agreed to abide by discipline. Thereafter, he would scarcely speak to me. Later, according to Elizabeth Bentley, he rose to the leadership he coveted in her espionage group.&lt;ref&gt;

===Account in Venona===
The Perlo group fits into the [[Venona project]] information when transcript # 687 of 13 May 1944 is examined. [[Iskhak Akhmerov]] in New York City personally prepared a report to [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] headquarters in Moscow advising that some unspecified action had been taken regarding [[Elizabeth Bentley]] in accordance with instructions of [[Earl Browder]]. Akhmerov then made reference to winter and also to [[Harry Magdoff]]. This latter reference was then followed by a statement that in Bentley's opinion "they" are reliable. It was also mentioned that no one had interested himself in their possibilities.

The name Golovin was mentioned, and it was then reported that [[Victor Perlo]], [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]], [[Edward Fitzgerald (adviser)|Edward Fitzgerald]] and Harry Magdoff would take turns coming to New York every two weeks. Akhmerov said Kramer and Fitzgerald knew [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]], whose cover name was later changed to "Robert".

===Records in KGB Archives===

[[Allen Weinstein]] and [[Alexander Vassiliev]] in ''Haunted Wood'', a book written from an examination of KGB Archives in Moscow, report the KGB credits the Perlo group members with having sent, among other items, the following 1945 [[U.S. Government]] documents to Moscow:

==Members==

Victor Perlo headed the Perlo group. Perlo was originally allegedly a member of the [[Harold Ware|Ware group]] before [[World War II]]. After receiving a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1933, Perlo worked at a number of New Deal government agencies among a group of economists known as "[[Harry Hopkins]]' bright young men." The group worked, among other things, for creation and implementation of the WPA jobs program, and helped push through unemployment compensation, the Wagner National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and Social Security. During World War II, Perlo served in several capacities, working first as chief of the Aviation Section of the War Production Board, then in the Office of Price Administration, and later for the Treasury Department. Perlo left the government in 1947. Perlo also worked for the [[Brookings Institution]] and wrote ''American Imperialism''. Perlo's code name in Soviet intelligence was "Eck" and "Raid" appearing in [[Venona project]] as "Raider".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="803">In [[economics]], a '''privileged group''' is one possible condition for the production of [[public good]]s.

A privileged group contains at least one individual that benefits more from a public good than its production costs. Therefore, the good will be produced although other members of the group benefit without paying. However, this [[free rider problem]] may still result in an undersupply of the good compared to the [[Lindahl equilibrium]].

In France, the '''Procureur général''' is a magistrate who sits at the [[Court of Appeal (France)|cours d’appel (courts of appeal)]], at the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] or the [[Court of Audit (France)|Cour des comptes]] (Court of Auditors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexinter.net/PROCPEN/attributions_du_procureur_general_aupres_de_la_cour_d%27appel.htm|title=Des attributions du procureur général près la cour d'appel |website=lexinter.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the appellate courts, the term refers to the magistrate who conducts the prosecution or the suit for the court of appeal, as opposed to the members of the "formations de jugement" - the bench of judges who rule on the matter. 

[[File:Organisation_juridictionnelle_nationale_fr.gif|thumb|px=800|Courts of Appeal in the French [[Judiciary of France|judiciary]].]]
The Procureurs généraux at the Courts of Appeal are the superiors of the prosecutors of the Republic whose actions they coordinate.&lt;ref name=metier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metiers.justice.gouv.fr/magistrat-12581/le-metier-12582/procureur-26218.html|title=Justice / Métiers et concours / Procureur|website=www.metiers.justice.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups form a public prosecutor's office (distinct from that of the Court of Cassation), subject to the instructions of the [[:fr:Direction des Affaires criminelles et des Grâces (DACG)|Directorate of Criminal Affairs]] and the Minister of Justice.
The Procureur général is assisted by one or more [[Advocate General#Other European jurisdictions|Avocat général]] and [[:fr:Substitut du procureur général|Substituts généraux]] (magistrat du premier grade).

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Azerbaijan}}
Azerbaijan is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Women and children from Azerbaijan are subjected to sex trafficking within the country and in [[Malaysia]], [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], and the UAE. Traffickers increasingly used the internet for recruitment. Azerbaijan is a destination country for sex trafficking victims from [[Ukraine]], and in previous years [[China]], [[Russia]], Turkey, [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. In previous years, Azerbaijan has been used as a transit country for victims of sex trafficking from [[Central Asia]] to the UAE, Turkey, and Iran.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271139.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 Law on the Fight against Trafficking in Persons and article 144 of the criminal code prohibit sex and lobar trafficking and prescribe penalties of five to 15 years' imprisonment. The government investigated twenty-two cases of sexual exploitation in 2016. The government prosecuted 30 defendants for sex trafficking and convicted 28, compared to 18 sex traffickers in 2015. Two traffickers received sentences between one to five years' imprisonment and the other traffickers received sentences between five to 10 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Azerbaijan as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

[[File:NYC - New York City Library - 1723.jpg|thumb|350px|Patrons studying and reading at the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]].]]
A '''public library''' is a [[library]] that is accessible by the general public and is usually funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by [[librarian]]s and library [[paraprofessional]]s, who are also [[Civil service|civil servant]]s.

There are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries: they are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute); they are governed by a board to serve the public interest; they are open to all, and every community member can access the collection; they are entirely voluntary in that no one is ever forced to use the services provided; and they provide basic services without charge.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E. ''Foundations of Library and Information Science'' (3rd ed). 2010. Neal-Schuman Publishers: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public libraries exist in many countries across the world and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population. Public libraries are distinct from [[research library|research libraries]], [[school library|school libraries]], and other [[Special library|special libraries]] in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population. Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy, quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to ''borrow'' books and other materials, i.e., take off the premises temporarily; they also have non-circulating [[reference]] collections and provide computer and Internet access to patrons.

==Overview==
[[File:Maadilib.JPG|thumb|right|A public library in [[Maadi]], [[Egypt]]]]
The culmination of centuries of advances in the [[printing press]], [[moveable type]], paper, ink, publishing, and distribution, combined with an ever-growing information-oriented middle class, increased commercial activity and consumption, new radical ideas, massive population growth and higher literacy rates forged the public library into the form that it is today.

Public access to books is not new. [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] made [[scrolls]] in dry rooms available to patrons of the baths, and tried with some success to establish libraries within the empire.

In the middle of the 19th century, the push for truly public libraries, paid for by taxes and run by the state gained force. Matthew Battles states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was in these years of class conflict and economic terror that the public library movement swept through Britain, as the nation's progressive elite recognized that the light of cultural and intellectual energy was lacking in the lives of commoners.&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;Matthew. Library: An Unquiet History. New York, N.Y.: Norton, 2004, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public libraries were often started with a donation, or were bequeathed to parishes, churches, schools or towns. These social and institutional libraries formed the base of many academic and public library collections of today.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Bill, Katz. Dahl's History Of The Book, No. 2.

The establishment of circulating libraries in the 18th century, by [[bookselling|booksellers]] and [[publisher]]s provided a means of gaining profit and creating social centers within the community. The circulating libraries not only provided a place to sell books, but also a place to lend books for a price. These circulating libraries provided a variety of materials including the increasingly popular [[novel]]s. Although the circulating libraries filled an important role in society, members of the middle and upper classes often looked down upon these libraries that regularly sold material from their collections and provided materials that were less sophisticated.

[[Circulating libraries]] also charged a [[Subscription business model|subscription fee]], however the fees were set to entice their patrons, providing subscriptions on a yearly, quarterly or monthly basis, without expecting the subscribers to purchase a share in the circulating library. This helped patrons who could not afford to buy books, to be able to borrow books to read, and then return. This also created a more popular demand, as book fees were growing, and more books were being copied. Circulating libraries were very popular, the first one was located in 1725, in [[Edinburgh|Edinbrough, Scotland]] by [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]]. 

Circulating libraries were not exclusively lending institutions and often provided a place for other forms of commercial activity, which may or may not be related to print. This was necessary because the circulating libraries did not generate enough funds through subscription fees collected from its borrowers. As a commerce venture, it was important to consider the contributing factors such as other goods or services available to the subscribers.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols.

The [[Biblioteca Malatestiana|Malatestiana Library]] ({{Lang-it|Biblioteca Malatestiana}}), also known as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library dating from 1452 in [[Cesena]], [[Emilia-Romagna]] ([[Italy]]). It was the first [[Europe]]an civic [[library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Cesena |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221210346/http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |archivedate=2009-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. belonging to the [[medieval commune|Commune]] and open to everybody. It was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, [[Malatesta Novello]]. The works were directed by [[Matteo Nuti da Fano|Matteo Nuti]] of [[Fano]] (a scholar of [[Leon Battista Alberti]]) and lasted from 1447 to 1452.

==History==
[[File:Thomas Bodley.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Bodley]] founded the [[Bodleian Library]] in 1602 as an early public library.]]
{{main article|History of libraries}} {{see|Bibliothèque nationale de France}}

Historian [[Yahya of Antioch|Yahya ibn Said al-Antaki]] (d. 1066) reported that [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (r. 996–1021) financed and established libraries open to the public, where anyone, even the simple laymen, could choose whatever books they wanted and have them copied for them by public scribes, free of charge.&lt;ref name="ant"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yahya ibn Said al-Antaki |authorlink1=Yahya of Antioch |title=Kitāb taʼrih̲ d̲ayl (Continuation de la chronique d'Eutychius d'Alexandrie (Saʿid ibn Bitrīq) pour la période 938-1034) |date=1066}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as many of his other decisions, Al-Hakim later ordered this policy to be reversed.&lt;ref name="ant"/&gt;  In Cesena Italy, the first community-run public library, the [[Biblioteca Malatestiana|Malatestiana Library]], was established in 1447, provided both secular and religious texts in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and was fully open to all members of the public.
Another early library that allowed access to the public was that of the Kalendars or Kalendaries, a brotherhood of clergy and laity who were attached to the Church of All-Hallowen or [[All Saints' Church, Bristol|All Saints]] in [[Bristol]], England. Records show that in 1464, provision was made for a library to be erected in the house of the Kalendars, and reference is made to a deed of that date by which it was "appointed that all who wish to enter for the sake of instruction shall have 'free access and recess' at certain times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=G.A.|title=Three centuries of a city library: an historical and descriptive account of the Norwich Public Library established in 1608 and the present public library opened in 1837|date=1917|publisher=Norwich: Public Library Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early years of the 17th century, many famous collegiate and town libraries were founded in England.

===Enlightenment era libraries===
[[Claude Sallier]], the French philologist and churchman, operated an early form of public library in the town of [[Saulieu]] from 1737 to 1750. He wished to make culture and learning accessible to all people.

The [[Załuski Library]] ({{lang-pl|Biblioteka Załuskich}}, {{lang-la|Bibliotheca Zalusciana}}) was built in [[Warsaw]] 1747–1795 by [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]] and his brother, [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], both Roman Catholic bishops. The library was open to the public and indeed was the first Polish public library, the biggest in Poland and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fyifrance.com/f102005c.htm |title=The Strange Life of One of the Greatest European Libraries of the Eighteenth Century: the Zaluski Collection in Warsaw |publisher=Fyifrance.com |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208031623/http://www.fyifrance.com/f102005c.htm |archivedate=2008-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently [[Lending library|lending libraries]]. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966) ''Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850'' London: Library Association; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public. In 1790, The Public Library Act would not be passed for another sixty-seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, for which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

However, up until the mid 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term, i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis. Subscription libraries, both private and commercial, provided the middle to upper classes with a variety of books for moderate fees.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription libraries]]. Commercial [[subscription libraries]] began when booksellers began renting out extra copies of books in the mid-18th century. Steven Fischer estimates that in 1790, there were "about six hundred rental and lending libraries, with a clientele of some fifty thousand".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008) ''A Nation of Readers: the lending library in Georgian England''. London: British Library; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The mid- to late 18th century saw a virtual epidemic of feminine reading as [[novel]]s became more and more popular.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964) ''The Heritage of the English Library''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin; p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Novels, while frowned upon in society, were extremely popular. In England there were many who lamented at the "villanous profane and obscene books" and the opposition to the circulating library, on moral grounds, persisted well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many establishments must have circulated many times the number of novels as of any other genre.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797, Thomas Wilson wrote in ''The Use of Circulating Libraries'': "Consider, that for a successful circulating library, the collection must contain 70% fiction". However, the overall percentage of novels mainly depended on the proprietor of the [[circulating library]]. While some circulating libraries were almost completely novels, others had less than 10% of their overall collection in the form of novels.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The national average start of the 20th century hovered around novels comprising about 20% of the total collection.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Novels varied from other types of books in many ways. They were read primarily for enjoyment instead of for study. They did not provide academic knowledge or spiritual guidance; thus they were read quickly and far fewer times than other books. These were the perfect books for commercial subscription libraries to lend. Since books were read for pure enjoyment rather than for scholarly work, books needed to become both cheaper and smaller. Small duodecimo editions of books were preferred to the large [[Folio (printing)|folio]] editions. Folio editions were read at a desk, while the small [[duodecimo]] editions could be easily read like the paperbacks of today.

Much like paperbacks of today, many of the novels in circulating libraries were unbound. At this period of time, many people chose to bind their books in leather. Many circulating libraries skipped this process. Circulating libraries were not in the business of preserving books; their owners wanted to lend books as many times as they possibly could. Circulating libraries had ushered in a completely new way of reading. Reading was no longer simply an [[academia|academic pursuit]] or an attempt to gain [[spirituality|spiritual guidance]]. Reading became a social activity. Many circulating libraries were attached to the shops of milliners or drapers. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends as [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]] do today.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964) pp. 275-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|right|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century.]]
Another factor in the growth of subscription libraries was the increasing cost of books. In the last two decades of the century, especially, prices were practically doubled, so that a quarto work cost a [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]], an [[octavo]] 10 shillings or 12 shillings, and a duodecimo cost 4 [[shilling]]s per volume. Price apart, moreover, books were difficult to procure outside London, since local booksellers could not afford to carry large stocks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial libraries, since they were usually associated with booksellers, and also since they had a greater number of patrons, were able to accumulate greater numbers of books. The United Public Library was said to have a collection of some 52,000 volumes-–twice as many as any private subscription library in the country at that period.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; These libraries, since they functioned as a business, also lent books to non-subscribers on a per-book system.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private subscription libraries===
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was the "gentlemen only" library. The gentlemen's subscription libraries, sometimes known as proprietary libraries, were nearly all organized on a common pattern. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred. The entrance fee, i.e. the purchase price of a share, was in early days usually a guinea, but rose sharply as the century advanced, often reaching four or five guineas during the French wars; the annual subscription, during the same period, rose from about six shillings to ten shillings or more. The book-stock was, by modern standards, small (Liverpool, with over 8,000 volumes in 1801, seems to have been the largest), and was accommodated, at the outset, in makeshift premises–-very often over a bookshop, with the bookseller acting as librarian and receiving an honorarium for his pains.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Franklin, former Boston apprentice printer turned Philadelphia printer and publisher, would become a founder of the first American Subscription Library known as The Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1727 he and some friends formed "a club of mutual improvement,"  as he wrote in his autobiography. Calling themselves the  "Junto" - meaning a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose - they met on Friday evenings to discuss politics, morals, and natural philosophy, as science was then termed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men would share what books they possessed between one another through the subscription library.

The Liverpool [[Subscription library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular single work was John Hawkesworth's ''Account of Voyages ... in the Southern Hemisphere'' (3 vols) which was borrowed on 201 occasions. The records also show that in 1796, membership had risen by 1/3 to 198 subscribers (of whom 5 were women) and the titles increased five-fold to 4,987. This mirrors the increase in reading interests. A patron list from the Bath Municipal Library shows that from 1793 to 1799, the library held a stable 30% of their patrons as female.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also uncommon for these libraries to have buildings designated solely as the library building during the 1790s, though in the 19th century, many libraries would begin building elaborate permanent residences. Bristol, Birmingham, and Liverpool were the few libraries with their own building.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The accommodations varied from the shelf for a few dozen volumes in the country stationer's or draper's shop, to the expansion to a back room, to the spacious elegant areas of [[Hookham's Circulating Library|Hookham's]] or those at the resorts like Scarborough, and four in a row at Margate.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the 19th century, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings, and the subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

===Modern public libraries===
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Under the terms of the [[Museums Act 1845|Museums Act of 1845]], the municipalities of [[Warrington]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] established libraries in their museums. Warrington Municipal Library opened in 1848.

Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|title=History of the Public Libraries Act|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm|archivedate=2014-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that "the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (English politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections were raised about the increase in [[taxation]], the potential infringement on private enterprise and the existing library provision such as [[mechanics' institutes]] and the fear that it would give rise to "unhealthy social agitation".&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime rate]]s.

[[Salford Museum and Art Gallery]] first opened in November 1850 as "The Royal Museum &amp; Public Library", as the first unconditionally free public library in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |publisher=Manchesteronline |title=Eye witness in Manchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513165303/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_sal_mayor/index.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }} Retrieved on 2008-09-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsalford.info/whattosee/heritage/industrialheritage/industrialheritage1st.htm|publisher=visitsalford.info|title=1st In Salford|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library in [[Castlefield|Campfield]], [[Manchester]] was the first library to operate a ''free'' lending library without subscription in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2238494.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anniversary of first public library | date=September 5, 2002 | accessdate=April 14, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040620130317/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2238494.stm | archivedate=June 20, 2004 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norwich]] lays claim to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries—although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]] and [[Sheffield]].

The 1850 Act was noteworthy because it established the principle of free public libraries.
In 1866, an amending Act was passed&lt;ref&gt;Public Libraries Amendment Act, 29 &amp; 30 Vict. c.114&lt;/ref&gt; which eliminated entirely the population limit for the establishment of a library and replaced the two-thirds majority previously required for adoption with a simple majority.  It also allowed neighbouring parishes to combine with an existing or potential library authority. Despite the rise in the level of tax public libraries could levy, it was still very difficult for boroughs to raise enough capital to fund new libraries. The growth of the public library movement in the wake of the 1850 Act relied heavily on the donations of philanthropists.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1973), pp. 107-137&lt;/ref&gt;

County libraries were a later development, which were made possible by the establishment of County Councils in 1888. They normally have a large central library in a major town with smaller branch libraries in other towns and a mobile library service covering rural areas.

====Expansion====
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]] played an important role in financing public libraries across the [[English-speaking world]].]]
[[File:Halifax central library June 2015.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Halifax Central Library]], a modern public library.]]
The modern public library grew at a great pace at the end of the 19th century especially in the [[English-speaking world]]. Philanthropists and businessmen, including [[John Passmore Edwards]], [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to fund the establishment of large numbers of public libraries for the edification of the masses.

[[Public libraries in North America]] developed from the 18th century to today; as the country grew more populous and wealthier, factors such as a push for education and desire to [[Sharing|share]] knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries. In addition, money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to get many libraries started. In some instances, collectors donated large book collections.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Hauk Shera, ''Foundations of the public library;: The origins of the public library movement in New England, 1629–1885'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern public library in the world supported by taxes was the Peterborough Town Library in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]]. It was "established in 1833."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Peterborough Town Library|url=http://peterboroughtownlibrary.org/about/history/|website=Peterborough Town Library|accessdate=26 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102164154/http://peterboroughtownlibrary.org/about/history/|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a small public library. The first large public library supported by taxes in the [[United States]] was the [[Boston Public Library]], which was established in 1848 but did not open its doors to the public until 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Public Library A Brief History and Description|url=http://www.bpl.org/general/history.htm|website=Boston Public Library|accessdate=26 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626114123/http://www.bpl.org/general/history.htm|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Redwood Library and Athenaeum was founded in 1747 by a group led by Abraham Redwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodlibrary.org|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527094742/http://www.redwoodlibrary.org/|archivedate=27 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first library in Rhode Island and the oldest lending library in America.

A total of 1,689 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] were built in the United States between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to universities. By 1930, half the American public libraries had been built by Carnegie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Theodore | title = Carnegie Libraries across America | publisher = Preservation Press | location = Washington | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-471-14422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public library in [[Australia]] was the Melbourne Public Library (now the [[State Library of Victoria]]), which opened in 1856, just a few years after their introduction into Britain. This was however purely a reference library. In September 1869, the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) government opened as the Free Public Library, Sydney (now the [[State Library of New South Wales]]) by purchasing a bankrupt subscription library. In 1896, the [[Brisbane]] Public Library was established. The Library's collection, purchased by the [[Queensland]] Government from the private collection of [[George Rogers Harding|Justice Harding]]. In 1935 the ''Free Library Movement'' was established in New South Wales advocating for free public libraries to be supported by municipal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=G.

The pioneer of modern public libraries in France was [[Eugène Morel]], a writer and one of the librarians at the [[Bibliothèque nationale]]. He put forward his ideas in the 1910 book ''La Librairie publique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Librairie publique |year=1910 |publisher=Enssib.fr |format=PDF |url=http://www.enssib.fr/bibliotheque-numerique/document-brut-48832 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003225919/http://www.enssib.fr/bibliotheque-numerique/document-brut-48832 |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaëtan Benoît, ''Eugène Morel, pioneer of public libraries in France'', Litwin Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The main task of public libraries is to provide the public with access to books and periodicals.

Libraries typically offer access to thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of books, the majority of which are available for borrowing by anyone with the appropriate [[library card]]. A library's selection of books is called its ''collection'', and usually includes a range of popular fiction, classics, nonfiction and reference works, books of public interest or under public discussion, and subscriptions to popular newspapers and magazines. Most libraries offer quiet space for reading, known as reading rooms. Borrowers may also take books home, as long as they return them at a certain time and in good condition. If a borrowed book is returned late, the library may charge a small [[library fine]], though some libraries have eliminated fines in recent years. About two-thirds of libraries now provide access to [[e-books]] and digital or digitized periodicals as well as printed books.&lt;ref name="plftas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Judy|title=Libraries Connect Communities: Public Library Funding &amp; Technology Access Study 2011-2012|url=http://www.ala.org/research/sites/ala.org.research/files/content/initiatives/plftas/2011_2012/plftas12_execsummary.pdf|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=28 July 2013|author2=Bertot, John Carlo|author3=Davis, Denise|date=June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101153110/http://www.ala.org/research/sites/ala.org.research/files/content/initiatives/plftas/2011_2012/plftas12_execsummary.pdf|archivedate=1 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many libraries offer assistance to borrowers, to select books, through specialist Readers' Advisory Services librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/services/public_libraries/docs/ALHF2014_EllenForsyth_SherreyQuinn.pdf|title = Reading Revived: A History of Readers' Advisory Services in Australian Public Libraries|date = 2014|access-date = 18 January 2016|website = |publisher = State Library of New South Wales|last = Forsyth|first = Ellen|last2 = Quinn|first2 = Sherrey|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150116043855/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/services/public_libraries/docs/ALHF2014_EllenForsyth_SherreyQuinn.pdf|archivedate = 16 January 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public libraries also provide books and other materials for children. These items are often housed in a special section known as a children's library and attended to by a specialized children's librarian. Child oriented [[websites]] with on-line educational games and programs specifically designed for younger library users are becoming increasingly popular. Services may be provided for other groups, such as [[large print]] or [[Braille]] materials, [[audiobook|Books on tape]], [[young adult literature]] and other materials for teenagers, or materials in other than the national language (in foreign languages).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Libraries also lend books to each other, a practice known as [[interlibrary loan]]. Interlibrary loan allows libraries to provide patrons access to the collections of other libraries, especially rare, infrequently used, specialized and/or out-of-print books. Libraries within the same system, such as a county system, may lend their books to each other, or libraries in different states may even use an interlibrary loan system.

The selection, purchase and [[Library catalog|cataloging]] of books for a collection; the care, repair, and weeding of books; the organization of books in the library; [[readers' advisory]]; and the management of membership, borrowing and lending are typical tasks for a public [[librarian]], an [[information professional]] with graduate-level education or experience in [[library and information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Richard E.

In the United States, libraries are responsible for supporting the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and how it relates to their facilities through policies such as the American Library Association's [[Library Bill of Rights]]. The right to freedom of speech and information is significant to public libraries; one way of upholding this doctrine is to protect the [[privacy]] of all patrons that belong to a library. The concept of confidentiality is important because the First Amendment may be violated if a patron's information could possibly be shared.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Patrons may not feel free to check out certain materials for fear it would later be revealed. Members of society need to be reassured that even if they borrow controversial or embarrassing materials, their privacy will be upheld.&lt;ref name="privacy interpretation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=interpretations&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=132904|website=American Library Association|accessdate=1 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123448/http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=interpretations&amp;Template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=132904|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy stating a library's view on privacy should be{{According to whom|date=May 2016}} created and displayed where patrons can see when they enter the building.

===Digital engagement===
[[File:Fort Worth Library Computer Lab.jpg|right|thumb|Fort Worth Central Library Computer Lab]]
Part of the public library mission has become attempting to help bridge the [[digital divide]]. As more books, information resources, and government services are being provided online (see [[e-commerce]] and [[e-government]]), public libraries increasingly provide access to the Internet and [[public computer]]s for users who otherwise would not be able to connect to these services. They can also provide community  spaces to encourage the general population to improve their digital skills through Library Coding Clubs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goscl.com/coding-clubs-in-libraries-on-the-rise-330-increase-from-march-2016/|title=Coding Clubs in Libraries on the Rise:  330% Increase from March 2016|author=|date=|website=goscl.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109223036/http://goscl.com/coding-clubs-in-libraries-on-the-rise-330-increase-from-march-2016/|archivedate=2016-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Library makerspace]].

In addition to access, many public libraries offer training and support to computer users. Once access has been achieved, there remains a large gap in people's online abilities and skills. For many communities, the public library is the only agency offering free computer classes, information technology learning and an affordable, interactive way to build digital skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} {{as of|2012}}, 91% of libraries offer free wireless Internet to their patrons; 76% offer e-books for borrowing; and 90% offer formal or informal technology training.&lt;ref name="plftas"/&gt; A significant service provided by public libraries is assisting people with e-government access and use of federal, state and local government information, forms and services.

Public libraries have a long history of functioning as [[community center]]s or [[public space]]s for reading, study and formal and informal public meetings. In 1898, Andrew Carnegie, a prominent library philanthropist, built a library in Homestead, Pennsylvania, where his main steel mills were located. Besides a book collection, it included a bowling alley, an indoor swimming pool, basketball courts and other athletic facilities, a music hall, and numerous meeting rooms for local organizations. It sponsored highly successful semi-pro football and baseball teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick B. Miller|author2=David K. Wiggins|title=Sport and the Color Line: Black Athletes and Race Relations in Twentieth Century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHiKCLaOLOEC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=17|isbn=9780203497456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the development of the modern public library, [[subscription libraries]] were often used as clubs or gathering places. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends, as coffee shops do today.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964) ''The Heritage of the English Library''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, pp. 275-76&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, public libraries were touted as alternatives to dance halls or gentleman's clubs, and frequently built, organized and supported because of their equalizing and civilizing influence.
	 
Today, in-person and on-line programs for reader development, language learning, homework help, free lectures and cultural performances, and other community service programs are common offerings. The library storytime, in which books are read aloud to children and infants, is a cultural touchstone. Most public libraries offer frequent storytimes, often daily or even several times a day for different age groups. Some libraries have begun offering sensory storytimes for children and adults on the autism spectrum. Sensory storytimes give patrons "more ways to process information", especially considering people on the autism spectrum are concrete thinkers and/or might have sensory issues to fluorescent lightning or ambient noise other patrons might not notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/03/01/sensory-storytime-spectrum-libraries-add-services-for-children-with-autism/|title=Storytime for the Spectrum|last=Cottrell|first=Megan|date=2016-03-01|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320202114/http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/03/01/sensory-storytime-spectrum-libraries-add-services-for-children-with-autism/|archivedate=2017-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries is "summer reading" for children, families, and adults. Summer reading usually includes a list of books to read during summer holidays, as well as performances, book discussions or other celebrations of reading, culture and the humanities. Many libraries offer classes to the community such as tech clinics where patrons can bring in laptops and electronic devices and receive one on one attention in solving their problems and learning how to use them.
	
Libraries may also offer free or inexpensive meeting space for community organizations and educational and entrepreneurial activity. The addition of [[makerspace]]s in libraries, beginning with the Fayetteville Free Library in 2011, offers the potential for new roles for public spaces and public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCue|first=T.J.|title=First Public Library to Create a Maker Space|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2011/11/15/first-public-library-to-create-a-maker-space/|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=15 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726071454/http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2011/11/15/first-public-library-to-create-a-maker-space/|archivedate=26 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at library programs increased by 22% between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program attendance at public libraries is on the rise|url=http://www.lrs.org/documents/fastfacts/298_Programming.pdf|work=Fast facts: recent statistics from the Library Research Service|publisher=Colorado State Library|accessdate=28 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104113125/http://www.lrs.org/documents/fastfacts/298_Programming.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
While in the past libraries were merely buildings to house their collections, most now utilize their space to offer programs or clubs regularly. Although some libraries will have similar programs with different names, such as book club, writing club or computer programs, most programs will differ based on the specific library and the community they serve. New studies have shown that librarians must research what their specific community needs, “because communities differ, however, the ways libraries implement these services differ as well. The [example of service response] offered at one library may vary significantly from [the same example] offered by another library. The differences are perfectly appropriate if they result from a tailoring of services to address local needs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=x5buRH0KfhwC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=%22because+communities+differ,+however,+the+ways+libraries+implement+these+services+differ+as+well%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22because%20communities%20differ%2C%20however%2C%20the%20ways%20libraries%20implement%20these%20services%20differ%20as%20well%22&amp;f=false | title=The New Planning for Results: A Streamlined Approach| isbn=9780838935040| last1=Nelson| first1=Sandra S.| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Websites like [[Pinterest]] have numerous ideas for creating programs for local patrons, while the website [[Instructables]] has [[DIY]] tutorials, complete with pictures, which is helpful for libraries on a budget. "Programs in the humanities and the arts that encourage people to think and talk about ethics and values, history, art, poetry, and other cultures are integral to the library’s mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/ppo/resources/benefitspublic|title=The Benefits of Public Programming for Participating Libraries and Audiences|last=admin|date=29 March 2007|website=ala.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905234224/http://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/ppo/resources/benefitspublic|archivedate=5 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saratoga Springs Public Library]] also has numerous story times as well as Yoga for children, parent/child workshops, Spanish workshops, a read-to-a-dog program, and a Kindness club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ny.evanced.info/sspl/lib/eventcalendar.asp?&amp;dt=mo&amp;df=calendar&amp;cn=0&amp;private=0&amp;ln=0&amp;et=Children+Programs|title=Schedule of Events|author=|date=|website=ny.evanced.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905231329/https://ny.evanced.info/sspl/lib/eventcalendar.asp?&amp;dt=mo&amp;df=calendar&amp;cn=0&amp;private=0&amp;ln=0&amp;et=Children+Programs|archivedate=2017-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chelmsford Public Library]] has a plethora of story times for ages birth to preschool.

===Diversity===
A significant goal in American libraries is to become more culturally diverse throughout the country.  Public libraries are an equal access facility and want to make everyone feel welcome no matter the religion, race, ethnicity, sex, or financial status.  To accomplish this goal, libraries are striving to find ways in which to make both staff and the library programs they provide more culturally sensitive.  
A starting point for most libraries is to find out the demographics in which they are located.  Once the library system learns more about the community they serve, they can start building a collection and programs around it. Another suggestion from multiple experts says to hire staff that represents the society that the library is located in order to better relate and serve members of that society.
By making culturally diverse programs, a library can be inviting to many members of the community.  A few ways libraries accomplish this goal are by providing programs which are inclusive to many different cultures such as having lectures or events in different languages, including celebrations and holidays that are diverse, and by inviting speakers and authors from different cultures to come and talk.

===Research assistance===
[[File:Garolibr.jpg|thumb|right|A public library in [[Garowe]], [[Somalia]]]]
Librarians at most public libraries provide reference and research help to the general public. This can include assisting students in finding reliable sources for papers and presentations; helping the public find answers to questions or evidence in a debate; or providing resources related to a specific event or topic. Reference assistance is usually provided through a [[reference interview]] which is usually conducted at a public [[reference desk]] but may also be conducted by telephone or online. Reference librarians may also help patrons develop an appropriate bibliography or works cited page for an academic paper. Depending on the size of the library, there may be multiple reference desks that deal with different topics. Large public, academic or research libraries may employ librarians that are experts in specific topics or subjects. Often the children's section in a public library has its own reference desk. On the other hand, at a smaller library, circulation and reference may occur at the same desk.
	
The Internet has had a significant effect on the availability and delivery of reference services. Many reference works, such as the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], have moved entirely online, and the way people access and use these works has changed dramatically in recent decades. The rise of [[search engine]]s and crowd-sourced resources such as [[Wikipedia]] have transformed the reference environment. In addition to the traditional reference interview, reference librarians have an increasing role in providing access to digitized reference works (including the selection and purchase of [[databases]] not available to the general public) and ensuring that references are reliable and presented in an academically acceptable manner. Librarians also have a role in teaching [[information literacy]], so that patrons can find, understand and use information and [[finding aid]]s like search engines, databases and library catalogs.

Public libraries may answer millions of reference questions every year. For example, the [[Boston Public Library]] answers more than one million reference questions annually.&lt;ref name=tws18novabbb&gt;{{Cite news | author = Business Wire | title = Boston Public Library Secures E-Rate Funding; Selects One Communications for 31 Location MPLS Network | quote = "The Internet and emerging technologies have had a substantial impact on libraries," said Mary Bender, Communications Manager at [[Boston Public Library]].

===Reference collections===
{{see also|Archives|Special collections}}
[[File:Choa Chu Kang library.jpg|thumb|right|Reading area in a [[Singapore]] public library]]
In addition to their circulating collection, public libraries usually offer a collection of [[reference book]]s, such encyclopedias, dictionaries, phone books and unique or expensive academic works. These books may not be available for borrowing, except under special circumstances. Reference books that are frequently used, such as phone books, may be housed in a special section called "ready reference."

Some libraries also keep historical documents relevant to their particular town, and serve as a resource for historians in some instances. For example, the [[Queens Public Library]] kept letters written by unrecognized [[Tiffany lamp]] designer [[Clara Driscoll (Tiffany glass designer)|Clara Driscoll]], and the letters remained in the library until a curator discovered them.&lt;ref name=tws16nov12&gt;{{Cite news | author = Kastner, Jeffrey | title = Out of Tiffany's Shadow, a Woman of Light | quote = He was co-curator of the exhibition with the independent scholar ... and the historical society's curator of decorative arts, Margaret K.

Collections of unique or historical works are sometimes referred to as [[special collections]]; except in rare cases, these items are reference items, and patrons must use them inside the library under the supervision or guidance of a librarian. Local libraries' special collections may be of particular interest to people researching their family history. Libraries that are focused on collecting works related to particular families are genealogical libraries and may be housed in the same building as a public library.
		
Many libraries—especially large, urban libraries—have large collections of photographs, digital images, rare and fragile books, artifacts and manuscripts available for public viewing and use. Digitization and digital preservation of these works is an ongoing effort, usually funded by grants or philanthropy. In 2005, the New York Public Library offered the "[[NYPL Digital Gallery]]" which made a collection of 275,000 images viewable over the web; while most of the contents are in the [[public domain]], some images are still subject to [[copyright]] rules.&lt;ref name=tws18novrreer&gt;{{Cite news | author = Jim Regan | title = The NY Public Library's Digital Gallery | quote = Officially launched on March 3rd, the NYPL Digital Gallery is presently offering 275,000 images (stored on a 57- terabyte, a thousand billion bytes of data, network of servers) for public perusal and free personal use ("...individual private study, scholarship and research...") | publisher = Christian Science Monitor | date = March 21, 2005 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0321/p25s01-stin.html | accessdate = 2009-11-18 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724065427/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0321/p25s01-stin.html | archivedate = July 24, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited funding, [[copyright]] restrictions, a lack of expertise or poor [[provenance]] are barriers to the large-scale digitization of libraries' special collections.

===Other services===
[[File:Biblioburro.jpg|thumb|A burro library]]
	 
Depending on a community's desires and needs, public libraries may offer many other resources and services to the public. In addition to print books and periodicals, most public libraries today have a wide array of other media including [[audiobook]]s, [[e-books]], [[compact disc|CD]]s, [[audio cassette|cassette]]s, [[videotape]]s, and [[DVD]]s. In 2015, certain libraries started to stock general materials for borrowing, such as pots, pans, sewing machines, and similar household items in order to appeal to a larger population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrison|first=Ellen|title=Borrow a sewing machine?

In rural areas, the local public library may have a [[bookmobile]] service, consisting of one or more buses or pack animals (such as [[Biblioburro|burros]], [[Bookmobile#Present-day mobile libraries|camels, donkey, or elephants]]) furnished as small public libraries, some equipped with [[Hot spot (Wi-Fi)|Internet access points]] or computer labs, and serving the countryside according to a regular schedule. In communities that are extremely isolated or that have poor digital infrastructure, libraries may provide the only access to online education, [[telemedicine]], or [[telework]]. Libraries also partner with schools and community organizations to promote literacy and learning.&lt;ref name=tws18novdgfsaab&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sunday Forum: The importance of libraries| quote = You'll find librarians guiding customers to information that will help them to find a job, start a business or trace their family trees.

==Organization==
The establishment or development of a public library involves creating a legal authorization and governing structure, building a collection of books and media, as well as securing reliable funding sources, especially government sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting Up a Library: A Resource Guide|url=http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet16|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=14 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807053702/http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet16|archivedate=7 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most public libraries are small, serving a population of under 25,000, and are (or were) established in response to specific local needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landau|first=Herbert|title=The Small Public Library Survival Guide: Thriving on Less|url=http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=2409|publisher=ALA Editions|accessdate=14 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628205646/http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=2409|archivedate=28 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Library Primer'', [[John Cotton Dana]]'s 1899 work on the establishment and management of libraries in the United States, Dana wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each community has different needs, and begins its library under different conditions. Consider then, whether you need most a library devoted chiefly to the work of helping the schools, or one to be used mainly for reference, or one that shall run largely to periodicals and be not much more than a reading room, or one particularly attractive to girls and women, or one that shall not be much more than a cheerful resting-place, attractive enough to draw man and boy from street corner and saloon. Decide this question early, that all effort may be concentrated to one end, and that your young institution may suit the community in which it is to grow, and from which it is to gain its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dana|first=John Cotton|title=A library primer|year=1899|publisher=Wikisource|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Library_Primer_%281899%29/Chapter_II|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025115125/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Library_Primer_(1899)/Chapter_II|archivedate=2012-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After being established and funded through a resolution, public referendum or similar legal process, the library is usually managed by a [[board of directors]], library council or other local authority. A librarian is designated as the library director or library manager. In small municipalities, city or county government may serve as the library board and there may be only one librarian involved in the management and direction of the library. Library staff who are not involved in management are known in the United States and some other English-speaking countries as "library paraprofessionals" or "library support staff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Rita|title=Library paraprofessionals: a bibliography|url=http://colt.ucr.edu/bibliography.html|publisher=University of California Riverside|accessdate=14 August 2013|year=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20021012000000/http://colt.ucr.edu/bibliography.html|archivedate=12 October 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may or may not have formal education in [[library and information science]]. Support staff have important roles in [[library collection development]], cataloging, [[technical support]], and the process of preparing books for borrowing.  All of these tasks may be referred to as ''technical services'', whether or not they involve information technology.&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward Evans, Sheila S. Intner, Jean Weihs ''Introduction to Technical Services''; 7th ed. Englewood, Colo.: Libraries Unlimited, 2002 {{ISBN|1-56308-918-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the library's governing board has ultimate authority to establish policy, many other organizations may participate in library management or library fundraising, including civic and voluntary associations, women's clubs, [[Friends of the Library]] groups, and groups established to advise the library on the purchase and retention of books.

State and national governments may also have a role in the establishment and organization of public libraries. Many governments operate their own large libraries for public and legislative use (e.g., [[state libraries]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], etc.). These governments can also influence local libraries by reserving formal recognition or funding for libraries that meet specific requirements. Finally, associations of library and information professionals, such as the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) and the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP) help establish norms and standard procedures, secure funding, advocate at the state or national level and certify [[library school]]s or [[information school]]s.

==Funding==
Public libraries are funded through a wide combination of sources, the most significant which is usually local or [[municipal]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Funding|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/libfunding/fed|work=Library Funding Updates|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=28 March 2014|quote="While the majority of funding for libraries comes from state and local sources, federal funding provides critical assistance, giving libraries across the country the financial support they need."|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403140921/http://www.ala.org/advocacy/libfunding/fed|archivedate=3 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supporting the library services provided by local authorities and making sure there is a national collection of published material|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/supporting-the-library-services-provided-by-local-authorities|publisher=http://gov.uk|accessdate=28 March 2014|date=8 April 2013|quote="Local authorities are responsible for providing a comprehensive and efficient library service."|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302122041/https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/supporting-the-library-services-provided-by-local-authorities|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens who use a local library support it via the city or county government, or through a [[special-purpose district]], which is a local government body that has independent leadership and may levy its own taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library District 101: the library district explained|url=http://denverlibrary.org/library-district|publisher=http://denverlibrary.org|accessdate=28 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328223418/http://denverlibrary.org/library-district|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local funding may be supplemented by other government funding. For example, in the United States, the state and federal governments provide supplementary funding for public libraries through [[State aid for libraries|state aid]] programs, the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA) and [[E-Rate]]. State and local governments may also offer cities and counties large grants for library construction or renovation. Private [[philanthropy]] has also had a significant role in the expansion and transformation of library services, and, like other educational institutions, some libraries may be partially funded by an [[Financial endowment|endowment]]. Some proactive librarians have devised alliances with patron and civic groups to supplement their financial situations. Library "friends" groups, activist boards, and well organized book sales also supplement government funding.

Public funding has always been an important part of the definition of a public library. However, with local governments facing financial pressures due to the Great Recession, some libraries have explored ways supplement public funding.

Survey data suggests the public values free public libraries. A [[Public Agenda]] survey in 2006 reported 84% of the public said maintaining free library services should be a top priority for their local library. Public libraries received higher ratings for effectiveness than other local services such as parks and police. But the survey also found the public was mostly unaware of financial difficulties facing their libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicagenda.org/reports/long-overdue "Long Overdue: A Fresh Look at Public Attitudes About Libraries in the 21st Century"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926154353/http://publicagenda.org/reports/long-overdue |date=2008-09-26 }} ''Public Agenda'', 2006.

'''Romano-Greek''' (also referred to as '''Hellenoromani'''; {{lang-gr|Ελληνο-ρομανική}}) is a nearly extinct [[mixed language]] (referred to as [[Para-Romani]] in Romani linguistics), spoken by the [[Romani people|Romani]] people in [[Greece]] that arose from [[language contact]] between [[Romani language|Romani]] speaking people and the [[Greek language]]. The language is expected to be a secret language spoken in [[Thessaly]] and Central Greece Administrative Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/rge|title=Romano-Greek|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typologically the language is structured on Greek with heavy lexical borrowing from Romani.&lt;ref name=Ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rge Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; Related variants of this language are Dortika. Dortika is a secret language spoken mainly in Athens by traveling builders from Eurytania Prefecture. In both cases, the languages are most likely not native to their speakers.

The '''Scholars Strategy Network''' ('''SSN''') is an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina.

''Harvard Magazine.'' 15 February 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the work of individual SSN members is typically published in [[academic journals]], the organization encourages its members to write "briefs" about current issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/content/social-scientists-seek-new-ways-influence-public-policy McMurtrie, Beth.

''The Washington Post: The Monkey Cage.'' 24 September 2013.

"How Legislators View Their Constituents." ''The Daily Beast.'' 24 September 2013. Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the Scholars Strategy Network with an associated website was originally conceived of in 2009 by [[sociologist]] and [[political scientist]] [[Theda Skocpol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/paul-ryan-budget-plan-targeted-progressive-academics_n_1752507.html Siddiqui, Sabrina.

Accessed 17 November 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The association is backed by donors Robert Bowditch, Jr. and David desJardins, both of whom are affiliated with the progressive [[Democracy Alliance]], but the Scholars Strategy Network does not take formal positions on policy questions or support or oppose particular political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news2.sanford.duke.edu/newsletters/Insights11_12.pdf Stanford Insights Staff.

== Regional Networks ==

An SSN Regional Network includes scholars who live or work in that region, and each is coordinated by a leader or co-leaders who set the regional agenda and organize discussions and public events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/03/21/experts-explore-who-controls-government Shan, Tony.

Folio from Walters manuscript W.171 (15th century)]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
The '''seven deadly sins''', also known as the '''capital vices''' or '''cardinal sins''', is a grouping and classification of [[vice]]s within Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virtues and Vices in the Arts: A Sourcebook|last=Tucker|first=Shawn|publisher=Cascade|year=2015|isbn=1625647182|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities.&lt;ref name="Aquinas"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiJCBAAAQBAJ|title=Summa Theologica (All Complete &amp; Unabridged 3 Parts + Supplement &amp; Appendix + interactive links and annotations)|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|date=2013-08-20|publisher=e-artnow|isbn=9788074842924|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the standard list, they are '''[[pride]]''', '''[[greed]]''', '''[[lust]]''', '''[[envy]]''', '''[[gluttony]]''', '''[[wrath]]''' and '''[[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]''',&lt;ref name="Aquinas"/&gt; which are also contrary to the [[seven virtues]]. These [[Catholic views on sin|sins]] are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).

This classification originated with the [[Desert Fathers|desert fathers]], especially [[Evagrius Ponticus]], who identified seven or eight evil thoughts or spirits that one needed to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evagrius of Pontus: The Greek Ascetic Corpus translated by Robert E. Sinkewicz.|last=Evagrius|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0199297088|location=Oxford and New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evagrius' pupil [[John Cassian]], with his book ''The Institutes,'' brought the classification to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Institutes|last=Cassian|first=John|publisher=Newman Press of the Paulist Press|year=2000|isbn=0809105225|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as evident in penitential manuals, sermons like "[[The Parson's Tale]]" from Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]],'' and artworks like Dante's [[Purgatorio|''Purgatory'']] (where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are depicted as being grouped and penanced according to the worst capital sin they committed). The Catholic Church used the concept of the deadly sins in order to help people curb their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds could occur; the leader-teachers especially focused on pride (which is thought to be the sin that severs the soul from Grace,&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; and the one that is representative and the very essence of all evil) and greed, both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying all other sins to be prevented. To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins, the vices are discussed in treatises and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches as well as older textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Greco-Roman antecedents ===
While the seven deadly sins as we know them did not originate with the Greeks or Romans, there were ancient precedents for them. [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' lists several positive, healthy human qualities, excellences, or [[virtue]]s. Aristotle argues that for each positive quality there are two negative vices that are found on each extreme of the virtue. Courage, for example, is the human excellence or virtue in facing fear and risk. Excessive courage makes one rash, while a deficiency of courage makes one cowardly. This principle of virtue found in the middle or "mean" between excess and deficiency is Aristotle's notion of the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Aristotle lists virtues like courage, temperance or self-control, generosity, "greatness of soul," proper response to anger, friendliness, and wit or charm.

Roman writers like [[Horace]] extolled the value of virtue while listing and warning against vices. His first epistles says that "to flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Their origin in the spiritual teaching of Evagrius the Hermit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3WpAwAAQBAJ|publisher=SPCK|date=2013-04-23|isbn=9780281062997|first=Angela|last=Tilby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tableau de mission -François-Marie Balanant tableau 1-.jpg|thumb|An allegorical image depicting the human heart subject to the seven deadly sins, each represented by an animal (clockwise: [[toad]] = avarice; [[snake]] = envy; [[lion]] = wrath; [[snail]] = sloth; [[pig]] = gluttony; [[goat]] = lust; [[peacock]] = pride).]]

=== Origin of the currently recognized Seven Deadly Sins ===
The modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the fourth-century [[monk]] [[Evagrius Ponticus]], who listed eight ''evil thoughts'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] as follows:&lt;ref name="Pontico"&gt;Evagrio Pontico, ''Gli Otto Spiriti Malvagi'', trans., Felice Comello, Pratiche Editrice, Parma, 1990, p.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evagrius of Pontus: The Greek Ascetic Corpus|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006-06-22|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199297085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# {{lang|grc|Γαστριμαργία}} (''gastrimargia'') gluttony
# {{lang|grc|Πορνεία}} (''porneia'') [[prostitution]], [[fornication]]
# {{lang|grc|Φιλαργυρία}} (''philargyria'') [[avarice]] (greed)
# {{lang|grc|Ὑπερηφανία}} (''hyperēphania'') [[pride]] – sometimes rendered as ''self-overestimation''&lt;ref&gt;In the [https://archive.org/stream/Philokalia-TheCompleteText/Philokalia-Complete-Text_djvu.txt translation] of the ''[[Philokalia]]'' by Palmer, Ware, and Sherrard.&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{lang|grc|Λύπη}} (''lypē'') [[sadness]] – in the ''[[Philokalia]]'', this term is rendered as ''envy,'' sadness at another's good fortune
# {{lang|grc|Ὀργή}} (''orgē'') wrath

# {{lang|grc|Ἀκηδία}} (''akēdia'') [[acedia]] – in the ''Philokalia'', this term is rendered as [[Depression (mood)|dejection]]

They were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity (largely due to the writings of [[John Cassian]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf211.iv.iii.html|title=NPNF-211. Sulpitius Severus, Vincent of Lerins, John Cassian - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition=First|title=The Institutes|publisher=Newman Press of the Paulist Press|date=2000-01-03|location=New York|isbn=9780809105229|first=St John|last=Cassian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus becoming part of the Western tradition's spiritual [[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]] (or [[Catholic devotions]]), as follows:&lt;ref name="Refoule67"&gt;Refoule, F. (1967) "Evagrius Ponticus," In ''New Catholic Encyclopaedia,'' Vol. 5, pp. 644f, Staff of Catholic University of America, Eds., New York, NY, USA: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{lang|la|Gula}} (gluttony)
# {{lang|la|Luxuria/Fornicatio}} (lust, fornication)
# {{lang|la|Avaritia}} (avarice/greed)
# {{lang|la|Superbia}} (pride, hubris)
# {{lang|la|Tristitia}} ([[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]/[[Depression (mood)|despair]]/despondency)
# {{lang|la|Ira}} (wrath)
# {{lang|la|Vanagloria}} ([[vainglory]])
# {{lang|la|Acedia}} (sloth)

These "evil thoughts" can be categorized into three types:&lt;ref name=Refoule67/&gt;

* lustful appetite (gluttony, fornication, and avarice)
* irascibility (wrath)
* mind corruption (vainglory, sorrow, pride, and discouragement)

In AD 590 [[Pope Gregory I]] revised this list to form the more common list. Gregory combined ''tristitia'' with ''acedia'', and ''vanagloria'' with ''superbia'', and added ''envy,'' in Latin, ''invidia''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gregory the Great: Moral Reflections on the Book of Job, Volume 1|publisher=Cistercian Publications|date=2014-11-18|isbn=9780879071493|first=Mark|last=DelCogliano}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virtues and Vices in the Arts: A Sourcebook|publisher=Cascade Books, an Imprint of Wipf and Stock Publishers|date=2015-02-24|first=Shawn R.|last=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's list became the standard list of sins. [[Thomas Aquinas]] uses and defends Gregory's list in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' although he calls them the "capital sins" because they are the head and form of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The cause of sin, in respect of one sin being the cause of another Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 84; I-II,84,3)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2084.htm#article4|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name="Armentrout2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armentrout|first=Don S.|title=An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church: A User-Friendly Reference for Episcopalians|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|language=English |isbn=9780898697018|page=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranhour.org/sermon.asp?articleid=648&amp;mode=print|title=Mighty Menacin' Midianites|last=Lessing|first=Reed|date=25 August 2002|publisher=The Lutheran Hour|language=English|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methodist Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucmpage.org/articles/rspeidel.htm|title=What Would a United Methodist Jesus Do?|last=Speidel|first=Royal|publisher=UCM|language=English|accessdate=26 March 2017|quote=Thirdly, the United Methodist Jesus reminds us to confess our sins.

Moreover, modern day evangelists, such as [[Billy Graham]] have explicated the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Lutheran, Volumes 39-40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KaHmAAAAMAAJ|year=1956|publisher=American Lutheran Publicity Bureau|language=English |page=332|quote=The world-renowned Evangelist, Billy Graham, presents in this volume an excellent analysis of the seven deadly sins which he enumerates as pride, anger, envy, impurity, gluttony, avarice, and slothfulness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and modern definitions, views and associations==
Most of the capital sins, with the sole exception of sloth, are defined by [[Dante Alighieri]] as perverse or corrupt versions of love for something or another: lust, gluttony, and greed are all excessive or disordered love of good things; sloth is a deficiency of love; wrath, envy, and pride are perverted love directed toward other's harm.&lt;ref name="DLSintro652"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, pp. 65–67 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; In the seven capital sins are seven ways of eternal death.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sin and Its consequences|last=Manning|first=Henry Edward|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital sins from lust to envy are generally associated with pride, which has been labeled as the father of all sins, etc.

=== Lust ===
{{Main article|Lust}}
[[File:Ingres_-_Paolo_and_Francesca.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francesca da Rimini#In Inferno|Paolo and Francesca]], whom [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']] describes as [[Damnation|damned]] for fornication. ([[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], 1819)]]

'''Lust''', or '''lechery''' (Latin, "''luxuria''"  (carnal)), is intense longing. It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lust|title=Definition of LUST|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[rape]], [[bestiality]], [[un-natural sexual practices]] and other immoral sexual acts. However, lust could also mean simply desire in general; thus, lust for money, power, and other things are sinful. In accordance with the words of [[Henry Edward Manning]], the impurity of lust transforms one into "a slave of the devil".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Lust, if not managed properly, can subvert propriety.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lust:The Seven Deadly SIns|last=Blackburn|first=Simon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-19-516200-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante defined lust as the disordered love for individuals, thus possessing at least the redeeming feature of mutuality, unlike the graver sins, which constitute an increasingly  agonised focusing upon the solitary self (a process begun with the more serious sin of gluttony).&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p.  67 and p. 202''&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thought to be the least serious capital sin&lt;ref name="DLSintro652"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uf62BQAAQBAJ|title=William Blake's Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy: A Study of the Engravings, Pencil Sketches and Watercolors|last=Pyle|first=Eric|date=2014-12-31|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476617022|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is an abuse of a faculty that humans share with animals, and sins of the flesh are less grievous than spiritual sins (love excessive, not love turning ever further awry toward hatred of man and God). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&amp;pg=PA1819&amp;dq=lust+summa+theologica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4-YPy-KTNAhVh36YKHRrvBRQQuwUILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=lust%2520summa%2520theologica&amp;f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|last=Aquinas|first=St Thomas|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=9781602065604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dante's ''Purgatorio'', the penitents walk deliberately through the purifying flames of the uppermost of the terraces of Mount Purgatory so as to purge themselves of lustful thoughts and feelings and finally win the right to reach the Earthly Paradise at the summit. In Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', unforgiven souls guilty of the sin of lust are whirled around for all eternity in a perpetual tempest, symbolic of the passions by which, through lack of self-control, they were buffeted helplessly about in their earthly lives.

=== Gluttony ===
{{Main article|Gluttony}}

[[File:Albert_Anker_-_Stillleben_-_Unmässigkeit.jpg|thumb|''Gluttony''{{Clear}}''[[Gluttony|Excess]]'' ([[Albert Anker]], 1896)]]

'''Gluttony''' (Latin, {{lang|la|gula}}) is the overindulgence and [[overconsumption]] of anything to the point of waste.  The word derives from the Latin ''gluttire'', meaning to gulp down or swallow.

In Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food causes it to be withheld from the needy.&lt;ref name="Okholm 2000"&gt;Okholm, Dennis. [http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/september4/3.62.html "Rx for Gluttony"]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Vol. 44, No. 10, September 11, 2000, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these scripts, gluttony can be interpreted as [[selfishness]]; essentially placing concern with one's own impulses or interests above the well-being or interests of others.{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}

During times of [[famine]], [[war]], and similar periods when food is scarce, it is possible for one to indirectly kill other people through starvation just by eating too much or even too soon.

Medieval church leaders (e.g., [[Thomas Aquinas]]) took a more expansive view of gluttony,&lt;ref name="Okholm 2000"/&gt; arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals, and the constant eating of delicacies and excessively costly foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06590a.htm|title=Gluttony|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas went so far as to prepare a list of five ways to commit gluttony, comprising:

* ''Laute'' – eating too expensively
* ''Studiose'' – eating too daintily
* ''Nimis'' – eating too much
* ''Praepropere'' – eating too soon
* ''Ardenter'' – eating too eagerly

Of these, ''ardenter'' is often considered the most serious, since it is extreme attachment to the pleasure of mere eating, which can make the committer eat impulsively; absolutely and without qualification live merely to eat and drink; lose attachment to health-related, social, intellectual, and spiritual pleasures; and lose proper judgement{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}: an example is [[Esau]] selling his birthright for ordinary food of bread and pottage of lentils. His punishment was that of the "profane person . . . who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright." We learn that "he found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears." {{bibleref2c|Gen|25:30|NASB}}

=== Greed ===
{{Main article|Greed}}
[[File:The_worship_of_Mammon.jpg|thumb|''Greed''{{Clear}}1909 painting ''The Worship of [[Mammon]]'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]].
]]
'''Greed''' (Latin, {{lang|la|avaritia}}), also known as '''avarice, cupidity''', or '''covetousness''', is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of desire. However, greed (as seen by the Church) is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions. Thomas Aquinas wrote, "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things." In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated excessively on earthly thoughts{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. [[Hoard]]ing of materials or objects, [[theft]] and [[robbery]], especially by means of [[violence]], [[trickery]], or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of [[authority]] are all actions that may be inspired by Greed. Such misdeeds can include [[simony]], where one attempts to purchase or sell [[sacraments]], including [[Holy Orders]] and, therefore, positions of authority in the Church hierarchy.

In the words of Henry Edward, avarice "plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

As defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to [[material wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/greed|title=The Free Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary|date=April 1, 1987|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like pride, it can lead to not just some, but all evil.&lt;ref name="Aquinas"/&gt;

=== Sloth ===
{{Main article|Sloth (deadly sin)}}

]]
'''Sloth''' (Latin, ''tristitia'' or '''{{lang|la|[[acedia]]}}''' ("without care")) refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-930390-81-4|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sloth?s=t|title=the definition of sloth|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Summa Theologica'', [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] defined sloth as "sorrow about spiritual good".&lt;ref name="Aquinas"/&gt;

The scope of sloth is wide.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Spiritually, ''acedia'' first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to [[God]]. Mentally, ''acedia'' has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, ''acedia'' is fundamentally associated with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in [[laziness]], idleness, and indolence.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Sloth includes ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace given by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] ([[Wisdom]], [[Understanding]], [[Counsel]], [[Knowledge]], [[Piety]], [[Courage|Fortitude]], and [[Fear of the Lord]]);  such disregard may lead to the slowing of one's spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of [[Charity (practice)|charity]] towards the [[neighbourhood|neighbor]], and to animosity towards those who love God.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Sloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do.  By this definition, evil exists when "good" people fail to act.

[[Edmund Burke#When "good men do nothing"|Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797) wrote in ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents|Present Discontents]]'' (II. 78) "No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united Cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle."

Unlike the other capital sins, which are sins of committing immorality, sloth is a sin of omitting responsibilities. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Emotionally and cognitively, the evil of ''acedia'' finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. ''Acedia'' takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From ''tristitia'', asserted Gregory the Great, "there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair..." Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of ''acedia'', counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and ''wrawnesse'', the last variously translated as "anger" or better as "peevishness". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. ''Acedia''  in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Society and Evil|last=Lyman|first=Stanford|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders the man in his righteous undertakings and thus becomes a terrible source of human's undoing.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

In his ''Purgatorio'' Dante portrayed the penance for acedia as running continuously at top speed.

Dante describes acedia as the ''failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul''; to him it was the ''middle sin'', the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars{{who|date = July 2011}} have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.

=== Wrath ===
{{Main article|Wrath}}
[[File:Jacques_de_l'Ange_-_A_young_Man_with_a_Sword_restrained_by_a_young_Woman,_'Anger'.jpg|thumb|''Wrath'', by [[Jacques de l'Ange]]]]
'''Wrath''' (Latin, {{lang|la|ira}}) can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of [[anger]], [[rage (emotion)|rage]], and even [[hatred]]. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven deadly Sins: A companion|last=Landau|first=Ronnie|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-4457-3227-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its purest form, wrath presents with injury, violence, and hate that may provoke [[feuds]] that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of wrath can manifest in different ways, including [[impatience]], [[misanthropy|hateful misanthropy]], [[revenge]], and [[self-destructive behavior]], such as drug abuse or suicide.{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}}

{{Quote|text="People who fly into a rage always make a bad landing."|sign=[[Will Rogers]]|source=}}

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it's directed against an innocent person, when it's unduly strong or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. "If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin." (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302-03)

People feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are certain someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with it.&lt;ref name="Anger pg 290"&gt;International Handbook of Anger. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction to Purgatory, [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] describes wrath as "love of [[justice]] perverted to revenge and [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]]".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In accordance with Henry Edward, angry people are "slaves to themselves".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Envy ===
{{Main article|Envy}}
[[File:Bartolomeo_Manfredi_-_Cain_Kills_Abel,_c._1600,_Kunsthistorisches_Museum_(Vienna).jpg|thumb|''Envy''{{Clear}}[[Cain and Abel#Motives|''Cain killing Abel'']], painting by Bartolomeo Manfredi, c. 1600]]

'''Envy''' (Latin, {{lang|la|invidia}}), like greed and lust, is characterized by an insatiable desire. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It arises from [[Vanity|vainglory]],&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7Cf9Bt1DWsC|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 3 (Part II, Second Section)|last=Aquinas|first=St Thomas|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=9781602065581|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and severs a man from his neighbor.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Malicious envy is similar to jealousy in that they both feel discontent towards someone's traits, status, abilities, or rewards. A difference is that the envious also desire the entity and covet it. Envy can be directly related to the [[Ten Commandments]], specifically, "Neither shall you covet... anything that belongs to your neighbour" - a statement that may also be related to [[greed]]. Dante defined envy as "a desire to deprive other men of theirs". In Dante's Purgatory, the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either "joy at another's misfortune" (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or "grief at another's prosperity" (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because "sorrow causes hatred" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum291.htm|title=Summa Theologica: Treatise on The Theological Virtues (QQ[1&amp;#93; – 46): Question. 36 – Of Envy (four articles)|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|date=|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Envy is said to be the motivation behind [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] murdering his brother, [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.

[[Bertrand Russell]] said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conquest of Happiness|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=[[Horace Liveright|H. Liverwright]]|year=1930|location=[[New York City|New York]]|page=&lt;!-- insert page number --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} bringing sorrow to committers of envy whilst giving them the urge to inflict pain upon others.

In accordance with the most widely accepted views, only pride weighs down the soul more than envy among the capital sins. Just like pride, envy has been associated directly with the devil, for Wisdom 2:24 states:" the envy of the devil brought death to the world,".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{clear}}

'''[[Pride]]''' (Latin, {{lang|la|superbia}}) is considered, on almost every list, the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins: the perversion of the faculties that make humans more like God—dignity and holiness. It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Also known as '''[[hubris]]''' (from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ὕβρις|ὕβρις]]}}), or '''futility''', it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people.

In even more destructive cases, it is irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better, superior, or more important than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal image or self (especially forgetting one's own lack of divinity, and refusing to acknowledge one's own limits, faults, or wrongs as a human being).

{{Quote|text=What the weak head with strongest bias rules, Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.|sign=[[Alexander Pope]]|source=[[An Essay on Criticism]], line 203.}}

As pride has been labelled the father of all sins, it has been deemed the devil's most prominent trait. [[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride is understood to sever the spirit from God, as well as His life-and-grace-giving Presence.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

One can be prideful for different reasons. Author [[Ichabod Spencer]] states that "[s]piritual pride is the worst kind of pride, if not worst snare of the devil. The heart is particularly deceitful on this one thing."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1895|isbn=|location=|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] said "[r]emember that pride is the worst viper that is in the heart, the greatest disturber of the soul's peace and sweet communion with Christ; it was the first sin that ever was, and lies lowest in the foundation of Satan's whole building, and is the most difficultly rooted out, and is the most hidden, secret and deceitful of all lusts, and often creeps in, insensibly, into the midst of religion and sometimes under the disguise of humility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Deborah Hatheway, Letters and Personal Writings (Works of Jonathan Edwards Online Vol. 16)|last=Claghorn|first=George|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient Athens, hubris was considered one of the greatest crimes and was used to refer to insolent contempt that can cause one to use violence to shame the victim. This sense of hubris could also characterize rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|title=hubris - Definition &amp; Examples|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for the committer's own gratification.&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric|author=Aristotle|page=1378b|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eros"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&amp;pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's connotation changed somewhat over time, with some additional emphasis towards a gross over-estimation of one's abilities.

The term has been used to analyse and make sense of the actions of contemporary heads of government by Ian Kershaw (1998), Peter Beinart (2010) and in a much more physiological manner by David Owen (2012). In this context the term has been used to describe how certain leaders, when put to positions of immense power, seem to become irrationally self-confident in their own abilities, increasingly reluctant to listen to the advice of others and progressively more impulsive in their actions.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Dante's definition of pride was "love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour".

Pride is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999).
As one might expect, pride is not always associated with high [[self-esteem]] but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of pride have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Pride is generally associated with an absence of [[humility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jeremiekubicek.com/humility-vs-pride/|title=Humility vs Pride And Why The Difference Should Matter To You {{!}} Jeremie Kubicek|website=jeremiekubicek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qAtNAPteVk0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Pride+is+generally+associated+with+an+absence+of+humility&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NvXm9JG5Ns&amp;sig=VrvLZ0pcmQZzLwhCMIUURKInFCM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNnZ3_zJXZAhVBLo8KHUlcAAoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pride%20is%20generally%20associated%20with%20an%20absence%20of%20humility&amp;f=false|title=Values, Violence, and Our Future|last=Acquaviva|first=Gary J.|date=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042005599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} It may also be associated with a lack of knowledge. [[John Gay]] states that "By ignorance is pride increased; They most assume who know the least."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

In accordance with the [[Sirach]]'s author's wording, the heart of a proud man is "like a partridge in its cage acting as a decoy; like a spy he watches for your weaknesses. He changes good things into evil, he lays his traps. Just as a spark sets coals on fire, the wicked man prepares his snares in order to draw blood. Beware of the wicked man for he is planning evil. He might dishonor you forever." In another chapter, he says that "the acquisitive man is not content with what he has, wicked injustice shrivels the heart."

[[Benjamin Franklin]] said "In reality there is, perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as ''pride''. Disguise it, struggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history. For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Addison]] states that "There is no passion that steals into the heart more imperceptibly and covers itself under more disguises than pride."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1895|isbn=|location=|pages=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb "pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall" (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18)(or pride goeth before the fall) is thought to sum up the modern use of pride. Pride is also referred to as "pride that blinds," as it often causes a committer of pride to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830/The_1920_Farrows_Bank_Failure_A_Case_of_Managerial_Hubris|title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|publisher=Durham University|deadurl=no|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, "that pride that goes just before the fall." In his two-volume biography of [[Adolf Hitler]], historian [[Ian Kershaw]] uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, ''Hubris'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|publisher=[[W. W.

Much of the 10th and part of 11th chapter of the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]] discusses and advises about pride, hubris, and who is rationally worthy of honor. It goes:

{{Quote|text="Do not store up resentment against your neighbor, no matter what his offence; do nothing in a fit of anger. Pride is odious to both God and man; injustice is abhorrent to both of them. Sovereignty is forced from one nation to another because of injustice, violence, and wealth. How can there be such pride in someone who is nothing but dust and ashes? Even while he is living, man's bowels are full of rottenness. Look: the illness lasts while the doctor makes light of it; and one who is king today will die tomorrow. Once a man is dead, grubs, insects, and worms are his lot.The beginning of man's pride is to separate himself from the Lord and to rebel against his Creator. The beginning of pride is sin. Whoever perseveres in sinning opens the floodgates to everything that is evil.  For this the Lord has inflicted dire punishment on sinners; he has reduced them to nothing. The Lord has overturned the thrones of princes and set up the meek in their place. The Lord has torn up the proud by their roots and has planted the humble in their place. The Lord has overturned the land of [[paganism|pagans]] and totally destroyed them. He has devastated several of them, destroyed them and removed all remembrance of them from the face of the earth. Pride was not created for man, nor violent anger for those born of woman. Which race is worthy of honor? The human race. Which race is worthy of honor? Those who are good. Which race is despicable? The human race. Which race is despicable? Those who break the commandments. The leader is worthy of respect in the midst of his brethren, but he has respect for those who are good. Whether, they be rich, honored or poor, their pride should be in being good. It is not right to despise the poor man who keeps the law; it is not fitting to honor the sinful man. The leader, the judge, and the powerful man are worthy of honor, but no one is greater than the man who is good. A prudent slave will have free men as servants, and the sensible man will not complain. Do not feel proud when you accomplished your work; do not put on airs when times are difficult for you. Of greater worth is the man who works and lives in abundance than the one who shows off and yet has nothing to live on. My son, have a modest appreciation of yourself, estimate yourself at your true value. Who will defend the man who takes his own life? Who will respect the man who despises himself? The poor man will be honored for his wisdom and the rich man, for his riches. Honored when poor-how much more honored when rich! Dishonored when rich-how much more dishonored when poor! The poor man who is intelligent carries his head high and sits among the great. Do not praise a man because he is handsome and do not hold a man in contempt because of his appearance. The bee is one of the smallest winged insects but she excels in the exquisite sweetness of her honey. Do not be irrationally proud just because of the clothes you wear; do not be proud when people honor you.  Do you know what the Lord is planning in a mysterious way? Many tyrants have been overthrown and someone unknown has received the crown. Many powerful men have been disgraced and famous men handed over to the power of others. Do not reprehend anyone unless you have been first fully informed, consider the case first and thereafter make your reproach. Do not reply before you have listened; do not meddle in the disputes of sinners. My child, do not undertake too many activities. If you keep adding to them, you will not be without reproach; if you run after them, you will not succeed nor will you ever be free, although you try to escape."|sign=|source=[[Sirach]],10:6–31 and 11:1–10}}

Jacob Bidermann's [[medieval]] [[miracle play]], ''[[Cenodoxus]]'', pride is the deadliest of all the sins and leads directly to the damnation of the titulary famed Parisian doctor. In Dante's ''Divine Comedy'', the penitents are burdened with stone slabs on their necks to keep their heads bowed.

== Historical sins ==

=== Acedia ===
{{Main article|Acedia}}
[[File:Acedia_(mosaic,_Basilique_Notre-Dame_de_Fourvière).jpg|thumb|''Acedia'' [[mosaic]], [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière]]]]
'''Acedia''' (Latin, {{lang|la|acedia}} "without care"&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;) (from Greek ἀκηδία) is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to [[Apathy|apathetic]] listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to [[Melancholia|melancholy]]: ''acedia'' describes the behaviour and ''melancholy'' suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God; by contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need.

Acēdia is negative form of the Greek term κηδεία, which has a more restricted usage. 'Kēdeia' refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott. A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised by Sir Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The positive term 'kēdeia' thus indicates love for one's family, even through death. It also indicates love for those outside one's immediate family, specifically forming a new family with one's "beloved." Seen in this way, 'acēdia' indicates a rejection of familial love. Nonetheless, the meaning of 'acēdia' is far more broad, signifying indifference to everything one experiences.

Pope Gregory combined this with ''tristitia'' into sloth for his list. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] described ''acedia'' in his interpretation of the list, he described it as an ''uneasiness of the mind'', being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability. Dante refined this definition further, describing acedia as the ''failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul''; to him it was the ''middle sin'', the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars{{who|date = July 2011}} have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.

Acedia is currently defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as spiritual sloth, which would be believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult. In the fourth century, Christian monks believed acedia was not primarily caused by laziness, but by a state of depression that caused spiritual detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/desert-fathers-sins-acedia-sloth|title=Before Sloth Meant Laziness, It Was the Spiritual Sin of Acedia|date=2017-07-14|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vainglory ===
{{Main article|Vanity}}
'''Vainglory''' (Latin, {{lang|la|vanagloria}}) is unjustified boasting. Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded ''vainglory'' into pride for his listing of sins.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; According to Thomas Aquinas, it is the progenitor of [[Envy-freeness|envy]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

The Latin term ''gloria'' roughly means ''boasting'', although its English cognate – ''glory'' – has come to have an exclusively positive meaning; historically, the term ''vain'' roughly meant ''futile'' (a meaning retained in the modern expression "in vain"), but by the 14th century had come to have the strong [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] undertones, that it still retains today.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these semantic changes, ''vainglory'' has become a rarely used word in itself, and is now commonly interpreted as referring to ''vanity'' (in its modern narcissistic sense).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{clear}}

== Confession Patterns ==
Confession is the act of admitting the commission of a sin to a priest, who in turn will forgive the person in the name (in the person) of Christ, give a penance to (partially) make up for the offense, and advise the person on what he or she should do afterwards.

According to a 2009 study by Fr Roberto Busa, a Jesuit scholar{{who|date=February 2017}}, the most common deadly sin confessed by men is supposedly lust, and by women, pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7897034.stm|title=Two sexes 'sin in different ways'|publisher=BBC News|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex,  or whether differing views on what "counts" or should be confessed caused the observed pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morning Edition|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100906920|title=True Confessions: Men And Women Sin Differently|publisher=Npr.org|date=February 20, 2009|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Purgatorio]]'' ===

The second book of Dante's epic poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' is structured around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, found at the lowest level, are the abuses of the most divine faculty. For Dante and other thinkers, a human's rational faculty makes humans more like God. Abusing that faculty with pride or envy weighs down the soul the most. Abusing one's passions with wrath or a lack of passion as with sloth also weighs down the soul but not as much as the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires to have one's physical needs met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that weighs down the soul, but it does not weigh it down like other abuses. Thus, the top levels of the Mountain of Purgatory have the top listed sins, while the lowest levels have the more serious sins of wrath, envy, and pride.

=== [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Parson's Tale]]" ===

The last tale of the [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], the "Parson's Tale" is not a tale but a sermon that the parson gives against the seven deadly sins. This sermon brings together many common ideas and images about the seven deadly sins. This tale and Dante's work both show how the seven deadly sins were used for confessional purposes or as a way to identify, repent of, and find forgiveness for one's sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canterbury Tales|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/c/the-canterbury-tales/summary-and-analysis/the-parsons-prologue-and-tale|website=CliffsNotes|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dante's Inferno and Saint Augustine's Confessions|url=https://h2g2.com/entry/A1912169|website=h2g2|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s Prints of the Seven Deadly Sins ===

=== [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' ===

Spenser's work, which was meant to educate young people to embrace virtue and avoid vice, includes a colourful depiction of the House of Pride. Lucifera, the lady of the house, is accompanied by advisers who represent the other seven deadly sins.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' ===

The seven sins are personified and they give a confession to the personification of Repentance. Only pride is represented by a woman, the others all represented by male characters.

=== [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'' ===

This work satirized capitalism and its painful abuses as its central character, the victim of a split personality, travels to seven different cities in search of money for her family. In each city she encounters one of the seven deadly sins, but those sins ironically reverse one's expectations. When the character goes to Los Angeles, for example, she is outraged by injustice, but is told that wrath against capitalism is a sin that she must avoid.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== [[Paul Cadmus]]' ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' ===

Between 1945 and 1949, the American painter Paul Cadmus created a series of vivid, powerful, and gruesome paintings of each of the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Paul Cadmus {{!}} The Seven Deadly Sins: Pride {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/486323|website=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revalorization==
[[Ferdinand Mount]] maintains that [[late modernity|liquid currentness]], especially through [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], has surprisingly given valor to vices, causing society to regress into that of primitive [[Paganism|pagans]]: "covetousness has been rebranded as [[retail therapy]], sloth is [[Downtime (break)|downtime]], lust is [[Sexual exploration|exploring your sexuality]], anger is opening up your feelings, vanity is looking good because you're worth it and gluttony is the religion of [[foodie]]s".&lt;ref&gt;F.

"Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada "consent means…the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity" without abuse or exploitation of "trust, power or authority", coercion or threats.&lt;ref name=canadiancriminalcode&gt;{{cite journal|last=Criminal Code|first=Canadian|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-137.html#docCont|title=‘Canadian Criminal Code’|date=2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Consent can also be revoked at any moment.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=David S.|title=‘Consent for Sexual Behavior in a College Student Population’|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=10 August 1998|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of "yes means yes" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: "the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment."&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be "free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity."&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, S.E. and Muehlenhard, C.L. (1999) '"By the Semi-mystical Appearance of a Condom": How Young Women and Men Communicate Sexual Consent in Heterosexual Situations', The Journal of Sex Research 36: 258–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the "yes means yes", or in the "no means no", model.&lt;ref name=Roffee&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137476159_5|title=Roffee James A., ‘When Yes Actually Means Yes: Confusing Messages and Criminalising Consent’ in Rape Justice: Beyond the Criminal Law eds.

==Consent==
Within the scholarly literature, definitions surrounding [[consent]] and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus.&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres/&gt; Dr James Roffee,  a senior lecturer in criminology in the [[Monash University]] School of Social Sciences, argues that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrates how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023|title= No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights| volume=14 | journal=Human Rights Law Review|pages=541–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour’s Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some [[Minor (law)|minor]]s under the legal [[age of consent]] may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However, the law does not view this as legitimate. While there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

Some individuals are unable to give consent, or even if they can verbally indicate that they consent, they are deemed to lack the ability to make informed or full consent (e.g., minors below the age of consent or an intoxicated person). People may also consent to unwanted sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn-Nilas, C, Goncalves, M, Grant, A, &amp; Kennett, D. (2018). '"A thematic analysis of men's sexual compliance with unwanted, non-coercive sex." ''Psychology Of Men And Masculinity'', 19(2): 203-211. &lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canada, [[implied consent]] has not been a defence for [[sexual assault]] since the 1999 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case of ''[[R v Ewanchuk]]'', where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely "implied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2015/11/13/no-still-means-no-editorial.html|title=No still means "no": Editorial|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2015|website=thestar.com|publisher=[[The Toronto Star]]|access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the defense may a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying),&lt;ref name= "Balos"&gt;Balos, Beverly, and Mary Louise Fellows.

Unwanted sexual activity can involve rape or other sexual assault, but it may also be distinguished from them. Jesse Ford, the author of a 2018 study that showed that men are having unwanted sex with women to "prove they are not gay", states that "[a]ll sexual assault is unwanted sex, but not all unwanted sex is sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/15/men-unwanted-sex-women-not-gay/ |title=Men admit to having unwanted sex with women to ‘prove they are not gay’ or ‘weird’ |last=Franklin |first=Lauren |date=15 July 2018 |website=www.pinknews.co.uk |publisher=Pink News |access-date=4 August 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal vs. nonverbal===
[[File:Kiss at Feb Club NYC 20100202.7D.02686.L1.C45.BW SML (4469827485).jpg|thumb|right|200px|While different consent policies have differing views on whether non-verbal cues count as consent, some rules do permit seeking consent through non-verbal communication.]]
There can be verbal or nonverbal consent, or a mix of the two types, depending on different policies and laws. According to ''Bustle'' writer Kae Burdo, "only verbal consent counts". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/154179-what-nobody-talks-about-when-they-talk-about-consent |title=What Nobody Talks About When They Talk About Consent |last=Burdo |first=Kae |date= 25 April 2016|website=www.bustle.com |publisher=Bustle |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dartmouth College's rules on consent state that a communication in intimate encounters is often nonverbal cues such as smiling, nodding, and touching another person; however, it states that "...body language often isn't enough" because interpreting body language is risky, so the best option is to use "explicit verbal communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/consent/communication/whendo.html|title=How Do I Know If I Have Consent? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.dartmouth.edu |publisher=Dartmouth |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reports that men typically use nonverbal indicators to determine consent (61 percent say they perceive consent through a partner's [[body language]]), but women typically wait till a partner verbally asks them before they indicate consent (only 10 percent say they indicate consent through body language), a differing approach that may lead to confusion in heterosexual couples' encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/affirmative-consent-are-students-really-asking.html |title= Affirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking?|last=Keenan |first= Sandy|date=28 July 2015 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Burdo does acknowledge that BDSM situations in which a participant has voluntarily put on a gag or has agreed to be in subspace make it hard to consent verbally. As well, some people have disabilities which make it impossible to speak and give verbal consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/154179-what-nobody-talks-about-when-they-talk-about-consent |title=What Nobody Talks About When They Talk About Consent |last=Burdo |first=Kae |date= 25 April 2016|website=www.bustle.com |publisher=Bustle |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; In cases of BDSM or speech-affecting disabilities, Burdo suggests using "clear, nonverbal consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/154179-what-nobody-talks-about-when-they-talk-about-consent |title=What Nobody Talks About When They Talk About Consent |last=Burdo |first=Kae |date= 25 April 2016|website=www.bustle.com |publisher=Bustle |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Mary Spellman, the dean of students at Claremont McKenna College, states that her college allows either verbal or non-verbal consent, with non-verbal consent being assessed by looking at whether the other person is "actively participating" and touching the other person when he is touching her or encouraging the first person", signs which indicate that a "...person is an active participant in whatever is going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321677110/a-campus-dilemma-sure-no-means-no-but-exactly-what-means-yes |title=A Campus Dilemma: Sure, 'No' Means 'No,' But Exactly What Means 'Yes'? |last=Smith |first=Tovia |date=13 June 2014 |website=www.npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Daily Dot'' states that verbal consent is best because both participants can clearly indicate what they want, ask questions and seek clarification; in contrast, nonverbal consent is may not be clear, as people "...have different understandings of gestures, “vibes,” and nonverbal cues", which can lead to "ambiguity and misunderstanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/what-is-consent/ |title=A plain and simple guide to understanding consent |last=Dimeo-Ediger |first=Winona  |date=13 September |website=www.dailydot.com |publisher=Daily Dot |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Feldman Barrett]], a psychologist and neuroscientist, states that in a sexual consent context, "[f]ace and body movements aren’t a language" that participants can rely on, because the human "brain is always guessing" about how to interpret smiles and expressions; as such, "...facial movements are terrible indicators of consent, rejection and emotion in general" and they are "not a replacement for words."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://time.com/5274505/metoo-verbal-nonverbal-consent-cosby-schneiderman/ |title=Why Men Need to Stop Relying on Non-Verbal Consent, According to a Neuroscientist |last=Feldman Barrett |first=Lisa |date=11 May 2018 |website=time.com |publisher=Time |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
{{Main|Age of consent}}
Children or [[Minor (law)|minors]] below a certain age, the [[Age of consent|age of sexual consent]] in that [[jurisdiction]], are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. The age of consent is the age below which a minor is considered to be [[legally incompetent]] to consent to [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]]. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances. Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age.

===Mental disabilities or conditions===

Likewise, persons with [[Alzheimer's disease]] or similar disabilities may be unable to give [[Consent (criminal law)|legal consent]] to sexual relations even with their spouse.&lt;ref name=NYT42215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pam Belluck|title=Iowa Man Found Not Guilty of Sexually Abusing Wife With Alzheimer’s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/health/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-wife-with-alzheimers.html|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York does not consider it to be consent in cases where people have a physical disability that makes them unable to communicate that they do not consent, either using words or physically or if they have a mental illness or other mental condition that makes them unable to understand the sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/03/important-concepts-know-comes-consent-laws-people-disabilities/ |title=WHEN CONSENT CAN’T BE GIVEN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT SEX &amp; DISABILITY LAWS |last=Gray |first=Jacquelyn|date= 1 March 2016|website=crimefeed.com |publisher=Crime Feed |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina has a 10 year penalty for a person who has sex with a person who is mentally challenged or incapable of movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/03/important-concepts-know-comes-consent-laws-people-disabilities/ |title=WHEN CONSENT CAN’T BE GIVEN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT SEX &amp; DISABILITY LAWS |last=Gray |first=Jacquelyn|date= 1 March 2016|website=crimefeed.com |publisher=Crime Feed |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Law profesor [[Deborah Denno]] argues that people with some types of mental challenges should be able to consent to sex; she says they "...have the right to do so, and unnecessarily broad and moralistic restrictions infringe upon that right".&lt;ref&gt;Deborah W.

===Unconsciousness or intoxication===

In some jurisdictions, individuals who are intoxicated from alcohol or drugs cannot consent. For example, Michigan Criminal Sexual Conduct Laws states that it is a crime to have sex with a “mentally incapacitated” person who cannot control their conduct or consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sapac.umich.edu/article/50 |title=Alcohol &amp; Sexual Assault |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=sapac.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center |access-date=9 June 2018|quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, intoxication is a factor that affects whether a person can legally consent to sexual activity. However, the level of intoxication that will make consent impossible varies according to circumstances, which include how intoxicated the person is and whether they voluntarily consumed the alcohol or drugs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/criminal-code-consent-gregory-lenehan-sexual-assault-law-court-1.4014105 |title=Does the law say a drunk can consent?

In Canada, a person who is asleep or unconscious cannot consent to sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/no-consent-in-unconscious-sex-case-supreme-court-rules/article4263384/ |title=No consent in unconscious sex case, Supreme Court rules |last=Mahoney |first=Jill |last2=Makin  |first2=Kirk |date=27 May 2011 |website=www.theglobeandmail.com |publisher=Globe and Mail |access-date=30 June 2018  |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Position of trust or authority===
When determining if a sexual encounter was consensual, Canadian courts will consider if the accused was in a "position of trust or authority" regarding the complainant, as this undermines consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/criminal-code-consent-gregory-lenehan-sexual-assault-law-court-1.4014105 |title=Does the law say a drunk can consent?

===Deception and deceit===
{{Main|Rape by deception}}
Sexual encounters where one party uses deception or deceit to obtain consent could be non-consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-mysteries-love/201712/rape-deception |title=Rape by Deception: Sexual misconduct by lying or withholding |last=Brogaard |first=Berit |date=26 December 2017 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; As such, if A gives consent to have sex with B, but B has lied about a pertinent issue, A has not given fully informed consent. Deception could include false statements about using contraception, age, gender, whether one is married, religion or employment, sexually transmitted infections testing status, giving the impression that one is someone’s partner, and falsely making the person think that a sexual activity is some type of medical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-mysteries-love/201712/rape-deception |title=Rape by Deception: Sexual misconduct by lying or withholding |last=Brogaard |first=Berit |date=26 December 2017 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Examples include a California man who snuck into the bedroom of an 18-year old woman right after her boyfriend left the bedroom, so she thought he was her boyfriend; an Israeli man who lied and told a woman he was a pilot and a medical doctor to have sex with her; and a US man who falsely claimed to be an NFL football player as a way to get sexual encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-mysteries-love/201712/rape-deception |title=Rape by Deception: Sexual misconduct by lying or withholding |last=Brogaard |first=Berit |date=26 December 2017 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In Alexandra Sims' article entitled "Trans people could 'face rape charges' if they don’t declare sexual history, warns trans activist" she states that the UK ''Sexual Offences Act'' requires transgender people to tell partners about their gender history as part of its requirements that people making sexual consent decisions have access to information so that they can make informed consent about whether to have sex; trans activist Sophie Cook states that the law is an infringement on trans peoples' human rights and on their privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trans-people-could-face-rape-charges-if-they-don-t-declare-sexual-history-warns-trans-activist-a7076546.html |title=Trans people could 'face rape charges' if they don’t declare sexual history, warns trans activist |last=Sims |first=Alexandra |date=11 June 2016 |website=www.independent.co.uk |publisher=Independent |access-date=25 June 2018 |quote='By forcing transgender people to disclose their history to prospective partners the law is not only infringing their human rights it’s also reinforcing the bigoted idea that trans people are in some way abhorrent'}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula.  In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on "consensual sexual relationships," "the meaning and importance of consent" as well as "[[rape myth]]s".&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Plans for sexual consent lessons in schools 'do not go far enough''|date=9 March 2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school’s policies.&lt;ref name=consentpolicy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication.&lt;ref name=CAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushowy|first=Kristin|url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/02/25/in-ontario-sex-ed-consent-the-hot-issue.html|title=‘In Ontario sex ed, consent the hot issue’|date=25 February 2015}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent.

''The Guardian'' reported that Oxford and Cambridge have added sexual consent workshops; one such workshop included a "quiz about the rates of sexual or gender crimes" and a discussion of three fictional "scenarios of sexual contact", including a story of groping at a party, a relationship in which one partner stopped participating, but the other person, who was sexually excited, continued to proceed to new sex acts, and a case in which a couple was drunk and had sex. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/28/what-i-learned-in-a-sexual-consent-class-at-oxford|title=What I learned in a sexual consent class at Oxford |last=Fenton |first=Siobahn |date= 28 October 2014|website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |access-date= 20 June 2018|quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the workshop was to consider if consent was asked for and obtained in these scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/28/what-i-learned-in-a-sexual-consent-class-at-oxford|title=What I learned in a sexual consent class at Oxford |last=Fenton |first=Siobahn |date= 28 October 2014|website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |access-date= 20 June 2018|quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; While Sydney University has introduced an online sexual consent course, Nina Funnell states that it has been criticized by students, professors and sexual assault prevention leaders as "tokenistic", inexpensive, and ineffective in changing student attitudes or actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/sydney-universitys-consent-matters-course-is-tokenistic/news-story/024b521256f1c317985606ec09b2bd8c |title=Sydney University’s Consent Matters Course is tokenistic |last=Funnell |first=Nina |date=30 January 2018 |website=www.news.com.au |publisher=news.com.au |access-date=20 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Some UK universities are launching [[bystander intervention]] programs that teach people to intervene when they see potential sexual misconduct situations, for example, by moving a male friend at a party away from an intoxicated woman he is talking to, if she seems unable to consent to his advances. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/we-cant-run-away-from-rape |title=We can’t run away from rape |last1= Westmarland|first1=Nicole |last2=Doyle| first2=Jennifer|date=19 November 2015 |website=www.timeshighereducation.com |publisher=Times Higher Education |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=Rather than seeing participants as potential victims or perpetrators, such “bystander education” programmes aim to empower individuals not only proactively to intervene to prevent sexual assaults from being perpetrated }} &lt;/ref&gt; One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvdvpw/white-women-less-likely-to-help-sexual-assault-victim-if-shes-black |title=White Women Less Likely to Help Sexual Assault Victim If She's Black
Bystander intervention is seen as one of the most powerful tools in preventing on-campus sexual assaults—but a new study shows that white students feel "less personal responsibility" to help their black peers. |last= Bess|first=Gabby |date=13 March 2017 |website=broadly.vice.com |publisher=Broadly/Vice |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote="We found that although white students correctly perceived that black women were at risk in a pre-assault situation, they tended not to feel as personally involved in the situation," the researchers at SUNY Geneseo, Jennifer Katz and Christine Merrilees, said in an interview with PsyPost. In other words, "despite their shared status as women, white female bystanders in the current study may have felt that a Black woman's plight was not as personally relevant because race has a more powerful effect than gender on intent to intervene and feelings of responsibility to intervene," they write in the study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="No means no"===
[[File:FEMEN 15 oct 2012-b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[FEMEN]] activist holds a sign reading "Non=Non", French for "no=no", at a protest.]]
The Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) created the "No Means No" campaign in the 1990s to increase awareness by university students about "sexual assault, acquaintance rape, and dating violence" and decrease the incidence of these issues. The CFS developed a “No Means No” campaign that included research on sexual assault and producing and distributing buttons, stickers, posters and postcards with the slogan and other information. According to the CFS, "No Means No" to set in place a no tolerance approach to sexual violence and harassment and educate students about these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfs-ns.ca/no-means-no/ |title=No means no, in every way, in every language |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=cfs-ns.ca |publisher=Canadian Federation of Students |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the "no means no" approach developed, however, because some people cannot say no, either because they are not conscious, intoxicated or facing threats or coercion, with the coercion issue being especially important in cases where there is a power imbalance between two people in a sexual encounter. To address these concerns, there was a shift from 'no means no' to 'yes means yes' (affirmative consent), to ensure that people were not having sexual actions taken on them due to not speaking up or not resisting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=54192 |title=Creating a consent culture beyond 'no means no' |last=Mahoney |first=Neve |date=17 October 2017 |website=www.eurekastreet.com |publisher=Eureka Street |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Hess states that a person may not be able to say no, or they may be intoxicated or passed out, or they may freeze up from fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-a-law-meant-to-protect-college-students-from-rape-has-become-so-polarizing-2015-7 |title=Why a law meant to protect college students from rape has become so polarizing |last=Jackson |first=Abby |date=31 July 2015 |website=www.businessinsider.com |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Sherry Colb criticizes the "no means no" approach on the grounds that it makes sexual contact the "default" option when two people have agreed to be in private in a date-like situation, at least until the woman says "no" to the other person's advances. Colb says that under the "no means no" approach, a man who is in private with a woman in a romantic context can undress her and penetrate her if she does not say "no", even if she is staring ahead and saying and doing nothing, which Colb says treats being quiet or not moving as an invitation to sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://verdict.justia.com/2014/10/29/making-sense-yes-means-yes |title=Making Sense of “Yes Means Yes” |last=Colb |first=Sherry |date=29 October 2014 |website=verdict.justia.co |publisher=Justica |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; She says that under a "no means no" approach, there is not a metaphorical "Do Not Trespass" sign on a woman's body, and as such, women have to fear that accepting a date and being in private with the partner could lead to unwanted sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://verdict.justia.com/2014/10/29/making-sense-yes-means-yes |title=Making Sense of “Yes Means Yes” |last=Colb |first=Sherry |date=29 October 2014 |website=verdict.justia.co |publisher=Justica |access-date=23 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Affirmative: "yes means yes"===
[[File:Only Yes Means Yes Campaign.png|thumb|left|200px|A logo for the "yes means yes" campaign.]]
Affirmative consent ("yes means yes") is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures.&lt;ref name=Grinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; With "yes means yes", a person can still say "no" after an initial yes. "Yes means yes" was developed by a group of women at the US liberal arts school Antioch College in 1991, who "...successfully petitioned for a conduct-code amendment that explicitly defined sexual consent as requiring an enthusiastic “yes” from everyone involved. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2018/02/15/no-means-no-to-yes-means-yes-how-our-language-around-sexual-consent-has-changed/?noredirect=on |title=‘No means no’ to ‘yes means yes’: How our language around sexual consent has changed |last=Mettler |first=Katie |date=15 February 2018 |website= www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=Washington Post |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, sex was considered consensual as long as neither party said “no.”" (the "no means no" approach).

And if they don't, it's considered nonconsent, and that's a violation of...[college] policy"; a pre-arranged hand signal can also be used if the students made a "prior verbal agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321677110/a-campus-dilemma-sure-no-means-no-but-exactly-what-means-yes |title=A Campus Dilemma: Sure, 'No' Means 'No,' But Exactly What Means 'Yes'? |last=Smith |first=Tovia |date=14 June 2014 |website=www.npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The "yes means yes" approach involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;"...affirmative consent standards have been adopted at colleges across the nation, including every Ivy League university except Harvard. "Affirmative consent: A primer"  Christine Emba ''Washington Post'' Oct 12 2015 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/12/affirmative-consent-a-primer/&lt;/ref&gt; who describe consent as an "affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity."  Claremont McKenna College Dean of Students Mary Spellman says "yes means yes" can be expressed nonverbally by determining "[i]s the [other] person actively participating?...Are they touching me when I am touching them? Are they encouraging me when I'm doing various different things? Those would all be signs that the person is an active participant in whatever is going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321677110/a-campus-dilemma-sure-no-means-no-but-exactly-what-means-yes |title=A Campus Dilemma: Sure, 'No' Means 'No,' But Exactly What Means 'Yes'? |last=Smith |first=Tovia |date=14 June 2014 |website=www.npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., "Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing." Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity ("Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity," a university policy reads).&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.

There are three pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or "the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex."

They are:

# Knowing exactly what and how much I'm agreeing to
# Expressing my intent to participate
# Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say "no", one gives and seeks an explicit "yes". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that while the words used in "yes means yes" may vary, the main idea is that both people are agreeing to do sex acts.&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; She says that "yes means yes" requires a major change in how we think of sexual assault, as it requires men and women to agree to and actively participate in sex.&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; T.K. Pritchard says that even after consent is given, participants in an encounter should be "constantly checking in", and that there should be checking in before sexual contact, during sex, and after sex, to ensure consent was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thecord.ca/event-works-to-inform-students-on-consent-in-various-contexts/ |title=Event works to inform students on consent in various contexts |last=Bouchard |first=Nathalie |date=14 February 2018 |website=thecord.ca |publisher=The Cord |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Larson states that a person should check in with their sex partner before kissing or sex, and also, even during sex, when they change the speed of an action, switch to a different position, or move their hands to a new body area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-consent-questions-answered |title=Your Gnarliest Questions About Consent, Answered |last=Larson|first=Lauren |date=30 May 2018 |website= www.gq.com|publisher=GQ |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=Don’t just check in before you kiss, go down on, or have sex with your partner.

Even in a "yes means yes" paradigm, if a partner asks in a way where there is not room or a "no", or if they get a no and then use guilt to manipulate the person, that can be considered sexual coercion rather than consent; other examples include if a partner seeking sex complains that their need for sex is not being met, shows passive-aggressive behaviour, or persistently asks again and again until they get a "yes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/154179-what-nobody-talks-about-when-they-talk-about-consent |title=What Nobody Talks About When They Talk About Consent |last=Burdo |first=Kae |date= 25 April 2016|website=www.bustle.com |publisher=Bustle |access-date=21 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Conn Caroll states that social conservatives may support the "yes means yes" laws, as the increased risk of being found guilty of sexual misconduct will lessen student interest in "hook up culture" and create an incentive for men to form long-term, committed relationships with women, rather than just seeking out one-night stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/10/07/a-social-conservative-case-for-affirmative-consent-laws-n1901883 |title=A Conservative Case for Affirmative Consent Laws |last=Carroll |first=Conn |date=7 October 2014 |website=townhall.com |publisher=Townhall |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=But, from a social conservative viewpoint, is this really all that bad?

In a ''Time'' article, [[Cathy Young]] states that the California "yes means yes" law is unlikely to make sexual predators less likely to attack or keep  victims safe; she says it creates unclear and capricious rules on sexual activity and moves the burden of proof to those who are accused, who are typically male. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3222176/campus-rape-the-problem-with-yes-means-yes/ |title=Campus Rape: The Problem With 'Yes Means Yes' |last=Young |first=Cathy |date=29 August 2014 |website=time.com |publisher=Time |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Young states that when the ''San Gabriel Valley Tribune'' asked a lawmaker how an innocent accused person could prove that he obtained consent, she was told “Your guess is as good as mine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3222176/campus-rape-the-problem-with-yes-means-yes/ |title=Campus Rape: The Problem With 'Yes Means Yes' |last=Young |first=Cathy |date=29 August 2014 |website=time.com |publisher=Time |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; A judge overruled a University of Tennessee-Chattanooga ruling that a male student did not obtain consent; the judge wrote that "...[a]bsent the tape recording of a verbal consent or other independent means to demonstrate that consent was given, the ability of an accused to prove the complaining party's consent strains credulity and is illusory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/one-year-in-yes-means-yes-policies-begin-to-fall-apart |title=One year in, 'yes-means-yes' policies begin to fall apart |last=Schow |first=Ashe |date=13 August 2015 |website=www.washingtonexaminer.com |publisher=Washington Examiner |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Robert Shibley notes that Jonathan Chait has expressed concern that colleges with "yes means yes" rules are removing due process; Shibley argues that fairness and consistency are needed in disciplinary systems; he states that even though college tribunals are not law courts, they still have elements of court trials, as they are based on an allegation, an investigation is done, a hearing is held, evidence is brought forward, sentences are handed down, and there is an appeal that can be made. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefire.org/ezra-klein-gets-wrong-yes-means-yes-law-california/|title=What Ezra Klein Gets Wrong about the ‘Yes Means Yes’ Law in California |last=Shibley |first=Robert |date=`7 October 2014 |website=www.thefire.org |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights in Education|access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Shibley states that accused do not have core protections and he states that the college does the investigation, judges the case in the trial, and hears the appeal, which means there is not a separation of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefire.org/ezra-klein-gets-wrong-yes-means-yes-law-california/|title=What Ezra Klein Gets Wrong about the ‘Yes Means Yes’ Law in California |last=Shibley |first=Robert |date=`7 October 2014 |website=www.thefire.org |publisher=Foundation for Individual Rights in Education|access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]] calls "yes means yes" laws "drearily puritanical" and totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille.

In "When Saying ‘Yes’ Is Easier Than Saying ‘No’", Jessica Bennett says that one challenge is "[[gray rape|gray zone sex]]" where a woman says yes to an initiator in a sexual encounter when she "desperately" means "no", engaging in what she calls "begrudgingly consensual sex" because saying yes is easier than explaining a "no" or exiting the situation, and because Western culture teaches women to be "‘nice’ and ‘quiet’ and ‘polite" and to "protect others’ feelings" at the expense of the woman's own feelings and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/sunday-review/when-saying-yes-is-easier-than-saying-no.html |title=When Saying ‘Yes’ Is Easier Than Saying ‘No’ |last=Bennett |first=Jessica |date=16 December 2017|website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=For years, my female friends and I have spoken, with knowing nods, about a sexual interaction we call “the place of no return.” It is a kind of sexual nuance that most women instinctively understand: the situation you thought you wanted, or maybe you actually never wanted, but somehow here you are and it’s happening and you desperately want out, but you know that at this point exiting the situation would be more difficult than simply lying there and waiting for it to be over. In other words: saying yes when we really mean no.}} &lt;/ref&gt; Julianne Ross states that in a Western society where sexual narratives focus on male desire, what women want can be deemed less important; as such, in this context, women in heterosexual encounters may feel a pressure to say yes to certain sex acts for fear that they may be criticized as a "prude" if they do not agree, or because the women want to fit into social expectations in their group, or because they are seeking validation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://mic.com/articles/114176/what-the-conversation-around-yes-means-yes-is-missing#.Isjgjd0me |title=What the Conversation Around "Yes Means Yes" Is Missing |last=Ross |first=Julianne |date=8 April 2015 |website=mic.com |publisher=Mic |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent contracts and apps==

In the 2010s, smartphone apps have been developed to give couples the ability to electronically consent to sexual relations. Apps include We-Consent, Sa-Sie, LegalFling and Good2Go. LegalFling uses [[blockchain]] and sets out each person's terms and conditions, such as requiring condom use or agreeing to specific acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2018/02/20/sexual-consent-apps-set-rules-intimacy-come-their-own-risks/328635002/ |title=People are talking about sexual consent.

In Reina Gattuso's article entitled "Seven reasons consent apps are a terrible idea", she criticizes consent apps on the grounds that: a person can withdraw consent at any point, including minutes after clicking yes on the app; the binary yes or no approach of the apps simplifies the complexity of consent; the app cannot legally confer agreement to each change in sex acts; they make consent too much about legal proofs and setting down evidence; and they change what should be a continuous process of communication into a quick action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feministing.com/2018/05/16/six-reasons-consent-apps-are-a-terrible-idea/ |title=Seven reasons consent apps are a terrible idea |last=Gattuso |first=Reina |date=May 2018 |website=feministing.com |publisher=Femisting |access-date=13 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Cricket Epstein states that using consent apps have a "[[victim-blaming]]" mentality that suggests that the person who is asked to click on the app may become a false accuser; as well, she says the app may protect perpetrators, because once agreement is clicked on the app, it will be harder for a complainant to say that she or he had sex acts done without consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bust.com/feminism/193913-what-nick-cannon-gets-wrong-about-consent.html |title=Nick Cannon's "Consent App" Gets Consent Completely Wrong |last=Epstein |first=Cricket |date= |website=bust.com |publisher=Bust |access-date=13 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholar Robin West stated in a 2000 article that the use of consent as an ethical premise for life decisions may increase happiness in the world, except for women. She states that women technically consent to many of the life experiences that lead to misery for women, such as pregnancies they did not wish to have, marriages to spouses who beat them, or jobs where a boss sexually harasses them, since they consented to the sex, marriage or taking the job, respectively (even if they did not want the adverse results, such as on-the-job harassment). West states that if we make consent the key ethical standard in life, then all of these negative experiences for women will be not able to be criticized, as people will say that the woman chose of her own free will to enter that situation.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/consent-isnt-enough-in-fifty-shades-of-grey/385267/ |title=Consent Isn’t Enough: The Troubling Sex of Fifty Shades: The blockbuster fantasy has become a big movie—and a bigger problem. |last=Green |first=Emma |date=10 February 2015 |website=www.theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=13 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In "Why Yes Can Mean No", Jordan Bosiljevac states that "yes" does not necessarily mean consent for "...poor, disabled, queer, non-white, trans, or feminine" people; she states that consent approaches are a form of privilege created for well-to-do, hetero, cis, White, able-bodied people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cmcforum.com/opinion/04302015-why-yes-can-mean-no |title=Why Yes Can Mean No |last=Bosiljevac |first= Jordan|date=30 April 2015 |website=cmcforum.com |publisher=The Forum |access-date=7 July 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Donna Oriowo states that "...when we talk about consent, we very rarely are talking about black women or women of color", and the focus is usually on white women, with black women accusers continuing to face doubt and blame due to tropes depicting black women as "...over-sexed and only want[ing] sex." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blavity.com/when-we-talk-about-consent-who-are-we-really-talking-about |title=When We Talk About Consent, Who Are We Really Talking About?: "Somehow, when black female voices are raised up in anger, in disbelief and in pain, they are easily ignored." |last=Oriowo |first=Donna |date=March 2018 |website=blavity.com |publisher= |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=The idea continues to be perpetuated that black women cannot be raped because of our supposed want or need for sex, that is almost masculine in nature — giving the assailant a pass because they believe they are just giving black women what they want.}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some younger feminists argue that consent is not truly possibly when there is a power disparity between partners in an encounter; [[Laura Kipnis]] disagrees, arguing that it is "...precisely the dynamics of power—of status, money, appearance, age, talent—that create desire" between people in a sexual context, with desire being one of the elements Kipnis thinks we should focus on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/laura-kipniss-battle-against-vulnerability |title=Laura Kipnis’s Battle Against Vulnerability: The Northwestern University professor strengthens her polemic against campus sexual culture |last=Smallwood |first=Christine |date=2 April 2017 |website=www.newyorker.com |publisher=New Yorker |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=But she believes that the “leakiness” and “idiocy” of sexual desire cannot be contained by regulation; people need to learn to deal with it themselves. }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Lockwood Harris argues that consent initiatives, such as "no means no" and "yes means yes" use views about communication which she sees as false myths, such as the claim that communication during sex can and should be a binary, unambiguous "no" or "yes". Harris states that by calling for this type of response, anti-assault advocates are lowering the complexity of communication competence between the two people and lessening the opportunities to make consent a political act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00909882.2018.1435900?journalCode=rjac20 |title=Yes means yes and no means no, but both these mantras need to go: communication myths in consent education and anti-rape activism |last=Harris  |first=Kate Lockwood |date=12 February 2018 |website=www.tandfonline.com |publisher=Journal of Applied Communication Research  |access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jed Rubenfeld]] of [[Yale Law School]] wrote in a review that consent should not be the (sole) criterion to judge whether a sexual contact is legal or not. First, in stark contrast to other legal areas (e.g. qualification for a [[mortgage]] or an [[insurance]], see [[misrepresentation]]), there is generally no requirement to be truthful before obtaining sexual consent. Secondly, rape laws intend to protect sexual autonomy, but yet the only thing that can override somebody's autonomy is [[coercion]], or exploiting somebody's incapacitation. In Rubenfeld's view, the defenselessness of a person, or the use (or threat) of force, is therefore the only criterion which can define rape in a logical way.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|author=Jed Rubenfeld|url=https://gould.usc.edu/centers/clhc/events/feature/documents/Rubenfeld.pdf|title=The Riddle of Rape-by-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of affirmative consent are more challenging in [[BDSM]] encounters, particularly in settings where the participants agree to "consensual non-consent", also called meta-consent and blanket consent, a mutual agreement to be able to act as if consent has been [[waiver|waived]]. It is an agreement where comprehensive consent is given in advance, with the intent of it being irrevocable under most circumstances. This often occurs without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Consensual-nonconsent/ "Consensual non-consent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901004229/http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Consensual-nonconsent/ |date=2009-09-01 }}, Informed Consent dictionary, Accessed 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html Dictionary of BDSM Terms], "Consensual Non-Consent", Accessed 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if two participants in a BDSM encounter agree that they consent to violence, in Canada, the law limits what violent sexual act people can consent to; specifically, Canadians cannot consent to getting seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-law-imposes-some-limits-on-freedom-to-consent-to-violent-sexual-activity |title=Canadian law imposes some limits on freedom to consent to violent sexual activity|last=Hasselback |first=Drew |date=27 October 2014 |website=nationalpost.com |publisher=National Post |access-date=16 July 2018 |quote=Jian Ghomeshi says that what he does in the bedroom is done with consent.

In "Discussing Consent in Gay Spaces Requires Nuance, Not Sex Panic", Rennie McDougall states that adding modern consent approaches to gay spaces such as gay bars and saunas would have a negative effect on gay men's sexual interactions, because non-consensual but non-threatening hands of a stranger on a bottom, chest or crotch can be a "positive part of sexual discovery" for gay men.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/12/19/discussing_consent_in_gay_spaces_requires_nuance_not_sex_panic.html |title=Discussing Consent in Gay Spaces Requires Nuance, Not Sex Panic |last=McDougall |first=Rennie |date=19 December 2017 |website=www.slate.com |publisher=Slate/Outward |access-date=24 June 2018 |quote=But the sanitization of gay spaces—a total cleaning up of our sometimes messy brushes with desire—would be a profound loss. What arguments like these make clear is that when it comes to the language of assault, we should not generalize. A “strange hand on our butts” in a gay club, as Henry writes, is not necessarily an act of sexual violence.

{{Italic title}}
[[File:TheGypsyGame.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Delacorte Press|Delacorte]])]]
'''''The Gypsy Game''''' by [[Zilpha Keatley Snyder]] is a 1997 sequel to the [[Newbery Honor]] book ''[[The Egypt Game]]''. All of the main characters return in a new adventure. This book was followed by a 1998 guide, ''The Gypsy Game Teacher's Guide''.

==Plot summary==
In this sequel, the "Egyptian" children have decided to play that they are gypsies and begin their usual practice of copious reading and reproduction of authentic practices. While April plunges in with enthusiasm, the more Melanie learns, the more something seems to be holding her back. Marshall is enthusiastic about playing, as in ''The Egypt Game''. Meanwhile, Toby Alvillar reveals that he actually has some Gypsy ancestry. He believes he can get some of his grandmother's things to use as props for the new game.

However, the children never get around to playing the Gypsy Game. Toby becomes the subject of a custody dispute between his eccentric artist father and his wealthy, conservative grandparents. Under the extreme pressure, Toby runs away and begins a life on the street. Along the way, the kids discover some nasty historical facts about the Romany, not to mention the hard lives of the homeless people Toby meets. The story goes on to describe how the children locate Toby and decide to abandon their fantasy games, taking on real-world responsibilities.

'''Wasi-wari''' ('''Vasi-vari''', '''Wasi-weri''') is the language of the [[Wasi people]], spoken in a few villages in the [[Parun|Pârun Valley]] (Prasun Valley) in [[Afghanistan]]. It also goes by the name '''Prasuni''' (Prasun).

Vasi-vari belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]], and is on the [[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]] group of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch. Vasi-vari is the most isolated of the [[Nuristani languages]].

Its speakers are 100% [[Muslim]]. Literacy rates are low: below 1% for people who have it as a [[first language]], and between 15% and 25% for people who have it as a [[second language]].

==General Information==
Wasi-wari is a language spoken by the Vâs’i people who are located in the Pârun Valley, known as Vâs’i gul, at the beginning of the [[Pech River]] Basin in the Nurestân Province of Northeastern Afghanistan.  The Vâs’i refer to the language as Vâs’i-vari or Vâs’i-vare, but it is also known as Prasuni, Paruni, Parun, Vasi-vari, Prasun, Veron, Verou, Veruni, Wasi-veri, Wasi-weri, Wasin-veri, Vasi Vari, and Pārūnī.  The population of Vâs’i gul is between 3000-6000, and there are approximately 8000 native speakers, which makes it a vulnerable language.

Wasi-wari is broken up into three [[dialects]] that are spoken in six villages.  The upper dialect, Ṣup'u-vari, is spoken in the northernmost village, Ṣup'u.  The central dialect, üšʹüt-üćʹü-zumʹu-vari, is spoken in the middle four villages, S’eć, Üć’ü, Üšʹüt, and Zum’u.  The Lower dialect, Uṣ'üt-var’e, is spoken in Uṣ'üt, the lowest village.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, R. F. (2000). The Vâsi. Retrieved from: http://nuristan.info/Nuristani/Vasi/vasi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic Affiliation===
Wasi-wari is part of the Nuristani branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, which has both Iranian and Indo-Aryan influences.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, R. F. (2010). Nurestâni languages. In ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. Retrieved from:
http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nurestani-languages&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuristani languages were formerly considered to be [[Dardic languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, G. A. (1919).

Retrieved from: http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=8-2&amp;pages=584#page/74/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are dissimilar enough from the other Dardic languages to constitute their own branch of the Indo-Iranian language tree.  There was also previously confusion on whether Wasi-wari and Prasun were the same or separate languages, but it was determined that both names referred to the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, R. F. (1973). Notes on the Nūristāni and Dardic languages. ''Journal of the American
Oriental Society'', 93, 297-305. Retrieved from: https://www.jstor.org/stable/599462&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is substantially different than the other Nuristâni languages, Wasi-wari forms the northern cluster of Nuristâni languages with [[Kamkata-viri|Kâmk’ata-Mumkst’a-vari]], so they share some similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, R. F. (2010). Nurestâni languages. In ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. Retrieved from:
http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nurestani-languages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowels==
Wasi-wari has eight vowels, â, u, o, i, e, ü, ö, and the unmarked vowel, a, which is pronounced as a high central vowel, [ɨ].  Long vowels are denoted with :, such as [i:].

According to the [[United Nations]], one billion people in the world constitute the largest global minority, people with [[Disability|disabilities]]. Of this population, 40-80 million reside in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/27/world/asia/india-disability-challenges/index.html|title=Disability in India: The struggles of infrastructure, prejudice and karma|last=CNN|first=Monica Sarkar, for|website=CNN|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; India plays an active role in the disability rights movement and has ratified and signed the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/about.shtml|title=Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not adequately address the challenges faced by these groups of people, such as lack of accessibility throughout the country. Another crucial issue is the promotion of negative stereotypes about disability in films, like those from  [[Bollywood]]. 

== Overview ==
Brotherhood is an organization that has been actively fighting for the rights of disabled communities since 2002. They have pioneered the disability rights movement by carrying out conversations, and taking advantage of the influence of audio-visual media. Through various initiatives, they strive to utilize documentaries and film to dispel stereotypes and misconceptions pertaining to disabilities, and to raise awareness among the Indian public as well as global audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesco-ci.org/ict-pwd/ND2014/film-festival-information|title=From Exclusion to &lt;strong&gt;Empowerment&lt;/strong&gt;|website=unesco-ci.org|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the aforementioned UN treaty, Brotherhood - in collaboration with the [[United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unic.org.in/|title=United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan|website=www.unic.org.in|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]], National Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenationaltrust.gov.in/content/innerpage/introduction.php|title=Introduction : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE)|website=thenationaltrust.gov.in|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a Statutory Body of the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment]]) and Apeejay Institute of Mass Communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apeejay.edu/aimc/|title=AIMC – Leading Best Top Ranked Institute of Mass Communication {{!}} Advertising {{!}} Public Relations {{!}} Event {{!}} TV Journalism {{!}} Anchoring  {{!}} Reporting in Delhi India|website=www.apeejay.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; - organize the We Care Film Festival every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wecarefilmfest.org/|title=We Care Film Fest|website=www.wecarefilmfest.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year marked the festival's thirteenth year, a milestone because it is the only international film festival that is officially recognized as a UNESCO partner, according to the New Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by UNESCO and signed by 203 countries as of November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tiss.edu/uploads/files/nationalConfBrochure.pdf|title=National Conference Brochure|date=|website=United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan|publisher=United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unic.org.in/items/GetInvolved_13thEditionOfWeCareFilmFestival2016.pdf|title=13th edition of We Care Film Festival|website=United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan|publisher=United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viewpoints == 
Dr. Sushma Batra, Professor of Social Work at the University at Delhi, and K. Kannan, a New Delhi-based journalist, are advocates of the movement toward disability rights. They write:
{{quote box|width=80%|align=center|text=While there are people who believe in the power of cinema to change the world, there are others who say that its chief purpose is to entertain people. And so, the disability experience too has been twisted and distorted to suit the dynamics of entertainment by many film-makers across the globe. And there have been some who have used films to highlight the reality of the disability experience and the diversity it brings to the world, how coping-up mechanisms highlight the triumph of spirit over the body and so on.}}

Kannan and Dr. Batra acknowledge the strong sphere of influence that cinema has in societies, nationally and internationally. They point out that due to the goal of entertaining the masses, filmmakers undermine the experiences of disabled populations through some very negative stereotypes and tropes. Many Bollywood films either over-dramatize disabled characters or mock them through cartoon-esque and pity-inducing depictions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wecarefilmfest.org/index.php/2015/09/20/disability-in-cinema/|title=Disability in Cinema – We Care Film Fest|website=www.wecarefilmfest.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common tropes == 
This section will examine common tropes – highlighted by Kannan and Dr. Batra&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – employed by filmmakers in Bollywood film, notions that this film festival seeks to dispel. 

Disabled characters may be utilized as a comic interlude for the entertainment of audiences. A film series that perfectly illustrates this is [[Golmaal (film series)|Golmaal]]. They may be regarded with pity and a sense of condescension. The trope, a patronizing attitude, is used to paint the “hero” or protagonist of a film in a positive light by means of looking down upon the disabled character. Disability has been used by filmmakers as a convenience to enhance the plot of the story. An example is [[Koyla]] (1997 film). 

Some films depict disabled characters as heroes, which can be very problematic. Through the language and behaviors used in certain films, disabled peoples are portrayed as being liabilities and burdensome unproductive members of society. 

Films may downplay the magnitude of disabilities by imparting the idea that there are “quick fixes” to an individual’s disabilities, like [[Deewane Huye Paagal]] (2005 film). Lastly, films portray disabled peoples as being “cured” by external forces, such as by aliens in [[Koi... Mil Gaya]] (2003 film).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">On Sunday, August 19, 1962, a group of six men, with help of a bank’s safe-keeper, robbed a local branch of the [[National Bank of Poland]], located in the town of [[Wołów]] in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]] (southwestern [[Poland]]).  Altogether, 12,531,000 [[złoty]]s were stolen,&lt;ref name="Tourist Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-wyjazd.pl/przewodnik/wolow,155.html |title=Wołów - Historia - W Polsce |work=e-wyjazd.pl |language=Polish |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620045232/http://www.e-wyjazd.pl/przewodnik/wolow,155.html |archivedate=June 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in late 2000s (decade) prices, would make some 18 million złotys. It was the biggest [[bank robbery]] in the history of the [[People's Republic of Poland]],&lt;ref name="Tourist Guide"/&gt; to the point that the Polish government for a while considered withdrawing all 50-złoty and 100-złoty bills from the market, which would help find the robbers.&lt;ref name="MAKBET"&gt;

== The robbery ==
The robbery was described with details in a local newspaper ''Głos Pracy'', which dedicated large part of its October 19, 1962, issue to the "job". According to the article, which was written two months after the robbery, on Sunday, August 19, 1962, a group of robbers approached a guard, who was entering the bank to work the night shift. The guard was bound, and left in the cellar, while the robbers entered the main hall, quickly finding the safe. 

The robbers got into the safe through a hole cut in the wall by a jack-screw.&lt;ref name="ZE"&gt;

 |language=Polish
 |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They stole 12,531,000, all in 500-, and 100-złoty notes. The loot was staggering for these times, as back then, the biggest lottery jackpots were up to 1 million złotys.&lt;ref name="MAKBET"/&gt; 

According to Colonel Stanisław Gorniecki of the local [[Milicja Obywatelska|police]] department, the guard spent the whole night in the cellar, and was found on the next day at 4:30 a.m., by a cleaning lady, who upon entering the building noticed that the main door had not been locked. The woman then heard moaning coming from the cellar, and she went down to spot the guard. Soon afterwards the police were informed, and all local roads were closed, and the officers checked all trunks. Criminals and thieves known to the police were investigated, and on the same day (Monday, August 20), a group of police experts came by plane from [[Warsaw]]. The investigation was dubbed W-62.&lt;ref name="MAKBET"/&gt;

== The investigation ==
The experts found out that the robbers had used a [[Warszawa (car)|Warszawa]] car, also, due to several traces left on the ground, they managed to tell the type of tires. Also, the vehicle hit a pile of broken bricks, so search immediately started. Furthermore, on the ripped safe there were traces of paint of the tools used. It looked like all tools were painted in the same color, so the detectives tried to locate a shop or a workshop to which the tools belonged. As the robbery was very quick, it was suggested that one of the criminals was a person associated with the bank, who knew the details of the inside. Therefore, all employees were investigated. Finally, it was established that all stolen banknotes belonged to the AP and AR series (for 500 złoty notes), and DI, DK and DR series (100 złoty notes). All bank tellers and cashiers in the country were informed about it.

== The arrests ==
Hundreds of tip-offs came to the police from uninvolved individuals around the country, and the first significant information came from [[Pruszcz Gdański]], where a woman came to a bank to deposit 18,000 złotys. Among the money, there were a lot of bills from the marked series, and the teller immediately informed the police. A short investigation concluded that the woman was related to a person from Wołów, who was a customer of the bank, and turned out to be one of the robbers.  

The second tip came from [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], where a bank teller noticed that a 500-złoty note was very damaged and probably fake. The manager of the bank checked it - the note was real, but it was purposely tattered to look old and worn. Altogether, there were nine such notes in the Ostrów Wielkopolski bank. All were taken to the laboratory, which confirmed that the money was new, and probably washed in a laundry machine.

One day later, on October 1, 1962, a woman entered a textile store in the [[Kluczbork]]. She picked an expensive carpet, and handed the seller a 500-złoty bill. The female employee immediately realized that it was the wanted note, but at the same time the customer sensed she was in trouble. She wanted the money back, but also suggested a bribe. The seller would not hear of it, locked the store and called the police.&lt;ref name="ZE"/&gt;  The customer was the wife of a man from Wołów, who turned out to be one of the brains of the gang. A search of their house resulted in finding a great deal of stolen money that belonged to the marked series. It was a breakthrough moment of the investigation, and in the next three days, all the robbers were caught.

== The robbers ==
The police were shocked to learn that none of the robbers were seasoned criminals, but a group of otherwise law-abiding citizens of the town.&lt;ref name="ZE"/&gt;  Their brains was an electrician Stanisław J., who had worked for the bank, and who had ordered his comrades to stay quiet for a while, and avoid any big purchases, not to bring heat on the gang. All were sentenced to 25 years, but left prison after 17 years, in 1979.&lt;ref name="MAKBET"/&gt;  The police recovered almost all the money stolen in the heist.

In 1975, film director [[Mieczysław Waskowski]] made a movie ''Hazardzisci'' (''The Gamblers''), which is dedicated to the 1962 robbery.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5628 Synagogue.jpg|thumb|350px| Jewish yishuv in [[Rishon Lezion]], 1882]] 
{{Use British (Oxford) English|date=February 2012}}
The '''Yishuv''' ({{lang-he|ישוב}}, literally "settlement") or '''Ha-Yishuv''' (''the Yishuv'', {{lang-he|הישוב}}) or '''Ha-Yishuv Ha-Ivri''' (''the Hebrew Yishuv'', {{lang-he|הישוב העברי}}) is the term referring to the body of [[Jew]]ish residents in the land of Israel (corresponding to [[Ottoman Syria]] until 1917, [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|OETA South]] 1917–1920 and later [[Mandatory Palestine]] 1920–1948) prior to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]]. The term came into use in the 1880s, when there were about 25,000 Jews living across the [[Land of Israel]], then comprising the southern part of [[Ottoman Syria]], and continued to be used until 1948, by which time there were some 630,000 Jews there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=y_Rb5rgpNOAC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Old+Yishuv+25,000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WOKQOXTDt1&amp;sig=2CcngglqOqrxHoUiCEBq5bKwnzs&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwie4bLX-ufeAhVP-6QKHU2HBZUQ6AEwDHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Old%20Yishuv%2025%2C000&amp;f=false Ethnicity, Religion and Class in Israeli Society], Eliezer Ben-Rafael and Stephen Sharo, Cambridge University Press, pages 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in Hebrew even nowadays to denote the Pre-State Jewish residents in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tripathi |first=Deepak |title=Imperial Designs: War, Humiliation &amp; the Making of History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TgwmQ1nwVQC&amp;pg=PT132&amp;dq=yishuv+pre-state+jewish+residents&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZi_WMhKPWAhUFkJAKHYMnDWoQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=yishuv%20pre-state%20jewish%20residents&amp;f=false |publisher=Potomac Books |year=2013 |isbn=9781612346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is sometimes drawn between the '''Old Yishuv''' and the '''New Yishuv''':
The [[Old Yishuv]] refers to all the Jews living there before the [[aliyah]] (immigration wave) of 1882 by the [[Zionist movement]]. The Old Yishuv residents were religious Jews, living mainly in [[Jerusalem]], [[Safed]], [[Tiberias]] and [[Hebron]]. Smaller communities were in [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], [[Peki'in]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Nablus]], [[Shfaram]] and until 1779 also in [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In the final centuries before modern Zionism, a large part of the Old Yishuv spent their time studying the [[Torah]] and lived off charity ([[halukka]]), donated by Jews in the [[Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=PTuL2OR81lEC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=of+the+new+yishuv%27s+criticism+toward+the+old+yishuv+regarding+its+reliance+on+donations+from+abroad,+the+Halukah+money&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR0LP9pubeAhVBSxoKHcHeCu8Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=of%20the%20new%20yishuv's%20criticism%20toward%20the%20old%20yishuv%20regarding%20its%20reliance%20on%20donations%20from%20abroad%2C%20the%20Halukah%20money&amp;f=false From Empire To Empire: Jerusalem Between Ottoman and British Rule], Abigail Jacobson, Syracuse University Press, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Yishuv''' refers to those who began building homes outside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s, to the founders of the [[Moshava]] of [[Petah Tikva]] and the [[First Aliyah]] of 1882, followed by the founding of neighbourhoods and villages until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

=== Old Yishuv ===
{{Main|Old Yishuv|Ottoman Jews|Pre-Zionist Aliyah}}
The [[Old Yishuv]] were the Jewish communities of the southern [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian provinces]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Destruction and Reconstruction – the Jewish Quarter. ''For the 400 years of Ottoman rule in Jerusalem there was a Jewish community living inside the walls of the Old City.  The community, which we call the “Old Yishuv,” was not a single, cohesive unit. Until the early 19th century the community consisted mainly of Sephardic Jews, descendants of the exiles from Spain with Ashkenazi (Hassidic and Mitnagdim) and Mizrahi Jews in minority representation. Beginning with the mid-18th century Ashkenazi Jews begin to settle in the city, but not for extended periods.'' [http://www.jerusalem-oldcity.org.il/download/file/web-eng-rova-yehudi.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; up to the onset of [[Aliyah|Zionist aliyah]] and the consolidation of the [[New Yishuv]] by the end of World War I. As opposed to the later Zionist aliyah and the New Yishuv, which came into being with the [[First Aliyah]] (of 1882) and was more based on a socialist and/or secular ideology emphasizing labor and self-sufficiency, the Old Yishuv, whose members had continuously resided in or had come to ''[[Eretz Yisrael]]'' in the earlier centuries, were largely ultra-orthodox Jews dependent on external donations ([[Halukka]]) for living.
{{Yishuv haYashan}}
The Old Yishuv developed after a period of severe decline in Jewish communities of the Southern Levant during the early Middle Ages, and was composed of three clusters. The oldest group consisted of the Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jewish communities in [[Galilee]] and the Judeo-Arabic speaking [[Musta'arabi Jews|Musta'arabim]] who settled in Eretz Yisrael in the Ottoman and late Mamluk period. A second group was composed of Ashkenazi and Hassidic Jews who had emigrated from Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. A third wave was constituted by Yishuv members who arrived in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Krämer, ''A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel,'' Princeton University Press, 2008 p.104&lt;/ref&gt;  The Old Yishuv was thus generally divided into two independent communities – the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] (including Musta'arabim), mainly constituting the remains of Jewish communities of Galilee and the four Jewish holy cities, which had flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; and the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], whose immigration from Europe was primarily since the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;Abraham P. Bloch, ''One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries for every day of the year'', KTAV Publishing House, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-88125-108-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjxJAFawRasC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=Mustarabim&amp;ei=We_OSrD5DJOEkAT4ht2mBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mustarabim&amp;f=false, M1 p. 278].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Old Yishuv' term was coined by members of the '[[New Yishuv]]' in the late 19th century to distinguish themselves from the economically dependent and generally earlier Jewish communities, who mainly resided in the [[Four Holy Cities|four holy cities of Judaism]], and unlike the New Yishuv, had not embraced land ownership and agriculture. Apart from the Old Yishuv centres in the four holy cities of Judaism, namely [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]], smaller communities also existed in [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], [[Peki'in]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Nablus]] and [[Shfaram]]. [[Petah Tikva]], although established in 1878 by the Old Yishuv, nevertheless was also supported by the arriving Zionists. [[Rishon LeZion]], the first settlement founded by the [[Hovevei Zion]] in 1882, could be considered the true beginning of the ''New Yishuv''.

=== Beginning of modern Aliyah ===
{{Aliyah}}
The Ottoman government was not supportive of the new settlers from the First and Second Aliyah, as the Ottoman government officially restricted Jewish immigration. The Yishuv relied on money from abroad to support their settlements.

In 1908 the Zionist Organization founded the [[Palestine Office]], under [[Arthur Ruppin]], for land acquisition, agricultural settlement and training,&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''A History of Zionism'', p153&lt;/ref&gt; and later for urban expansion. The first Hebrew high schools were opened in Palestine as well as the [[Technion]], the first institution for higher learning. [[Hashomer]], a Zionist self-defence group, was created to protect the Jewish settlements. Labor organizations were created along with health and cultural services, all later coordinated by the [[Jewish National Council]]. By 1914, the old Yishuv was a minority and the new Yishuv began to express itself and its [[zionism|Zionist]] goals.

The Zionist movement tried to find work for the new immigrants who arrived in the [[Second Aliyah]]. However, most were middle class and were not physically fit or knowledgeable in agricultural work. The Jewish plantation owners had previously hired Arab workers who accepted low wages and were very familiar with agriculture. The leaders of the Zionist movement insisted that plantation owners (those who arrived in the First Aliyah) only hire Jewish workers and grant higher wages. The conquest of labor was a major Zionist goal. However, this caused some turmoil in the Yishuv for there were those who felt that they were discriminating against the Arabs just as they had been discriminated against in Russia. The Arabs became bitter from the discrimination despite the small number of Arabs that were affected by this.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The [[First Aliyah]] was the very beginning of the creation of the New Yishuv. More than 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. The immigrants were inspired by the notion of creating a national home for Jews. Most of the Jewish immigrants came from Russia, escaping the [[Pogrom|pogroms]], while some arrived from Yemen. Many of the immigrants were affiliated with [[Hovevei Zion]]. Hovevei Tzion purchased land from Arabs and other Ottoman subjects and created various settlements such as [[Yesud HaMa'ala]], [[Rosh Pinna]], [[Gedera]], [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Nes Tziona]] and [[Rechovot]]. These agricultural settlements were supported by philanthropists from abroad, chiefly [[Edmond James de Rothschild]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/rothschild.html Baron Edmond James de Rothschild]. Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alphonse James de Rothschild]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1931/08/20/archive/baron-edmond-de-rothschild-86 Baron Edmond De Rothschild 86.  August 20, 1931] JTA Archive, The Global Jewish News Source&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] also immigrated during the first Aliyah. Ben-Yehuda took it upon himself to revive the Hebrew language, and along with [[Nissim Bechar]] started a school for teaching Hebrew, later on founding the first Hebrew newspaper.

During the Second Aliyah, between 1903 and 1914, there were 35,000 new immigrants, primarily from Russia.

During [[World War I]], the conditions for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire worsened. All those Jews who were of an enemy nationality were exiled and others were drafted into the Ottoman army. Many of those exiled fled to [[Egypt]] and the [[United States]]. Those who remained in the Ottoman ruled Palestine faced hard economic times. There was disagreement whether to support the British or the Turks. A clandestine group, [[Nili]], was established to pass information to the British in the hope of defeating the Ottomans and ending their rule over Palestine. The purpose and members of the Nili were discovered. All involved were executed by the Ottomans except its founder, [[Aaron Aaronsohn]], who escaped to Egypt. During World War I, the Jewish population in Palestine diminished by a third due to deportations, immigration, economic trouble and disease. During World War I, there were two British battalions of Jews, called the [[Zion Mule Corps]], who were to fight on the front of Palestine. They helped in the British capture of Ottoman Syria (including Palestine), leading to the Turkish surrender. The members of the Zion Mule Corps later made up the Yishuv's defence groups that would fight against the British.

== During the British Mandate ==
World War I ended, along with the Ottoman Empire. Britain gained control of Palestine through the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], which partitioned [[Ottoman Syria]] into French-ruled Syria and Lebanon and British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. There was a hope that British control would allow the creation of a Jewish national homeland as promised in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. The British Mandate was formalized in 1922 based on the Balfour Declaration. The British were supposed to help the Jews build a national home and promote the creation of self-governing institutions. The mandate provided for an agency in which the Jews could represent Jewish interests and promote Jewish immigration. It was called the [[Jewish Agency for Palestine]], and was only created ten years later, serving as the de facto government of the Yishuv.

Along with a Jewish agency there was to be a general self-governing institution created in Palestine including Jews and Arabs. The Yishuv feared such an institution due to the Arab majority, but none was created in the end due to the Arabs' refusal to cooperate with the Jews or British.
The optimism that existed in the beginning of the British mandate soon diminished due to continued hardships in the Yishuv. Most of the European funds that supported the Jewish settlements before World War I ended. The Arabs, opposed to the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate, instigated riots against the Jews. The British limited immigration through yearly quotas; only those who received "certificates" could make Aliyah.

=== Women's rights ===
Many women who immigrated to Israel came out of national Zionist motives who wanted the same rights as men and wanted to rebuild their land.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202995|title=The Complex Identity of Religious-Zionist Women in Pre-State Israel, 1921–1948|first=Lilach|last=Rosenberg-Friedman|date=18 September 2006|publisher=|volume=11|issue=3|pages=83–107|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and [[Rosa Welt-Straus]], who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/welt-straus-rosa|title=Welt-Straus, Rosa – Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QnLnZrwBw-EC&amp;pg=PT396&amp;lpg=PT396&amp;dq=%22rosa%20welt-straus%22|title=Jewish Women in Pre-State Israel: Life History, Politics, and Culture|first1=Ruth|last1=Kark|first2=Margalit|last2=Shilo|first3=Galit|last3=Hasan-Rokem|date=15 March 2009|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-808-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/searching-for-the-banner-of-the-hebrew-woman.premium-1.516467|title=Searching for the banner of the Hebrew woman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/second-aliyah-womens-experience-and-their-role-in-yishuv|title=Second Aliyah: Women's Experience and Their Role in the Yishuv – Jewish Women's Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constituent assembly was voted upon in 1920 and 14 women were elected out of the three hundred and fourteen delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/hbi/publications/workingpapers/docs/reinharz4.pdf|title=Timeline of Women and Women's Issues in the Yishuv and Israel|last=Reinharz|first=Shulamit|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the increase in the number of women filling public positions, the rate of women participating in the labor force increased steadily during the British mandate period in the Yishuv. With that being said, the employment opportunities at the beginning of the mandate period were very low and women were mainly limited to typical female occupations because the only other option would be to work in construction, which only pioneer women committed to as part of their feminist-nationalist outlook because those roles were considered inappropriate for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/women-in-yishuv-workforce|title=Women in the Yishuv Workforce {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were consistently more unemployed when compared to their male counterparts, regardless of [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cyclical+fluctuation cyclical fluctuations].The wages for working women were constantly lower than the wages of their male counterparts, and throughout the Yishuv period, the average wage for women were 50 to 70 percent of male's wage.

Not only were non-religious women fighting for equality, but so were religious women.

=== History ===
There were Arab riots throughout [[Jaffa riots|1920–21]] in opposition to the [[Balfour Declaration]]. The Arabs tried to show the British the instability of Palestine and that a Jewish homeland was ungovernable. Riots increased in [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]] after the fourth Aliyah – 133 Jews were killed by Arab mobs during the 1929 riots. The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigration and land purchases were displacing them and taking their jobs away. These riots were also instigated by false rumours that the Jews were planning on building a synagogue near the [[Western Wall]]. These riots led to the evacuation of Hebron's indigenous – largely non-Zionist – Jewish population.

==== White papers ====
The British responded to the Arab riots with the [[White Paper of 1939]]. It was based on the [[Hope Simpson Report]], which stated that Palestine after economic development could support only 20,000 more immigrant families without infringing on the Arab population's placement and employment. It therefore attempted to curtail immigration to Palestine. Upon Jewish criticism of this policy, it was clarified that immigration would not be stopped entirely but would be restricted by quotas.

There were many Jewish immigrants that arrived throughout the 1930s in the fifth Aliyah, despite the immigration quotas. Many who came were fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe. Those that came from Nazi Germany were able to come because of the [[Haavara Agreement]]. This allowed Jews to escape from Germany to Palestine in return for paying a ransom to the Reich. By then, the Yishuv had a population of about 400,000.

==== The 1936–39 Arab revolt ====
The increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants and land purchases, unchallenged by the British Mandate, angered and radicalized many Arabs. In April 1936, Arabs attacked a Jewish bus, leading to a series of incidents that escalated into a [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|major Arab rebellion]]. The British were caught by surprise and were unable to prevent the deaths of thousands of Arabs and hundreds of Jews in the revolt. The [[Haganah]] protected the Yishuv's settlements while the [[Irgun]], a more radical group, attacked Arab settlements. A coalition of recently formed Arab political parties formed the [[Arab Higher Committee]] (AHC). It declared a national strike in support of three basic demands: cessation of Jewish immigration, an end to all further land sales to the Jews, and the establishment of an Arab national government. The Arabs threatened that if the British didn't comply with their demands then they would join the adversaries of the British. This concerned the British for [[World War II]] was just beginning and they knew they would need Middle Eastern oil.

The British worked with their Arab allies to bring a halt to the AHC riots. The [[Peel Commission]] reported, in July 1937, that the British obligations to the Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and the mandate unworkable. It suggested the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the British mandate governing over Nazareth, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem along with a corridor from Jerusalem to the coast. The Jews accepted the general principle of a partition while the Arabs refused any partition plan. The British government sent a technical team called the [[Woodhead Commission]] to detail the plan. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodhead commission report |url=https://archive.org/details/WoodheadCommission|quote=(p. 236) FINANCE...we found that  it was impossible, whatever boundaries we might recommend, to set  up an Arab State which should be self-supporting.... deficits of £P.610,000 per annum for the Arab State  (including Trans- Jordan) and of £P.460,000 per annum for the  Mandated Territories, but a surplus of £P.600,000 per annum for the (p. 237 ) Jewish State. We have found that it is not possible to call upon the  Jewish State for a direct subvention to the Arab State, and neither  practicable nor equitable to set up an Arab State with a budget  so very far from being balanced. We conclude that, if partition  is to be carried out, there is no alternative but that Parliament  should be asked to provide, in some form, sufficient assistance to  enable the Arab State to balance its budget.  (p. 246)...CONCLUSION ... The question whether  partition is practicable involves considerations of two kinds :  practical and political. The former concern chiefly finance and  economics ;....  But the financial and economic difficulties, ..., are of such a nature that we can find no possible way to  overcome them within our terms of reference.   ... we have proposed,  ... a modification of partition which, ... seems to  us, subject to certain reservations, to form a satisfactory basis of  settlement, if His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the  very considerable financial liability involved.   There remain the political difficulties. .... But  there is still the possibility that both sides may be willing to accept  a reasonable compromise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938" /&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. {{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Revolt broke out again in the autumn of 1937. The British ended the revolt using harsh measures, deporting many Palestinian Arab leaders and shutting down the AHC. In the Yishuv, the Arab Revolt reinforced the already firm belief in the need for a strong Jewish defence network. Finally, the Arab agricultural boycott that began in 1936 forced the Jewish economy into even greater self-sufficiency. The Haganah during this period changed from being a small clandestine militia to a large military force. The British security forces at this time cooperated with the Haganah to respond to the Arabs.

In 1938 Captain [[Orde Wingate]] created the [[Special Night Squads]] (SNS) that were composed mostly of Haganah members. SNS used the element of surprise in night raids to protect the Jewish settlements and attack the Arabs.

===== White Paper of 1939 =====
The British suppressed the Arab revolt and published the [[White Paper of 1939]]. It allowed for a total of only 75,000 Jews to enter Palestine over a five-year period. During this time the Yishuv entered a period of relative peace with the Arabs.

==== During World War II ====
The Yishuv wanted to help their fellow Jews, who were being murdered by the Nazis in Europe. Many Jews from Europe were prevented from fleeing to Mandatory Palestine by strict immigration quotas established by the white papers. The Jewish Agency organized illegal immigration from 1939 through 1942 with the help of the Haganah. Those who arrived illegally to Israel during this time were part of the [[Aliyah Bet]]. This was a dangerous operation, for these illegal immigrants arrived by boat and had to be careful not to be caught by the British or [[Nazis]]. Many of these ships sank or were caught, such as the ''[[Patria disaster|Patria]]'', ''[[Struma disaster|Struma]]'' and {{SS|Bulgaria||2}}. Compared with the number of attempts, few ships actually arrived successfully to Mandatory Palestine, but tens of thousands of Jews were saved by the illegal immigration.

The Yishuv also wanted to help on the front lines in Europe to try to save Jews from the Nazi atrocities. In 1942 the Jewish agency turned to the British to offer their assistance by sending Jewish volunteers to Europe as emissaries of the Yishuv to organize local resistance and rescue operations among the Jewish communities. The British accepted the proposal but on a much smaller scale than the Jewish agency had hoped. They only took Jewish parachutists who were recent immigrants from certain targeted countries that they wanted to infiltrate. The British Special Forces and military intelligence both consented to the volunteers' dual role as British agents and Jewish emissaries. 110 Yishuv members were trained; however only 32 were deployed. Many of them succeeded in helping the POWs and uprisings in the Jewish communities, while others were caught.

There were two periods during the war when the Yishuv faced a direct threat from Nazi forces. The first occurred following Germany's conquest of France in 1940, since the pro-Nazi Vichy regime controlled the northern [[Levant]], from which an invasion of Palestine could take place. However, in 1941 British forces [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|successfully fought]] Vichy forces for control of Syria and Lebanon, thus removing the threat of invasion from the north, at least as long as German armies in Eastern Europe could be held back by the [[Red Army]] and thus unable to easily advance towards the Near East from the north. In 1942 however, as Erwin Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]] swept across [[North Africa]] with the intent of capturing the [[Suez Canal]], the likelihood of a German invasion from the south became a real possibility, causing great anxiety in the Yishuv and prompting plans to be drawn for its defense. Knowing that Nazi control of Palestine meant certain annihilation of the Yishuv, a debate raged among Yishuv leadership whether, in the event Nazi occupation was to take place, the inhabitants of the Yishuv should evacuate together with British forces eastwards towards British possessions in Iraq and India or undertake a [[Siege of Masada|Masada]]-like last stand in Palestine, likely doing so in a fortified zone to be hastily constructed around the [[Mount Carmel|Carmel Mountains]]. This military operation was officially named [[Palestine Final Fortress]]. Fortunately for the Yishuv, the advance of German forces eastwards in Egypt was halted during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], thus lifting the threat of invasion from the south. The anxious time leading to the Nazi loss at El Alamein became known as the [[200 days of dread]].

===== The Biltmore declaration =====
Despite the reports of Nazi atrocities and the desperation of Jews needing a safe haven the British kept the gates of Palestine almost closed to Jewish immigration. The Zionist leaders met at the Biltmore Hotel in New York in May 1942 and called for unrestricted  Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth.

==== Mandatory Palestine post World War II ====
Hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors were being held in Displaced Persons Camp (DP Camps) aching to go to Mandatory Palestine. The British received much international pressure, specifically from U.S. president Harry Truman, to change their policy on immigration. Despite Britain's dependence on American economic aid, the British refused, claiming that they were experiencing too much resistance from the Arabs and Jews already in Palestine and feared what would happen if more were allowed to enter. The refusal to remove the white paper policy angered and radicalized the Yishuv. The Yishuv's militia groups set out to sabotage the British infrastructure in Palestine and continue in their illegal immigration efforts. In 1946, the British responded to the Yishuv's efforts and began a two-week search for Jews suspected of anti-British activities, arresting many of the Haganah's leaders. While the British were busy looking for the Haganah, the Irgun and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] carried out attacks on British forces. The most famous of their attacks was on the [[King David Hotel bombing|King David Hotel]], the site of the British military command and the British Criminal Investigation Division. This location was chosen because a few weeks before a large quantity of documents was confiscated from the Haganah and brought there. Despite being warned by the Yishuv and told to evacuate the building the British officials decided not to cave in to the pressure.  The Yishuv attacked anyway, resulting in 91 casualties, 28 of who were British and 17 who were [[Palestinian Jews]].

By 1947 the British had 100,000 troops in Palestine trying to maintain order and protect themselves. The British mandate was a major expense to the Exchequer, forcing them to present the Palestine problem to the United Nations on May 15, 1947.  The United Nations proposed a partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into 2 states—Arab and Jewish (UN Resolution 181).  The Jews accepted it, while the Arabs stated that they would do everything in their power to prevent it.

The AHC, determined to prevent [[Resolution 181]] from coming into effect, began to attack and besiege the Jews. The British sided with the Arabs {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} in an attempt to prevent the Yishuv from arming themselves.  Jerusalem was held under a siege with no access to weapons, food or water. The Provisional Government seemed helpless until it received a large shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia.  The Haganah started fighting offensively from April through May.  The Haganah mounted a full-scale military plan, [[Operation Nachson]].  After much fighting and the crucial construction of [[Burma Road (Israel)|a new road]] from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the siege of Jerusalem was broken, allowing supplies to be brought into the city.

This operation's success helped Harry S. Truman recognize that the Jews would be able to protect themselves. The United States decided therefore, it would support the establishment of a Jewish state.  On May 14, 1948 the Jews proclaimed the independent state of Israel and the British withdrew from Palestine.

=== Evacuations and expulsions of Jews under the British Mandate ===
{{See also|List of villages depopulated during the Arab-Israeli conflict#Jewish villages}}

The 1920 Nabi Musa riots left four Arabs and five Jews killed, with 216 Jews and 23 Arabs wounded. The majority of the victims were members of the [[old Yishuv]]. About 300 Jews from the Old City were evacuated following the riots.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{Harvtxt|Segev|2001}}, pp. 127–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Jaffa riots in 1921, thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had previously been lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food and services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city.&lt;ref name=segev2&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=173–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1929 Palestine riots]], which left 133 Jews dead,&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain, 1930: Report of the Commission on the disturbances of August 1929, Command paper 3530 (Shaw Commission report), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NA 59/8/353/84/867n, 404 Wailing Wall/279 and 280, Archdale Diary and Palestinian Police records.&lt;/ref&gt; the Jewish community members of Gaza and Hebron were ordered to evacuate by the British forces, in fear of their security.

During the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] of 1936–1939, the Jewish residents of [[Acre, Israel|Akko]] were ousted from the city by local Arab residents. The same fate was forced on the ancient Jewish community of [[Peki'in]].

=== Parliamentary representation ===
{{Main|Assembly of Representatives (Mandatory Palestine)}}
[[File:Asefathanivharim.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] at Asefat Hanivharim, September 1944]]
The Assembly of Representatives was the elected parliamentary assembly of the Jewish community in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. It was established on 19 April 1920,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=14037 Palestine Through History: A Chronology (I)] The Palestine Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; and functioned until 13 February 1949, the day before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]], elected on 25 January, was sworn in. The Assembly met once a year to elect the executive body, the [[Jewish National Council]],&lt;ref name=K&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/asefat_niv_eng.htm Assembly of Representatives (Assefat Hanivharim)] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; which was responsible for education, local government, welfare, security and defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.618881 The origins and challenges of Israeli democracy] Haaretz, 3 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It also voted on the budgets proposed by the Jewish National Council and the Rabbinical Council.&lt;ref name=K /&gt;

=== Paramilitary forces ===
{{Main|Haganah|Irgun}}
The most notable Jewish paramilitaries in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] were the [[Haganah]], the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. In October, 1945, during the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine]], those organizations joined to form the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]]. It was established by the [[Jewish Agency]] and activated for some ten months, until August, 1946.&lt;ref name="Jewish Agency"&gt;Jewish Agency for Israel, [http://jafi.org/JewishAgency/English/About/History/#t6The History of the Jewish Agency for Israel] Retrieved on 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance coordinated acts of sabotage and attacks against British authorities.
